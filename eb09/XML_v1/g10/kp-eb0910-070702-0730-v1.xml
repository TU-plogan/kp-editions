                <p><label type="entry">GOÄLPÄRA</label>, the most westerly district of Assam,
                    between 25° 21' and 26° 51' N. lat. and between 89° 44' and 91°0' E. long.,
                    bounded on the N. by Bhutiln, E. byKâmnip, S. by the Gâro Hills, and W. by Kuch
                    Belmr and Rangpur. The district is situated on the Brahmaputra, at the corner
                    where the river takes its southerly course into Bengal. The scenery is striking.
                    Along the banks of the river grow clumps of cane and reed; farther back stretch
                    fields of rice cultivation, broken only by the fruit trees surrounding the
                    villages, and in the background rise the forest-clad hills overtopped by the
                    white peaks of the Himalayas. The soil of the hills is of a red ochreous earth,
                    with blocks of granite and sandstone interspersed; that of the plains is of
                    alluvial formation. Earthquakes are common and occasionally severe shocks have
                    been experienced. The Brahmaputra annually inundates vast tracts of country.
                    Numerous extensive forests yield valuable timber. Wild animals of all kinds are
                    found.</p>
                <p>Goalpara has always formed the frontier between Bengal and Assam; originally it
                    must have constituted part of the legendary Hindu kingdom of Karnrιip; from that
                    it must have fallen into the hands of the early rajas of Kuch Behar, who,
                    however, were unable long to retain their kingdom. From the east the wild Ahams
                    came down the valley of the Brahmaputra, while from the west the Mughuls
                    extended the limits of the Delhi empire. In 1603 the Mughuls came into collision
                    with the Ahams, but were forced to retreat with a decisive defeat. The district
                    came into British possession with the rest of Bengal in 1765. It has undergone
                    several changes in administration, and in 1872, when Assam was constituted a
                    separate administration, Goalpara was included within it.</p>
                <p>In 1872 the population was 407,714,—311,419 being Hindus, and 89,916 Mahometans.
                    Goal para town, with between 3000 and 4000 inhabitants, is the most populous
                    place, as well as the chief centre of trade. Dhubri is the point where the
                    traffic of northern Bengal is shipped on board the Assam steamers. Gauripur and
                    Lakhshmipur carry on a thriving trade in timber.</p>
