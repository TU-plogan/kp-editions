                <p><label type="entry">GIRDLE</label>, a band of leather or other material worn
                    round the waist, either to confine the loose and flowing outer robes so as to
                    allow freedom of movement, or to fasten and support the garments of the wearer.
                    In southern Europe and in all Eastern countries the girdle was and still is an
                    important article of dress. Among the Romans it was used to confine the <hi
                    rend="italic">tunica;</hi> and so general was the custom that the want of a
                    girdle was regarded as strongly presumptive of idle and dissolute propensities.
                    It also formed a part of the dress of the Greek and Roman soldier; the phrase
                    <hi rend="italic">cingulum</hi><hi rend="italic">deponere,</hi> to lay aside the
                    girdle, was as equivalent to quitting the service. It was used as now in the
                    East to carry money in; hence <hi rend="italic">zonam perdere,</hi> to lose
                    one’s purse.</p>
                <p>Girdles and girdle-buckles are not found in early Celtic interments, nor are they
                    frequent in Gallo-Roman graves. But in Frankish and Burgundian graves they are
                    almost constantly present, often ornamented with plaques of bronze or silver,
                    and the clasps and mountings chased or inlaid with various ornamental designs,
                    occasionally including figures of the cross, and rude representations of
                    Scripture subjects. In later times girdles are frequently represented on brasses
                    and monumental effigies from the 12th to the 16th century. They were either of
                    leather or of woven materials, often of silk and adorned with gold and gems. The
                    mode in which they were worn is shown on the effigies; usually fastened by a
                    buckle in front, the long free end of the girdle was passed up underneath and
                    then down over the cincture, and through the loop thus formed the ornamented end
                    hung down in front. Among the sumptuary regulations of Edward III. there were
                    prohibitions against wearing girdles of gold and silver unless the wearer were
                    of knightly rank or worth £200 a year. Similar regulations against extravagance
                    in girdles are occasionally found to the 16th century. The brasses of the 15th
                    century present many beautiful examples of ladies’ girdles, which were often
                    worn like that of the knight with the ornamental end hanging down in front,
                    sometimes with both ends depending from a large clasp or ornamental fastening in
                    the centre. Allusions to the girdle are common in the poetry of the 16th and
                    17th centuries. The purse, the dagger, the rosary, the pen and inkhorn and the
                    bunch of keys were carried suspended from it, and hence it was an ancient custom
                    for bankrupts or insolvent persons to put off and surrender their girdles in
                    open court. It is recorded that the widow of Philip I., duke of Burgundy,
                    renounced her right of succession by putting off her girdle upon the duke’s
                    tomb. The girdle, which was a very important element in the dress of the
                    Levitical priesthood, does not appear as an ecclesiastical vestment in the
                    Christian Church until the 8th century. Germanus, who died in 740, mentions the
                    girdle worn by deacons; and Hrabanus Maurus in the succeeding century speaks of
                    the girdle as one of the regular vestments, and refers to its symbolism. Some
                    centuries later the church had to discountenance extravagance in this article of
                    attire, and splendour in the decoration of girdles was denounced as secular and
                    unbefitting the ecclesiastical character.</p>
