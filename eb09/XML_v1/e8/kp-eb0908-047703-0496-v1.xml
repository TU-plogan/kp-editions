                <p><label type="entry">EPIGRAMS</label>. Nothing perhaps could be more hopeless than
                    an attempt to discover or devise a definition wide enough to include the vast
                    multitude of little poems which at one time or other have been honoured with the
                    title of epigram, and precise enough to exclude all others. Without taking
                    account of its evident misapplications, we find that the name has been
                    given—first, in strict accordance with its Greek etymology from i⅛ιγpαφcu∕, to
                    inscribe, to any actual inscription on monument, statue, or building; secondly,
                    to verses never intended for such a purpose, but assuming for artistic reasons
                    the epigraphical form; thirdly, to verses expressing with something of the
                    terseness of an inscription a striking or beautiful thought; and fourthly, by
                    unwarrantable restriction, to a little poem ending in a “point,” especially of
                    the satirical kind. The last of these has obtained considerable popularity from
                    the well-known lines—</p>
                <p>“The qualities rare in a bee that we meet</p>
                <p>In an epigram never should fail;</p>
                <p>The body should always be little and sweet, And a sting should be left in its
                    tail ’—</p>
                <p>which represent the older Latin of some unknown writer— “Omne epigramma sit
                    instar apis: sit aculeus illi;</p>
                <p>Sint sua mella, sit et corporis exigui.”</p>
                <p>Attempts not a few of a more elaborate kind have been made to state the essential
                    element of the epigram, and to classify existing specimens; but, as every lover
                    of epigrams must feel, most of them have been attended with very partial
                    success. Scalιger, in the third book of his <hi rend="italic">Poetics,</hi>
                    gives a fivefold division, which displays a certain ingenuity in the
                    nomenclatuιe but is very superficial: the first class takes its name from <hi
                    rend="italic">mel.</hi> or honey, and consists of adulatory specimens; the
                    second from <hi rend="italic">feh</hi> or gall; the third from <hi rend="italic"
                    >acetum,</hi> or vinegar; and the iourth from <hi rend="italic">sal,</hi> or
                    salt; while the fifth is styled the condensed, or multiplex. This classification
                    is adopted by Nicolaus Mercerius in his <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">conscribendo epigrammate,</hi> Paris, 1653; but he supplemented it
                    by another of much more scientific value, based on the figures of the ancient
                    rhetoricians. Lessing, in the preface to his own epigrams, gives an interesting
                    treatment of the theory, his principal doctrine being practically the same as
                    that of several of his less eminent predecessors, that there ought to be two
                    parts more or less clearly distinguished,— the first awakening the reader’s
                    attention in the same way as an actual mouument might do, and the other
                    satisfying his curiosity in some unexpected manner. An attempt was made by
                    Herder to increase the comprehensiveness and precision of the theory; but as he
                    himself confesses, his classification is rather vague—the expository, the
                    paradigmatic, the pictorial, the impassioned, the artfully turned, the illusory,
                    and the swift. After all, if the arrangement according to authorship be
                    rejected, the simplest and most satisfactory is according to subjects. The
                    epigram is one of the most catholic of literary forms, and lends itself to the
                    expression of almost any feeling or thought. It may be an elegy, a satire, or a
                    love-poem in miniature, an embodiment of the wisdom of the ages, a bon-mot set
                    off with a couple of rhymes.</p>

                <p>From its very brevity there is no small danger of the epigram passing into
                    childish triviality: the paltriest pun, a senseless anagram, is considered stuff
                    enough and to spare. For proof of this there is unfortunately no need to look
                    far; but perhaps the reader could not find a better collection ready to his hand
                    than the second twenty-five of the <hi rend="italic">Epigrammaium</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Centurioe</hi> of Samuel Erichius; by the time he reaches No. 11
                    of the 47th century, he will be quite ready to grant the appropriateness of the
                    identity maintained between the German <hi rend="italic">Seele,</hi> or soul,
                    and the German <hi rend="italic">Esel,</hi> or ass.</p>
                <p>Of the epigram as cultivated by the Greeks a detailed account has been given in
                    the article on the <hi rend="smallcaps">Anthologies,</hi> those wonderful
                    collections which bid fair to remain the richest of their kind. The delicacy and
                    simplicity of so much of what has been preserved is perhaps their most striking
                    feature; and one cannot but be surprised at the number of poetβ proved capable
                    of such work. In Latin literature, on the other hand, the epigrammatists are
                    comparatively few, and though several of them, as Catullus and Martial, are men
                    of high literary genius, too much of what they have left behind is vitiated by
                    brutality and obscenity. On the subsequent history of the epigram, indeed,
                    Martial has exercised an influence as baneful as it is extensive, and he may
                    fairly be counted the far-off progenitor of a host of scurrilous verses which he
                    himself would almost have blushed to write. Nearly all the learned Latinists of
                    the 16th and 17th centuries may claim admittance into the list of
                    epigrammatists,—Bembo and Scaliger, Buchanan and More, Stroza and Sannazarius.
                    Melanchthon, who succeeded in combining so much of Pagan culture with his
                    Reformation Christianity, has left us soιne graceful specimens, but his editor,
                    Joannes Major Jaochimus, has so little idea of what an epigram is, that he
                    includes in his collection some translations from the Psalms. John Owen, or, as
                    he Latinized his name, Johannes Audoenus, a Cambro-Briton, attained quite an
                    unusual celebrity in this department, and is regularly distinguished as Owen the
                    Epigrammatist. The tradition of tue Latin epigram has been kept alive in England
                    by such men as Porson, Vincent Bourne, and Walter Savage Landor; and at one at
                    least of our universities there is an annual prize for the best original
                    specimen. Happily there is now little danger of any too personal epigrammatist
                    suffering the fate of Niccolo Franco, who paid the forfeit of his life for
                    having launched his venomous Latin against Pius V., though he may still incur
                    the milder penalty of having his name inserted in the <hi rend="italic">Index
                    Expurgatorius,</hi> and find, like John Owen, that_ he consequently has lost an
                    inheritance.</p>
                <p>In English literature proper there is no writer like Martial in Latin or Logau in
                    German, whose fame is entirely due to his epigrams; but several even of those
                    whose names can perish never have not disdained this diminutive form. The
                    designation epigram, however, is used by our earlier writers with excessive
                    laxity, and given or withheld without apparent reason. The collection which
                    bears the title of <hi rend="italic">One and thyrtye Epigrammes, wherein are
                    bryefly touched so many abuses that may and ought to be put away: Compiled and
                    Imprinted by Robert Crowley,</hi> 1550, is of almost no literary value,
                    consisting of rugged and in many cases vulgar and pointless attempts at satire.
                    Those of Henry Parrot, published in 1613 as <hi rend="italic">Laquei
                    ridiculosi,</hi><hi rend="italic">or Springes to catch Woodcocks,</hi> are only
                    not quite as worthless, though, as far as the mere form goes, they better
                    deserve the name they assume; for, according to the author’s poetical
                    simile—</p>
                <p>“We make our epigrammes as men taste cheese, Which hath his relish in the last
                    farewell.”</p>
                <p>John Weever’s collection (1599) is of interest mainly because of its allusion to
                    Shakespeare. Ben Jonson furnishes a number of noble examples in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Underwoods;</hi> and one or two of Spenser’s little poems and a
                    great many of Herrick’s are properly classed as epigrams. Turberville is just as
                    graceful in this department as he is in everything else; but he has left one at
                    least which is not without value—</p>
                <p>“A miser's mind thou hast, Thou hast a prince’s pelf,</p>
                <p>Which makes thee wealthy to thine heir,</p>
                <p>A beggar to thyself.”</p>
                <p>A few quaint specimens maybe culled from the pages of Thomas Fuller; but most of
                    the fifty-nine epigrams recently published by Mr Grosart are poor affairs at the
                    best Cowley, Waller, Dryden, Prior, Parnell, Swift, Addison, Johnson, Goldsmith,
                    and Young have all been at times successful in their epigrammatical attempts;
                    but perhaps none of them has proved himself so much “to the manner born” as
                    Pope, whose name indeed is almost identified with the epigrammatical spirit in
                    our literature. Few of our modern poets have followed in his footsteps, and
                    though nearly all might plead guilty to an epigram or two, there is no one who
                    has a distinct reputation as an epigrammatist. Such a reputation might certainly
                    have been Laudor’s, had he not chosen to write the best of his minor poems in
                    Latin, and thus made his readers nearly as select as his language.</p>
                <p>The French are undoubtedly the most successful cultivators of the “salt” and the
                    “vinegar” epigram; and from the time of Marot downwards many of their principal
                    authors have earned no small celebrity in this department. It iε enough to
                    mention the names of J. B. Rousseau, Lebrun, Voltaire, Marmontel, Piron, and
                    Chénier. In spite of Rapin’s dictum that a man ought to be content if he
                    succeeded in writing one really good epigram, those of Lebrun alone number
                    upwards of 600, and a very fair proportion of them would doubtless pass muster
                    even with Rapin himself. If Piron was never anything better, “pas même
                    académicien,” he appears at any rate in Grimm’s phrase to have been “une machine
                    à saillies, à epigrammes, et à bon-mots.” Perhaps more than anywhere else the
                    epigram has been recognized in France as a regular weapon in literary and
                    political contests, and it might not be altogether a hopeless task to compile an
                    epigrammatical history from the Revolution to the present time.</p>
                <p>While any fair collection of German epigrams will furnish examples that for
                    keenness of wit would be quite in place in a French anthology, the Teutonic
                    tendency to the moral and didactic has given rise to a class but sparingly
                    represented in French. The very name of <pb break="no"

                    to this peculiarity, which is exemplified equally by the rude <hi rend="italic"
                    >priameln,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">pr&lt;xanιeln,</hi> of the 13th and 14th
                    centuries and the polished lines of Goethe and Schiller. Logau published his <hi

                    1654, and Wernicke no fewer than six volumes of <hi rend="italic">V</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Überschriften oder</hi><hi rend="italic">Epigrammata</hi> in 1697;
                    Kastner’s <hi rend="italic">Sinngedichte</hi> appeared in 1782, and Haug and
                    Weissen’s <hi rend="italic">Epigrammatische Anthologie</hi> in 1804. Kleist,
                    Opitz, Gleim, Hagedorn, Klopstock, and A. W. Schlegel all possess some
                    reputation as epigrammatists; Lessing <hi rend="italic">is, facile</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">princeps</hi> in the satirical style; and Herder has the honour of
                    having enriched his language with much of what is best from Oriental and
                    classical sources.</p>
                <p>It is often by no means easy to trace the history of even a single epigram, and
                    the investigator soon learns to be cautious of congratulating himself on the
                    attainment of a genuine original. The same point, refurbished and fitted anew to
                    its tiny shaft, has been shot again and again by laughing cupids or fierce-eyed
                    furies in many a frolic and many a fray. During the period when the epigram was
                    the favourite form in Germany, Gervinus tells us how the works, not only of the
                    Greek and Roman writers, but of Neo-Latinists, Spaniards, Dutchmen, Frenchmen,
                    Englishmen, and Poles were ransacked and plundered; and the same process of
                    pillage has gone on in a more or less modified degree in other times and
                    countries. Very noticeable often are the modifications of tone and expression
                    occasioned by national and individual characteristics: the simplicity of the
                    prototype may become common-place in the imitation, the sublime be distorted
                    into the grotesque, the pathetic degenerate into the absurdly sentimental; or on
                    the other hand, an unpromising <hi rend="italic">motif</hi> may be happily
                    developed into unexpected beauty. A good illustration of the variety with which
                    the same epigram may be translated and travestied is afforded by a little volume
                    published in Edinburgh in 1808, under the title of <hi rend="italic"
