                <p><label type="entry">ESAU, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Edom</hi></label>, the father
                    of the Edomites, <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> was the son of Isaac and
                    Rebecca, and the elder twin brother of Jacob. According to the narrative
                    contained in Genesis, the name Esau (hairy) was given to him on account of his
                    hairy appearance at his birth, and the name Edom (red) when he sold his
                    birthright to Jacob for a meal of red lentile pottage. Esau, who was a hunter,
                    having returned famished from the chase, found Jacob enjoying a savoury dish,
                    and besought him to be allowed to share it. Jacob refused this, unless Esau made
                    over to him the privileges of the elder son; and, prompted by the pangs of
                    hunger, the latter immediately consented. Notwithstanding th is, and although by
                    marriage with two Canaanitish women Esau had separated himself from the pure
                    blood of Abraham, he would have received the covenant blessing from his father,
                    had not Jacob secured it through the deceit of personating Esau, which, as his
                    father was blind, he was able to accomplish by imitating the hairy appearance of
                    his brother by means of goat skins. Esau, on hearing what Jacob had done, vowed
                    to kill him, and the latter found it necessary to flee to Mesopotamia. Soon
                    afterwards Esau, to propitiate his parents, married the daughter of Ishmael, but
                    as they continued to be offended by the idolatrous practices of his Canaanitish
                    wives, he retired from his father’s house and took up his residence in Mount
                    Seir. Here he learned that Jacob was returning from Padanaram -with his wives,
                    children, and flocks; but, whether propitiated by the humble bearing of the
                    latter or not, he not only refrained from executing the vengeance he had sworn
                    against him, but even offered to escort him on his way. The two brothers
                    afterwards united in burying their father; but after that Esau “took all his
                    substance which he had got in the land of Canaan, and went into the country from
                    the face of his brother Jacob.” Some modern critics regard the history of Jacob
                    and Esau as in a great degree, if not altogether, mythical, and the recorded
                    life of Esau as suggested very much by the nature of the country inhabited by
                    his descendants, its history, and the relation of its inhabitants to those of
                    Canaan. The words “Esau” and “Seir” etymologically suggest a shaggy
                    mountain-land. According to Ewald <hi rend="italic">(Gesch. d. V. Isr.</hi> i.
                    336, 430, 494), the three names Seir, Edom, Esau, indicate that an aboriginal
                    race calling itself Seir was first subjugated by Canaanites bearing the name of
