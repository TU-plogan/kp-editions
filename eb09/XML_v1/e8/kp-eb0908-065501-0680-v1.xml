                <p><label type="entry">EUCLID</label>. Of the lives of the Greek mathematicians
                    generally very little is known, and among the number Euclid is no exception · we
                    are ignorant not only of the dates of his birth and death, but also of his
                    parentage, his teachers, and the residence of his early years. In some of the
                    editions of his works, as will be seen, he is called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Megarensis,</hi> as if he had been born at Megara in Greece, a mistake which
                    arose from confounding him with another Euclid, a disciple of Socrates. Proclus,
                    the Neo-platonist (412-485 <hi rend="smallcaps">a,d.),</hi> is the authority for
                    most of our information regarding Euclid, which is contained in his commentary
                    on the first book of the <hi rend="italic">Elements.</hi> He there states that
                    Euclid lived in the time of Ptolemy I., king of Egypt, who reigned from 323 to
                    285 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> that he was younger than the associates of
                    Γlato, but older than Eratosthenes (276-196 B.c.) and Archimedes (287-212 B.c.)
                    Euclid is said to have founded the mathematical school of Alexandria, which was
                    at that time becoming a centre, not only of commerce, but of learning and
                    research, and for this service to the cause of exact science he would have
                    deserved commemoration, even if his writings had not secured him a worthier
                    title to fame. Proclus preserves a reply made by Euclid to King Ptolemy, who
                    asked whether he could not learn geometry more easily than by studying the <hi
                    rend="italic">Elements—</hi> “There is no royal road to geometry.” Pappus of
                    Alexandria, whose date is rather uncertain, but is probably a century earlier
                    than that of Proclus, says that Euclid was a man of mild and inoffensive
                    temperament, unpretending, and kind to all genuine students of mathematics. This
                    being all that is known of the life and character of Euclid, it only remains
                    therefore to speak of his works.</p>
                <p>Among those which have come down to us the most remarkable is the <hi
                    rend="italic">Elements (j⅜τοcχfLa).</hi> They consist of thirteen books; two
                    more are frequently added, but there is reason to believe that they are the work
                    of a later mathematician, Hypsicles of Alexandria. At the outset of the first
                    book occur the definitions or explanations of the meanings of the terms
                    employed; the postulates, which limit the instruments to be used in the
                    constructions to the ruler and the compasses; and the axioms or common notions,
                    the fundamental principles from which mathematical truths are deduced. The
                    propositions, which consist of both theorems and problems, deal with rectilineal
                    figures, principally the triangle and the parallelogram, and the book concludes
                    with the celebrated Pythagorean theorem and its converse. The second book is
                    occupied with the consideration of the rectangular parallelograms contained by
                    the segments of straight lines, and their relation to certain squares. It
                    contains only two problems, the one to divide a straight line in medial section
                    (“the divine section,” as it was afterwards called), and the other which shows
                    how to effect the quadrature of any rectilineal area. The third book, prefaced
                    with a few definitions, discusses the properties of circles. The fourth book
                    contains no theorems. The problems are on the inscription in, and
                    circumscription about, circles of triangles, squares, and certain regular
                    polygons, and on the inscription of circles in, and the circumscription of
                    circles about, some of these figures. Though, in the definitions preliminary to
                    this book, Euclid explains when a rectilineal figure is ia-scribed<pb break="no"

                    figure, he has given no proposition showing how in any case such inscription or
                    circumscription may be effected. The equilateral triangle, the square, the
                    regular pentagon, and such regular polygons as can be derived from these, were
                    the only regular figures known to be inscriptible in a circle by means of
                    elementary geometry, till Gauss discovered, in 1796, that the circumference of a
                    circle could be divided into 17 equal parts. In his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Disquisitiones</hi><hi rend="italic">Arithmetics,</hi> published in 1801, it is
                    proved that there can be inscribed in a circle any regular polygon, the number
                    of whose sides is prime, and is denoted by <hi rend="italic">2</hi><hi

                    is, depends to some extent upon, the first; the third presupposes both the first
                    and second; the fourth presupposes the first three; and all four are largely
                    concerned with the discussion of the absolute equality or inequality of certain
                    magnitudes. The fifth book stands alone, depending upon none of the preceding
                    books, and contains the theory of proportion, with respect not merely to
                    geometrical magnitudes, such as lines, angles, areas, solids, but to any
                    magnitudes of which multiples can be formed. The diagrams consist of straight
                    lines, probably for convenience of construction, but the enunciations of the
                    propositions and the reasoning are perfectly general. With the exception of his
                    treatment of parallels, Euclid’s doctrine of proportion has been the subject of
                    more discussion than any other part of the <hi rend="italic">Elements.</hi> The
                    foundation of the doctrine is the criterion of proportionality laid down in the
                    famous fifth definition. The necessity or the appropriateness of such a
                    criterion can be seen only when the distinction between number and magnitude has
                    been clearly apprehended, or, what amounts to the same thing, when an adequate
                    conception has been formed of incommensurables. The ordinary arithmetical test
                    of proportionality will then be found to suit only certain cases which
                    occur—those, namely, where the magnitudes considered are commensurable, and if
                    the theory of proportion is to be rigorous and complete (as Euclid’s is), it
                    must be extended to incommensurables by the notions of continuity and limits.
                    The difficulty therefore which Is felt by readers of the fifth book in grasping
                    Euclid’s doctrine is due mainly to the nature of the subject, and no very
                    material simplification of the full treatment of proportion is possible. The
                    sixth book contains the application of the theory of proportion, mostly to
                    rectilineal figures. In the last proposition, the second part of which is due to
                    Theon, it is noteworthy that the restricted definition of an angle, given in the
                    first book, and adhered to throughout, is tacitly abandoned. The seventh,
                    eighth, and ninth books are arithmetical, that is, treat of the properties of
                    numbers. The definitions relating to them occur at the beginning of the seventh
                    book, and some of these show perhaps the tendency of the Greeks, natural enough
                    to a scientific people with a defective numerical notation, to consider quantity
                    from a geometrical point of view. A number composed of two factors was called a
                    plane number, one composed of three a solid number, and the factors themselves
                    were called sides. The test by which numbers are recognized to be proportionals
                    is different from that given in the fifth book, for here it requires to be
                    applied only to quantities which are commensurable, namely, integers. The last
                    proposition of the ninth book shows how to construct a perfect number, that is,
                    a number which is equal to the sum of all its divisors; for example, θ = 1 ÷ 2 +
                    3, 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14, &amp;c. The tenth book is the longest of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Elements.</hi> It is occupied with the consideration of
                    commensurable and incommensurable magnitudes, and ends with the proposition that
                    the diagonal and the side of a square are incommensurable. With regard to
                    straight lines, Euclid distinguishes between those which are commensurable or
                    incommensurable in length, and those which are so in power, the latter being
                    defined to be straight lines the squares on which have or have not a common
                    measure. There are three sets of definitions to this book, the second set
                    inserted before the forty-ninth proposition, and the third before the
                    eighty-sixth. The eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth books treat mainly of solid
                    geometry. In the eleventhare given the definitions which serve for the three
                    books, the principal properties of straight lines and planes, of solid angles,
                    and of parallelepipeds. The twelfth book begins with two theorems of plane
                    geometry, and then discusses chiefly the properties of pyramids, cones, and
                    cylinders. The last two propositions relate to spheres, the last being to prove
                    that spheres have to one another the triplicate ratio of their diameters. In
                    this book is exemplified the method of Exhaustions, which is founded on the
                    principle that by taking away from a magnitude more than its half, from the
                    remainder more than its half, and so on, a remainder is at length reached which
                    is less than any assignable magnitude (book x. prop. 1 ). Other applications of
                    this method, the nearest approach made by the ancients to the differential
                    calculus, are to be found in the works of Archimedes (see his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Measurement of the Circle, Conoids and Spheroids, Sphere and Cylinder).</hi>
                    The thirteenth book treats of lines divided in extreme and mean ratio, of some
                    regular figures inscribed in circles, and of the five regular solids, the last
                    proposition being to exhibit the edges of these five solids, and to compare them
                    with one another.</p>
                <p>The question has often been mooted, to what extent Euclid, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Elements,</hi> is a discoverer or a compiler. To this question no
                    entirely satisfactory answer can be given, for scarcely any of the writings of
                    earlier geometers have come down to our times. We are dependent on Pappus and
                    Proclus for the scanty notices we have of Euclid’s predecessors, and of the
                    problems which engaged their attention; for the solution of problems, and not
                    the discovery of theorems, would seem to have been their principal object. From
                    these authors we learn that the property of the right-angled triangle had been
                    found out, the principles of geometrical analysis laid down, the restriction of
                    constructions in plane geometry to the straight line and the circle agreed upon,
                    the doctrine of proportion, as well as loci, plane and solid, and some of the
                    properties of the conic sections investigated, the five regular solids (often
                    called the Platonic bodies) and the relation between the volume of a cone or
                    pyramid and that of its circumscribed cylinder or prism discovered. Elementary
                    works had been written, and the famous problem of the duplication of the cube
                    reduced to the determination of two mean proportionals between two given
                    straight lines. Notwithstanding this amount of discovery, and all that it
                    implied, Euclid must have made a great advance beyond his predecessors (we are
                    told that “he arranged the discoveries of Eudoxus, perfected those of
                    Theaetetus, and reduced to invincible demonstration many things that had
                    previously been more loosely proved”), for his* <hi rend="italic">Elements</hi>
                    supplanted all similar treatises, and, as Apollonius received the title of “the
                    great geometer,” so Euclid has come down to later ages as “the elementator,”</p>
                <p>The first six and, less frequently, the eleventh and twelfth books are the only
                    parts of the <hi rend="italic">Elements</hi> which are now read in the schools
                    or universities of the United Kingdom; and, within recent years, strenuous
                    endeavours have been made by the Association for the Improvement of Geometrical
                    Teaching to supersede even these. On the Continent, Euclid has for many years
                    been abandoned, and his place supplied by numerous treatises, certainly not
                    models of geometrical rigour and arrangement. The fact that for twenty centuries
                    the <hi rend="italic">Elements,</hi> or parts of them, have held their ground as
                    an introduction to geometry is a <pb break="no"

                    for such a purpose. They are, speaking generally, not too difficult for novices
                    in the science; the demonstrations are rigorous, ingenious, and often elegant;
                    the mixture of problems and theorems gives perhaps some variety, and makes their
                    study less monotonous; and, if regard be had merely to the metrical properties
                    of space as distinguished from the graphical, hardly any cardinal geometrical
                    truths are omitted. With these excellences are combined a good many defects,
                    some of them inevitable to a system based on a very few axioms and postulates.
                    Thus the arrangement of his propositions seems arbitrary; associated theorems
                    and problems are not grouped together; the classification, in short, is
                    imperfect. That is the main objection to the retention of Euclid as a
                    school-book. Other objections, not to mention minor blemishes, are the prolixity
                    of his style, arising partly from a defective nomenclature, his treatment of
                    parallels depending on an axiom which is not axiomatic, and his sparing use of
                    superposition as a method of proof. A text-book of geometry which shall be free
                    from Euclid’s faults, and not contain others of a graver character, and which
                    shall at the same time be better adapted to purposes of elementary instruction,
                    is much to be desired, and remains yet to be written.</p>
                <p>Of the thirty-three ancient books subservient to geometrical analysis, Pappus
                    enumerates first the <hi rend="italic">Data</hi> (Δeδo∕Λ∈Vα) of Euclid. He says
                    it contained 90 propositions, the scope of which he describes; it now consists
                    of 95. It is not easy to explain this discrepancy, unless we suppose that some
                    of the propositions, as they existed in the time of Pappus, have since been
                    split into two, or that what were once scholia have since been erected into
                    propositions. The object of the <hi rend="italic">Dalai?,</hi> to show that when
                    certain things—lines, angles, spaces, ratios, &amp;c.—are given by hypothesis,
                    certain other things are given, that is, are determinable. The book, as we are
                    expressly told, and as we may gather from its contents, was intended for the
                    investigation of problems; and it has been conjectured that Euclid must have
                    extended the method of the <hi rend="italic">Data</hi> to the investigation of
                    theorems. What prompts this conjecture is the similarity between the analysis of
                    a theorem and the method, common enough in the <hi rend="italic">Elements,</hi>
                    of <hi rend="italic">reductio</hi><hi rend="italic">ad</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    believing that one at any rate, and probably both, of these books are not by
                    Euclid. No mention is made of them by any writer previous to Ptolemy (140 A.D.),
                    or by Ptolemy himself, and in no ancient codex are they ascribed to Euclid.</p>

                    an exposition of the appearances produced by the motion attributed to the
                    celestial sphere. Pappus, in the few remarks prefatory to his sixth book,
                    complains of the faults, both of omission and commission, of writers on
                    astronomy, and cites as an example of the former the second theorem of Euclid’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Phaenomena,</hi> whence, and from the interpolation of other

                    made of them by Pappus. This latter circumstance, taken in connexion with the
                    fact that two of the propositions in the sixth book of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mathematical Collection</hi> prove the same things as three in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Optics,</hi> is one of the reasons given by Gregory for deeming
                    that work spurious. Several other reasons will be found in Gregory’s preface to
                    his edition of Euclid’s works.</p>
                <p>In some editions of Euclid’s works there is given a book on the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Divisions of Superfries,</hi> which consists of a few propositions, showing how
                    a straight line may be drawn to divide in a given ratio triangles,
                    quadrilaterals, and pentagons. This was supposed by John Dee of London, who
                    transcribed or translated it, and entrusted it for publication to his friend
                    Federic Commandine of Urbino, to be the treatise of Euclid referred to by

                    to be Euclid’s. This opinion, however, he does not seem to have held very
                    strongly, nor does it appear that it was adopted by Commandine. The book does
                    not exist in Greek.</p>

                    ΤΙορισμάτων)</hi> are mentioned both by Pappus and Proclus, and the former gives
                    an abstract of them, with the lemmas assumed. A porism, according to Pappus, was
                    neither a theorem nor a problem, but something of an intermediate form, which
                    yet could be enunciated as a theorem or as a problem. Later geometers, he says,
                    defined it to be a local theorem wanting part of the hypothesis, but this
                    definition he censures as imperfect. After the publication of Commandine’s
                    translation of Pappus (1588), many attempts were made to extract from this
                    unsatisfactory description a clear idea of what a porism was, and, with the help
                    of the lemmas, to restore Euclid’s books. The mystery, which baffled the
                    penetration even of Edmund Halley, was not resolved till the time of Simson,
                    who, in 1722, gained some insight into the subject, and whose posthumous
                    treatise <hi rend="italic">De Porismatibus</hi> appeared in 1776. Simsou’s views
                    have been objected to by recent French writers, such as M. Paul Breton, and M.
                    Michel Chasles; but for a discussion of the subject recourse must be had to the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Porism.</hi> Here it will be sufficient to state
                    Simson’s definition, which is,—“A porism is a proposition in which it is
                    proposed to demonstrate that one or more things are given, between which and
                    every one of innumerable other things, not given but assumed according to a
                    given law, a certain relation, described in the proposition, is to be shown to
                    take place ;” and to refer to Simson’s <hi rend="italic">Opera P</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">eliqua</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> Playfair’s paper <hi
                    rend="italic">On the Origin and Investigation of Porisms;</hi> Trail’s <hi

                    >Euclide.</hi></p>
                <p>2. Two books are mentioned, named T0'7rωv <hi rend="italic">πpος lπιφαvelα,</hi>
                    which is rendered <hi rend="italic">Locorum</hi><hi rend="italic">ad</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Superficiem</hi> by Commandine and subsequent geometers. These
                    books were subservient to the analysis of loci, but the four lemmas which refer
                    to them, and which occur at the end of the seventh book of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mathematical Collection,</hi> throw very little light on their contents.
                    Simson’s opinion was that they treated of curves of double curvature, and he
                    intended at one time to write a treatise on the subject. (See Trail’s Z√c, pp.
                    60-62, 100-105).</p>
                <p>3. Pappus says that Euclid wrote four books on the <hi rend="italic">Conic
                    Sections</hi><hi rend="italic">(βιβλία</hi><hi rend="italic">τεσσαρα</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Κωνικών),</hi> which Apollonius amplified, and to which he added
                    other four. It is known that, in the time of Euclid, the parabola was considered
                    as the section of a right-angled cone, the ellipse that of an acute-angled cone,
                    the hyperbola that of an obtuse-angled <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n683/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0683-0658"/> cone, and that Apollonius was the first who
                    showed that the three sections could be obtained from any cone. There is good
                    ground therefore for supposing that the first four books of Apollonius’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Conics,</hi> which are still extant, resemble Euclid’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Conics</hi> even less than Euclid’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Elements</hi> do those of Eudoxus and Theaetetus.</p>
                <p>4. A book on <hi rend="italic">Fallacies</hi> (∏epι ^ευδαpιωv) is mentioned by
                    Proclus, who says that Euclid wrote it for the purpose of exercising beginners
                    in the detection of errors in reasoning.</p>
                <p>This notice of Euclid would be incomplete without some account of the earliest
                    and the most important editions of his works. Passing over the commentators of
                    the Alexandrian school, the first European translator of any part of Euclid is
                    Boetius (500 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi> author of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Consolatione Philosophice.</hi> His <hi rend="italic"
                    >Euclidis Megarensis Geometrice libri</hi><hi rend="italic">duo</hi> contain
                    nearly all the definitions of the first three books of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Elements,</hi> the postulates, and most of the axioms. The enunciations, with
                    diagrams but no proofs, are given of most of the propositions in the first,
                    second, and fourth books, and a few from the third.</p>
                <p>Some centuries afterwards, Euclid was translated into Arabic, but the only
                    printed version in that language is the one made of the thirteen books of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Elements</hi> by Nasir Al-Din Al-Tilsi (13th century), which
                    appeared at Rome in 1594. Judging from the unusual number of diagrams in this
                    edition, the translation of Euclid’s text is probably rather free.</p>
                <p>The first printed edition of Euclid was a translation of the fifteen books of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Elements</hi> from the Arabic, made, it is supposed, by
                    Adelard of Bath (12th century), with the comments of Campanus of Novara. It
                    appeared at Venice in 1482, printed by Erhardus Ratdolt, and dedicated to the
                    doge Giovanni Mocenigo. This edition represents Euclid very inadequately; the
                    comments are often foolish, propositions are sometimes omitted, sometimes joined
                    together, useless cases are interpolated, and now and then Euclid’s order
                    changed.</p>
                <p>The first printed translation from the Greek is that of Bartholomew Zamberti,
                    which appeared at Venice in 1505. Its contents will be seen from the title: <hi

                <p>-The first printed Greek text was published at Basel, in 1533, with the title
                    Eυκλ∈ιδoυ 2τoιχειωv <hi rend="italic">βιβλr if eκ</hi> τωv Θεωvov συνουσιών. It
                    was edited by Simon Grynaeus from two MSS. sent to him, the one from Venice by
                    Lazarus Bayfius, and the other from Paris by John Ruellius. The four books of
                    Proclus’s commentary are given at the end from an Oxford MS. supplied by John
                    Clay mundus.</p>
                <p>Γhe English edition, the only one which contains all the extant works attributed
                    to Euclid, is that of Dr David Gregory, published at Oxford in 1703, with the
                    title, Eυκλειδoυ. τα σω^o∕zεva. <hi rend="italic">Euclidis</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    text is that of the Basel edition, corrected from the MSS. bequeathed by Sir
                    Hemy Savile, and from Savile’s annotations on his own copy. The Latin
                    translation, which accompanies the Greek on the same page, is for the most part
                    that of Commandine.</p>

                    in 1816, and the third in 1818. It contains the <hi rend="italic">Elements</hi>
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Data,</hi> which are, says the editor, certainly the
                    only works which remain to us of this ever-celebrated geometer. The texts of the
                    Basel and Oxford editions were collated with 23 MSS., one of which belonged to
                    the library of the Vatican, but had been sent to Paris by the Comte de Peluse
                    (Monge). The Vatican MS. was supposed to date from the 9th century; and to its
                    readings Peyrard gave the greatest weight.</p>
