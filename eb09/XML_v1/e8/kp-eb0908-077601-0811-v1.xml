                    (1814-1873), a clergyman of the Scotch Episcopal Church, bishop of Argyll and
                    the Isles, was descended from an old Highland family, and was born in Aberdeen
                    25th March 1814. After spending two sessions at the university of that city,
                    where he manifested a special bent towards the study of natural history, he
                    studied for a time at a private school in Chelsea, and in 1831 he attended the
                    classes of chemistry, natural philosophy, and natural history in the university
                    of Edinburgh. His uncertain health, however, compelled him for a time to suspend
                    all systematic study. The property inherited from his father rendered it
                    unnecessary for him to adopt a profession from pecuniary considerations, and his
                    delicate health counselled at least delay in taking such a step. Accordingly,
                    for some time after his marriage be occupied himself chiefly in the cultivation
                    of his literary and artistic tastes, residing at first in the north of Scotland,
                    and in October 1838 journeying to Italy, <pb break="no"

                    1836, however, he had begun to look to the church as a profession; and in
                    October 1838 he was admitted to deacou’s orders with the object of pledging
                    himself to his future profession before leaving Scotland,—the Episcopalian
                    Church being preferred by him to the Presbyterian, chiefly on account of its
                    comprehensive statements regarding the subject of human redemption. Soon after
                    his return from Italy he was requested to take the charge of the Episcopal
                    congregation at Forres, and on accepting it he was ordained a presbyter in the
                    autumn of 1841. He remained at Forres till 1846, when he was elected first
                    bishop of the newly restored diocese of Argyll and the Isles, the duties of
                    which position he discharged till his death, 22d May 1873. In 1851 he received
                    the degree of D.C.L. from the university of Oxford.</p>
                <p>Though the work accomplished by Ewing was necessarily modified and circumscribed
                    by the fact that throughout his whole life he was fettered by a delicate bodily
                    con stitution, he yet battled with the vices and religious perplexities and
                    difficulties of his time in a spirit of buoyant cheerfulness. Perhaps his
                    strength lay chiefly in the charm of his personal manner, in his fine tact, and
                    his catholic sympathies; and these gradually secured him, not only the
                    admiration and love of the people and clergy of his diocese, but a prominent
                    position among the ecclesiastics of his own time, both in Scotland and England.
                    In all theological discussions he contended for the exercise of a wide tolerance
                    and charity, shrinking from condemning with ecclesiastical censure even opinions
                    which he feared might be fraught with evil and danger to the church. He did not,
                    indeed, attach much importance to mere ecclesiastical authority and
                    organization, and was more solicitous about the inward than the outward unity of
                    Christianity. His own theological position resembled very closely that of Thomas
                    Erskine of Linlathen, and Frederick Denison Maurice; but his relation to these
                    theologians was rather that of a friendly sympathiser than a disciple, for his
                    opinions were the fruit of his own meditation, and were coloured by his own
                    idiosyncracy, and their perspective was determined by his individual
                    stand-point. Unlike theirs, his teaching was never presented in the form of a
                    complete and elaborate theological treatise, and its purport is only to be
                    gathered from fragmentary publications,—letters to the newspapers, pamphlets,
                    special sermons, essays contributed to the series of <hi rend="italic">Present
                    Day Papers,</hi> of which he was the editor, and a volume of sermons entitled
                    <hi rend="italic">Revelation considered as.Light,</hi> which he only lived to
                    see through the press. The title of this volume may be taken as indicating the
                    characteristic feature of his theology. He dwelt specially upon the illuminating
                    power of Christianity as revealing the fatherhood of God, and thus “rolling back
                    the clouds of human sin and sorrow,” so as even ultimately to “exhaust hell of
                    its darkness.” To him each attribute of God was equally light, and therefore he
                    did not believe that any compromise had ever been effected between them. Christ
                    was the supreme manifestation of that light, and the Bible was but the medium of
                    its revelation, the means for enabling it to stream in upon the soul from
                    sources beyond the mere letter of the truths which the written word contained.
                    One of the chief of these external sources of light, specially welcomed by
                    Ewing, was science, to the discoveries of which he looked forward as destined to
                    lead to the manifestation of other and higher aspects of Christianity than were
                    yet fully realized.</p>
                <p>Besides his strictly theological writings, Ewing is the author of the <hi
