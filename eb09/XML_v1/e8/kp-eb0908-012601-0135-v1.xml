                <p><label type="entry">ELEPHANTA ISLE</label>, called by the natives Gharipur, a
                    small island between Bombay and the mainland, is situated about seven miles from
                    Bombay, 18° 57' N. lat. and 73° E. long. It is nearly five miles in
                    circumference, and the few inhabitants it contains are employed in the
                    cultivation of rice, and in rearing sheep and poultry for the Bombay market. The
                    island was, till within recent times, almost entirely overgrown with wood; it
                    contains several springs of good water. But it owes its chief celebrity to the
                    mythological excavations and sculptures of Hindu superstition which it contains.
                    Opposite to the landing-place is a colossal statue of an elephant, cracked and
                    mutilated, from which the island received from the Portuguese the name it still
                    bears. At a short distance from this is a cave, the entrance to which is nearly
                    60 feet wide and 18 high, supported by pillars cut out of the rock; the sides
                    are sculptured into numerous compartments, containing representations of the
                    Hindu deities, but many of the figures have been defaced by the zeal of the
                    Mahometans and Portuguese. In the centre of the excavations is a remarkable
                    bust, thought to represent the Hindu Triad, namely, Brahma the Creator, Vishnu
                    the Preserver, and Siva or Mahadeva the Destroyer, but now supposed by some to
                    be a triform representation of Siva alone. The heads are 6 feet in length, and
                    are well cut, and the faces, with the exception of the under lip, are handsome.
                    The headdresses are curiously ornamented; and one of the figures holds in its
                    hand a cobra di capella snake, whilst on the cap are, amongst other symbols, a
                    human skull and a young infant. On each side of the Trimurti is a pilaster, the
                    front of which is filled up by a human figure leaning on a dwarf, both much
                    defaced. There is a large compartment to the right, hollowed a little, and
                    covered with a great variety of figures, the largest of which is 16 feet high,
                    representing the double figure of Siva and Parvati, named Viraj, half male and
                    half female. On the right is Brahma, four-faced, on a lotus,—one of the very few
                    representations of this god which now exist in India; and on the left is Vishnu.
                    On the other side of the Trimurti is another compartment with various figures of
                    Siva and Parvati, the most remarkable of which is Siva in his vindictive
                    character, eight-handed, with a collet of skulls round his neck. On the right of
                    the entrance to the cave is a square apartment, supported by eight colossal
                    figures, containing a gigantic symbol of Mahadeva or Siva cut out of the rock.
                    In a ravine connected with the great cave are two other caves, also containing
                    sculptures, which, however, have been much defaced owing to the action of damp
                    and the falling of the rocks. This interesting retreat of Hindu religious art is
                    said to have been dedicated to Siva, but it contains numerous representations of
                    other Hindu deities. It has, however, for long been a place, not so much of
                    worship, as of archaeological and artistic interest alike to the European and
                    Hindu traveller. It forms a wonderful monument of antiquity, and must have been
                    a work of incredible labour. Archaeological authorities are of opinion that the
                    cave must have been excavated about the tenth century of our era. The island is
                    much frequented by the British residents of Bombay; and during his tour in India
                    in 1875, the Prince of W <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> ales was entertained
                    there at a banquet. (See Rousselet’s Linde, and Fergusson’s History of
                    Architecture.)</p>
