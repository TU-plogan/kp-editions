                    (1634-1716), a Norwegian poetess, who enjoyed a very wide reputation throughout
                    Scandinavia and over Germany during the first half of the 18th century. She was
                    born at Bergen in January 1634; her father, Engelbrecht Jorgensen, was
                    originally rector of the high school in that city, and afterwards dean of the
                    cathedral. Iu 1652 she married Ambrosius Hardenbech, a theological writer famous
                    for his flowery funeral sermons, who succeeded her father at the cathedral, when
                    the latter died in 1659. By the poetess Hardenbech had five sons and four
                    daughters. In 1678 her first volume appeared, <hi rend="italic">Sjadens
                    aandelige Sangoffer</hi> (The Soul’s Spiritual Offering of Song), published at
                    Copenhagen. This volume of hymns and devotional pieces, very modestly brought
                    out, had an unparalleled success, and surpassed in popularity every similar
                    collection of that age. The fortunate poetess was invited to Denmark, and on her
                    arrival at Copenhagen was presented at court. She was also introduced to Thomas
                    Kingo, the father of Danish poetry, and the eminent pair greeted one another
                    with a brace of improvised couplets, which have been preserved, and of which the
                    poetess’s reply is incomparably the neater. The next fifteen years of her life
                    were extremely unhappy. In 1683 her husband died, and before 1698 she had buried
                    all her nine children. In the midst of her troubles appeared her second work,
                    the <hi rend="italic">Taareoffer</hi> (Sacrifice of Tears), which is a
                    continuous religious poem in four books. This was combined with the <hi
                    rend="italic">Sangoffer,</hi> and no less than three editions of the united
                    works were published before her death, and many after it. In 1698 she brought
                    out a third volume of sacred verse, <hi rend="italic">Et</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >kristeligt Valet fra Verden</hi> (A Christian Rejection of the World), a very
                    tame production. In her old age she was honoured by a visit from the great poet
                    of her time, Petter Dass, who made the laborious journey to Bergen merely to see
                    her. She died, aged eighty-two, in 1716. The first verses of Dorthe
                    Engelbrechtsdatter are the best; her <hi rend="italic">Sangoffer</hi> was
                    dedicated to Jesus, the <hi rend="italic">Taareoffer</hi> to Queen Charlotte
                    Amalia; the change is significant of her different position in the eyes of the
                    world. She is, all through, a dull and tiresome writer, but her immense fame
                    among her contemporaries, and her merit as one of the earliest writers of verse
                    in modern Norway, give her a position in literature.</p>
