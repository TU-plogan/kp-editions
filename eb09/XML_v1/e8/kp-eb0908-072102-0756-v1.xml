                <p><label type="entry">EURYMEDON</label>, an Athenian general, who, in the 5th year
                    of the Peloponnesian war, 428 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> was sent by the
                    Athenians, with a fleet of 60 vessels, to intercept the Peloponnesian fleet
                    which was sailing to attack Corcyra, at that time rendered defenceless through
                    internal feuds. On his arrival he found that Nicostratus with a small squadron
                    from Naupactus had placed the island in security, but he took the command of the
                    combined fleet, which, however, the absence of the enemy prevented from
                    achieving any other end than merely to countenance and support by its presence
                    the cruelties inflicted by the democratic party on their political opponents. In
                    the following summer, in joint command along with Hipponicus of the land forces
                    of the Athenians, he, in concert with the fleet commanded by Nicias, ravaged the
                    district of Tanagra; and in 425 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> conjointly with
                    Sophocles, he was sent in command of an expedition destined for Sicily. After
                    leaving they learned that the enemy’s fleet was at Corcyra, but they were
                    delayed by stormy weather from arriving there in time to attack them. They had
                    been commanded in any case to touch at Corcyra, in order to deliver the
                    democratic party from the attacks of the oligarchical exiles, who had taken up a
                    position on a hill near the city, and w ere threatening it with capture. On the
                    arrival of the Athenian fleet the oligarchical leaders surrendered themselves on
                    condition that they should be sent to Athens to be judged; but they were
                    treacherously induced to make an attempt to escape, and on that account were
                    delivered up to the fury of their opponents. Eurymedon then proceeded to Sicily,
                    but immediately on his arrival there a pacification was concluded by
                    Hermocrates, to which Eurymedon and Sophocles were induced to agree. The terms
                    of the pacification did not, however, satisfy the Athenians, who attributed its
                    conclusion to bribery, and punished two of the chief agents in the negotiation
                    by banishment, while Eurymedon was sentenced to pay a heavy fine. In 414
                    Eurymedon, sent with Demosthenes to reinforce the Athenians at the siege of
                    Syracuse, was defeated and slain in the first of two battles fought before its
                    walls</p>
