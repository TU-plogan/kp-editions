                    in Holland, September 11, 1584. After completing his early education at Leyden,
                    he entered the university of that city, and in 1608 took the degree of master of
                    arts. By the advice of Scaliger he studied the Oriental languages whilst taking
                    his course of theology; and he even then <pb break="no"

                    department of learning. He afterwards travelled in England, France, Italy, and
                    Germany, forming connexions with learned men, and availing himself of the
                    information which they communicated. During his stay at Paris he contracted a
                    friendship with Casaubon, which lasted during his life, and also took lessons in
                    Arabic from an Egyptian, Joseph Barbatus, otherwise called Abu-dakni. At Venice
                    he perfected himself in the Turkish, Persic, and Ethiopie languages. After a
                    long absence, Erpenius returned to his own country in 1612, and on the 10th
                    February 1613 he was appointed professor of Arabic and other Oriental languages,
                    Hebrew excepted, in the university of Leyden. Soon after his settlement at
                    Leyden, animated by the example of Savary de Brèves, who had established an
                    Arabic press at Paris at his own charge, he caused new Arabic characters to be
                    cut at a great expense, and erected a press in his own house. In 1619 the
                    curators of the university of Leyden instituted a second chair of Hebrew in his
                    favour. In 1620 he was sent by the States of Holland to induce Pierre Dumoulin
                    or Andre Rivet to settle in that country; and after a second journey he was
                    success ful in inducing Rivet to comply with their request. Some time after the
                    return of Erpenius, the States appointed him their interpreter; and in this
                    capacity he had the duty imposed upon him of translating and replying to the
                    different letters of the Moslem princes of Asia and Africa. His reputation had
                    now spread throughout all Europe, and several princes, the kings of England and
                    Spain, and the archbishop of Seville made him the most flattering offers; but he
                    constantly refused to leave his native country. In addition to the numerous
                    works he had already published, he was preparing an edition of the Koran with a
                    Latin translation and notes, and was projecting an Oriental library, when at the
                    early age of forty a contagious disease cut short his life, November 13,
                    1624.</p>
