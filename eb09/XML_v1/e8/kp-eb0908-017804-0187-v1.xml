                <p><label type="entry">EMPEDOCLES</label>, one of the most imposing and enigmatic
                    figures in early Greek philosophy, was a native of Agrigentum in Sicily, and
                    lived in the 5th century, probably from 490 to 430 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> The details of his life are full of fable and contradictions. The
                    most probable accounts represent him as belonging to an honourable family in the
                    palmy days of his city, as a champion of free institutions, like his father
                    Meton, detecting the aims of incipient tyrants, and crushing the opponents of
                    popular rights, but as finally forced, through the change of parties that
                    occurred during his visit to Olympia, to forego his native city, and to return
                    to Peloponnesus to die. Of his poem on nature (φυtrις) there are left about 400
                    lines in unequal fragments out of the original 5000; of the hymns of
                    purification (καθαρμ.οί) less than 100 verses remain; of the other works,
                    improbably assigned to him, nothing is known. His grand but obscure hexameters,
                    after the example of Parmenides, delighted Lucretius. Aristotle, it is said,
                    called him the father of rhetoric. But it was as at once statesman, prophet,
                    physicist, physician, and reformer that he most impressed the popular
                    imagination. To his contemporaries, as to himself, he seemed more than a mere
                    man. The Sicilians honoured his august aspect as he moved amongst them with
                    purple robes and golden girdle, with long hair bound by a Delphic garland, and
                    brazen sandals bn his feet, and with a retinue of slaves behind him. Stories
                    were told of the ingenuity and generosity by which he had made the marshes round
                    Selinus salubrious, of the grotesque device by which he laid the winds that
                    ruined the harvests of <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0188-0179"/> Agrigentum, and of the almost miraculous
                    restoration to life of a woman who had long lain in a death-like trance. Legends
                    stranger still told of his disappearance from among men. Empedocles, according
                    to one story, was one midnight, after a feast held in his honour, called away in
                    a blaze of glory to the gods; according to another, he had only . thrown himself
                    into the crater of Etna, in the hope that men, finding no traces of his end,
                    would suppose him translated to heaven. But his hopes were cheated by the
                    volcano, which cast forth his brazen sandals, -and betrayed his secret.</p>
                <p>As his history is uncertain, so his doctrines are hard to put together. He does
                    not belong to any one definite school. While, on one hand, he combines much that
                    had been suggested by Parmenides, Pythagoras, and the Ionic school, he has germs
                    of truth that Plato and Aristotle afterwards developed. There are, according to
                    Empedocles, four ultimate kinds of things, four primal divinities, of which are
                    made all structures in the world—fire, air, water, eιrth. These four elements
                    are eternally brought into union, and eternally parted from each other, by two
                    divine beings or powers, love and hatred—an attractive and a repulsive force
                    which the ordinary eye can see working amongst men, but which really pervade the
                    whole world. According to the different proportions in which these four
                    indestructible and unchangeable matters are combined with each other is the
                    difference of the organic structure produced; e.g., flesh and blood are made of
                    equal parts of all four elements, whereas bones are one-half fire, one-fourth
                    earth, and one-fourth water. It is in the aggregation and segregation of
                    elements thus arising that Empedocles, like the atomists, finds the real process
                    which corresponds to what is popularly termed growth, increase, or decrease.
                    Nothing new comes or can come into being; the only change that can occur is a
                    change in the juxtaposition of element with element.</p>
                <p>Empedocles apparently regarded love and discord as alternately holding the empire
                    over things,—neither, however, being ever quite absent. As the best and original
                    state, he seems to have conceived a period when love was predominant, and all
                    the elements formed one great sphere or globe. Since that period discord had
                    gained more sway; and the actual world was full of contrasts and oppositions,
                    due to the combined action of both principles. His theory attempted to explain
                    the separation of elements, the formation of earth and sea, of sun and moon, of
                    atmosphere. But the most interesting and most matured part of his views dealt
                    with the first-origin of plants and animals, and with the physiology of man. As
                    the elements (his deities) entered into combinations, there appeared quaint
                    results—heads without necks, arms without shoulders. Then as these fragmentary
                    structures met, there were seen horned heads on human bodies, bodies of oxen
                    with men’s heads, and figures of double sex. But mo3t of these products of
                    natural forces disappeared as suddenly as they arose; only in those rare cases
                    where the several parts were found adapted to each other, and casual member
                    fitted into casual member, did the complex structures thus formed last. Thus
                    from spontaneous aggregations of casual aggregates, which suited each other as
                    if this had been intended, did the organic universe originally spring. Soon
                    various influences reduced the creatures of double sex to a male and a female,
                    and the world was replenished with organic life.</p>
                <p>As man, animal, and plant are composed of the same elements in different
                    proportions, there is an identity of nature in them all. They all have sense and
                    understanding; in man, however, and especially in the blood at his heart, mind
                    has its peculiar seat. But mind is always dependent upon the body, and varies
                    with its changing constitution. Hence the precepts of morality are with
                    Empedocles largely dietetio.</p>
                <p>Knowledge is explained by the principle that the several elements in the things
                    outside us are perceived by the corresponding elements in ourselves. We know
                    only in so far as we have a cognate nature within us to the object of knowledge.
                    Like is known by like. The whole body is full of pores, and hence respiration
                    takes place over the whole frame, But in the organs of sense these pores are
                    specially adapted to receive the effluxes which are continually rising from
                    bodiee around us; and' in this way perception is somewhat obscurely
                    explained.</p>
                <p>It is not easy to harmonize these quasi-scientific theories with the theory of
                    transmigration of souls which Empedocles seems to expound, Probably the doctrine
                    that the divinity (δαi∕zωv) passes from element to element, nowhere finding a
                    home, is a mystical way of teaching the continued identity of the principles
                    which are at the bottom of every phase of development from inorganic nature to
                    man. At the top of the scale are the prophet and the physician, those who have
                    best learned the secret of life; they are next to the divine. One law, an
                    identity of elements, pervades all nature; existence is one from end to end; the
                    plant and the animal are links in a chain where man is a link too: and even the
                    distinction between male and female is transcended. The beasts are kindred with
                    man; he who eats their flesh is not much better than a cannibal.</p>
                <p>Looking at the opposition between these and the ordinary opinions, we are not
                    surprised that Empedocles notes the limitation and narrowness of human
                    perceptions. We see, he says, but a part, and fancy that we have, grasped the
                    whole. But the senses cannot lead to truth; thought and reflection must look at
                    the thing on every side. It is the business, of a philosopher, while he lays
                    bare the fundamental difference of elements, to display the identity that
                    subsists between what seem unconnected parts of the universe.</p>
