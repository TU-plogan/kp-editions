                    (15517-1634 ?), a Spanish poet and ecclesiastic, born probably in 1551, at
                    Ronda, in the province of Granada. He was educated at Salamanca, was an early
                    patron and friend of Lope de Vega, and served as a soldier in Flanders. His
                    ecclesiastical position seems to have been that of a chaplain at Ronda, but he
                    resided chiefly at Madrid. He is now chiefly noted as having produced one of the
                    best of those romances delineating Spanish manners that have found imitators in
                    other countries. This book, which is entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Belaciones</hi><hi rend="italic">de la Vida y</hi><hi rend="italic">Hechos del
                    Escudero Marcos de Obregon,</hi> appeared in 1618 at Barcelona, at a period when
                    Spanish literature was at a low ebb. Marcos is not a chivalresque “esquire”, but
                    a simple individual who seeks his fortune by attaching himself to great men; and
                    the object of the author is to λvarn young men against so degrading a course of
                    life. The squire tells his own story. The incidents, which are not generally
                    exciting, though amusing, and nationally characteristic, are supposed to be
                    drawn in great part from the author’s own life; the style is correct, though
                    somewhat diffuse. Its chief interest, like that of the clever <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vida y</hi><hi rend="italic">Hechos del</hi><hi rend="italic">Picaro</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Guzman de Alfarache</hi> of Aleman, is that Le Sage has not
                    scrupled to borrow from both writers many of the incidents and characters in his
                    novel of <hi rend="italic">Gil Blas—</hi> a circumstance which induced an
                    indignant Spaniard to give to his translation into Spanish of Le Sage’s work the
                    title, <hi rend="italic">Gil Blas restored to his Country and his Native
                    Tongue,</hi> while in the preface he denounces the barefaced plagiarism. The
                    charge of plagiarism against Le Sage was first made by Voltaire, who grossly
                    exaggerates in saying that <hi rend="italic">Gil Blas</hi> is taken entirely
                    from the work of Espinel. Espinel was noted for his musical taste, and added a
                    fifth string to the national guitar. He was also a poet of some reputation,
                    especially for his <hi rend="italic">Canciones</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pedondillas.</hi> His pastorals and elegies contain many spirited natural
                    descriptions, though they do not abound in original conceptions; and his
                    versification is always harmonious. He was the inventor or reviver of the
                    measure known as the <hi rend="italic">decimas,</hi> and sometimes called after
                    him <hi rend="italic">Espinelas,</hi> which consists of a stanza of ten verses
                    of eight syllables each. He also translated into verse some of the odes and the
                    <hi rend="italic">Ars Poetica</hi> of Horace. Espinel seems to have been
                    neglected in his old age, for he died in great poverty at Madrid in 1634.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Μαrcοs de Obregon</hi> was translated into German by Tieek,
                    with a preface and valuable notes. There is a good English translation by
                    Algernon Langton (2 vols., London, 1816).</p>
