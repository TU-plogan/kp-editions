                <p><label type="entry">ERASMUS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Desiderius</hi></label>, was
                    born at Rotterdam on the night of 27-8 October, and probably in the year 1466.
                    The inscription on his statue, erected in his native place in 1622, names the
                    year 1467; but the epitaph on his tombstone at Basel makes him 69 at the time of
                    his death in July 1536, a reckoning which might be compatible with either year,
                    1466 or 1467. The latter year is excluded by Erasmus’s own statements, which,
                    though inconsistent, agree on the whole best with the year 1466 (see <hi
                    rend="italic">Ep.</hi> 51, append.) His father’s Christian name was Gerhard, of
                    which Erasmus is meant for a Greek, and Desiderius for a Latin, rendering. He
                    had no proper surname, not having been born in wedlock. His father provided for
                    his education as long as he lived, placing him first as chorister in the
                    cathedral school of Utrecht, and afterwards removing him to Deventer, of which
                    school the celebrated teacher Alexander Hegius was at that time master. But
                    Erasmus was too young—he left Deventer aet. 13—to have come much under the
                    instruction of the head-master.</p>
                <p>Both his father and his mother dying young, Erasmus was left to the care of three
                    guardians, who endeavoured to force him into a convent. They sent him for three
                    years to a conventual preparatory school at Bois-le-duc (Hertogenbosch), and
                    afterwards so far overcame his resistance that he entered upon the novitiate in
                    a house of the regular canons of St Augustine, at Stein, near Gouda. He made his
                    profession here in 1486, aet. 19; and was afterwards ordained priest by the
                    bishop of Utrecht. Erasmus had no vocation for the devotional exercises of
                    convent life, and was disgusted with the society of the monks,—coarse, ignorant,
                    and illiterate. His aspiration was to escape to some university where he might
                    study. From the very first, the love of letters was the one ruling motive of his
                    life. An unexpected chance brought him deliverance. Henri de Bergues, bishop of
                    Cambray, took him to be his secretary. With the permission of the prior of
                    Stein, and the consent of the general of the order and of· the ordinary, the
                    bishop of Utrecht, Erasmus left the convent. After a short stay with his new
                    patron the bishop of Cambray, and with funds sparingly supplied by him, Erasmus
                    entered the college of Montaigu in the university of Paris. Of the revolting
                    economy of this college in respect of food and lodging he has left a graphic
                    account in the <hi rend="italic">Colloquies</hi> (Icthyophagia): “I carried
                    nothing away from it,” he says, “but a body infected with disease, and a
                    plentiful supply of vermin.” Rabelais, it will be remembered, has recorded a
                    similar experience.</p>
                <p>To eke out his scanty means he took pupils. With one of these, Lord Mountjoy, he
                    came to England in 1497. According to Anthony Wood, he spent three years, 1497
                    to 1499, in Oxford. Many of the biographers make him return to Paris in 1498;
                    but the chronology of this part of Erasmus’s life is confused. It is certain
                    that he resided some time in Oxford, having a room in a small Augustinian house
                    called St Mary’s College, in New-inn-hall Lane, and either there or in London
                    made the acquaintance of the few Englishmen who were distinguished for learning,
                    Colet, Grocyn, Linacer, Latimer, Sixtinus. In 1499 he was again in Paris, then
                    at Orleans, then at St Omer’s in the Netherlands, and for the next five years he
                    seems to have been continually on the move between France and Holland, his
                    longest sojourn being at Louvain. In these years he had a hard struggle with
                    poverty, supporting himself partly by pupils, partly by dedications. He wrote
                    and <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n532/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0532-0513"/> delivered a Latin oration on the occasion of the
                    reception of the archduke Philip at Brussels in 1504, for which he got a
                    handsome fee. In April 1506 we find him again in England, first in London, and
                    becoming acquainted with More and Warham, then at Cambridge, performing the
                    exercises for the divinity degree, and commencing B.D. “The Athenae
                    Cantabrigienses” of Cooper make him take the degree of D.D. at the university,
                    but this is an error. His stay in England was not long, as he found opportunity
                    to carry out a long cherished project of a journey to Italy. Want of funds had
                    hitherto been the obstacle; “I have a longing to visit Italy,” he wrote in 1498,
                    “but it is not easy to fly without wings.” He was engaged to escort the two sons
                    of Baptista Boyer, physician to Henry VII., as far as Bologna. In September 1506
                    he λvas at Turin, and took the degree of D.D. in that university. He passed the
                    winter of 1506-7 at Bologna, where he was witness of the triumphal entry of
                    Julius IL, and where he made acquaintance with Paulus Bυmbasius and Scipio
                    Carteromachus (Forteguerra). Here he obtained a papal dispensation permitting
                    him to lay aside the dress of his order, though the story of his being mistaken
                    for a plague-doctor in consequence of wearing it is justly dismissed by Drummond
                    as a pleasant fiction. He visited Venice, where he stayed some time, for the
                    purpose of passing through the press of Aldus a second and greatly enlarged
                    edition of his <hi rend="italic">Adagia.</hi> Here he was domesticated in the
                    house of Asulanus, and made the acquaintance of the circle of learned men who
                    were clustered round the Aldine press,—Marcus Musurus, Aleander, Baptista
                    Egnatius, Arc.</p>
                <p>In 1508 he removed to Padua, where he spent the winter as tutor to Alexander
                    Stewart, natural son of James IV., king of Scotland. Father and son fell
                    together, not long after, at Flodden. In the early spring of 1509 the tutor and
                    pupil removed to Siena, and from Siena Erasmus went on to Rome. As his
                    reputation had gone before him, he was received wherever he came with marks of
                    distinction. But he learnt nothing from intercourse with the Italian literati;
                    the Renaissance had already spent itself, and Erasmus complains “In Italia
                    frigent studia, fervent bella.” He had various offers of preferment, but a
                    letter from Lord Mountjoy announcing the death of the king of England, April
                    1509, and magnifying the favourable disposition of the young sovereign Henry
                    VIII. towards Erasmus, and towards learning in general, determined his return to
                    this country. From London, where he was the guest of Thomas More, and where he
                    wrote his <hi rend="italic">Encomium Morias,</hi> he moved to Cambridge, whither
                    he was invited by John Fisher, bishop of Rochester, and lodged in Queen’s
                    College, of which Fisher was president. By Fisher’s interest, he was appointed
                    Lady Margaret’s professor of divinity, and afterwards regius reader of Greek.
                    From his mention of the grammars of Chrysoloras and of Gaza as the text books on
                    which he lectured, it may be inferred that the study of Greek was still in its
                    infancy in that university. Gibbon’s sarcasm that “Eras mus learned Greek at
                    Oxford and taught it at Cambridge” <hi rend="italic">{Hist.,</hi> ch. 66) has
                    just this foundation.</p>
                <p>The stipends of these chairs were small, and Erasmus refused to take fees from
                    students mostly very poor. He lived upon presents from wealthy ecclesiastics.
                    Archbish op Warham was his principal patron. Erasmus says, “He has given me a
                    living worth a hundred nobles, and changed it at my request for a pension of one
                    hundred crowns. Within these few years he has given me more than four hundred
                    nobles without my asking; one day he gave me one hundred and fifty. From other
                    bishops I have received more than one hundred. Lord Mountjoy has appointed me a
                    pension of one hundred crowns.” He got fifteen angels from Colet for a
                    dedication. He says, in the <hi rend="italic">Compendium Vitce,</hi> that if the
                    promises made to him had been performed he would have passed the rest of his
                    days in England. But in this he perhaps deceived himself. At this period of his
                    life, and till he was turned fifty, the agitation of locomotion, new places, and
                    fresh faces were a necessity to him. An over-excited nervous sensibility was at
                    the bottom of this feverish restlessness. In the autumn of 1513 he bade farewell
                    to England, visited Lord Mountjoy at the Castle of Ham in Picardy, of which he
                    was governor, and passed by the Rhine to Strasburg. Here he made the aquaintance
                    of Wimpheling, Sebastian Brant, and the young Johann Sturm. He employed his time
                    on board the tow-boat by which he leisurely ascended the river in correcting his
                    “Commentarii de duplici copia,” &amp;c., for a new edition. To Basel, -which was
                    to be the home of his old age, he was attracted by the reputation of its press.
                    But he met with such a hearty welcome from Froben and Amerbach, and found so
                    agreeable a circle of men of learning, that he passed the whole winter 1514-15
                    here. The bishop of Basel, Christoph von Uten-heim, was so much pleased with him
                    that he sought to domesticate him in his house; he made the acquaintance of
                    Zwingli and of Hans Holbein, and drew round him a circle of young students full
                    of ardour for learning, and consequently of admiration for Erasmus,—Glareanus,
                    Oecolampadius, Beer, Myconius, Sapidus, and, above all, Beatus Rhenanus, who
                    became his attached disciple and biographer.</p>
                <p>Though from this time forward Basel became the centre of occupation and interest
                    for Erasmus, yet for the next seven years he was in constant movement, from
                    Basel to Flanders, thence to England in 1517, and back again to Basel. Offers of
                    church preferment in various countries continued to be made to him. But his
                    circumstances had improved so much, by pensions, the presents which -were
                    showered upon him, and the sale of his books, that he was now in a position to
                    refuse all proposals which would have interfered with his cherished
                    independence. Aware how necessary it was, if he would maintain his literary
                    supremacy, to keep on good terms with the powerful in church and state, and
                    therefore cautious not to give offence in word or act, he was yet most anxious
                    to avoid dependence on any individual. It suited him to be always competed for,
                    and never to sell himself. The general ardour for the restoration of the arts
                    and of learning created an aristocratic public, of which Erasmus was supreme
                    pontiff. Luther spoke to the people and the ignorant; Erasmus had the ear of the
                    educated class. His friends and admirers were distributed over all the countries
                    of Europe, and presents were continually arriving from small as well as great,
                    from a donation of 200 florins, made by Pope Clement VII., down to sweetmeats
                    and comfits contributed by the nuns of Cologne <hi rend="italic">{Ep.</hi> 666).
                    From England, in particular, he continued to receive supplies of money. In the
                    last year of his life, Cromwell sent him 20 angels, and Archbishop Crammer 18.
                    Though Erasmus led a very hard-working and far from luxurious life, and had no
                    extragavant habits, yet he could not live upon little. The excessive delicacy of
                    his constitution exacted some unusual indulgences. He could not bear the iron
                    stoves of Germany, and required an open fireplace, or a porcelain stove, in the
                    room in which he worked. He was afflicted with the stone, and obliged to be
                    particular as to the wine he drank. The white wines of Baden or the Rhine did
                    not suit him; he could only drink those of Burgundy or Franche-Comté. No more
                    acceptable present could be offered him than a cask of the light-red wine of the
                    Jura. He could neither eat nor bear the smell of fish. “His heart,” he said,
                    “was Catholic, but his stomach <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n533/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0533-0514"/> was Lutheran.” For his constant journeys he
                    required two horses, one for himself and one for his attendant. And though he
                    was almost alw ays found in horse-flesh by his friends, the keep had to be paid
                    for. For his literary labours and his extensive correspondence he required one
                    or more amanuenses. He often had occasion, on his own business, or on that of
                    Froben’s press, to send special couriers to a distance, employing them by the
                    way in collecting the free gifts of his tributaries.</p>
                <p>Precarious as these means of subsistence seem, he preferred the independence thus
                    obtained to an assured position which would have involved obligations to a
                    patron or professional duties which his weak health would have made onerous. He
                    accepted the diploma of D.D. from the theological faculty at Louvain, but
                    declined an offered professorship, saying “he did not like teaching.” The duke
                    of Bavaria offered to meet this objection by dispensing with teaching, if he
                    would only reside, and would have named him on these terms to a chair in his new
                    university of Ingolstadt, with a salary of 200 ducats, and the reversion of one
                    or more prebendal stalls. The archduke Ferdinand offered a pension of 400
                    florins, if he would only come to reside at Vienna. Adrian VI. offered him a
                    deanery <hi rend="italic">(Ep.</hi> 859), but the offer seems to have been of a
                    possible and not an actual deanery. Offers, flattering but equally vague, were
                    made from France, on the part of the bishop of Bayeux, and even of Francis I.
                    “Invitor amplissimis conditionibus; offeruntur dignitates et episcopatus; rex
                    essem si juvenis essem <hi rend="superscript"> ,,</hi> (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Ep.</hi> 735). Erasmus declined all, and about the end of the year 1520 settled
                    permanently at Basel, in the capacity of general editor and literary adviser of
                    Froben’s press. He had a house of his own in Louvain, and as a subject of the
                    emperor, and attached to his court by a pension, it would have been convenient
                    to him to have fixed his residence there. But the bigotry of the Flemish clergy,
                    and the monkish atmosphere of the university of Louvain, overrun with Dominicans
                    and Franciscans, united for once in their enmity to the new classical learning,
                    inclined Erasmus to seek a more congenial home in Basel. Here a freer spirit
                    reigned, and here he had already formed several fast friendships. But that which
                    had most influence upon his choice was the fact that Basel had been made, by two
                    enterprising publishers, Froben and Johann Amerbach, the centre of the German
                    booktrade. The arrival of Erasmus was an event in Basel. He had a public
                    reception, and received addresses on the part of the bishop and clergy, the
                    municipality, and the university. But to Froben his arrival was the advent of
                    the very man whom he had long wanted. Froben’s enterprise, united with Erasmus’s
                    editorial skill, raised the press of Basel, for a time, to be the most important
                    in Europe. The death of Froben in 1527, the final separation of Basel from the
                    empire, the wreck of learning in the religious disputes, and the cheap paper and
                    scamped work of the Frankfort presses, gradually withdrew the trade from Basel.
                    But during the eight years of Erasmus’s co-operation the Froben press took the
                    lead of all the presses in Europe, both in the standard value of the works
                    published and in style of typographical execution. Like some other publishers
                    who preferred reputation to returns in money, Froben died poor, and his
                    impressions never reached the splendour afterwards attained by those of the
                    Estiennes, or of Plantin. The series of the Fathers alone contains Jerome
                    (1516-18),Cyprian (1520),Pseudo-Arnobius (1522), Athanasius (Latin, 1522),
                    Hilarius (1523), Irenaeus (Latin, 1526), Ambrose (1527), Augustine (1528),
                    Epiphanius (1529), Chrysostom on St Matthew (Latin, 1530), Basil (Greek, 1532,
                    the first Greek author printed in Germany), and Origen (Latin, 1536). In these
                    editions, partly texts, partly translations, it is impossible to determine the
                    respective shares of Erasmus and his many helpers. The prefaces and dedications
                    are all written by him, and some of them, as that to the Hilarius, are of
                    importance for the history as well of the times as of Erasmus himself. Of his
                    most important edition, that of the Greek text of the New Testament, something
                    will be said further on.</p>
                <p>In this “mill,” as he calls it, Erasmus continued to grind for eight years, from
                    his 53rd to his 61st year, getting through in that time an amount of literary
                    labour to which most men in robust health would scarcely have proved equal.
                    Besides his work as editor, he was always writing himself some book or pamphlet
                    called for by the event of the day, some general fray in which he was compelled
                    to mingle, or some personal assault which it was necessary to repel. He was
                    himself painfully conscious how much his reputation as a writer was damaged by
                    this extempore production. “An author,” he says, “should handle with deliberate
                    care the subject which he has selected, should keep his work long by him and
                    retouch it many times before it sees the light. These things it has never been
                    my good fortune to be able to do. Accident has determined my subject for me. I
                    have written on without stopping, and published with such precipitation that
                    changed circumstances have often compelled entire re-writing in the second
                    edition” <hi rend="italic">(Ep. ad Botzhem.).</hi> He was the object of those
                    solicitations which always beset the author whose name upon the title page
                    assures the sale of a book. He was besieged for dedications, and as every
                    dedication meant a present proportioned to the circumstances of the dedicatee,
                    there was a natural temptation to be lavish of them. Add to this a
                    correspondence so extensive a3 to require him at times to write forty letters in
                    one day, “I receive daily,” he writes, “letters from remote parts, from kings,
                    princes, prelates, and men of learning, and even from persons of whose existence
                    I was ignorant.” His day was thus one of incessant mental activity, and he had
                    acquired the power of working with such rapidity that J. C. Scaliger, one of his
                    detractors, says <hi rend="italic">(Orat.</hi> 2 <hi rend="italic">pro
                    Cicerone)</hi> that he had been told by Aldus that Erasmus did more work in one
                    day than others did in two. Under the heading “Herculei Labores,” in <hi
                    rend="italic">The Adayia,</hi> he hints at the immense labour which this
                    compilation had cost him. But hard work was so far from breeding a distaste for
                    his occupation, that reading and writing grew ever more delightful to him
                    (literarum assiduitas non modo mihi fastidium non parit, sed voluptatem; crescit
                    scribendo scribendi studium).</p>
                <p>In 1527 Johann Froben died, and the disturbances at Basel, occasioned by the
                    zealots for the religious revolution which was in progress throughout
                    Switzerland, began to make Erasmus desirous of changing his residence. He
                    selected Freiburg in the Breisgau, as a city which was still in the dominion of
                    the emperor, and was free from religious dissension. Thither he removed in April
                    1529. He was received with public marks of respect by the authorities, who
                    granted him the use of an unfinished residence which had been begun to be built
                    for the late emperor Maximilian. Erasmus proposed only to remain at Freiburg for
                    a few months, but found the place so suited to his habits that he bought a house
                    of his own, and remained there six years. A desire for change of air—he fancied
                    Freiburg was damp,—rumours of a new war with France, and the necessity of seeing
                    his <hi rend="italic">Ecclesiastes</hi> through the press, took him back to
                    Basel in 1535. He lived now a very retired life, and saw only a small circle of
                    intimate friends. It was now that a last attempt was made by the papal court to
                    enlist him in some public -way against the Reformation. On the election of Paul
                    III. in 1534, he had, as usual, sent the new pope a congratulatory letter. After
                    his arrival in Basel, he received a complimentary <pb break="no"

                    deanery of Deventer, the income of which was reckoned at 1500 ducats. This
                    nomination was accompanied with an intima tion that more was in store for him,
                    and that steps would be taken to provide for him the income, viz., 3000 ducats,
                    λvhich was necessary to qualify for the cardinal’s hat. But Erasmus was even
                    less disposed now than he had been before to barter his reputation for honours.
                    His health had been for some years gradually declining, and disease in the shape
                    of gout gaining upon him. In the winter of 1535-6, he was confined entirely to
                    his chamber, many days to his bed. Though thus afflicted he never ceased his
                    literary activity, dictating his tract <hi rend="italic">On the Purity of the
                    Church,</hi> and revising the sheets of a translation of Origen which was
                    passing through Froben’s press. His last letter is dated 28th June 1536, and
                    subscribed “Eras. Rot. aegra manu.” “I have never been so ill in my life before
                    as I am now,—for many days unable even to read.” Dysentery setting in carried
                    him off 12th July 1536, in his 69th year.</p>
                <p>By his will, now preserved in the library at Basel, he left what he had to leave,
                    with the exception of some legacies, to Boniface Amerbach, Johann Froben’s
                    son-in-law, partly for himself, partly in trust for the benefit of the aged and
                    infirm, or to be spent in portioning young girls, and in educating young men of
                    promise. He left none of the usual legacies for masses or other clerical
                    purposes, and was not attended by any priest or confessor in his last
                    moments.</p>
                <p>Erasmus’s features are familiar to all, from Holbein’s many portraits or their
                    copies. Beatus Rhenanus, “Summus Erasmi observator,” as he is called by De Thou,
                    describes his person thus :—“In stature not tall, but not noticeably short; in
                    figure well built and graceful; of an extremely delicate constitution, sensitive
                    to the slightest changes of climate, food, or drink. After middle life he
                    suffered from the stone, not to mention the common plague of studious men, an
                    irritable mucous membrane. His complexion was fair; light blue eyes, and
                    yellowish hair. Though his voice was weak, his enunciation was distinct; the
                    expression of his face cheerful; his manner and conversation polished, affable,
                    even charming.” It was this delicacy of stomach, and not pampered appetite, that
                    made him loathe fish, and be fastidious as to his wine. His highly nervous
                    organization made his feelings acute, and his brain incessantly active. Through
                    his ready sympathy with all forms of life and character, his attention was
                    always alive. The active movement of his spirit spent itself, not in following
                    out its own trains of thought, but in outward observation. No man was ever less
                    introspective, and though he talks much of himself, his egotism is the genial
                    egotism which takes the world into its confidence, not the selfish egotism which
                    feels no interest but in its own woes. He says of himself, and justly, “that he
                    was incapable of dissimulation” <hi rend="italic">lfEp.</hi> 1152). There is
                    nothing behind, no pose, no scenic effect. It may be said of his letters that in
                    them “tota patet vita senis.” His nature was flexible without being faultily
                    weak. He has many moods and each mood imprints itself in turn on his words.
                    Hence, on a superficial view, Erasmus is set down as the most inconsistent of
                    men. Further acquaintance makes us feel a unity of character underlying this
                    susceptibility to the impressions of the moment. His seeming inconsistencies are
                    reconciled to apprehension, not by a formula of the intellect, but by the
                    many-sidedness of a. highly impressible nature. In the words of Nisard, Erasmus
                    was one of those “dont la gloire a été de beaucoup comprendre, et d’affirmer
                    peu.”</p>
                <p>This equal openness to every vibration of the environment is the key to all
                    Erasmus’s acts and words, and among them to the middle attitude which he took up
                    towards the great religious conflict of his time. The reproaches of party
                    assailed him in his life-time, and have continued to be heaped upon his memory.
                    He was loudly accused by the Catholics of collusion with the enemies of the
                    faith. His powerful friends, the pope, Wolsey, Henry VIII., the emperor, called
                    upon him to declare against Luther. Theological historians from that time
                    forward have perpetuated the indictment that Erasmus sided with neither party in
                    the struggle for religious truth. The most moderate form of the censure presents
                    him in the odious light of a trimmer; the vulgar and venomous assailant is sure
                    that Erasmus was a Protestant at heart, but withheld the avowal that he might
                    not forfeit the worldly advantages he enjoyed as a Catholic. When by study of
                    his writings we come to know Erasmus intimately, there is revealed to us one of
                    those natures to which partisanship is an impossibility. It was not timidity or
                    weakness which kept Erasmus neutral, but the reasonableness of his nature. It
                    was not only that his intellect revolted against the narrowness of party, his
                    whole being repudiated its clamorous and vulgar excesses. As he loathed fish, so
                    he loathed clerical fanaticism. Himself a Catholic priest— “the glory of the
                    priesthood and the shame”—the tone of the orthodox clergy was distasteful to
                    him; the ignorant hostility to classical learning which reigned in their
                    colleges and convents disgusted him. In common with all the learned men of his
                    age, he wished to see the power of the clergy broken, as that of an obscurantist
                    army arrayed against light. He had employed all his resources of wit and satire
                    against the priests and monks, and the superstitions in which they traded, long
                    before Luther’s name was heard of. The motto which was already current in his
                    life-time, “that Erasmus laid the egg and Luther hatched it,” is so far true,
                    and no more. Erasmus would have suppressed the monasteries, put an end to the
                    domination of the clergy, and swept away scandalous and profitable abuses, but
                    to attack the church or re-mould received theology was far from his thoughts.
                    And when out of Luther’s revolt there arose a new fanaticism—that of evangelism,
                    Erasmus recoiled from the violence of the new preachers.- “Is it for this,” he
                    writes to Melanchthon <hi rend="italic">(Ep.</hi> 703), “that we have shaken off
                    bishope and parties, that we may come under the yoke of sucn madmen as Otto and
                    Farel <hi rend="italic">1”</hi> Passages have been collected, and it is an easy
                    task, from the writings of Erasmus to prove that he shared the doctrines of the
                    Reformers. Passages equally strong might be culled to show that he repudiated
                    them. The truth is that theological questions in themselves had no attraction
                    for him. And when a theological position was emphasized by party passion it
                    became odious to him. In 1521 he writes <hi rend="italic">(Ep.</hi> 572) that he
                    had not yet had time to read Luther’s pamphlets, so offensive to his refined
                    taste was their coarse vulgarity and exaggerated tone, as he had found on
                    looking into them. In the words of Drummond, “Erasmus was in his own age the
                    apostle of common sense and of rational religion. He did not care for dogma, and
                    accordingly the dogmas of Rome, which had the consent of the Christian world,
                    were in his eyes preferable to the dogmas of Protestantism From the beginning to
                    the end of his career he remained true to the purpose of his life, which was to
                    fight the battle of sound learning and plain common sense against the powers of
                    ignorance and superstition, and amid all the convulsions of that period he never
                    once lost his mental balance.”</p>
                <p>Erasmus is accused of indifference. But he was far from indifferent to the
                    progress of the revolution. He was keenly alive to its pernicious influence on
                    the cherished interest of his life, the cause of learning. “I abhor the
                    evangelics, because it is through them that literature is everywhere declining,
                    and upon the point of perishing.” <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n535/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0535-0516"/> He had been born with the hopes of the
                    Renaissance, with its anticipation of a new Augustan age, and had seen this fair
                    promise blighted by the irruption of a new horde of theological polemics, worse
                    than the old scholastics, inasmuch as they were revolutionary instead of
                    conservative. Erasmus never flouted at religion nor even at theology as such,
                    but only at blind and intemperate theologians.</p>
                <p>But though Erasmus while lashing theologians respected theology, he did not
                    cultivate it. He barely acquiesced in church dogma without being compelled to
                    investigate it. His mind had no metaphysical inclination; he was a man of
                    letters, with a general tendency to rational views on every subject which came
                    under his pen. His was not the mind to originate, like Calvin, a new scheme of
                    Christian thought. He is at his weakest in defending free will against Luther,
                    and indeed he can hardly be said to enter on the metaphysical question. He
                    treats the dispute entirely from the outside. It is impossible in reading
                    Erasmus not to be reminded of the rationalist of the 18th century. Erasmus has
                    been called the “Voltaire of the Renaissance.” . But there is a vast difference
                    in the relations in which they respectively stood to the church and to
                    Christianity. Voltaire, though he did not originate, yet adopted a moral and
                    religious scheme which he sought to substitute for the church tradition. He
                    waged war, not only against the clergy, but against the church and its
                    sovereigns Erasmus drew the. line at the first of these. He was not an
                    anticipation of the 18th century; he was the man of his age, as Voltaire of his;
                    though Erasmus did not intend it, he undoubtedly shook the ecclesiastical
                    edifice in all its parts; and, as Melchior Adamus says of him, “pontifici Romano
                    plus nocuit jocando, quam Lutherus stomachando.”</p>
                <p>But if Erasmus was unlike the 18th century rationalist in that he did not declare
                    war against the church, but remained a Catholic and mourned the disruption, he
                    was yet a true rationalist in principle. The principle that reason is the one
                    only guide of life, the supreme arbiter of all questions, politics and religion
                    included, has its earliest and most complete exemplar in Erasmus. He does not
                    dogmatically denounce the rights of reason, but he practically exercises them.
                    Along with the charm of style, the great attraction of the writings of Erasmus
                    is this unconscious freedom by which they are pervaded.</p>
                <p>It must excite our surprise that one who used his pen so freely should have
                    escaped the pains and penalties which invariably overtook minor offenders in the
                    same kind. For it was not only against the clergy and the monks that he kept up
                    a ceaseless stream of satiric raillery; he treated nobles, princes, and kings,
                    with equal freedom. No 18th century republican has used stronger language than
                    has this pensioner of Charles V. “The people build cities, princes pull them
                    down; the industry of the citizens creates wealth for rapacious lords to
                    plunder; plebeian magistrates pass good laws for kings to violate; the people
                    love peace, and their rulers stir up war.” Such outbursts are frequent in one of
                    his most popular books, <hi rend="italic">The</hi><hi rend="italic">Adagia.</hi>
                    These freedoms are part cause of Erasmus’s popularity. He was here in sympathy
                    with the secret sore of his age, and gave utterance to what all felt but none
                    dared to whisper but he. It marks the difference between 1513 and 1669 that, in
                    a reprint of the <hi rend="italic">Juliτιs</hi><hi rend="italic">Exclusus</hi>
                    published in 1669 at Oxford, it was thought necessary to leave out a sentence in
                    which the writer of that dialogue, supposed by the editor to be Erasmus, asserts
                    the right of states to deprive and punish bad kings. It is difficult to say to
                    what we are to ascribe his immunity from painful consequences. We have to
                    remember that he was removed from the scene early (1536) in the reaction, before
                    force was fully organized for the suppression of the revolution. And his popular
                    works, <hi rend="italic">The Adagιa</hi> (1500), <hi rend="italic">The
                    Colloquies</hi> (1521), had established themselves as standard books in the more
                    easy going age, when power, secure in its unchallenged strength, could afford to
                    laugh with the laughers at itself. At the date of his death (1536), the Catholic
                    revival, with its fell antipathy to art and letters, was only in its infancy;
                    and when times became dangerous, Erasmus cautiously declined to venture out of
                    the protection of the empire, refusing repeated invitations to Italy and to
                    France. “I had thought of going to Besançon,” he said, “ne non essem in ditione
                    Caesaris” <hi rend="italic">(Ep.</hi> 1299). In Italy a Bembo and a Sadoleto
                    wrote a purer Latin than Erasmus, but contented themselves with pretty phrases,
                    and were careful to touch no living chord of feeling. In France it was necessary
                    for a Rabelais to hide his free-thinking under a disguise of revolting and
                    unintelligible jargon. It was only in the empire that such liberty of speech as
                    Erasmus used was practicable, and in the empire Erasmus passed for a moderate
                    man. Upon the strength of an established character for moderation he enjoyed an
                    exceptional licence for the utterance of unwelcome truths; and in spite of his
                    flings at the rich and powerful, he remained through life a privileged person
                    with them. No noble except Eppendorf, young and crack-brained, ever attempted to
                    call him seriously to account for his gibes.</p>
                <p>But though the men of the keys and the sword let him go his way unmolested, it
                    was otherwise with his brethren of the pen. A man who is always launching
                    opinions must expect to be retorted on. And when these judgments were winged by
                    epigram, and weighted by the name of Erasmus, who stood at the head of letters,
                    a wide-spread exasperation was the consequence. Mr Disraeli has not noticed
                    Erasmus in his <hi rend="italic">Quarrels of Authors,</hi> perhaps because
                    Erasmus’s quarrels would require a volume to themselves. “So thin-skinned that a
                    fly would draw blood,” as the prince of Carpi expressed it, he could not himself
                    restrain his pen from sarcasm. He forgot that though it is safe to lash the
                    dunces, he could not with equal impunity sneer at those who, though they might
                    not have the ear of the public as he had, could yet contradict and call names.
                    And when literary jealousy was complicated with theological differences, as in
                    the case of the free-thinkers, or with French vanity, as in that of Budaeus, the
                    cause of the enemy was espoused by a party and a nation. The quarrel with
                    Budaeus was strictly a national one. Cosmopolitan as Erasmus was, to the French
                    literati he was still the Teuton. Dolet calls him “enemy of Cicero, and jealous
                    detractor of the French name.” The only contemporary name which could approach
                    to a rivalry with his was that of Budaeus (Budé), who was exactly contemporary,
                    having been born in the same year as Erasmus. Rivals in fame, they were unlike
                    in accomplishment, each having the quality which the other wanted. Budaeus,
                    though a Frenchman, knew Greek well; Erasmus, though a Dutchman, very
                    imperfectly. But the Frenchman Budaeus wrote an execrable Latin style,
                    unreadable then as now, while the Teuton Erasmus charmed the reading world with
                    a style which, though far from good Latin, ⅛ the most delightful which the
                    Renaissance has left us.</p>
                <p>The style of Erasmus is, considered as Latin, incorrect, sometimes even
                    barbarous, and far removed ' from any classical model. But it has qualities far
                    above purity. The best Italian Latin is but an echo and an imitation; like the
                    painted glass which we put in our churches, it is an anachronism. Bembo,
                    Sadoleto, and the rest write purely in a dead language. Erasmus’s Latin was a
                    living and spoken tongue. Though Erasmus had passed nearly all his life in
                    England, France, and Germany, he spoke not one of those three languages. His
                    conversation was Latin; and the language in which he talked about <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n536/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0536-0517"/> common things he wrote. Hence the spontaneity and
                    naturalness of his page, its flavour of life and not of books. He writes from
                    himself, and not out of Cicero. Hence, too, he spoiled nothing by anxious
                    revision in terror lest some phrase not of the golden age should escape from his
                    pen. Ho confesses apologetically to Longolius <hi rend="italic">(Ep.</hi> 402)
                    that it was his habit to extemporize all he wrote, and that this habit was
                    incorrigible; “effundo verius quam scribo omnia ’’ But he was quite alive to the
                    beauty of the Ciceronian periods of Bembo, Sadoleto, and Julius von Pflug, whom
                    he calls “the three happiest stylists of our day” <hi rend="italic">(Ep.</hi>
                    1370), and “would learn to imitate them, but he is too old.” He complains that
                    much reading of the works of St Jerome had spoiled his Latin; but, as Scaliger
                    says <hi rend="italic">(Scalig</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> a</hi> 2 <hi rend="superscript"> α</hi>), “Erasmus’s language is
                    better than St Jerome’s.” The same critic, however, thought Erasmus would have
                    done better “if he had kept more closely to the classical models.”</p>
                <p>In the annals of classical learning Erasmus may be regarded as constituting an
                    intermediate stage between the humanists of the Latin Renaissance and the
                    learned men of the age of Greek scholarship, between Polιtiano and Joseph
                    Scaliger. Erasmus, though justly styled by Muretus <hi rend="italic">(Varr.
                    Lectt.</hi> 7, 15), “eruditus sane vir, acmultae lectionis,” was not a “learned”
                    man in the special sense of the word,— not an “érudit.” He was more than this;
                    he was the “man of letters,”—he first who had appeared in Europe since the fall
                    of the Roman empire. His acquirements were vast, and they were all brought to
                    bear upon the life of his day. He did not make a study apart of antiquity for
                    its own sake, but used it as an instrument of culture. He did not worship,
                    imitate, and reproduce the classics, like the Latin humanists who preceded him;
                    he did not master them and reduce them to a special science, as did the French
                    Hellenists who succeeded him. He edited many authors, it is true, but he had
                    neither the means of forming a text, nor did he attempt to do so. In editing a
                    father, or a classic, he had in view the practical utility of the general
                    reader, not the accuracy required by the guild of scholars. “His Jerome,” says
                    J. Scaliger, “is full of sad blunders” <hi rend="italic">(Scalig</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> α,</hi> 2“). Even Julien Garnier could discover that
                    Erasmus “falls in his haste into grierous error in his Latin version of St
                    Basil, though his Latinity is superior to that of the other translators” (Pref,
                    in <hi rend="italic">Opp. St Bas.,</hi> 1721). It must be remembered that the
                    commercial interests of Froben’s press led to the introduction of Erasmus’s name
                    on many a title page when he had little to do with the book, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g,</hi> the Latin <hi rend="italic">Josephus</hi> of 1534, to which Erasmus
                    only contributed one translation of 14 pages; or the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aristotle</hi> of 1531, of which Simon Grynaeus seems to have been the real
                    editor. Where Erasmus excelled was in prefaces,—not philological introductions
                    to each author, but spirited appeals to the interest of the general reader,
                    showing how an ancient book might be made to minister to modern spiritual
                    demands.</p>
                <p>It has been the fate of Erasmus, as of so many great writers, to be best known to
                    posterity by one of his slightest works. Those who have read nothing else of
                    Erasmus have read his <hi rend="italic">Colloquies.</hi> And a wider circle
                    still, who would not care to read the text of the <hi rend="italic">Praise of
                    Folly,</hi> know of the book, because of the Holbein illustrations, which have
                    preserved in general remembrance a Latin <hi rend="italic">jeual'-esprit</hi>
                    which would otherwise have only been consulted by the curious. But Erasmus
                    himself complained of « the caprice of fortune,” which had made his <hi
                    rend="italic">Colloquies</hi> his most popular work, a “book full of foolish
                    things, bad Latin, and solecisms” <hi rend="italic">(Ep. adBotzj).
                    ΥheEncomiumMοriee</hi> (Praise of Folly) was composed during his journey from
                    Italy, and written out from his notes in seven days during his stay in Thomas
                    More’s house in London. It was not destined for publication, but a copy found
                    its way into the hands of the printers Badius at Paris, and came out in 1512,
                    Within a few months seven editions were called for, and Froben’s reprint of
                    1515, consisting of 1800 copies, was sold in a few weeks. Milton, in 1628,
                    speaks of it as being “in every one’s hands” at Cambridge.</p>
                <p>Of Erasmus’s works, mostly hasty pamphlets, squibs, or personal explanations, two
                    are chiefly memorably— <hi rend="italic">The</hi><hi rend="italic">Adagia</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">The Greek Testament.</hi> The first edition of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Adagia</hi> (Paris, 1500) was only the germ of the book afterwards
                    known under that title. This first edition contained 800 proverbs. The last
                    edition in Erasmus’s life-time, 1536, has more than 4000. Duplessis <hi
                    rend="italic">(Bibliogr. parernf)</hi> enumerates 49 editions of the original
                    work, adding that his list is not complete; and he does not mention the numerous
                    abridgments. It is a mere commonplace-book, or compilation out of the Greek and
                    Latin classics. The Italian fine writers (Muretus) sneered at it as “rudis
                    indigestaque moles.” But it was just what the public wanted, a manual of the wit
                    and wisdom of the ancient world for the use of the modern. The collection -was
                    enlivened by commentary in Erasmus’s finest vein. Yet so established was the
                    book in the hands of the public that the Council of Trent, unable to suppress
                    it, and not daring to overlook it, ordered the preparation of a castrated
                    edition.</p>
                <p>Of Erasmus’s Greek Testament the same must be said, viz., that it has no title to
                    be considered as a work of learning or scholarship, yet that its influence upon
                    opinion was profound and durable. It contributed more to the liberation of the
                    human mind from the thraldom of the clergy than all the uproar and rage of
                    Luther’s many pamphlets. As an edition of the Greek Testament it has no critical
                    value. But it was the first <hi rend="italic">(Editio Princeps,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Basileoe</hi><hi rend="italic">ap. Jo. Frobenium,</hi> 1516,
                    folio), and it revealed the fact that the Vulgate, the Bible of the church, was
                    not only a second-hand document, but in places an erroneous document. A shock
                    was thus given to the credit of the clergy in the province of literature, equal
                    to that which was given in the province of science by the astronomical
                    discoveries of the 17th century. Even if Erasmus had had at his disposal the
                    MSS. subsidia for forming a text, he had not the critical skill required to use
                    them. He had at hand two late Basel MSS., which he sent straight to press,
                    correcting them in places by two others. In four subsequent reprints, 1519,
                    1522,1527, 1535, Erasmus gradually weeded out the many typographical errors of
                    his first edition, but the text remained essentially such as he had first
                    printed it. The Greek text indeed was but a subordinate part of his scheme. The
                    principal object of the volume was the new Latin version, the original being
                    placed alongside as a guarantee of the translator’s good faith. This
                    translation, with the justificatory notes which accompanied it, though not
                    itself a work of critical scholarship, became the starting-point of modern
                    exegetical science. Erasmus did nothing to solve the problem, but to him belongs
                    the honour of having first propounded it.</p>
                <p>For an account of the attacks which this publication brought on its author, as
                    well as for a notice of his many literary and other controversies, the reader
                    must be referred to some of the special lives of Erasmus. And no man of letters
                    has had more numerous biographers. Beatus Rhenanus prefixed a brief, but
                    pregnant, memoir to his edition of the <hi rend="italic">Opera,</hi> Basileae,
                    1540. The common foundation of all the modern compilations on the life of
                    Erasmus is the sketch which Le Clerc, while he was superintending the Leyden
                    edition of the works, drew up, and published in the <hi rend="italic"

                    and writings of Erasmus, though not even superficially versed in the literary
                    history of the 16th century. He rarely ventures beyond the text of Erasmus and
