                    Baron</hi></label> (1750- 1818), chief-justice of the Court of King’s Bench, was
                    born on the 16th November 1750, at Great Salkeld, in Cumberland, of which place
                    his father, afterwards bishop of Carlisle, was at the time rector. Educated at
                    the Charterhouse school and at St Peter’s College, Cambridge, he passed as third
                    wrangler, and was soon afterwards elected to a fellowship at Trinity. In spite
                    of his father’s strong wish that he should take orders, he chose the legal
                    profession, and on quitting the university was entered at Lincoln’s Inn. After
                    spending five years as a “special pleader under the bar,” he was called to the
                    bar in 1780. He chose the Northern Circuit, and in a very short time obtained a
                    lucrative practice and a high reputation. In 1787 he was appointed principal
                    counsel for Warren Hastings in the celebrated impeachment trial before the House
                    of Lords, and the ability with which he conducted the defence was universally
                    recognized. He had commenced his political career as a Whig, but, like many
                    others, he saw in the French Revolution a reason for changing sides, and became
                    a supporter of Pitt. On the formation of the Addington ministry in 1801, he was
                    appointed attorneygeneral, and in the following year he succeeded Lord Kenyon as
                    chief-justice of the King’s Bench. On being raised to the bench he was created a
                    peer, taking his title from the village of Ellenborough in Cumberland, where his
                    maternal ancestors had long held a small patrimony. In 1806, on the formation of
                    Lord Grenville’s ministry “of all the talents,” Lord Ellenborough declined the
                    offer of the Great Seal, but accepted a seat in the Cabinet. His doing so while
                    he retained the chief-justiceship was much criticised at the time, and, though
                    not without precedent, is open to obvious objections on constitutional grounds.
                    As a judge he had grave faults, though his decisions displayed profound legal
                    knowledge, and in mercantile law especially were reckoned of high authority. He
                    waβ harsh and overbearing to counsel, and in the political trials which were so
                    frequent in his time showed an unmistakable bias against the accused. In the
