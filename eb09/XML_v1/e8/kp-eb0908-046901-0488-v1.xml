                <p><label type="entry">EPHORL</label> This name, which exactly corresponds with the
                    Greek <hi rend="italic">episkopos,</hi> meaning <hi rend="italic">bishop</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">overseer,</hi> was given to certain magistrates in many Dorian
                    cities of ancient Greece. But the most prominent are the ephors of Sparta, who,
                    whatever may have been their origin, appear during the times for which we have
                    historical knowledge as the supreme power in the state, controlling alike its
                    civil and military administration. When in the 3d century <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> the complete humiliation of Sparta led the kings Agis III. and
                    Cleomenes III. to resolve on restoring what they supposed to be the ancient
                    constitution, theiF first blow was directed at the ephors, whom they charged
                    with deliberate usurpation. According to their version (Plut., <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cleom.</hi> 10) the ephors owed their existence to the Messenian wars, which
                    rendered necessary the prolonged absence of the kings, who accordingly delegated
                    to them their judicial functions; and the subordinate powers thus given were
                    gradually extended until they became virtually absolute. Another tradition
                    ascribed the institution of the ephors to Lycurgus himself. But if of Lycurgus
                    we cannot be said to know anything, the lays of Tyrtaeus, which alone give us
                    any trustworthy information about the Messenian wars, say nothing as to the
                    origin of the ephoralty. We can, therefore do no more than trace the development
                    of their powers during the ages for which we have genuine historical
                    narratives.</p>
                <p>Holding the country strictly as an army of occupation, the whole body of Spartans
                    was formed internally into a close oligarchy, all the members of which had the
                    same privileges and were subjected to the same discipline, with the exception of
                    the kings and the ephors. But the two Heraclid kings, as representing the two
                    rival sons of Aristodemus, generally held each the other in check, and thuβ
                    added to the influence of the ephors. That the latter were originally
                    subordinate is made plain by the statement of Xenophon <hi rend="italic">{De
                    Rep. Lac.,</hi> 15), that there was still in his time a monthly interchange of
                    oaths, by which the kings pledged themselves to govern according to the laws,
                    while the ephors on this condition undertook to maintain their authority. The
                    ceremony had in Xenophon’s days lost its meaning; but it pointed clearly to a
                    time when the kings had been predominant. It further shows that from the first
                    the ephors represented the whole body of the citizens; and the mode of electing
                    them, which Aristotle ridicules as childish, attests their popular character.
                    The general assembly might choose any one for the office, without any
                    qualification of age or property, and without scrutiny. The restriction of their
                    number to five had reference to the <hi rend="italic">polis</hi> or city of
                    Sparta, and the four hamlets which with it formed the stronghold of the Spartan
                    oligarchy.</p>
                <p>In their relations with the kings we find the ephors gradually acquiring greater
                    weight, and exercising their power more decisively. Herodotus (vi. 56) speaks of
                    the kings as still possessing the power of declaring war at their own will. But
                    in the wars of which we have historical knowledge, not only is the decision
                    given by the ephors, who may or may not have taken counsel with the senate and
                    the assembly, but two of their number accompany the kings, who thus become
                    simply leaders of the army, acting under the control of civil magistrates,
                    until, after the unsuccessful expedition of King Agis against Argos in 417 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> a law was passed appointing teu commissioners to
                    attend the kings in all their campaigns. The ephors were still further
                    distinguished from all other citizens by the privilege of exemption from the
                    public discipline. They also kept their seats on the approach of the kings,
                    while custom required the latter to rise if the ephors passed by. In the
                    relations of Sparta with foreign states generally we find the public business
                    carried on not by the kings but by the ephors, who treat with ambassadors,
                    determine the number of troops to be levied, decide on their destination, and
                    conclude treaties.</p>
                <p>Of the five ephors, the first in rank, probably as being the first elected, gave
                    his name to the year, like the Archon Eponymus at Athens. The whole college met
                    in the Archeion, which answered to the Athenian Prytaneion. They exercised
                    jurisdiction in all important civil suits, criminal cases and capital offences
                    being carried before the senate. With this jurisdiction they combined a large
                    censorial power, which extended even to minute details in the life of the
                    citizens. Their right of scrutiny into the conduct of magistrates they could
                    exercise even during their term of office. Not only could they depose such as
                    they found unworthy, but they might summon the kings before their tribunal, or
                    bring a capital charge against them before the Spartan assembly. With the
                    gradual slackening of the system of public discipline, and with the increasing
                    licence which their position enabled them to assume, their power became an
                    intolerable burden, at least to the kings; and Cleomenes cut the knot by
                    massacring the whole college, and abolishing the office.</p>
