                <p><label type="entry">ELIOT, <hi rend="smallcaps">Johx</hi></label> (1604-1690),
                    “the Apostle of the Indians of North America,” was born at Nasing, in Essex, in
                    1604, and was educated at Jesus College, Cambridge, where he took his bachelor’s
                    degree in 1623. He there displayed a partiality for philology which may have had
                    some influence in stimulating the zeal he afterwards displayed m acquiring the
                    language of the native Indians. After leaving the university he was employed as
                    an usher in a school near Chelmsford under the Rev. Thomas Hooker. While in the
                    family of Mr Hooker, Eliot received serious impressions, and resolved to devote
                    himself to the work of the Christian ministry. As there was then no field for
                    nonconformist preachers in England, he resolved to emigrate <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n146/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0146-0137"/> to America, where he arrived on the 3d of
                    November 1631. After officiating for a year in the first church in Boston, he
                    was in November 1632 appointed pastor of the church in Roxbury, where he
                    continued till his death.</p>
                <p>When Eliot began his mission work there were about twenty tribes of Indians
                    within the bounds of the plantation of Massachusetts Bay, and for a long time he
                    assiduously employed himself in learning their language. He obtained the
                    assistance of a young Indian taken prisoner in the Pequot war of 1637, and who
                    had been put to service with a Dorchester planter. With his help Eliot
                    translated the Commandments, the Lord’s Prayer, and many Scripture texts, and at
                    length <hi rend="smallcaps">avis</hi> able to preach to the Indians in their own
                    language. This he did without the aid of an interpreter in 1646, at a place a
                    few miles from Cambridge, afterwards called Nonantum or Noonatomen, i.e.,
                    “Rejoicing,” where a settlement of Christian Indians was subsequently
                    established.</p>
                <p>The labours of Eliot, being reported in England, excited great attention, and a
                    society, afterwards incorporated, was instituted for the propagation of the
                    gospel in New England. Among its leading members was the Hon. Robert Boyle, well
                    known by his scientific labours, who was one of Eliot’s constant correspondents.
                    From the fundä of this corporation an allowance of £50 per annum was paid to
                    Eliot in supplement of his moderate salary of £60 as minister of Roxbury.</p>
                <p>In 1651 a town called Natick, or “Place of Hills,” was founded by the Christian
                    Indians, mainly through the instrumentality of Eliot, for which he drew up a set
                    of civil and economical regulations. He also in 1653, at the charge of the
                    corporation, published a catechism for their use. This was the first work
                    published in the Indian language; no copy of it is known to exist. In the same
                    year there was published by the corporation in London a work called Teares of
                    Repentance, or a further Progress of the Gospel among the Indians of New
                    England, in which there was given “A Brief Relation of the Proceedings of the
                    Lord’s Work among the Indians, in reference unto their Church-estate, by John
                    Eliot.”</p>
                <p>In 1655 there was published in London by the corpora tiυn a tract entitled A
                    Later and Further Manifestation of the Progress of the Gospel amongst the
                    Indians in New England, declaring their Constant Love and Zeal to the Truth,
                    &lt;L∙c., being a Narrative of the Examinations of the Indians about their
                    Knowledge in Religion by the Elders of the Church, related by Mr John Eliot.
                    This work contained the confessions of those Indians that were baptized by Eliot
                    and admitted to church fellowship. In 1660 Eliot drew upon himself some
                    animadversion by the publication at London of a work called 7⅛β Christian
                    Commonwealth: or the Civil Policy of the rising Kingdom of Jesus Christ, which
                    was found to contain seditious principles, especially directed against the
                    Government of England. The statements, however, made in this book were
                    afterwards retracted by its author.</p>
                <p>About this time Eliot completed his task of translating the Bible into the Indian
                    language. The corporation in London supplied the funds, and the New Testament in
                    Indian was issued in 1661, shortly after the restoration of Charles I f. It
                    happened that the printing of the work was completed when the corporation was
                    expecting a royal charter. A dedication to the king was accordingly inserted,
                    written in a tone calculated to win his favour It stated that the Old Testament
                    was in the press, and it craved the “royal assistance for the perfecting
                    thereof.” The Old Testament was at length published in 1663. Copies of the New
                    Testament were bound with it, and thus the whole Bible was completed in the
                    Indian language. To it were added a catechism, and the Psalms of David in Indian
                    verse. The title of this Bible, which is now of great rarity, and fetches a very
                    high price, is Mamussce Wunneetupαnatamιve Up-Biblum God naneeswe Nukkoηe
                    Testament kah wonk Wιιsku Testament—Ne quoshkiηnumηk ηαshpe Wuttinneumoh Christ
                    noh asoowesit John Eliot; literally translated:—“The whole Holy his-Bible God,
                    both Old Testament and also New Testament. This turned by the-servant-of-Christ,
                    who recalled John Eliot.” This Indian version of the Scriptures was printed at
                    Cambridge (U.S.) by Samuel Green and Marmaduke Johnson, and was the first Bible
                    printed in America.</p>
                <p>In 1680 another edition of the New Testament was published; and in 1685 the
                    second edition of the Old Testament appeared. This last was bound up with the
                    second impression of the New Testament, and the two parts form the second
                    edition of the whole Bible. It was dedicated “To the Hon. Robert Boyle, the
                    Governour, and tu the Company for the Propagation of the Gospel,” &amp;c., and
                    is, like the first edition, a work of great rarity. Eliot received valuable
                    assistance in preparing this edition from the Rev. John Cotton of Plymouth
                    (U.S.), who had also spent much labour in obtaining a thorough knowledge of the
                    Indian language. A new edition of the Indian Bible was printed in 1822 at Boston
                    by P. S. Du Ponceau and J. Pickering.</p>
                <p>Besides his translation of the Bible, Eliot published at Cambridge (U.S.) in 1664
                    a translation of Baxter’s Call to the Unconverted, of which a second edition was
                    issued in 1688. In 1665 he published an abridged translation of Bishop Bayly’s
                    Practice of Piety, and a second edition in 1685. His well known Indian Grammar
                    Begun was written in the winter of 1664, his sons assisting in the work, and was
                    printed at Cambridge (U.S.) in 1666. At the end of this book are these memorable
                    words,—“Prayers and pains, through faith in Jesus Christ, will do anything.” The
                    grammar was reprinted in 1822, with notes by Pickering and Du Ponceau, in the
                    Collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society, vol. ix. The Indian Primer;
                    or the Way of Training up of our Indian Youth in the Good Knowledge of God; by
                    J. E., was printed at Cambridge (U.S.) in 1669. It comprises an exposition of
                    the Lord’s Prayer and a translation of the Larger Catechism in Indian. A reprint
                    of this work, from the only complete copy known to exist, preserved in the
                    library of the university of Edinburgh, was published, under the editorial
                    superintendence of Mr John Small, in 1877.</p>
                <p>In 1671 Eliot printed in English a little volume entitled Indian Dialogues,for
                    their Instruction in that Great Service of Christ in Calling Home their
                    Countrymen to the Knowledge of God and of themselves. This was followed in 1672
                    by The Logick Primer; some Logical Notions to Initiate the Indians in the
                    Knowledge of the Rule of Reason, &amp;c. These two volumes, printed at Cambridge
                    (U.S.), arc extremely rare. Of the former, the only known copy exists in a
                    private library in New York. A copy of the Logick Primer is preserved in the
                    British Museum, and another in the Bodleian.</p>
                <p>In 1611 a small tract of eleven pages was published at London, called A Brief
                    Narrative of the Progress of the Gospel among the Indians in New England in the
                    Year 1670 Given in by the Rev. Mr John Eliot, Minister of the Gospel there, in a
                    Letter by him directed to the Right Worshipful the Commissioners under His
                    Majesty's Great Seal for the Propagation of the Gospel amongst the Poor Blind
                    Natives in those United Colonies. This was possibly one of the publications of
                    the corporation after their charter was renewed by Charles II.; it is of extreme
                    rarity.</p>
                <p>In his old age the pen of Eliot was not idle. In 1678 he published The Harmony of
                    the Gospels in the Holy History of the Humiliation and Sufferings of Jesus
                    Christ <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n147/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0147-0138"/> from his Incarnation to his Death and Burial.
                    This work, which was printed at Boston, is a life of our Saviour with many
                    illustrative and practical remarks. The last of his publications was his
                    translation into Indian of Shepard’s Sincere Convert, which he had nearly
                    completed in 1664; this was revised by Grindal Rawson and printed in 1689.</p>
                <p>Eliot died at Roxbury on the 20th of May 1 690, at the age of eighty-six. He was
                    acknowledged to have been a man whose simplicity of life and manners, and
                    evangelical sweetness of temper, had won for him all hearts, whether in the
                    villages of the emigrants or in the smoky huts of the natives of New
                    England.</p>
                <p>His translation of the Bible and other works composed for the use of the Indians
                    are written in the Mohican dialect, which was spoken by the aborigines of New
                    England. By Eliot and others it was called the Massachusetts language. Although
                    it is no longer read, the works printed in it are valuable for the information
                    they furnish as to the structure and character of the unwritten dialects of
                    barbarous nations. <hi rend="smallcaps">(j. sm.)</hi></p>
