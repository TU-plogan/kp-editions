                    the diarist and author of <hi rend="italic">Sylva,</hi> was born at his father’s
                    seat at Wotton, in Surrey, on the 31st October 1620. He was the younger son of a
                    country gentleman of large estate, and much respected throughout the counties of
                    Surrey and Sussex, of which he was high sheriff, one high sheriff at that time
                    serving for both counties. Notwithstanding the wealth and position of his
                    family, John Evelyn was educated at the free school of Lewes, where his maternal
                    grandfather resided. While still at school, he was admitted into the Inner
                    Temple; and in the following month, at the age of sixteen, he entered Balliol
                    College, Oxford, as a fellow-commoner. In July 1641, having lost his father
                    during the previous year, he retired from England, which was then on the eve of
                    civil war. Before proceeding with his travels, he⅞xpressed his sympathy with the
                    cause of the queen of Bohemia, which was dear to all Protestant Englishmen, by
                    serving in her army for a few days, “according to the compliment.” The ten
                    following years he spent abroad, only making brief visits to England.</p>
                <p>It is with this period of travel that his famous <hi rend="italic">Diary,</hi>
                    which he had commenced in imitation of his father at eleven years of age, begins
                    to be full and interesting. This diary is for many reasons of value to the
                    student of history and manners. It comprises the long period, so rich in great
                    events, between the outbreak of <pb break="no"

                    with no thought of publication, it embodies the frankest expression of its
                    author’s opinions, and affords much curious and interesting information which
                    the historian would have probably passed over, .but which throws a strong light
                    upon the customs and feelings of the age. And Evelyn’s statements are always
                    worthy of at least a respectful hearing. In an age of fiercest political and
                    ecclesiastical conflict, himself subject to strong temptations to partisanship,
                    he maintained throughout life the same calm temperance of judgment; and, amid
                    general profligacy, the purity and integrity of his character remained
                    unstained. The competence of his fortune and the moderation of his ambition
                    rendered him politically independent. His attachment to monarchy did not blind
                    him to the vices of kings. Though an earnest Protestant and a firm Episcopalian,
                    he did not allow himself to be carried away into the extravagant bigotry so
                    common among his contemporaries; he deprecated the persecution of the Protestant
                    dissenters, and though he wrote against the Jesuits, he refused to join in the
                    mad hatred with which all who professed the Roman Catholic faith were popularly
                    regarded.</p>
                <p>In 1652 Evelyn returned home with his wife, the amiable and talented daughter of
                    Sir Richard Browne, and settled at Say es Court, the house afterwards famous as
                    the residence of Peter the Great. Though well known to be a royalist, he was not
                    molested, except on one occasion, when he was arrested by a party of fanatic
                    soldiers for observing Christmas Day, but, nothing else being proved against
                    him, was at once released. On the death of Cromwell, he published an <hi
                    rend="italic">Apology for the Royal Party,</hi> and tried in vain to persuade
                    Colonel Morley to declare for Charles II. From the Restoration till his death in
                    1706 he enjoyed unbroken court favour. In the reign of James IL, during the
                    absence of the earl of Clarendon in Ireland, he acted as one of the
                    commissioners of the Privy Seal, and honourably distinguished himself by
                    refusing, at the risk of offending the king, to sign an illegal licence of
                    popish books. But, with this exception, he never accepted an office of political
                    importance. His life, however, was filled with useful work. He was commissioner
                    for improving the streets and buildings of London, for ‘ charitable uses” (7.e.,
                    for examining into the affairs of charitable institutions), and for taking care
                    of the wounded who were brought home during the Dutch war, commissioner of the
                    mint, commissioner of trado and plantations, &amp;c. His love of scimce led to
                    his being chosen secretary of the Royal Society, and he twice declined the
                    presidency. It was through his influence that the Arundelian marbles and the
                    library and MSS. of the earl of Arundel were presented to the university of
                    Oxford, a service which the university recognized by conferring upon him the
                    degree of D.C.L. His writings were exceedingly numerous. The best known were his
                    <hi rend="italic">Diary</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Sylva,</hi> an elaborate
                    treatise on arboriculture. Among the others may be mentioned <hi rend="italic"
                    >Navigation and Commerce, their Original and Progreess,</hi> intended as an
                    introduction to a history of the Dutch war, which he both commenced and laid
                    aside at the command of Charles IL; <hi rend="italic">a Parallel of Ancient and
                    Modern Architecture; Public Employment preferred to Solitude;</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">The History of the Four Great Impostors.</hi> The first collection
                    of Evelyn’s miscellaneous writings, several of which had been published
                    anonymously, appeared in 1825, printed in facsimile, and edited by W.
                    Upcott.</p>
