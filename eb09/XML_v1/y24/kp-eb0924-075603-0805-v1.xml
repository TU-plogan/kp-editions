                    one of the most remarkable figures alike in literature and science in the
                    beginning of the 19th century in Great Britain. He belonged to a Quaker family
                    of Milverton, Somerset, and was the youngest of ten children, having been born
                    on 13th June 1773. His precocity, especially in the acquirement of languages,
                    was remarkable, being little <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n806/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0806-0757"/> inferior to that of Sir W. Rowan Hamilton. But
                    his thirst for knowledge was unlimited in its range. He was not content with
                    languages, mathematics, and physical science: natural science, medicine, and
                    even ancient philosophy were eagerly studied by him; and he was passionately
                    devoted to athletic exercises. His medical studies were pursued successively in
                    London, Edinburgh, Göttingen, and finally at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where
                    he took his doctor’s degree. The death of a maternal uncle put him in a position
                    of comfortable independence, and he did not heartily enter upon practice. He was
                    secured in 1802 by the Royal Institution as a colleague of Davy and professor of
                    natural philosophy. Here his special talents found ample occupation, and the
                    chief result was the publication in 1807 of his celebrated <hi rend="italic"
                    >Course of Lectures on Natural Philosophy,</hi> a work which is even now
                    regarded as a valuable authority. Some years before he had made his remarkable
                    discovery of the interference of light, and begun that wonderful series of
                    researches which, as completed by Fresnel, secured the triumph of the undulatory
                    theory. He was foreign secretary of the Royal Society for more than a quarter of
                    a century; and it is curious to note that his reputation stood higher in foreign
                    than in home scientific circles. He was one of the eight foreign associates of
                    the Institute of France. He was one of the Commissioners of Weights and
                    Measures, and secretary to the Board of Longitude, which in those days conducted
                    the <hi rend="italic">Nautical Almanac.</hi> A few years before his death he
                    became interested in life assurance, with great benefit to the company whose
                    scientific business he conducted. His death, on 10th May 1829, was probably
                    hastened by the extraordinary amount and variety of the labours he undertook,
                    and the self-sacrificing zeal with which he devoted himself to them.</p>

                    claimed his attention was the decipherment of the Egyptian hieroglyphics, in
