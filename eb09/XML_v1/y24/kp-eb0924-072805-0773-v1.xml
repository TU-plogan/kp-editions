                <p><label type="entry">YARKAND, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Yarkend</hi></label>, the
                    chief town of the principal oasis of East Turkestan, is situated on the
                    Yarkand-Daria, in 38° 25' N. lat. and 77° 16' E. long., at an altitude of about
                    4100 feet above sea-level. The settlements of the Yarkand oasis occupy the
                    south-western corner of East Turkestan, and are scattered along the numerous
                    rivers which issue from the steep slopes of the Pamir in the west, and the
                    Karakorum and Kuen-Lun Mountains in the south. The oasis of Kashgar limits it in
                    the north, and a tract of desert separates it from the oasis of Khotan in the
                    southeast. The Yarkand-Daria and its numerous tributaries, which are fed by the
                    glaciers of the mountain regions, as also many rivers which no longer reach the
                    main stream but are lost in the steppe or amidst the irrigated fields, bring
                    abundance of water to the desert; one of them is called Zerafshan
                    (“gold-strewing”), as much on account of the fertility it brings to the desert
                    as of the small amount of gold discovered in its auriferous sands. Numberless
                    irrigation canals, some of them of considerable length, carry the water of the
                    rivers to the fields, which occupy a broad zone of loess skirting the base of
                    the mountains. Higher up, in the spurs of the mountains, there are rich
                    pasturages, where large numbers of goats, yaks, camels, sheep, and cattle are
                    reared. On the whole, the oasis of Yarkand is regarded as the richest of East
                    Turkestan, and its population probably numbers about 200,000 inhabitants (32,000
                    households in 1873). Wheat, barley, rice, beans, and various oil-yielding plants
                    are grown in the fields, and the gardens supply abundance of melons, grapes,
                    apples, and other fruits. The cotton tree and the mulberry are cultivated in the
                    warmer parts of the oasis. There is no lack of gold, lead, and precious stones
                    in the mountains, though only the first-named is at present extracted. A variety
                    of petty trades are carried on in the towns; Yarkand is renowned for its
                    leather-ware and saddlery. The population consists of Persians, who have almost
                    given up the use of their mother tongue and now speak Turkish, and of Turkish
                    Sarts.</p>
                <p>The town of Yarkand, which has a population of about 60,000 according to Forsyth
                    (5000 houses in the city, and as many in Yanghishar and the suburbs), is very
                    favourably situated on the river of the same name, five days’ journey south-east
                    from Kashgar. It is surrounded by a thick earthen wall, nearly four miles long,
                    with towers in the Chinese style of architecture, and is well watered by
                    numberless canals, which are drawn from the river and, after having irrigated
                    the rich gardens of the city, lead to cisterns in which water is collected for
                    the winter. The square fortress of Yanghishar, which was built by the Chinese,
                    stands within four hundred yards of the walls of the town. The ten mosques and
                    madrasas of Yarkand, although much poorer than those of Bokhara or Samarcand,
                    enjoy a wide renown in the Moslem world. There is a brisk trade, especially in
                    horses, cotton, leather-ware, and all kinds of imported manufactured goods.</p>
                <p>Yarkand is surrounded by a number of smaller towns, the chief of which
                    are—Yanghi-hissar, which has about 600 houses and is the centre of a populous
                    district, Tash-kurgan on the Pamir, now reckoned as belonging to the Russians,
                    Posgam (1600 houses), Kargałyk, at the junction of the routes leading to Ladak
                    and Khotan (2000 houses), Sanju (2000), Tagarchi, Kartchum, Besh-taryk (1800),
                    Guma (3000), and several smaller ones.</p>
                <p>Yarkand was but very imperfectly known until the second half of the 19th century.
                    Marco Polo visited it between 1271 and 1275, and Goes in 1603; but the
                    continuous wars which marked the history of the oasis (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Turkestan,</hi> vol. xxiii. pp. 637-640) prevented Europeans from frequenting
                    it, so that until 1863 the information borrowed from mediaeval travellers and
                    from Chinese sources, along with that supplied by the pandit Mir Isset Ullah in
                    1812, was all that was known about the Yarkand region. The first European who
                    reached it in the 19th century was Adolph Schlagintweit, who passed by Yarkand
                    in August 1857, but was killed a few days later at Kashgar. The pandit Mohammed
                    Hamid visited it in 1863 and determined its geographical position and altitude.
                    The best recent information is due to Robert Shaw<note anchored="true"

                    who stayed at Yarkand in 1869, and to Sir Douglas Forsyth, who first visited it
                    in 1870. Three years later he visited it again with an expedition which had
                    Gordon, Bellew, Chapman, Trotter, Biddulph, and Stoliczka as members, and
                    afterwards published a detailed report upon the scientific results of the
                    mission.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
