                <p><label type="entry">YORK</label>, a northern county of England, is bounded E. by
                    the North Sea, N. by Durham (the boundary line being formed by the Tees), S. by
                    Lincoln, Nottingham, Derby, and Chester, and W. by Lancaster and Westmorland. It
                    is much the largest county in England, being more than double the size of
                    Lincolnshire, which ranks next to it. The area is 3,882,851 acres, or nearly
                    6067 square miles, almost one-eighth of the surface of England. Of the total
                    area 750,828 acres or about 1173 square miles are in the East Riding, 1,361,664
                    acres or about 2127½ square miles in the North Riding, and 1,768,380 acres or
                    about 2763 square miles in the West Riding. The city of York, which forms an
                    administrative division separate from the Ridings, embraces an area of 1979
                    acres or about 3 square miles.</p>
                <p>The marked differences in the geological structure of Yorkshire are reflected in
                    the great variety of its scenery. The stratification is for the most part
                    regular, but owing to a great line of dislocation nearly coincident with the
                    western boundary of the county the rocks dip towards the east, while the strike
                    of the strata is from north to south. The bold and picturesque scenery of the
                    western hills and dales is due to the effects of denudation among the harder
                    rocks, which here come to the surface. A portion of the Pennine chain,
                    stretching from Derbyshire to the Cheviots, runs north and south through
                    Yorkshire, where it has an average breadth of about 30 miles. The strata here
                    consist of (1) Silurian beds, occupying a small area in the north-west corner of
                    the county; (2) the Carboniferous or Mountain Limestone, which has been
                    subjected to great dislocations, the more important of which are known as the
                    North and South Craven faults; (3) the Yoredale series, consisting of shales,
                    flagstones, limestone, and thin seams of coal; and (4) the Millstone Grit,
                    forming part of the hilly moorlands, and capping many of the loftier eminences.
                    In the West Riding the Pennine range forms part of the elevated country of
                    Craven and Dent, with Whernside (2384 feet), Ingleborough (2361), and Penyghent
                    (2270). Towards the east it gradually declines into a series of moorland hills.
                    Mickle Fell in the north-west corner of the county rises to a height of 2581
                    feet. The scenery in the western part of the North Riding is somewhat similar to
                    that in Craven, except that the lower hills are of sharper outline owing to the
                    perpendicular limestone scars. To the intermingling of the limestone with the
                    softer rocks are due the numerous “forces” or waterfalls, which are one of the
                    special features of the scenery of this district, the more remarkable being High
                    Force in Teesdale and Aysgarth Force in Wensleydale. The action of water on the
                    limestone rocks has given rise to extensive caverns, of which the best examples
                    are those of Clapham and Ingleton in the West Riding, as well as to subterranean
                    watercourses. At Brimham, Plumpton, and elsewhere there are curious fantastic
                    masses of rock due to irregular weathering of the Millstone Grit. The Pennine
                    region is bounded on the south-east by the Coal Measures, forming the northern
                    portion of the Derbyshire, Nottingham, and Yorkshire coalfield, which in
                    Yorkshire extends from Sheffield northwards to Leeds. To the east the Measures
                    dip beneath the Permian beds, of which a narrow band crops up from Masham
                    southwards. The Permian strata are overlain to the east by the Trias or New Red
                    Sandstone, which is scarcely ever exposed, but having been partly worn away is
                    covered with Glacial deposits of clay and gravel, forming the low-lying Vale of
                    York, extending from the Tees south to Tadcaster and east beyond York to Market
                    Weighton. Farther east the Triassic beds are overlain by Lias and Oolite. The
                    Lias crops to the surface in a curve extending from Redcar to the Humber. In the
                    Middle Lias there is a seam of valuable iron ore, the source of the prosperity
                    of the Cleveland region. The moorlands extending from Scarborough and Whitby are
                    formed of Liassic strata topped with beds of Lower Oolite, rising gradually to
                    the north-east and attaining at Burton Head a height of 1489 feet, the greatest
                    elevation of the Oolite formation in England. In the bottom bed there is a seam
                    of ironstone, an immense nugget of which, in Rosedale, now nearly all removed,
                    formed at one time a conspicuous cliff. In this district there are a number of
                    picturesque eminences capped by Lower Oolites, and among the eastern slopes of
                    the moorlands there are several charming and fertile valleys. Along the line of
                    the Lower Oolites there is a series of low flat hills, which slope southwards
                    under the clays of the Vale of Pickering. These clays are covered by the Chalk,
                    forming the district of the Wolds, which again dips southwards below the clays
                    and sands of Holderness.</p>
                <p>The coast is not deeply indented at any part, the inlets scarcely deserving the
                    name of bays. Except in the Holderness region, the shore as far north as
                    Saltburn is bold and rocky, and presents a great variety of picturesque cliff
                    scenery, while below the cliffs there are in many cases long stretches of
                    beautiful sands.</p>
                <p>Yorkshire is famed for the beauty of its river scenery, in which respect it is
                    scarcely surpassed by Scotland. The great majority of the rivers issue from the
                    higher western regions and flow eastwards. The Tees, which rises on the <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n796/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0796-0747"/> south-east borders of Cumberland, forms
                    throughout almost its entire length the boundary between Yorkshire and Durham.
                    The Swale rises on the confines of Westmorland, and after a semicircular course
                    by Richmond joins the Ure a few miles below Boroughbridge. This latter river
                    flows in a similar direction some miles south of the Swale through the beautiful
                    Wensleydale, and then past Jervaulx Abbey, Masham, and Ripon. After its junction
                    with the Swale it takes the name of the Ouse, and on being joined by the Nidd
                    passes by York and Selby, beyond which it receives the Aire and the Trent, and
                    finally it falls into the Humber. The Wharfe flows south-eastwards from the
                    Pennine range past Bolton Abbey, Otley, Wetherby, and Tadcaster to the Ouse near
                    Cawood. The Aire rises in full stream from the foot of Malham Cove in Craven,
                    and, flowing past Skipton, Keighley, and Leeds, receives the Calder at
                    Castleford, and falls into the Ouse near Goole. The Ribble flows southwards
                    through the district of Craven into Lancashire. The Don rises in the Penistone
                    moors, and flowing northwards by Sheffield and Doncaster falls into the Ouse
                    near Goole. The Hull flows southwards through the East Riding to the Humber at
                    Hull.</p>
                <p>The county is almost destitute of lakes, the only sheets of water of size
                    sufficient to lay claim to that title being Semmer Water at the upper end of
                    Wensleydale, Malham Tarn at the head of Airedale, and Hornsea Mere near the
                    sea-coast at Hornsea.</p>
                <p>One of the chief sources of the mineral wealth of Yorkshire is the coalfield in
                    the West Riding, the most valuable seams being the Silkstone, which is
                    bituminous and of the very highest reputation as a house coal, and the Barnsley
                    thick coal, the great seam of the Yorkshire coalfield, which is of special
                    value, on account of its semi-anthracitic quality, for use in iron-smelting and
                    in engine furnaces. The average yearly production of the Yorkshire coalfield is
                    nearly twenty million tons, the number of persons employed above and below
                    ground at the coal-pits being over 60,000. Associated with the Upper Coal
                    Measures there is a valuable iron ore, occurring in the form of nodules. Large
                    quantities of fire-clay are also raised, as well as of gannister and oil-shale.
                    In the Middle Lias of the Cleveland district there is a remarkable bed of iron
                    ore, of which the annual production is over six million tons, the greater
                    proportion of the ore being converted into pig-iron in Middlesbrough, by far the
                    most important centre of pig-iron manufacture in the kingdom. Altogether the
                    production of pig-iron in Yorkshire is nearly one-third of that produced in
                    England, and nine-tenths of the produce of Yorkshire belongs to the Cleveland
                    district. Lead ore is obtained in the Yoredale beds of the Pennine range in
                    Wharfedale, Airedale, Niddesdale, Swaledale, Arkendale, and Wensleydale. Slates
                    and flagstones are quarried in the Yoredale rocks. In the Millstone Grit there
                    are several beds of good building stone, but that most largely quarried is the
                    Magnesian Limestone of the Permian series, which, however, is of somewhat
                    variable quality.</p>
                <p>Yorkshire is noted for the number of its mineral springs, chiefly sulphureous and
                    chalybeate, the principal, besides those at Harrogate, being Askern, Aldfield,
                    Boston Spa, Croft, Filey, Guisbrough, Hovingham, and Scarborough.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Agriculture.—</hi> The hilly country in the west of Yorkshire,
                    embracing the north-western corner of the North Riding and a great part of the
                    West Riding, is chiefly pasture land, sheep being grazed on the higher grounds
                    and cattle on the rich pastures where the limestone rock prevails. The Vale of
                    York, with an area of about 1000 square miles, includes much fertile land
                    occupied by all kinds of crops. The Chalk downs by careful cultivation now form
                    one of the best soils for corn crops, the rotation being grasses, wheat,
                    turnips, and barley. The till or boulder clay of Holderness is the richest soil
                    in Yorkshire. A great part of the land in this district has been reclaimed from
                    the sea, from 20,000 to 80,000 acres being protected by embankments. The Vale of
                    Cleveland in the North Riding is well cultivated, the higher grounds in the
                    district being chiefly pastoral. The smallest proportional area under
                    cultivation is in the North Riding, 860,820 acres out of</p>
                <p>1,361,664 in 1887, while in the East Riding there were 666,291 acres out of
                    804,798, and in the West Riding 1,210,639 acres out of 1,716,389. The proportion
                    of permanent pasture is largest in the West Riding, 803,514 acres or about
                    two-thirds of the area under cultivation, while in the North Riding it was
                    488,958 acres or rather more than one-half, and in the East Riding only 191,519
                    acres or considerably less than a third. On the other hand, the area under corn
                    crops in the West Riding was 208,890 acres, in the North Riding 197,846 acres,
                    and in the East Riding 254,162 acres. Wheat in 1887 occupied 66,341 acres in the
                    East Riding, 38,437 in the North, and 58,659 in the West; barley 64,042 in the
                    East, 61,367 in the North, and 54,592 in the West; and oats 101,410 in the East,
                    85,554 in the North, and 81,314 in the West. Rye, beans, and pease occupied
                    comparatively small areas. Liquorice is grown in the neighbourhood of
                    Pontefract. Flax is still grown, but occupies a comparatively small area, only
                    868 acres in 1887. Green crops in the East Riding occupied 110,806 acres
                    (potatoes 12,956, turnips 75,590, mangold 5297, carrots 613, cabbage, &amp;c.,
                    7419, and vetches, &amp;c., 8931), in the North Riding 78,689 (potatoes</p>

                    vetches, &amp;c., 3504), and in the West Riding 99,596 (potatoes 23,044, turnips
                    62,079, mangold 3331, carrots 250, cabbage, &amp;c., 2219, and vetches, &amp;c.,
                    8673). Clover and rotation grasses occupied in the East, North, and West Ridings
                    92,982, 71,846, and 85,075 acres respectively, and fallow land 16,388, 23,460,
                    and 13,141 acres respectively. The areas under orchards in 1887 were—in the East
                    Riding 849 acres, in the North 1015, and in the West 1694, the areas under
                    market gardens being 520, 369, and 2652 acres, under nursery grounds 104, 154,
                    and 807 acres, and under woods (in 1881) 14,480, 49,106, and 66,014 acres
                    respectively. Horses numbered 38,046 (23,508 used for agriculture, 14,538
                    unbroken horses and mares kept solely for breeding) in the East Riding, 40,384
                    (26,026 used for agriculture) in the North Riding, and 53,149 (35,180 used for
                    agriculture) in the West Riding. These horses are only such as are returned by
                    occupiers of land, and do not include the large number used for commercial
                    purposes. The draught horses are generally of a somewhat mixed breed, but the
                    county is famed for its breeds of hunters and of carriage and saddle horses. A
                    breed known as Cleveland bays is much used in London carriages. Horse-racing is
                    a favourite Yorkshire sport, the principal stables being at Malton, Beverley,
                    Doncaster, and Middleham. Cattle in 1887 numbered 86,169 (26,211 cows and
                    heifers) in the East Riding, 162,462 (54,111 cows and heifers) in the North
                    Riding, 264,876 (122,457 cows and heifers) in the West Riding. The breeds of
                    cattle are not much attended to, the custom in the hilly districts, in both the
                    West and the North Riding, being to purchase lean cattle at the northern fairs
                    to fatten for the Lancashire and Yorkshire butchers. The Teeswater breed is,
                    however, on the increase in Yorkshire. In Holderness there is a short-horned
                    breed, chiefly valuable for its milking qualities. Cheese-making is largely
                    carried on in some districts. Sheep in 1887 numbered in the East Riding 429,252,
                    in the North Riding 638,320, and in the West Riding 646,809. The Leicester, the
                    Lincoln, and the South Down, and crosses between the Cheviot and Leicester, are
                    perhaps the most common breeds. The old Wolds sheep have also been improved by
                    crossing with Leicesters. The total number of pigs in the East Riding in 1887
                    was 46,332, in the North Riding 48,990, and in the West Riding 71,887. Though
                    the large long-eared breed is still kept, the small breed is that chiefly in
                    favour. Large numbers of pigs are kept at the dairy farms and fed mainly on
                    whey. Yorkshire bacon is famed for its flavour.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Manufactures and Trade.—</hi> For many years an extensive
                    district in the West Riding has been famed for its woollen and worsted
                    manufactures. The early development of the industry was due partly to the
                    abundance of water power supplied by the numerous streams in the valleys by
                    which the district is indented; and in recent times the happy accident of the
                    proximity of coal and iron has enabled the industry to keep pace with modern
                    requirements. The West Riding is now the chief seat of the woollen manufacture
                    in the United Kingdom, and has almost a monopoly in the manufacture of worsted
                    cloths. In this industry nearly all the important towns in the Riding are
                    engaged, Leeds having for its specialty almost every variety of woollen and
                    worsted cloth, Bradford yarns and mixed worsted goods, Dewsbury, Batley, and the
                    neighbouring districts shoddy, Huddersfield both plain goods and fancy
                    trouserings and coatings, and Halifax, to the neighbourhood of which the cotton
                    industry of Lancashire has also penetrated, worsted and carpets. Next to the
                    woollen industry comes the manufacture of iron aud steel machinery and
                    implements of every variety, Leeds being one of the principal seats of all kinds
                    of mechanical engineering, and Sheffield of iron work and cutlery. For the minor
                    manufactures in the district, and for more specific details, reference must be
                    made to the separate articles on the different towns. Until comparatively
                    recently agriculture was the chief calling of the North Riding; but the
                    discovery of iron ore in the Cleveland region has led to the formation of
                    another great manufacturing centre, mainly devoted to the production of
                    pig-iron, the manufacturing of steel by the basic process, and iron
                    shipbuilding. The industrial activity of the East Riding is mostly centred in
                    Hull, the chief port of the county, although the Lancashire ports must be
                    regarded as the principal ports for the trade, especially of the West Riding. In
                    the North Riding Middlesbrough is rising into importance as a shipping port, and
                    Whitby, though not progressing as a port, has a considerable coasting trade. The
                    fishing industry, which is of minor importance, is carried on at Hull, Filey,
                    Whitby, and Scarborough, and a considerable number of villages.</p>
                <p>Scarborough is by far the most attractive and thriving watering-place north of
                    the Thames; and a number of others, such as Whitby, Bridlington, Filey, and
                    Saltburn, are rising yearly in repute. Among others, chiefly of local celebrity,
                    are Redcar, Hornsea, and Withernsea. There are a considerable number of inland
                    spas frequented to some extent by persons from other parts of the county, but
                    the only one of wide reputation is Harrogate.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration and Population.—</hi> Yorkshire has from an
                    early period been divided into three ridings, each of which has a lord
                    lieutenant. The East Riding has a separate court of quarter sessions and a
                    commission of the peace. The city of York within the municipal limits
                    constitutes a separate division of the county. The municipal city and the ainsty
                    are for parliamentary purposes included in the North Riding, for registration
                    purposes in the East Riding, and for all other purposes in the West Riding. The
                    parliamentary city of York, which formerly extended beyond the municipal limits,
                    is partly in the North and partly in the East Riding. The following table gives
                    the population of the county and of the three ridings in 1801, 1821, 1871, and
                    1881 :—</p>

                <p>The population has more than quadrupled since 1801, the increase having been much
                    the greatest in the West Riding. Though in area much the largest, Yorkshire is
                    in population third among English counties, being exceeded in this respect both
                    by Lancashire and Middlesex. The number of males in 1881 was 1,420,001 and of
                    females 1,466,563. The number of persons to an acre in the county was 0∙74—East
                    Riding 0∙42, North Riding (not including the city of York) 0∙25, and West Riding
                    1∙23. The East Riding comprises 6 wapentakes and the municipal boroughs of
                    Beverley (pop. 11,425), Kingston-upon-Hull (154,240), and Hedon (966). It is
                    divided into 12 petty and special sessional divisions. The borough of
                    Kingston-upon-Hull has a separate court of quarter sessions and a commission of
                    the peace, and the borough of Beverley has a commission of the peace. The riding
                    contains 352 civil parishes with part of one other, viz., Filey, which extends
                    into the North Riding. It is entirely in the diocese of York. The North Riding
                    comprises 11 wapentakes, the liberties of East and West Langbaurgh and of Whitby
                    Strand, and the municipal boroughs of Middlesbrough (55,934), Richmond (4502),
                    and Scarborough (30,504). It is divided into 19 petty and special sessional
                    divisions. The boroughs of Richmond and Scarborough have separate courts of
                    quarter sessions and commissions of the peace, and the borough of Middlesbrough
                    has a commission of the peace. The riding contains 554 civil parishes and parts
                    of five others. It is almost entirely in the diocese of York and Ripon. The West
                    Riding comprises 9 wapentakes, the city of Ripon (7390), and the municipal
                    boroughs of Barnsley (29,790), Batley (27,505), Bradford (183,032), Dewsbury
                    (29,637), Doncaster (21,139), Halifax (73,630), Harrogate (9482), Huddersfield
                    (81,841), Leeds (309,119), Pontefract (8798), Rotherham (34,782), Sheffield
                    (284,508), Wakefield (30,854), and Keighley (12,085). The riding is divided into
                    25 petty and special sessional divisions. The city of York, the boroughs of
                    Bradford, Doncaster, Leeds, Pontefract, and Sheffield, and the liberty of Ripon
                    (including the city) have separate courts of quarter sessions and commissions of
                    the peace, and the boroughs of Batley, Dewsbury, Halifax, Huddersfield, and
                    Wakefield have commissions of the peace. The liberty and the borough of Ripon
                    are not included in the West Riding for the purposes of the county rate, but are
                    rated separately. The riding contains 724 civil parishes and parts of six
                    others. It is mostly in the dioceses of York, Ripon, and Manchester. For
                    parliamentary purposes the East Riding is formed into three divisions,—Buckrose,
                    Holderness, and Howdenshire, each returning one member. It also includes the
                    parliamentary borough of Kingston-upon-Hull, returning three members, with part
                    of the borough of York city, which returas two members. The North Riding for
                    parliamentary purposes is formed into four divisions, —Cleveland, Richmond,
                    Thirsk, and Whitby, each returning one member. It also includes the boroughs of
                    Middlesbrough and Scarborough, each returning one member, with portions of the
                    boroughs of Stockton and York city. The West Riding for parliamentary purposes
                    is formed into three divisions, which are again subdivided into districts each
                    returning one member,—the north division into five districts, the south into
                    eight, and the east into six. The riding also includes the following
                    parliamentary boroughs :—Bradford returning three members, Dewsbury one, Halifax
                    two, Huddersfield one, Leeds five, Pontefract one, Sheffield five, and Wakefield
                    one.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History and Antiquities.—</hi> Traces of the old British
                    inhabitants are numerous in the Wolds of the East Riding and the moors of the
                    North Riding. Remains of the circular pit-dwellings of ancient Brigantian
                    villages still exist at Egton Grange, Hole Pits, Killing Pits, Danby, and
                    Roseberry Topping. A large number of implements, of both flint and bronze, have
                    been discovered in the barrows on the Wolds and moors, and in the caves of the
                    limestone district. Circles and other stone monuments are not uncommon, the most
                    remarkable being the monolith, 29 feet in height, at Rudston, and the group of
                    monoliths called the Devil’s Arrows at Boroughbridge, 16½, 21½, and 22½ feet in
                    height respectively. On the hill-sides there are numerous ancient earthworks and
                    dykes, such as the fortification on Flamborough Head, incorrectly called the
                    Danes’ dyke. Yorkshire was included in the territory of the Brigantes at the
                    time of its invasion by the Romans in 51; it did not, however, make formal
                    submission till 79. It afterwards formed part of the district of <hi
                    rend="italic">Maxima Caesariensis,</hi> of which the capital was <hi
                    rend="italic">Eboracum</hi> (York). The central districts of Yorkshire seem to
                    have been densely peopled by the Romans. Watling Street entered the county near
                    Bawtry, crossed the Don at <hi rend="italic">Danum</hi> (Doncaster), the Aire at
                    <hi rend="italic">Legeolium</hi> (Castleford), and the Wharfe at <hi
                    rend="italic">Calcaria</hi> (Tadcaster). Thence it proceeded by <hi

                    and <hi rend="italic">Cataractonium</hi> (Catterick Bridge) to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ad Tisam</hi> (Pierce Bridge), where it crossed the Tees. Another road passed
                    eastwards from York to Malton, and various branches traversed the county in
                    different directions. A great variety of Roman remains have been discovered and
                    traces of Roman camps are numerous, such as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cataractonium,</hi> the outlines of the station at Old Malton, the ancient wall
                    with the multangular tower at York, and the remains of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Isurium.</hi> After the departure of the Romans Yorkshire was overrun by the
                    Picts. Subsequently it formed the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Deira to the south of
                    Bernicia (see vol. viii. p. 270). The two were included in Northumbria, which
                    seems to have been under the rule sometimes of a single prince and sometimes of
                    two separate princes in Bernicia and Deira, the northern boundary of the latter
                    kingdom being probably the Tees and the southern always the Humber (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Northumberland,</hi> vol. xvii. p. 568 <hi rend="italic"

                    Danish invasions, is given). After the Conquest Yorkshire was divided among
                    several Norman earls—including<pb break="no"

                    Ilbert de Lacy, and William de Percy. The district was at this period frequently
                    invaded by the Scots. In 1138 David of Scotland laid waste the country to the
                    gates of York; but he was completely defeated by the English on 22d August of
                    that year in the battle of the Standard at Northallerton. In 1312 Thomas
                    Plantagenet, earl of Lancaster, raised an insurrection in Yorkshire against
                    Gaveston, the favourite of Edward II., whom he captured in Scarborough and
                    beheaded at Warwick on 19th June. The earl again in 1322 headed a party against
                    the Despensers, but on 16th March was defeated and captured at Boroughbridge,
                    and on 22d was beheaded at Pontefract. During the Wars of the Roses the county
                    was the scene of frequent conflicts, including the battle of Wakefield (31st
                    December 1460), in which Richard, duke of York, was defeated by Queen Margaret
                    and slain, and the battle of Towton (29th March 1461), in which Edward IV.
                    defeated Henry VI. In 1536 the county was the scene of the insurrection under
                    Robert Aske, known as the “Pilgrimage of Grace,” caused by the dissolution of
                    the monasteries. In 1569 a rising took place in Yorkshire under the earls of
                    Westmorland and Northumberland in behalf of Mary Queen of Scots. During the
                    Civil War the county was chiefly Royalist, although some of the most famous
                    Parliamentary officers were Yorkshiremen, the more noted being Fairfax and
                    Lambert. Bradford, Hull, Scarborough, Pontefract, and York sustained long
                    sieges; and on 2d July 1644 the great and decisive battle of the war occurred at
                    Marston Moor. The annals of the county are destitute of further incidents of
                    special historic importance.</p>
                <p>Of ancient strongholds or castles Yorkshire has still many interesting examples
                    in a more or less complete condition, including Barden Tower, built in the reign
                    of Henry VII. by Henry Clifford, “the shepherd lord,” which has been in ruins
                    since 1774; Bolton Castle, pronounced by Leland “the fairest in Richmondshire,”
                    a square building with towers at the corners, erected in the reign of Richard
                    II. by Richard Scrope, chancellor of England, occupied by Queen Mary while under
                    the charge of Lord Scrope, besieged during the Civil War, and rendered untenable
                    in 1647; the square tower or keep of Bowes Castle, supposed to have been built
                    by Alan Niger, first earl of Richmond; the gateway tower (erected in the reign
                    of Henry VI. ) of Cawood Castle, said to have been originally built by King
                    Athelstan in 920; the keep and various portions of the walls of the extensive
                    fortress of Conisbrough, of uncertain origin, but probably dating from Saxon
                    times; the remains of Danby Castle, said to have been built shortly after the
                    Conquest by Robert de Bruce; Harewood, of great extent, originally founded soon
                    after the Conquest, but now containing no portions earlier than the reign of
                    Edward III.; the keep, in the Early English style, and other remains of

                    county in the kingdom for variety of style, and the size and importance of many

                    Mary’s, Beverley, chiefly Perpendicular, very elaborate in style, originally
