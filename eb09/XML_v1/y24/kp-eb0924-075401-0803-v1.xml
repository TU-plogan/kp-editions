                <p><label type="entry">YORUBA, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Yariba</hi></label>, a
                    country of West Africa, occupying the eastern half of the Slave Coast region in
                    6°-9° N. lat. and 3°-7° E. long. Taken in its widest sense, so as to include the
                    whole domain of the Yoruba race and speech, the Yoruba country stretches from
                    the Bight of Benin northwards in the direction of the unexplored region of
                    Borgu, and from the ill-defined eastern frontier of Dahomey to the Niger and its
                    delta, which enclose it on the northeast, east, and south-east. Within these
                    limits it covers an area of at least 40,000 square miles, with a population
                    roughly estimated at over 2,000,000. But since 1820-21, when the old Yoruba
                    empire was broken up by the Fulah invaders, the northern part, comprised between
                    the Niger and the water-parting of the streams flowing north to that river and
                    south to the Gulf of Guinea, has been included in the Fulah state of Gando. This
                    water-parting, which constitutes the main physical feature of the land, is
                    formed by the eastern continuation of the mountain range which in the Mahi
                    country, north of Dahomey, appears to rise to over 6000 feet (Skertchley), but
                    which in Yoruba gradually falls to considerably under 2000 feet. But towards the
                    east, about the upper course of the river Oshun, the system again rises to what
                    is described as “a very mountainous country” (Higgins and Smith). The city of
                    llorin, near the northern slope of the divide, stands at an elevation of a
                    little over 1300 feet, which is probably about the average height of the range
                    in Yoruba. Gerhard Rohlfs, who in 1867 traversed the whole region from Rabba on
                    the Niger to Lagos on the Gulf of Guinea, describes the section north of the
                    water-parting as an open, gently sloping, and highly cultivated plain, to which
                    the profusion of flowering plants gives the aspect of a vast garden. Here
                    abundant crops of cereals, cotton, yams, ground-nuts, and kola nuts are raised.
                    South of the divide the land, which is intersected by the nearly parallel
                    courses of the rivers Ogun, Omi, Oshun, Oni, and Oluwa, falls in continuous
                    undulations down to the coast, the open cultivated ground gradually giving place
                    in the same direction to forest tracts, where the most characteristic tree is
                    the oil-palm. Flowering trees and shrubs are here also plentiful, while the
                    chief cultivated plants are corn, yams, plantains, bananas, tobacco, cotton, <hi
                    rend="italic">okro,</hi> groundnuts, and <hi rend="italic">ata-ile</hi> yielding
                    a yellow dye (Higgins and Smith). As the sea is approached, the wooded tracts
                    merge almost everywhere in a broad zone of dense primeval forest, completely
                    separating the arable lands of the interior from the coast lagoons.</p>
                <p>These lagoons, lying between the outer surf-beaten beach and the inner shore
                    line, form a navigable highway of still waters, which in many places is several
                    miles in extent. During the dry season the rivers discharging into the lagoons
                    are unable to force a passage seawards; but after the rains they find an outlet,
                    now at one point now at another, while here and there the natives themselves
                    often excavate passages for their boats between the inner and outer waters. Of
                    all the lagoons the most extensive are those of Leckie in the east and Ikoradu
                    (Lagos) in the west. At its northern extremity the latter receives the discharge
                    of the Ogun, the largest river in Yoruba, whose current is strong enough to keep
                    the seaward channel open throughout the year. Hence the great importance of the
                    British port of Lagos, which lies in smooth water at the inner entrance of this
                    channel.</p>
                <p>From Lagos, which, besides Badagry (about 40 miles farther west), is the only
                    station actually occupied by England on this coast, the British Government
                    exercises a sort of benevolent suzerainty over the whole of the Yoruba country.
                    In 1886 it despatched to the inland tribes two commissioners (Higgins and Smith)
                    for the purpose of bringing to a close the intertribal wars by which the country
                    had for years been wasted, and also of inducing the chiefs to give up the
                    practice of human sacrifices, which, as in Dahomey and Ashantee, though to a
                    less degree, has always prevailed throughout this region. The commissioners
                    obtained and embodied in their reports <hi rend="italic">{Blue Books,</hi> 1887)
                    a considerable amount of information regarding the present political and social
                    condition of the Yoruba peoples. Since the dismemberment of their empire by the
                    Fulahs (1820-21) the country has been divided into a number of semiindependent
                    states, chieftaincies, or kingdoms, hanging loosely together, or rather
                    constantly at war, and with a feeble sense of common nationality. The direct
                    representative of the old Yoruba power is the “alafin” or king of the Yoruba
                    country proper, occupying the northern and central parts of the whole region.
                    Round about this central state are grouped the kingdoms of Ilorin, Ijesha, Ife,
                    and Ondo in the east, Mahin and Jebu in the south, and Egba in the west. The
                    alafin resides at Oyo, on a headstream of the Oshun, a place which as metropolis
                    of the Yoruba nation has succeeded the older capitals, Bohu and Katunga, lying
                    farther north and destroyed during the wars with the Fulahs. Oyo has an
                    estimated population of 70,000 or 80,000; but it is greatly exceeded in size by
                    several other places in Yoruba Land, where for mutual protection the inhabitants
                    have mainly grouped themselves in large walled towns. Thus have sprung up the
                    great cities of Abeokuta (200,000 ?), capital of Egba, on the Ogun, due north of
                    Lagos; Ibadan (150,000), on a branch of the Omi, 30 miles south of Oyo; Ilorin
                    (200,000 ?), one of the great markets of West Africa, capital of the Ilorin
                    state; Ogbomosho (60,000), between Oyo and Ilorin; Ejigbo (40,000), Ilobu
                    (60,000), and Ikirun (60,000), following successively nearly due east from Oyo;
                    Ilesha (40,000), Oshogbo (60,000), and Ede (50,000), following each other due
                    west in the Ilesha state; Ipetumodu (40,000), in Ife; Ode Ondo (60,000), capital
                    of Ondo; Jebu Ode (60,000), Epe (40,000?), and Lagos (75,000), in the Jebu state
                    and British protectorate. The constitution of some of these great urban groups
                    is most remarkable. Thus Abeokuta, dating from 1825, owes its origin to the
                    incessant inroads of the slave-hunters from Dahomey and Ibadan, which compelled
                    the village populations scattered over the open country to take refuge in this
                    rocky<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"
                    >Abeokuta = “under the rocks.”</hi></p></note> stronghold against the common
                    enemy. Here they constituted themselves a free confederacy of some sixty
                    distinct tribal groups, each preserving the traditional customs, religious
                    rites, systems of government, and even the very names, of their original
                    villages. Yet this apparently incoherent aggregate has since held its ground
                    successfully against the powerful armies often sent against the place both by
                    the king of Dahomey from the west and by the people of Ibadan from the east. The
                    different tribes are clearly distinguished by their several tattoo markings,
                    usually some simple pattern of two or more parallel lines, disposed horizontally
                    or vertically on both cheeks or other parts of the face.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding their political feuds, the Yoruba people are distinguished above
                    all the surrounding races for their generally peaceful disposition, love of
                    industry, friendliness, and hospitality towards strangers. Physically they
                    resemble closely their Ewe and Dahomey neighbours, but are of somewhat lighter
                    complexion, taller, and of less pronounced Negro features. Their superior
                    intelligence is shown in their greater susceptibility to Christian and
                    Mohammedan influences, their capacity for trade, and their remarkable progress
                    in the industrial arts. Although the bulk of the nation is still pagan, Islam
                    has made great advancement since the cessation of the Fulah wars, while
                    Protestant and Roman Catholic missions have been at work for many years at
                    Abeokuta, Oyo, Ibádan, and other large towns. Samuel Crowther, the first Negro
                    bishop, who was distinguished as an explorer, geographer, aud linguist, was a
                    native of Yoruba, rescued by the English from slavery and educated at Sierra
                    Leone.</p>
                <p>Although agriculture is the chief industry, such useful arts as pottery, weaving,
                    tanning, dyeing, and forging are practised in all the towns. The people make
                    their own agricultural implements, extract a palatable wine from the <hi
                    rend="italic">Baphia vinifera,</hi> and weave a stout cotton fabric, which was
                    formerly exported to Brazil, but which can now scarcely stand the competition of
                    cheaper Manchester goods even in the home market. But as builders the Yorubas
                    know no rivals in Negroland. The houses of the chiefs, often containing as many
                    as fifty rooms, are constructed with rare skill, and tastefully decorated with
                    carvings representing symbolic devices, fabulous animals, and even scenes of war
                    or the chase.</p>
                <p>Before the introduction of letters the Yorubas are said to have employed knotted
                    strings, like the Peruvian quipus, for recording events of historic interest.
                    Their language, which has been reduced to writing and carefully studied by
                    Crowther, Bouché, Bowen, and other missionaries, is spoken with considerable
                    uniformity throughout the whole of the Yoruba domain, and has even penetrated
                    with the enterprising native traders as far east as Kano in the Haussa country
                    beyond the Niger. The best-known dialectic varieties are those of Egba, Jebu,
                    Ondo, Ife, Ilorin, and Oyo (Yoruba proper, called also Nago); but the
                    discrepancies are slight, while the divergence from the conterminous linguistic
                    groups (Ewe in the west, Ibo, Nupe, and others in the east) appears to be
                    fundamental.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n804/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0804-0755"/>
                <p>The most marked feature is a strong tendency towards monosyllabism, which has
                    been produced by phonetic decay, and which, as in the Indo-Chinese family, has
                    given rise to the principle of intonation, required to distinguish words
                    originally different but reduced by corruption to the condition of homophones.
                    Besides the tones, of which there are three,—high, low, and middle,—Yoruba has
                    also developed a degree of vocalic harmony, in which, as in Ural-Altaic, the
                    vowels of the affixes are assimilated to that of the root. Inflexion, as in
                    Bantu, is effected chiefly by prefixes; and there is a remarkable power of
                    word-formation by the fusion of several relational elements in a single compound
                    term. The Bible and several religious treatises have been translated into
                    Yoruba, which as a medium of general intercourse in West Africa ranks in
                    importance next to Haussa and Mandingam (A. H. K.)</p>
