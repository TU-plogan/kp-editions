                <p><label type="entry">MEASUREMENT</label>. We propose in the first place to enter
                    into some detail on the fundamental principles of the theory of measurement, and
                    in doing so it will be necessary to sketch the very remarkable theory
                    established by Riemann and other mathematicians as to the foundations of our
                    geometrical knowledge.</p>
                <p>Every system of geometrical measurement, as indeed the whole science of geometry
                    itself, is founded on the possibility of transferring a fixed figure from one
                    part of space to another with unchanged form. We are so familiar with this
                    process that we are apt not to realize its importance until very special
                    attention has been directed to the subject. We therefore propose to make a
                    logical examination of the nature of the assumptions involved in the possibility
                    of moving a figure in space so that it shall undergo no alteration. We shall
                    find that we require to postulate certain suppositions with regard to the nature
                    of space and to the measurement of distances.</p>
                <p>It will facilitate the conception of this somewhat difficult subject to consider
                    the case of hypothetical reasoning beings which Sylvester described as being
                    infinitely attenuated bookworms confined to infinitely thin sheets of paper. We
                    suppose such two-dimensional beings to be absolutely limited to a certain
                    surface. They could have no conception of space except as of two dimensions. The
                    movement of a point would for them form a line, the movement of a line would
                    form a surface. They could conduct their measurements and form their geometrical
                    theories. They would be able to draw the shortest lines between two points,
                    these lines being what we would call geodesics. To these two-dimensioned
                    geometers geodesics would possess many of the attributes of straight lines in
                    ordinary space. If the surface to which the beings were confined were actually a
                    plane, then the geometry would be the same as our geometry. They would find that
                    only one straight line could be drawn between two points, that through a point
                    only one parallel to a given line could be drawn, and that the ends of a line
                    would never meet even though the line be prolonged to infinity.</p>
                <p>We might also suppose that intelligent beings could exist on the surface of a
                    sphere. Their straightest line between two points would be the arc of the great
                    circle joining those two points. They would also find that a second geodesic
                    could be drawn joining the two points, this being of course the remaining part
                    of the great circle. A curious exception would, however, be presented by two
                    points diametrically opposite. An infinite number of geodesics can be drawn
                    between these points and all those geodesics are of equal length. The axiom that
                    there is one shortest line between two given points would thus not hold without
                    exception. There would be no parallel lines known to the dwellers on the sphere.
                    It would be found by them that every two geodesics must intersect, not only in
                    one, but even in two points. The sum of the three angles of a triangle would for
                    them not be constant. It would always be greater than two right angles, and
                    would increase with the area of the triangle. They would thus have no conception
                    of similarity between two geometrical figures of different sizes. If two
                    triangles be constructed which have their sides proportional, the angles of the
                    larger triangle would be greater than the corresponding angles of the smaller
                    triangle.</p>
                <p>It is thus plain that the geometrical axioms of the spheredwellers must be very
                    different from those of the planedwellers. The different axioms depend upon the
                    different kinds of space which they respectively inhabit, while their logical
                    powers are identical In one sense, however, the dwellers on the sphere and on
                    the plane have an axiom in common. In each case it will be <hi rend="italic"
                    >possible for a figure to be moved about without alteration of its
                    dimensions.</hi> A spherical triangle can be moved on the surface of a sphere
                    without distortion just as a plane triangle may be moved in a plane. The
                    sphere-dwellers and the plane-dwellers would be equally able to apply the test
                    of congruence. It is, however, possible to suppose reasoning beings confined to
                    a space in which the translation of a rigid figure is impossible. Take, for
                    instance, the surface of an ellipsoid or even a spheroid such as the surface of
                    the earth itself. A triangle drawn on the earth at the equator could not be
                    transferred to the surface of the earth near the pole and still preserve all its
                    sides and all its angles intact.</p>
                <p>If a surface admits of a figure being moved about thereon so as still to retain
                    all its sides and all its angles unaltered, then that surface must possess
                    certain special properties. It can be shown that, if a surface is to possess
                    this property, a certain function known as the “measure of curvature” is to be
                    constant. The measure of curvature is the reciprocal of the product of the
                    greatest and least radii of curvature. We do not now enter into the proof, but
                    it is sufficiently obvious that a sphere of which the radius is the geometric
                    mean between the greatest and least radii of curvature at each point will to a
                    large extent osculate the surface, so that a portion of the surface in the
                    neighbourhood of the point will, generally speaking, have the same curvature as
                    the sphere. If tire sphere thus determined be the same at all the different
                    points of the surface, then the curvature of the different parts of the surface
                    will on the whole resemble that of the sphere, and therefore we cannot be
                    surprised that the surface possessing this property will admit the displacement
                    of a rigid figure thereon without derangement of its form.</p>
                <p>We are thus conducted to a kind of surface the geometry of which is similar to
                    that of the plane, but in which the axiom of parallels does not hold good. In
                    this surface the radii of curvature at every point have opposite signs, so that
                    the measure of curvature which is zero for the plane and positive for the sphere
                    is negative for the surface now under consideration. This surface has been
                    called the “pseudosphere,” and its nature has been investigated by
                    Beltrami.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    two dimensions we can thus have either a plane or a sphere or a pseudosphere
                    which are characterized by the property that a surface may be moved about in all
                    directions without any change either in the lengths of its lines or in the
                    magnitudes of its angles. The axiom which assumes that there is only one
                    geodesic connecting two points marks off the plane and the pseudosphere from the
                    sphere. The axiom that only one parallel can be drawn through a given point to a
                    given line marks off the plane from the pseudosphere. The geometry of Euclid is
                    thus specially characterized among all conceivable geometries of two dimensions
                    by the following three axioms—(1) the mobility of rigid figures, (2) the single
                    geodesic between two points, (3) the existence of parallels.</p>
                <p>A very interesting account of this theory will be found in Clifford’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Lectures and Essays,</hi> vol. i. p. 317. We shall follow to some
                    extent the method employed by him in order to obtain an idea of the important
                    conception which is called the “curvature of space.” Suppose a geodesic be drawn
                    on a surface of constant curvature. Then a piece of the surface adjoining this
                    geodesic can be slid along the curve so as all the time to fit in close contact
                    therewith. If the piece of surface be turned to the other side of the geodesic
                    it will still fit along this side. A <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0691-0660"/> line possessing this property is called by
                    Leibnitz a straight line. It can be easily shown that a geodesic drawn on a
                    figure will also be a geodesic when the figure is transferred to any other
                    position. Suppose that the figure be divided into two parts A and B by the
                    geodesic; then the part B can be moved round so as to lie upon A, and the
                    boundary lines of the two portions will be coincident. Now let the two parts
                    while superposed be translated to any other position, then the piece B may be
                    slid off and back to its original position with regard to A. It must still fit,
                    because the whole figure might have been translated before the subdivision took
                    place. It follows that the division between A and B having been a geodesic in
                    its original position will continue to be a geodesic however the figure may be
                    translated.</p>
                <p>In a similar way we obtain the conception of a plane. According to Leibnitz’s
                    definition a plane is a surface such that if a portion of the space contiguous
                    thereto be slid along the surface it will continuously fit, and if the portion
                    of space be transferred to the other side of the surface it will fit also. This
                    definition has no meaning except we assume that the bodies may be translated in
                    space without derangement of their dimensions. From any point we can imagine a
                    doubly infinite number of geodesics radiating in all directions; if a plane be
                    drawn through the point, then all the geodesics touching the plane at that point
                    form what may be called a “geodesic surface.” It is shown that geodesic surfaces
                    of this description can alone fulfil the conditions by which planes are to be
                    defined. A doubly infinite number of geodesic surfaces can be drawn through
                    every point. If a rigid body be divided into two parts by a geodesic plane, then
                    no matter how the body be displaced the plane of section will still be geodesic.
                    The plane of section may be made to pass through any point, and the body may
                    then be given such an aspect as shall cause the section to coincide with any
                    geodesic surface through the point, but this necessarily involves that the
                    section shall fit each geodesic surface, in other words, that <hi rend="italic"
                    >all the geodesic surfaces shall have a constant curvature.</hi></p>
                <p>The point which we have now gained is one of very great importance. In our
                    ordinary conceptions of space the geodesic surfaces are of course our ordinary
                    planes, and the common curvature they possess is zero, but the condition that
                    rigid bodies shall be capable of translation with unaltered features does not
                    require that the curvatures shall be zero, it merely requires that the
                    curvatures shall be constant. If we add, however, the postulate of similarity,
                    then the curvatures must be zero. The postulate of similarity requires that it
                    shall be possible to construct a figure on any scale and anywhere similar to a
                    given figure. This practically includes the ordinary doctrine of parallels.
                    Lobatchewsky developed the system of geometry on the supposition that the space
                    had a constant curvature different from zero. In this geometry the parallels can
                    be drawn through a given point to a given line, and, to quote Clifford—</p>
                <p>“The sum of the three angles of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> triangle is less than
                    two right angles by a quantity proportional to the area of the triangle. The
                    whole of this geometry is worked out in the style of Euclid, and the most
                    interesting conclusions are arrived at, particularly in the theory of solid
                    space, in which a surface turns up which is not plane relatively to that space
                    but which for the purpose of drawing figures upon it is identical with the
                    Euclidean plane.”</p>
                <p>The most comprehensive mode of viewing the whole theory is that adopted by

                    possesses one obvious advantage. The use of symbols only admits of deductions on
                    purely logical principles. There is not therefore the risk of tacitly
                    introducing other axioms in addition to those with which we started.</p>
                <p>Magnitudes which have only one dimension present the theory of measurement in its
                    simplest form. The length of a straight line may be taken as an illustration of
                    a one-dimensioned magnitude. The velocity of a moving particle, the temperature
                    of a heated body, the electric resistance of a metal, all these and many others
                    are instances of one-dimensioned magnitude, the measure of which is to be
                    expressed by a single quantity. But there may be magnitudes which require more
                    than a single measurement for their complete specification. Take, for instance,
                    a four-sided field which has been duly surveyed. Of what is the measurement of
                    this field to consist? If the number of acres in the field be all that is
                    required then the area is expressed by a simple reference to a number of
                    standard acres. If, however, the entire circumstances of the field are to be
                    brought into view, then a simple statement of the area is not sufficient. It can
                    be easily shown that the surveyor must ascertain five independent quantities
                    before the details of the shape of the field can be adequately defined. Four of
                    these quantities may naturally be the lengths of the four sides of the field,
                    the fifth may be one of the angles, or the area, or the length of one of the
                    diagonals. Speaking generally, we may say that five distinct measurements will
                    be necessary to define the field adequately. The actual choice of the particular
                    measurements to be made is to a great extent arbitrary. The only condition
                    absolutely necessary is that they shall be all independent and free from
                    ambiguity. Once these five quantities are ascertained then all the other
                    features of the figure are absolutely determined. For instance, the four sides
                    and the diagonal being ascertained by measurement, then the other diagonal, the
                    four angles, and the area can all be computed by calculation. The five
                    quantities would determine everything about the field except its actual position
                    on the surface of the earth. If we further desired to have the field exactly
                    localized certain other quantities must be added. The latitude and the longitude
                    of one specified corner of the field would completely indicate that corner,
                    while the azimuth of one side from that corner would complete the definition of
                    its position. We are thus led to see that for the complete delineation of every
                    circumstance relating to the shape of the field and its locality eight different
                    measurements have been required. Two sets of eight measurements differing in any
                    particular can never indicate the same field. It is very important to notice
                    that the <hi rend="italic">number</hi> of quantities required is quite
                    independent of the particular nature of the measurements adopted. We might for
                    instance have simply measured the latitude and the longitude of each of the four
                    corners of the field. Once these quantities are known, then the shape of the
                    field, its area, its angles, and its diagonals have all been implicitly
                    determined. Here again we see that as two quantities are required to localize
                    each of the four corners, so eight quantities will be required to fully
                    determine the whole field.</p>
                <p>In the operations of analytical geometry we are accustomed to specify the
                    position of a point by the relation which it bears to certain fixed axes. By
                    means of certain quantities, either altogether linear or partly linear and
                    partly angular, we are enabled to specify the position of the point with
                    absolute definiteness. These quantities <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0692-0661"/> are called the coordinates of the point. In a
                    similar though more extended sense we may use the word “coordinates” to express
                    the group of eight magnitudes which we have found to be adequate to the complete
                    specification of the field. By the measurement of the field in the most complete
                    sense of the term we mean the measurement of its eight coordinates.</p>
                <p>Suppose that an object is completely specified by <hi rend="italic">n</hi>
                    coordinates, then every different group of <hi rend="italic">n</hi> coordinates
                    will specify a different object. The entire group of such objects will form what
                    is called a continuously extended manifoldness. The singly extended manifoldness
                    may be most conveniently illustrated by the conception of time, the various
                    epochs of which are the elements in the manifoldness. Space is a triply extended
                    manifoldness whereof the elements are points. All conceivable spheres form a
                    quadruply extended manifoldness. All conceivable triangles in space form a
                    manifoldness of nine dimensions. The number of coordinates required to specify
                    the position of an element in a manifoldness is thus equal to the order of the
                    manifoldness itself. It is important to observe that the elements of the
                    manifoldness may be themselves objects of no little complexity. Thus, for
                    instance, the conics forming a confocal group constitute the elements of a
                    singly extended manifoldness.</p>
                <p>The essential feature of a singly extended manifoldness is that a continuous
                    progress of an element can take place only in two directions, either forwards or
                    backwards. But a singly extended manifoldness may be regarded as itself an
                    element in a manifoldness of a higher order. Thus the points on a circle form a
                    singly extended manifoldness, while the circle itself is one element of the
                    manifoldness which consists of a series of concentric circles. The system of
                    concentric circles may in like manner be regarded as an element in the
                    manifoldness which embraces all systems of concentric circles whose centres lie
                    along a given line. We are thus led to conceive of a multiply extended
                    manifoldness as made up by the successive composition of singly extended
                    manifoldnesses.</p>
                <p>It follows from the conception of a manifoldness that in the case of a singly
                    extended manifoldness the position of every element must be capable of being
                    completely specified by a single quantity. It becomes natural to associate with
                    each element of the manifoldness a special numerical magnitude. These magnitudes
                    may vary from - ∞ to + ∞; to each magnitude will correspond one element of the
                    manifoldness, and conversely each element of the manifoldness is completely
                    specified whenever the appropriate number has been assigned. It is quite
                    possible to have this association of numerical magnitude with the actual
                    position of an element independent of any ordinary metrical relations of the
                    system; it will, however, most usually be found that the numerical magnitudes
                    chosen are such as admit of direct interpretations for the particular
                    manifoldness under consideration. Thus, for instance, in the case of the system
                    of concentric circles it will be natural to associate with each circle its
                    radius, and the position of each circle in the manifoldness will thus be
                    completely defined by the radius. So also in the case of that singly extended
                    manifoldness which consists of colours, it will be natural to employ as the
                    number which specifies each particular colour the wave-length to which that
                    particular colour corresponds.</p>
                <p>If the elements of such a manifoldness can receive a simultaneous displacement,
                    then it is plain that to each element in the original position will correspond
                    an element in the second position. Let <hi rend="italic">x</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">y</hi> be the numerical magnitudes correlated to these two
                    elements. Then, since the relation must be of the one-to-one type, it is
                    necessary that the magnitudes <hi rend="italic">x</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >y</hi> must be connected by an equation of the type <hi rend="italic">axy +
                    bx+cy + d≈O.</hi></p>
                <p>It follows from this that there are a pair of elements which are common to both
                    systems, for if <hi rend="italic">x=y</hi> we have the equation <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">oλ</hi><hi rend="superscript smallcaps"> 2</hi> + (δ + <hi
                    rend="italic">c}x ÷ d</hi> = 0.</p>
                <p>The original equation may be written in the form <hi rend="italic">axy</hi> + (δ
                    - <hi rend="italic">ω)x</hi> + (c + <hi rend="italic">ω)y + d</hi> = 0, and
                    whatever value <hi rend="italic">ω</hi> may have this equation will lead to the
                    same quadratic for the two common elements. We thus have a singly infinite
                    number of displacements which are compatible with the condition that the two
                    fundamental elements shall remain unaltered, and it is displacements of this
                    kind which express the movements of a rigid system.</p>
                <p>The position of a point is to be defined by three coordinates. In our ordinary
                    conception of coordinates the position of the point is defined by certain
                    measurements, and thus it would seem that the very mention of coordinates had
                    already presupposed the idea of distance. This, however, need not be the case.
                    We can assume a point in space to be completely defined by three purely
                    numerical quantities. It will be supposed that to each group of three
                    coordinates corresponds one point, and that conversely to one point will
                    correspond three coordinates and no ambiguity is to be present. This latter
                    consideration will exclude from our present view such cases as those where the
                    position of a point is defined by a line and two angles, because angles are
                    subject to a well-known ambiguity amounting to any even multiple of τr. In this
                    case it would not be true that to one point corresponds one set of coordinates,
                    although the converse may be correct.</p>
                <p>It is necessary to understand clearly the nature of the suppositions which are
                    made with regard to space by this assumption. Let <hi rend="italic">x, y, z</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">x',</hi><hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi rend="italic">,
                    z'</hi> be the coordinates of two points <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">a'.</hi> Now <hi rend="italic">x, y, z</hi> can change
                    continuously by any law into <hi rend="italic">x', y', z'.</hi> Each
                    intermediate stage will give the coordinates of a point. It must thus be
                    possible to pass continuously in an infinite number of ways from the point <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> to the point <hi rend="italic">a'.</hi> We thus assume that
                    space is continuous when we have assumed that its points are represented by
                    coordinates. It must be observed that we predicate nothing as to space which is
                    not involved in the fact that to each point corresponds one group of three
                    coordinates. To some extent the considerations now before us will apply to any
                    other continuous manifoldness which requires three coordinates for the complete
                    specification of its elements. Take, for instance, a musical note. It can be
                    specified accurately by its pitch, intensity, and timbre. These three quantities
                    may be regarded as the three coordinates which will discriminate one sound from
                    the rest. The manifoldness comprising all musical notes is, however, very
                    different from the manifoldness which embraces all the points of space. Each of
                    these manifoldnesses is no doubt continuous, and each of them is of three
                    dimensions, but the conception of distance can have no place in the musical
                    manifoldness. This is due to the absence from the musical manifoldness of
                    anything parallel with the conception of rigidity in the space manifoldness.
                    These remarks will show that the conception of “distance” is something of a
                    special type even in a three-dimensioned continuous manifoldness.</p>
                <p>There are also other three-dimensioned and continuous manifoldnesses from which
                    the conception of distance is also absent. Take, for instance, the manifoldness
                    which embraces all the circles that can lie in a given plane. The points of such
                    a manifoldness are the circles. It is three-dimensioned, for two coordinates
                    will be required for the centre of each circle and one for its radius. It is
                    obviously a continuous manifoldness, for one circle may by infinitely graduated
                    modifications pass into any other. Yet from this manifoldness also the
                    conception of distance is absent. There is no intelligible relation of one
                    circle to another <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n693/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0693-0662"/> which is analogous to the distance which we
                    require to determine.</p>
                <p>We shall now give the investigation of Helmholtz, by which the analytical form of
                    the function expressing the distance is to be ascertained <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Göttingen Nachrichten,</hi> 1868, pp. 193 <hi rend="italic">sq.}.</hi></p>
                <p>It must be remembered that our definition of a point will be purely analytical.
                    Suppose three different scales of pure quantity each extending from - ∞ to + ∞ .
                    Each of these scales is perfectly' continuous, so that, no matter how close any
                    two elements in the scale may be, it is always possible to conceive the
                    insertion of an infinite number of intermediate elements. A point is tobe
                    defined for our present purpose as a group of three numerical magnitudes taken
                    one from each of the three scales. This conception may be stated more generally.
                    We can conceive <hi rend="italic">n</hi> different numerical scales. Then a
                    group of <hi rend="italic">n</hi> numbers, one from each scale, will define an
                    element of a continuous »-fold manifoldness.</p>
                <p>It will be obvious that unless the theory of distance possess a special character
                    it will not be possible for a rigid body to exist. Take, for instance, five
                    points in a rigid body ABODE. There are ten different pairs of points and ten
                    corresponding distances; all these ten distances must remain unchanged when the
                    body is displaced. We may assume the position of A arbitrarily. Then after the
                    dislpacement B must be placed at the right distance from A, but will only be
                    limited by this condition to a certain surface, C must be placed at the right
                    distance from A and from B, thus C will be limited to a certain curve. D must be
                    placed at the proper distances from A, from B, and from C. These conditions will
                    be sufficient to define D with complete definiteness. In the same way E will be
                    completely defined by its distances from A, B, and C, but as D and E are thus
                    fully defined we have no guarantee that the distance DE shall retain, after the
                    translation, the same value which it had before. This then indicates that the
                    function which is to express the distance must have a very special form. Any
                    arbitrary function of the six coordinates of the two points would in general not
                    fulfil the condition that the distance DE after the transformation will retain
                    the same value as it had before. If a greater number of points than five be
                    taken, the conditions which a rigid system must fulfil become still more
                    numerous.</p>
                <p>Let <hi rend="italic">x, y, z</hi> be the coordinates of a point in a rigid body
                    free to rotate around a point. We shall assume that <hi rend="italic">x, y,
                    z</hi> is in the vicinity of the fixed point, and that the displacement of the
                    body is such that a second point remains unaltered. In other words, the
                    displacement is to be a rotation around a line joining the two points, and we
                    shall also assume that when this rotation has been completed every point will be
                    restored to its original position. Let r? be the angle of rotation around the
                    axis, then <hi rend="italic">x, y,</hi><hi rend="italic">z</hi> will all be
                    functions of <hi rend="italic">y,</hi> and we may assume that the following
                    equations will hold—</p>

                <p>In the first place it is plain that these differential coefficients must be
                    functions of <hi rend="italic">x, y,z,</hi> and, these functions being expanded
                    in ascending powers, we may omit all powers above the first. It will also be
                    .obvious that the absolute terms must be zero as the origin is by hypothesis to
                    be a fixed point. As the displacement is a rotation, it follows that the
                    differential coefficients must be zero for certain values of <hi rend="italic"
                    >x, y,</hi><hi rend="italic">z</hi> different from zero, but this involves the

                <p>Here we have attained the fundamental property which the coordinates must
                    satisfy. If <hi rend="italic">k</hi> be equal to unity then we have the
                    well-known condition of ordinary space and ordinary rectangular coordinates, but
                    it will be seen that there is nothing in the preceding investigation to make it
                    necessary that <hi rend="italic">k</hi> should be unity. There are therefore a
                    singly infinite variety of spaces in which it is possible for a rigid body to be
                    displaced. The different values of <hi rend="italic">k</hi> thus correspond to
                    the different “curvatures” which a space might have while it still retained the
                    fundamental property which is necessary for measurement by congruence.</p>
                <p>It will now be proper to study the special characteristics of the space with
                    which we are familiar. It has been called flat space or homaloidal space to
                    distinguish it from other spaces in which the curvature is not zero. It is
                    manifest that the characteristic features of our space are not necessarily
                    implied in the general notion of an extended quantity of three dimensions and of
                    the mobility of rigid figures therein. The characteristic features of our space
                    are not necessities of thought, and the truth of Euclid’s axioms, in so far as
                    they specially differentiate our space from other conceivable spaces, must be
                    established by experience and by experience only.</p>
                <p>The special feature of our space, by which it is distinguished from spherical
                    space on the one hand and pseudospherical space on the other hand, depends upon
                    what Riemann calls the measure of curvature. If the sum of the three angles of a
                    triangle is to be two right angles, and if the geometrical similarity of large
                    figures and small figures is to be possible, then the measure of curvature must
                    be zero. Now all measurements that can bθ made seem to confirm the axiom of
                    parallels and seem to show the measure of curvature of our space to be
                    indistinguishable from zero.</p>
                <p>It can be proved that the amount by which the three angles of a triangle would
                    differ from two right angles in curved space depends upon the area of the
                    triangle. The greater the area of the triangle the greater is the difference. To
                    test the famous proposition, Euclid i. 32, it will therefore not be sufficient
                    to measure small triangles. It might be contended that in small triangles the
                    difference between the sum of the three angles and two right angles was so small
                    as to be inextricably mixed up with the unavoidable errors of measurement.
                    Seeing therefore that small triangles obey the law, it is necessary to measure
                    large triangles, and the largest triangles to which we have access are, of
                    course, the triangles which the astronomers have found means of measuring. The
                    largest available triangles are those which have the diameter of the earth’s
                    orbit as a base and a fixed star at the vertex. It is a very curious
                    circumstance that the investigations of annual parallax of the stars are
                    precisely the investigations which would be necessary to test whether one of
                    these mighty triangles had the sum of its three angles equal to two right
                    angles. It must be admitted that the parallax-seeking astronomers have never yet
                    found any reason to think that there is any measurable difference. If there were
                    such a difference it would probably be inextricably mixed up with the annual
                    parallax itself. Were space really pseudospherical, then stars would exhibit a
                    real parallax even if they were infinitely distant. Astronomers have sometimes
                    been puzzled by obtaining a negative parallax as the result of their labours. No
                    doubt this has generally or indeed always arisen from the errors which are
                    inevitable in inquiries of this nature, but if space were really curved then a
                    negative parallax might result from observations which possessed mathematical
                    perfection.</p>
                <p>It must, however, be remembered that even the triangles of the parallax
                    investigations are utterly insignificant when compared with the dimensions of
                    space itself. Even the whole visible universe must be only an uncon-ceivably
                    small atom when viewed in its true relation to infinite space. It may well be
                    that even with the parallax triangles our opportunities of testing the
                    proposition are utterly inadequate to pronounce on the presence or absence of
                    curvature in space. It must remain an open question whether if we had large
                    enough triangles the sum of the three angles would still be two right
                    angles.</p>
                <p>Helmholtz illustrates the subject by considering the representation of space
                    which is obtained in a spherical mirror. A mirror of this kind represents the
                    objects in front of it in apparently fixed positions behind the mirror. The
                    images of the sun and of other distant objects will lie behind the mirror at a
                    distance equal to its focal length, or, to quote the description of
                    Helmholtz—</p>
                <p>“The image of a man measuring with a rule a straight line from the mirror would
                    contract more and more the farther he went, but with his shrunken rule the man
                    in the image would count out exactly the same number of centimetres as the real
                    man. And in general all geometrical measurements of lines or angles made with
                    regularly varying images of real instruments would yield exactly the same
                    results as in the outer world. All congruent bodies would coincide on being
                    applied to one another in the mirror as in the outer world. All lines of sight
                    in the outer world would be represented by straight lines of sight in the
                    mirror. In short I do not see how men in the mirror are to discover that their
                    bodies are not rigid solids and their experiences good examples of the
                    correctness of Euclid’s axioms. But if they could look out upon our world as we
                    can look into theirs, without overstepping the boundary, they must declare it to
                    be a picture in a spherical mirror, and would speak of us just as we speak of
                    them; and if two inhabitants of the different worlds could communicate with one
                    another, neither so far as I can see would be able to convince the other that he
                    had the true, the other the distorted relations. Indeed I cannot see that such a
                    question would have any meaning at all so long as mechanical considerations are
                    not mixed up with it.”</p>
                <p>A very important contribution to this subject has been made by Professor Simon
                    Newcomb, entitled “Elementary Theorems Relating to the Geometry of a Space of
                    Three Dimensions and of Uniform Positive Curvature in the Fourth Dimension,” see
                    <hi rend="italic">Jour. f. d.</hi><hi rend="italic">reine und angewandte</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Matti.,</hi> vol. lxxxiii., Berlin, 1877.</p>
                <p>He commences by assuming the three following postulates :—</p>
                <p>1 “That space is triply extended, unbounded, without properties dependent either
                    upon position or direction, and possessing such planeness [in its smallest parts
                    that both the postulates of the Euclidean geometry and our common conceptions of
                    the relations of the parts of space are true for every indefinitely small region
                    in space.”</p>
                <p>2. “That this space is affected with such curvature that a right line shall
                    always return into itself at the end of a finite and real distance 2D without
                    losing in any part of its course that symmetry with respect to space on all
                    sides of it which constitutes the fundamental property of our conception of
                    it.”</p>
                <p>3. “That if two right lines emanate from the same point making the indefinitely
                    small angle α with each other, their distance apart <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n696/mode/1up"

                    rend="superscript"> sin</hi> 2D ’</p>
                <p>Newcomb also assumes that two straight lines intersect only in a single point. He
                    defines a “complete right line” as one returning into itself, as supposed in
                    postulate 2. Any small portion of it is to be conceived as a Euclidean right
                    line. The locus of all complete right lines passing through the same point and
                    touching a Euclidean plane through that point will be called a “complete
                    plane.”</p>
                <p>A “region” will mean any indefinitely small portion of space in which we areto
                    conceive of the Euclidean geometry as holding true.</p>
                <p>Newcomb then proceeds to demonstrate the following propositions.</p>
                <p>I. All complete right lines are of the same length 2D. Hence D is the greatest
                    possible distance at which the points can be situated, it being supposed that
                    the distance is measured on the line of least absolute length.</p>
                <p>II. The complete plane is a Euclidean plane in every region of its extent.</p>
                <p>III. Every system of right lines passing through a common point A and making an
                    indefinitely small angle with each other are parallel to each other in the
                    region A' at distance D.</p>
                <p>IV. If a system of right lines pass in the same plane through A the locus of
                    their most distant points will be a complete right line.</p>
                <p>V. The locus of all the points at distance D from a fixed point A is a complete
                    plane, and indeed a double plane if we consider as distinct the coincident
                    surfaces in which the two opposite lines meet.</p>
                <p>VI. Conversely, all right lines perpendicular to the same complete plane meet in
                    a point at the distance D on each side of the plane.</p>
                <p>VII. For every complete right line there is a conjugate complete right line such
                    that every point of the one is at distance D from every point of the other.</p>
                <p>VIII. Any two planes in space have as a common perpendicular the right line
                    joining their poles, and intersect each other in the conjugate to that right
                    line.</p>
                <p>IX. If a system of right lines pass through a point, their conjugates will be in
                    the polar plane of that point. If they also be in the same plane the conjugates
                    will all pass through the pole of that plane.</p>
                <p>X. The relation between the sides <hi rend="italic">a, b, c</hi> of a plane
                    triangle in curved space and their opposite angles A, B, C will be the same as
                    in a Euclidean spherical triangle of which the corresponding sides <hi
                    rend="italic">air bπ cτr</hi> are — . — . — .</p>
                <p>2D ’ 2D 2D</p>
                <p>XI. Space is finite, and its total volume admits of being definitely expressed by
                    a number of Euclidean solid units which is a function of D.</p>
                <p>8D <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi></p>
                <p>XII. The total volume of space is -— . <hi rend="italic">ιτ</hi></p>
                <p>XIII. The two sides of a complete plane are not distinct, as in a Euclidean
                    surface.</p>
                <p>XIV. If moving along a right line we erect an indefinite series of perpendiculars
                    each in the same Euclidean plane with the one which precedes it, then on
                    completing the line and returning to our starting point, the perpendiculars will
                    be found pointing in a direction the opposite of that with which we started.</p>
                <p>Newcomb concludes thus: “It may be also remarked that there is nothing within our
                    experience which will justify a denial of the possibility that the space in
                    which we find ourselves may be curved in the manner here supposed. It might be
                    claimed that the distance of the farthest visible star is but a small fraction
                    of the greatest distance D, but nothing more. The subjective impossibility of
                    conceiving of the relation of the most distant points in such a space does not
                    render its existence incredible. In fact our difficulty is not unlike that which
                    must have been felt by the first man to whom the idea of the sphericity of the
                    earth was suggested in conceiving how by travelling in a constant direction he
                    could return to the point from which he started without during his journey
                    feeling any sensible change in the direction of gravity.”</p>
                <p>A sketch of the non-Euclidean geometry is given by Professor G. Chrystal in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Proc. Roy. Soc. Edin.,</hi> vol. x., session 1879-80. The
                    study of this paper is recommended to all who desire to study the elements of
                    what has been called “pangeometry.” A more extensive work, which contains the
                    theories of Riemann and Helmholtz, is J. Frischauf s <hi rend="italic">Elemente
                    der absoluten Geometrie,</hi> Leipsic, 1876.</p>
                <p>A fundamental step in the abstract theory of measurement was taken by Professor
                    Cayley in his “Sixth Memoir upon Quantics,” <hi rend="italic">Philosophical
                    Transactions,</hi> vol. cxlix. (1859). The theory thus originated by Cayley has
                    been more fully developed by Klein in his memoir “Ueber die nicht-Euclidische
                    geometrie,” <hi rend="italic">Mathematische Annalen,</hi> vol. iv. p. 573. We
                    shall here enter into this theory in some detail, for in it lies the true
                    foundation of geometrical measurement. A sketch of the theory was given by the
                    author of the present article in <hi rend="italic">Hermathena,</hi> No. vi. pp.
                    500-541, Dublin, 1879.</p>
                <p>This theory may be regarded merely as a more generalized method of measuring
                    distances and angles in ordinary space, but the results to which it leads are in
                    many respects identical with those to which we are conducted by the theory just
                    discussed. For instance, Newcomb’s principle as to the length of the shortest
                    distance between two points never exceeding a certain magnitude is common to his
                    theory and to Cayley’s. The theory of Cayley has, however, claims on our
                    attention of a special kind. We here deal with the space with which Euclid has
                    made us familiar, only observing that it is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >measurements</hi> in that space which are to be conducted on a more general
                    principle.</p>
                <p>We commence by assuming the existence of a certain surface called the
                    “fundamental quadric,” often called “the absolute.” By the aid of this quadric
                    and an arbitrary constant <hi rend="italic">c</hi> we determine the generalized
                    distance between the points in accQrdance with the following definition :— <hi
                    rend="italic">The distance between two points is equal to</hi> c <hi
                    rend="italic">times the logarithm of the anharmonic ratio in τvhich the line
                    joining the two points is divided by the fundamental quadric.</hi></p>
                <p>Let us first test this theory by a very obvious principle which any theory of
                    distance ought to fulfil. It is plain that, if P, Q, R be three collinear
                    points, then in ordinary measurement we ought to have</p>
                <p>PQ+QR=PR; but it is easy to see that this condition is fulfilled in the
                    generalized measurement. Let the line PQ cut the fundamental quadric in the two
                    points X, Y, then we have</p>
                <p>PQ = c log(PX÷PY) - clog (QX÷QY) QR = clog(QX÷QY) - clog(RX÷RY)
                    PR=clog(PX÷PY)-clog(RX÷RY); whence, as in the ordinary measures,</p>
                <p>ΓQ+QR=PR.</p>
                <p>It is also obvious that ir the generalized as in the ordinary measures</p>
                <p>(PQ)=-(QP), and that the distance between the coincident points is equal to
                    zero.</p>
                <p>From an obvious property of logarithms we also learn the important fact that the
                    generalized distance between the points is indeterminate to the extent of any
                    integral number of the periods 2cfτr.</p>
                <p>The distance from any point to its harmonic conjugate with respect to the two
                    fundamental points is equal to <hi rend="italic">ciιr.</hi> We thus see that the
                    distance between any two harmonic conjugates is constant. It is usual to make
                    the arbitrary constant c equal to - f÷2, in which case we see that the distance
                    between the two harmonic conjugates is equal to <hi rend="italic">it</hi> ÷ 2.
                    It can also be shown that, if the two absolute points on a right line coalesce,
                    then the generalized system of measurement degrades to the ordinary system. The
                    two absolute points are at an infinite distance from every other point, so that
                    in the generalized system of measurement every right line has two points at
                    infinity, and in general all the points in space which lie at infinity are
                    situated on the fundamental quadric.</p>
                <p>In ordinary geometry we define a circle to be the locus of a point which is at a
                    constant distance from a given point. In the more generalized geometry we retain
                    the same definition of the circle, only observing that the distance to be
                    constant must be expressed in the generalized manner. The plane of course cuts
                    the absolute in a conic section, so that the determination of the circle whose
                    centre is C is the following problem in conic sections :—Through a fixed point 0
                    a straight line OP is drawn which cuts a given conic in the points X, Y;
                    determine the locus of P so that the anharmonic ratio (O, P, X, Y) shall remain
                    constant.</p>
                <p>This problem is most readily solved by projecting the conic into a circle the
                    centre of which is the projection of O. The problem then assumes the very simple
                    form. On the diameter of a fixed circle a point P' is taken so that the
                    anharmonic ratio of the four points consisting of P', the centre O', and the two
                    points in which the line O'P' cuts the circle remains constant. It is required
                    to find <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n697/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0697-0666"/> the locus of P ’. The solution is obvious, and
                    hence we learn that a conic which has double contact with the fundamental conic
                    is a <hi rend="italic">circle</hi> in the generalized sense, and the centre of
                    that circle is the pole of the chord of contact.</p>
                <p>A system of conics which have double contact with the fundamental conic in the
                    same two points form a system of concentric circles, and the centre of the
                    system is the pole of the chord of contact. We are accustomed in ordinary
                    geometry to admit that every circle passes through the two imaginary circular
                    points at infinity. This is the specialized form of tire general theorem which
                    asserts that every circle has double contact with the fundamental conic. The two
                    theorems indeed coincide if the fundamental conic degrades to the infinity of
                    ordinary measurement.</p>
                <p>A critical ease is presented when the chord through 0 coincides with either of
                    the two tangents which may be drawn from 0 to the fundamental conic. The two
                    fundamental points then coincide, and hence the distance between any two points
                    on a tangent to the fundamental conic is equal to zero. We have thus the curious
                    result that in every system of concentric circles, including even the
                    fundamental conic itself, the two points common to the system of circles are at
                    the distance zero from the centre of the system. In fact the pair of tangents
                    from the centre may be regarded as a conic having double contact with the
                    fundamental conic, and therefore forming one of the circles of the concentric
                    system of which the radius is zero.</p>
                <p>The reader will at once perceive the analogy to a well-known phenomenon in
                    ordinary geometry. The equation in rectangular coordinates a∙ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> + ,∕ <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> =0 denotes <hi
                    rend="italic">either</hi> a circle of which the radius is zero <hi rend="italic"
                    >or</hi> the pair of lines</p>
                <p>∞±√- ly = 0; in the latter case we are obliged to admit that the distance of any
                    point on either of these lines from their intersection is equal to zero.</p>
                <p>We have now to consider the displacement of a rigid figure, and we shall for the
                    present speak only of a plane movement. We shall first show that it is possible
                    for a plane figure to receive such a displacement that the distance between
                    every two points in the figure after the displacement is equal to what it was
                    before.</p>
                <p>Let <hi rend="italic">x, y, z</hi> be the trilinear coordinates of a point in a
                    plane, and suppose that <hi rend="italic">x', y', ⅛</hi> are the coordinates of
                    the position to which this point is transferred in accordance with the linear

                <p>The three values of <hi rend="italic">p</hi> which satisfy this equation
                    determine the coordinates of the three points. It is natural to take the sides
                    of the triangle formed by these three points as the three lines of reference, in
                    which case, if α, <hi rend="italic">β,</hi><hi rend="italic">y</hi> be
                    constants, the system of equations assume the simple form <hi rend="italic"

                <p>It is easily shown that four collinear points before the transformation are
                    collinear after the transformation, and that their anharmonic ratio is
                    unaltered.</p>
                <p>This general form of linear transformation must be specialized in order to
                    represent the movement. As no finite movement can either bring a point to
                    infinity or from infinity, it is obvious that the displacement must be such as
                    to leave the fundamental conic unaltered. It is easily seen that the
                    specification of the transformation in its general form requires eight
                    constants; viz., the ratios of the nine quantities <hi rend="italic">a, b, c,
                    a!, b', c</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">, a", b'', c".</hi> We may imagine five of
                    these constants to be disposed of by the provision that the conic shall remain
                    unaltered. There will still remain three disposable constants to give variety to
                    the possible displacements.</p>
                <p>Although the fun lamentai conic will coincide with itself after the
                    transformation, yet it <hi rend="italic">generally</hi> happens that each point
                    thereon will slide along the conic during the transformation. It is, however,
                    very important to observe that there are two exceptions to this statement.</p>
                <p>Let O, A, B, C be four points upon the fundamental conic which by transformation
                    move into the positions O', A', B', C'. If OX be one of the double rays of the
                    systems 0A, OB, OC and 0A', OB', 0C', and if we use the ordinary notation for
                    anharmonic pencils, then we have</p>
                <p>0(A, B, 0, X) = 0(A', B', O', X).</p>
                <p>But the anharmonic ratio subtended by four points on a conic at any fifth point
                    is constant, whence</p>
                <p>0(A', B', O', X) = 0'(A', B', C', X), and therefore</p>
                <p>0(A, B, 0, X) = 0'(A', B', C', X).</p>
                <p>Suppose the transformation moved X to X', then since the anharmonic ratio of a
                    pencil is unaltered by transformation we have</p>
                <p>0(A, B, C, X) = 0'(A', B', C', X'); whence</p>
                <p>0'(A', B', C', X) = O'(A'B'C'X')j but this can only be true if the rays O'X and
                    0'X' are coincident, in which case X and X' are coincident, whence it follows
                    that the point X has remained unaltered notwithstanding the transformation.
                    Similar reasoning applies to the point Y defined by the other double ray, and
                    hence we have the following theorem:—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">In that linear transformation of the points in a plane which
                    constitutes a generalized movement, there are two points upon the fundamental
                    conic which remain unchanged.</hi></p>
                <p>It also follows that the tangents to the fundamental conic at the points X and Y,
                    as well as the chord of contact, must remain unaltered. These two tangents and
                    their chord of contact must therefore form the triangle of reference to which we
                    were previously conducted by the general theory of this transformation.</p>
                <p>It will now easily appear how a transformation of this kind is really a
                    displacement of a rigid plane. The distance between each pair of points is
                    expressed by an anharmonic ratio; such ratios are unchanged by the
                    transformation, and the two points which lay on the absolute originally are also
                    there after the transformation. It therefore appears that the distance in the
                    generalized sense between every pair of points is unchanged by the
                    transformation. In other words, a rigid system will admit of a displacement of
                    the kind now under consideration.</p>
                <p>If we denote the two tangents at the unaltered points on the conic by z=0, y = 0,
                    and the chord of contact by <hi rend="italic">z = 0,</hi> then the equation to
                    the absolute is <hi rend="italic">xy-k</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                    2</hi><hi rend="italic">z</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">≈0.</hi></p>
                <p>Transforming this equation by the substitution <hi rend="italic">xf=ax,
                    t∕≈βy</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> t</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> '=7
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> &gt; we see that the condition αβ≈=γ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> must be fulfilled.</p>
                <p>It is very remarkable that the fundamental conic is only one of a family of
                    conics, each of which remains unaltered by the transformation. In fact every
                    generalized circle of which the intersection of the two tangents is the centre
                    has for its equation <hi rend="italic">xy - h</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                    ,</hi><hi rend="italic">z</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi>; and,
                    whatever <hi rend="italic">h</hi> may be, this circle remains unaltered by the
                    transformation. Hence we have the following remarkable theorem:—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">When a plane rigid system is displaced upon itself there is one
                    point 0 of the system which remains unaltered, and all the circles which</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">hâve</hi><hi rend="italic">0 as their centre remain unaltered
                    also.</hi></p>
                <p>It is quite natural to speak of this motion as a “rotation,” and thus we may
                    assert the truth in generalized measurement of the well-known theorem in
                    ordinary geometry that <hi rend="italic">Every displacement of a plane upon
                    itself could have been produced by a rotation of the plane around a certain
                    point in the plane.</hi></p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the rotation of the plane round 0, the two tangents from 0 to the
                    fundamental conic and also their chord of intersection, or the polar of 0,
                    remain unaltered; each point on the polar of 0 is displaced along the polar, and
                    we would in ordinary geometry call this motion a translation parallel to the
                    polar. It thus appears that, in the sense now attributed to the words rotation
                    and translation, a rotation round a point is identical with a translation along
                    the polar of the point.</p>
                <p>Another point on which the present theory throws light on the ordinary geometry
                    must be here alluded to. We have seen that the two tangents from 0 to the
                    fundamental conic remain unchanged during the rotation of the plane round 0. It
                    certainly does seem paradoxical to assert that a plane and all it contains are
                    rotated around a point, and that nevertheless this operation does not alter the
                    position of a certain pair of lines in the plane which pass through the point.
                    But have we not precisely the same difficulty in ordinary geometry? Let us
                    suppose that a plane pencil of rays is rotated through an angle 0 about the
                    origin. Then a line through the origin whose equation before the rotation was
                    <hi rend="italic">x + hy=O</hi> becomes after the rotation ae cos 0 + y sin 0 +
                    ⅛(y cos 0 - ae sin 0) = 0.</p>
                <p>The lines thus represented are of course in general different, but the” will be
                    the same if l+Λ <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> = 0.</p>
                <p>It follows that even in ordinary geometry the two lines κ±fy=O remain unaltered
                    notwithstanding the rotation of the plane which <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n698/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0698-0667"/> contains them around their intersection. The two
                    lines here referred to are of course those which are drawn through the two
                    circular points at infinity. This paradox is therefore only a degraded form of
                    the property of the tangents to the fundamental conic.</p>
                <p>It can also be readily shown that, <hi rend="italic">if a plane receive two small
                    rotations round two points, then the total rotation produced could have been
                    produced by a single rotation about a certain point on the line joining the two
                    points.</hi></p>
                <p>Let A, B be the two points and P the pole of the line AB, then a rotation round A
                    will displace B along the line PB to an adjacent point B'. The rotation around B
                    will displace A to A' along the line PA; but, if A'B' intersects AB in 0, then a
                    single rotation about 0 would have effected the required displacement of A and
                    B, and therefore of the whole line. For, as the point 0 in the line AB could
                    only move by displacement into the line A'B', while it can also only move in the
                    direction OP, it must obviously remain unaltered.</p>
                <p>We are now in a position to inquire how the magnitude of an angle is to be
                    expressed in the present system of measurement. Our definition of the magnitude
                    of an angle must be made consistent with the supposition that when the angle is
                    carried round by rotation about the vertex the magnitude shall remain unaltered.
                    As anharmonic ratios are unaltered by the rotation, it follows that the
                    anharmonic ratio of the pencil formed by the two legs of the angle and the two
                    tangents to the fundamental conic must remain unaltered. Remembering that the
                    tangents do not move by the rotation, it is natural to choose a function of this
                    anharmonic ratio as the appropriate measure of an angle. The question still
                    remains as to what function should be chosen. The student of ordinary geometry
                    is doubtless aware that the angle between two lines multiplied into 2i is equal
                    to the logarithm of the anharmonic ratio of the pencil formed by joining the
                    intersection of the two lines to the two imaginary circular points at infinity.
                    This consideration suggests that the angle between the straight lines in the
                    generalized sense may be appropriately measured by the logarithm of the
                    anharmonic ratio of the pencil formed by the two legs of the angle and the two
                    tangents drawn from their point of intersection to the fundamental conic. There
                    is also a convenience in assuming the angle to be actually <hi rend="italic"
                    >equal</hi> to c times the logarithm of the anharmonic ratio, where <hi
                    rend="italic">c</hi> is the same constant as is employed in the expression of
                    the distance. In this case the angle between two lines is by a well-known
                    theorem equal to the distance between their poles. There is here an analogy to a
                    well-known theorem in spherical geometry.</p>
                <p>It will now be obvious that, however the angle be situated, its magnitude is
                    unchanged by any displacement of the plane; for, as we have already seen that
                    the displacement does not alter the distance between the poles of the two lines
                    forming the angle, it follows that the magnitude of the angle itself is
                    unaltered.</p>
                <p>Just as in the measurement of distance we find a pair of fundamental points on
                    each straight line, so in the measurement of angles we find a pair of
                    fundamental rays in each plane pencil. These rays are the two tangents from the
                    vertex of the pencil to the fundamental conic. In ordinary geometry the two
                    fundamental points on each straight line coalesce into the single point at
                    infinity; but it is exceedingly interesting to observe that even in ordinary
                    geometry the two fundamental rays on each pencil do not coincide. It should also
                    be observed that in the degraded circumstances of ordinary geometry it would be
                    impracticable to employ the <hi rend="italic">same</hi> constant c for the
                    purpose of both linear and angular measurement.</p>
                <p>It is easy to see that the definition of a right angle in the generalized sense
                    is embodied in the statement that “if two corresponding legs of an harmonic
                    pencil touch the fundamental conic then the two other legs are at right angles.”
                    We also see that all the perpendiculars to a given line pass through a point,
                    <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the pole of the given line; and from a given point
                    a perpendicular can be drawn to a given line by joining the point to the pole of
                    the line. The common perpendicular to two lines is obtained by joining their
                    poles.</p>
                <p>The student of modern geometry is already accustomed to think of parallel lines
                    as lines which intersect at infinity, or as lines whose inclination is zero. In
                    speaking of the generalized geometry <hi rend="italic">in a plane,</hi> we may
                    define that <hi rend="italic">two straight lines which intersect upon the
                    fundamental conic are parallel.</hi> It thus follows that through any point two
                    distinct parallels can be drawn to a given straight line. The only exception
                    will arise in the case where the given line touches the fundamental conic. This
                    is precisely the case in which the generalized system of measurement degrades to
                    the ordinary system. It will follow that in the present theory of measurement
                    the three angles of a triangle are together not equal to two right angles. In
                    fact, to take an extreme case, we may suppose the three vertices of the triangle
                    to lie upon the fundamental conic. In this case each of the three angles, and
                    therefore their sum, is equal to zero.</p>
                <p>A sphere in the generalized system of measurement is the locus of a point which
                    moves at a constant distance from a fixed point. It can therefore be easily
                    shown that a sphere is a quadric which touches the fundamental quadric along its
                    intersection with the polar plane of the centre of the sphere.</p>
                <p>In discussing the general case of the displacement of a rigid system it will
                    simplify matters to suppose that the fundamental quadric has real rectilinear
                    generators. It must, however, be understood that the results are not on that
                    account less general. A displacement must not alter the quadric, and must not
                    deform a straight line. Hence it follows that the only effect of a displacement
                    upon a generator of the fundamental quadric will be to convey it to a position
                    previously occupied by a different generator. We shall further suppose that the
                    displacement is such that the two generators to which we have referred belong to
                    the same system. Let A, B, C, D be four generators of the first system which by
                    displacement are brought to coincide with four other generators A', B', O', D'.
                    Let X be one generator of the second system which the displacement brings to X'.
                    Since the anharmonic ratio of the four points in which four fixed generators of
                    the one system are cut by any generator of the other system is constant, we must
                    have,, using an obvious notation for anharmonic ratio,</p>
                <p>X(ABCD) = X'(ABCD); but, since anharmonic ratios are unaltered by displacement,
                    we have</p>
                <p>X( ABCD) = X'( A'B'C'D'), whence</p>
                <p>X'(ABCD) = X'( A'B'C'D').</p>
                <p>It therefore follows that the anharmonic ratio in which four generators cut a
                    fixed generator X' is equal to the anharmonic ratio in which the four generators
                    after displacement cut the same generator X ’.</p>
                <p>If P be a generator which passes through one of the double points on X'
                    determined by the two systems of points in which X' is cut by the four
                    generators before and after displacement, we must have</p>
                <p>X(A, B, C, P) = X'(A', B', C', P); hence we see that the generator P will be
                    unaltered by displacement. Similar reasoning applies to the generator which
                    passes through the other double point, and of course to a pair of generators of
                    the second system, and hence we have the following remarkable theorem :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">In the most general displacement of a rigid system two
                    generators of each of the systems on the f undamental quadric remain
                    unaltered.</hi></p>
                <p>These four fixed generators are the edges of a tetrahedron. Denot* ing the four
                    faces of this tetrahedron by the equations <hi rend="italic">x=Q, y = 0, z=G, w
                    = Q,</hi> the equation of the fundamental quadric is <hi rend="italic">xz +
                    hPyw=0.</hi></p>
                <p>If the quadric be unaltered by the transformation a∕=αa ’, <hi rend="italic"
                    >y'=βy,</hi> z'=γs, <hi rend="italic">w'=δw,</hi> then we must have <hi
                    rend="italic">aγ = βδ.</hi></p>
                <p>When this condition is satisfied, then, whatever <hi rend="italic">h</hi> may be,
                    every quadric of the family <hi rend="italic">xz + hy w</hi> = 0</p>
                <p>will remain unaltered.</p>
                <p>The family of quadrics here indicated are analogous to the right circular
                    cylinders which have for a common axis the screw along which any displacement of
                    a rigid body in ordinary space may be effected.</p>
                <p>The two lines <hi rend="italic">x=0, z≈0</hi> and</p>
                <p>2∕=0, <hi rend="italic">w = 0</hi> are conjugate polars with respect to the
                    fundamental quadric, and both these lines are unaltered by the displacement.
                    Hence we see that <hi rend="italic">in any displacement of a rigid system there
                    are two right lines which remain unaltered, and these lines are
                    conjugate</hi><hi rend="italic">polars</hi><hi rend="italic">with respect to the
                    f undamental quadric.</hi></p>
                <p>Since the pole of a plane through one of these lines lies on the other line, it
                    appears that <hi rend="italic">a rotation of a rigid system about a straight
                    line is identical with a translation of the system along its conjugate
                    polar.</hi></p>
                <p>Clifford has pointed out the real nature of the lines which are to be called
                    parallel in the generalized system of measurement. Wo have explained that in the
                    plane two parallel lines intersect upon the fundamental conic; in a certain
                    sense also we may consider two lines in space of three dimensions to be
                    parallel, whenever they intersect upon the fundamental quadric. This is the view
                    of parallel lines to which we are conducted by simply generalizing the property
                    that two parallel lines intersect at infinity. But we can take a different
                    definition of two parallel lines. Let us, for example, call two lines parallel
                    when they admit of an indefinitely large number of common perpendiculars. It is
                    exceedingly interesting <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n699/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0699-0668"/> to observe that when this condition is fulfilled
                    in the generalized •system of measurement the parallel lines so obtained enjoy
                    many of the properties of ordinary parallel lines. The perpendicular distance
                    between such a pair of parallels is constant, and the angles which they make
                    with any common transversal are equal.</p>
                <p>It will be shown in a moment that any pair of straight lines which intersect the
                    same two generators of the same system on the fundamental quadric are parallel
                    in this new sense. The fact is that in the degraded circumstances of ordinary
                    geometry two quite different conceptions have become confused, A pair of lines
                    which intersect on the fundamental quadric and a pair of lines which intersect
                    the same pair of generators of the same kind on the fundamental quadric are
                    quite different conceptions; but when the fundamental quadric degrades to the
                    ordinary infinity then the conceptions coalesce, and each of them is merely a
                    pair of parallel lines in the ordinary sense of the word. The ordinary
                    properties of parallel lines have all their analogues in the generalized
                    geometry, but these analogues are distributed between the two original sources
                    of parallels. Clifford proposes to retain the word “parallel” in non-Euclidean
                    space for that conception which exhibits the more remarkable properties of
                    ordinary space, and defines as follows :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Straight lines which intersect the same two generators of the
                    same system on the fundamental quadric are parallel.</hi></p>
                <p>Let X and Y be two rectilinear generators of the fundamental quadric belonging to
                    the same system, and let A and B be two straight lines which intersect both X
                    and Y. Since AX and AY are tangent planes their poles must lie on X and Y
                    respectively, and therefore A' (and B'), the polar of A (and B), must intersect
                    both X and Y. The anharmonic ratio of the four points in which X intersects AB,
                    A'B' respectively is equal to that of the tangent planes drawn at the points
                    where X intersects A'B', AB respectively; and, as all these tangent planes
                    contain X, their anharmonic ratio must be equal to that in which they are cut by
                    the line Y. It hence follows that the lines X and Y are divided
                    equianharmonically by the four rays A, B, A', B', and therefore the four rays A,
                    B, A', B' must be all generators of the same system on an hyperboloid. An
                    infinite number of transversals can therefore be drawn to intersect these four
                    rays, that is to say, an infinite number of common perpendiculars can be drawn
                    to the two rays A and B, and it is easy to show that the lengths of all these
                    perpendiculars are equal.</p>
                <p>Clifford has proved the very remarkable theorem that rotations of equal amplitude
                    about two conjugate polars have simply the effect of translating every point
                    operated on through equal distances along parallel lines. This property leads to
                    most important consequences, but it would lead us too far to enter into the
                    subject at present.</p>

                    of this description will be found in the <hi rend="italic">Transactions of the
                    Royal Irish Academy,</hi> vol. xxvii. pp. 157-184.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Units of Measurement.—</hi> A most excellent account of the
                    units employed in scientific measurements will be found in Professor J. D.
                    Everett’s <hi rend="italic">Units and Physical Constants,</hi> London, 1879. We
                    shall here only give a very brief outline of this branch of the general theory
                    of measurement, referring inquirers to Everett’s volume for further details.</p>
                <p>Most of the quantities for which measurements are needed can be ultimately
                    expressed by means of (1) a definite length, (2) a definite mass, or (3) a
                    definite interval of time.</p>
                <p>It is very important that the units thus referred to should be chosen
                    judiciously, and it must be admitted that the units ordinarily used do not
                    fulfil the conditions which a well-chosen system of units should fulfil. The
                    most scientific system is beyond doubt that which has been suggested by the
                    units committee of the British Association. In this system the unit of length is
                    the <hi rend="italic">centimetre,</hi> the unit of mass is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >gramme,</hi> and the unit of time is the <hi rend="italic">second,</hi> and the
                    system is therefore often referred to for brevity as the C.G.S. system. The unit
                    of force is termed the <hi rend="italic">dyne,</hi> and it is defined to be the
                    force which, .acting upon a gramme of matter for a second, generates a velocity
                    of a centimetre per second. The unit of work is the work done by this force
                    working through a centimetre, and this unit is termed the <hi rend="italic"
                    >erg.</hi> The unit of power is the power of doing work at the rate of one erg
                    per second, and the power of an engine can be specified in ergs per second. By
                    the prefixes deca, hecto, kilo, mega, we can express a magnitude equal to the
                    unit multiplied by 10, 100, 1000, or 1,000,000 respectively. On the other hand
                    the prefixes deci, centi, milli, micro, signify the units divided by 10, 100,
                    1000, or 1,000,000 respectively.</p>
                <p>For comparison with the ordinary units the following statements will be useful.
                    The weight of a gramme at any part of the earth’s surface is about 980 dynes, or
                    rather less than a kilodyne. The weight of a kilogramme is rather less than a
                    megadyne, being about 980,000 dynes.</p>
                <p>The application of these units to electrical and many other measurements will be
                    found in Professor Everett’s book already referred to. On the general principles
                    of appliances for measurement, see a paper by Clifford in the <hi rend="italic"
