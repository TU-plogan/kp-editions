                    and 75 ’ 4' and 79° 33' W. long. It is bounded on the N. by Pennsylvania and
                    Delaware; E. by Delaware and the Atlantic Ocean; and S. and W. by Virginia and
                    West Virginia. The total area of the State is 12,210 square miles, of which
                    about 2350 square miles are covered by the waters of the Chesapeake Bay and of

                    and a shallow lagoon, called Sinepuxent Bay, extend along its entire length. The
                    central geographical feature of the State is the Chesapeake Bay, the greatest
                    inlet in the United States, and one which is navigable throughout for the
                    largest vessels. The bay at its ocean mouth, between Cape Charles and Cape
                    Henry, is 12 miles wide; it extends north and south about 200 miles; its breadth

                    extremely irregular, is deeply indented with estuaries. That part of the State
                    which lies between the bay on the west and the State of Delaware and the ocean
                    on the east is locally known as the Eastern Shore. The surface of this region is
                    for the most part level, and but little raised above the sea. The peninsula
                    between the Potomac river and the west shore of the bay constitutes another
                    geographical division similar in its general features to the Eastern Shore. Its
                    surface, however, is more undulating, and on the north-west it rises to a ledge
                    of Primitive rocks which runs from the Potomac river at a point about 10 miles
                    above Washington city north-east to the Susquehanna river, and separates the
                    tide-water portion of the State from the third division. This latter region
                    gradually rises as it extends westward until it culminates in the mountains of
                    the great Appalachian range, which are called, in Maryland, the Blue Ridge and
                    the Alleghanies. The principal rivers of the Eastern Shore are the Pocomoke,
                    Nanticoke, Choptank, and Elk. These are rather estuaries than rivers, and are
                    not navigable for any distance from their mouths. The Susquehanna flows into the
                    bay at its head, and is navigable for a few miles. On the western shore are the
                    Potomac, navigable for 125 miles, to Washington city, the Patuxent,—the largest
                    river which is altogether within the State,—navigable for small vessels for 40
                    miles, and the Patapsco, on which Baltimore city is situated, navigable for 22
                    miles. The tide rises and falls in all these rivers. With the exception of the
                    Youghiogheny, all the Maryland streams flow into the Chesapeake Bay.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geology and Minerals.—</hi> A great diversity of geological
                    formation is found in Maryland. The lower part of the Eastern Shore is an
                    alluvial plain, and the numerous islands in the bay are composed of similar
                    alluvial deposits. The northern part of the Eastern Shore, beginning at the
                    Choptank river, is a Tertiary formation, whose strata of sands and clays
                    overspread deposits of marl, which is of great value as a fertilizer. The
                    peninsula on the western shore of the bay belongs to the same Tertiary
                    formation, which, towards the north-west, gives place to a range of metamorphic
                    rocks. This belt of rocks, which includes a strip of New Red Sandstone, enters
                    the State near the head of the bay, and extends south-west to the Potomac, with
                    an average breadth of about 20 miles. The principal rocks are gneiss,
                    talc-slates, limestone, granite, serpentine, and divers hydrated magnesian
                    silicates. The limestone supplies a marble highly valued as a building material,
                    and the serpentine rocks yield the valuable metallic element of chromium, which
                    has been extensively and profitably worked. Oxides of iron occur in gneiss, and
                    the Jurassic clays contain the brown haematite ores from which iron is
                    manufactured. These ores were worked even during the colonial period, and in
                    1751 Maryland exported 2950 tons of pig iron to England. Bog iron ore is also
                    found on the Eastern Shore. Beds of different kinds of clays which are used in
                    the manufacture of bricks, porcelain, &amp;c., are abundant, and veins of copper
                    ore are also worked. Passing westward of the metamorphic rocks, we meet a wide
                    belt of Silurian and Devonian formation, and the first ridge of the Appalachian
                    range, beyond which lies the broad Hagerstown valley resting upon Trenton
                    limestone. Numerous parallel ridges, enclosing valleys of great fertility, and
                    .belonging to the Middle Silurian, Devonian, and Carboniferous formations,
                    follow. This belt of lines of elevation nearly parallel with the ocean, which is
                    a characteristic of the Appalachian chain, has, in Maryland, an average breadth
                    of about 40 miles, and trends to the south west. The mountainous region, which
                    extends to the western extremity of the State, but with elevations rarely
                    exceeding 2500 feet, begins at Cumberland, and here the Silurian and Devonian
                    formations give place to the Carboniferous. This portion of Maryland is one of
                    the most important bituminous coal regions in America. There are several
                    coal-fields with horizontal seams lying near the surface, but the most
                    considerable is that of the George’s Creek valley between Dan’s Mountain on the
                    east and Savage Mountain on the west. This narrow valley, about 20 miles long,
                    contains the “big seam ' ’ of bituminous coal, of the extraordinary thickness of
                    14 feet. The Maryland coal is unequalled in the manufacture of iron and the
                    generation of steam. The number of tons minedin 1881 was 2,261,918, and it is
                    estimated that 550 square miles of Coal-measures remain. This Carboniferous
                    formation also contains deposits of iron ore which are extensively worked.</p>

                <p>The soil of the Eastern Shore, and of the peninsula on the western shore of the
                    bay, is composed of sand and clay, and when properly cultivated is very
                    productive. Much attention is there bestowed upon the growth of peaches and
                    other fruits. The land in the central part of the State, and in the valleys of
                    the mountainous part, is of great fertility. The original forest still covers a
                    considerable area of the western portion. There are about one hundred species of
                    trees in the State. The deciduous oaks, hickory, chestnut, walnut, cedar, and
                    beech trees are especially abundant. The bay and its estuaries contain
                    inexhaustible beds of the finest oysters, yielding many thousand bushels
                    annually.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In 1880 the

                    32,405 acres, 288,067 bushels; wheat, 569,296 acres, 8,004,864 bushels. The live
                    stock on the farms, June 1, 1880, was as follows :—horses, 117,796; mules and
                    asses, 12,561; working oxen, 22,246; milch cows, 122,907; other cattle, 117,387;
                    sheep, 171,184; swine, 335,408.</p>
                <p>The statistics of the iron and steel industries for 1880 showed that the number
                    of establishments in Maryland was twenty-three; capital, $4,962,125; number of
                    hands, 2763; wages paid, $905,090; valueof materials, $2,888,574; value of
                    products, $4,470,050. The production of pig iron was 59,664 tons. The cotton
                    manufactures had 2325 looms, 125,014 spindles, used 46,947 bales of cotton, and
                    employed 4159 hands. Baltimore stands eighth in the list of manufacturing cities
                    in the United States. The number of establishments in that city is 3596; capital
                    $35,760,108; average number of hands employed 55,201; annual product
                    $75,621,388.</p>
                <p>The large foreign commerce of the State is conducted almost wholly through the
                    port of Baltimore, although there are two other ports of entry. In 1881 the
                    number of foreign vessels arriving was 1307; in 1880, 1508. The number of
                    foreign clearances in 1881 was 1179; in 1880, 1633. The number of vessels
                    registered in the State is 1788. The chief imports are iron, coffee, and salt;
                    the chief exports, tobacco, petroleum, and grain. The grain elevators at
                    Baltimore have a capacity of 6,150,000 bushels. In 1880 the value of the foreign
                    imports was $18,643,245, and that of the foreign exports $74,398,971. The
                    aggregate exchanges at the Baltimore clearing house in 1881 were $732,448,141.
                    There are one hundred and fifty-two fire and marine insurance companies doing
                    bιιsiness in the State. In 1881 these received $1,680,109 in premiums, and paid
                    losses amounting to $1,015,658. The twenty-nine life insurance companies in the
                    State received in 1881 $1,116,540 in premiums, and paid losses amounting to
                    $895,092.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Railways and Canals.—</hi> The Baltimore and Ohio Railway,
                    incorporated in 1827, is one of the chief lines of communication between the·
                    seaboard and the Western States. The number of miles of all railways in
                    operation wholly within the State is 1048. The Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, begun
                    in 1828, and completed in 1845, at a cost of $11,375,000, extends from
                    Cumberland, along the left bank of the Potomac, to Georgetown, in the District
                    of Columbia, a distance of 184 miles. It there crosses the river by an aqueduct
                    and continues to Alexandria, Va. Its depth is 6 feet and its width varies from
                    52 to 70 feet. The Chesapeake and Delaware Canal, connecting the Chesapeake and
                    Delaware Bays, is 12 miles long, 66 feet wide, 10 feet deep, and cost
                    $3,547,561.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Revenue, Debts, Taxation.—</hi> The total amount of the funded
                    debt of the State on September 30, 1881, was $11,257,560. About one-half of this
                    debt bears interest at 5 per cent., and the remainder at 6 per cent. As an
                    offset to this debt the State owns interest-paying securities amounting to
                    $3,461,085, and non-productive property valued at 25 million dollars. The
                    property assessed for purposes of State taxation in 1881 was valued at
                    $461,459,939, and the State tax was 181 cents on each $100. The total receipts
                    of the State from all sources were $1,996,641. The debt of Baltimore city, on
                    January 1, 1882, was $36,381,351. The city owns productive property worth
                    $15,304,596, and unproductive property valued at $5,150,780. The property
                    assessed for city taxation was valued at $247,230,189, and the city tax was
                    $1’37 on each $100. The debts of the cities and counties, exclusive of
                    Baltimore, amount to nearly two million dollars.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Social Statistics.—</hi> In 1881 the average number of convicts
                    in the State penitentiary was 545, nearly one-half of whom were sentenced for
                    larceny. The convicts are employed upon profitable labour, and the institution
                    is not only self-supporting, but is a source of revenue to the State. The State
                    house of correction received in 1881 414 prisoners, most of whom were sentenced
                    for short terms. Provision is made for juvenile offenders in houses of
                    reformation and similar establishments. The number of inmates in the almshouses
                    in 1879 was 2384. The M'Donogh Industrial School has an endowment of $861,968,
                    and educates and supports about fifty poor boys annually. The State extends its
                    aid to a hospital for the insane (with 400 inmates), an asylum for the blind,
                    two deaf and dumb asylums, and other charitable institutions. In 1880 there
                    λvere one hundred and thirty-eight periodicals published in the State. The
                    principal religious denominations are the Methodist, Roman Catholic,
                    Episcopalian, Presbyterian, and Baptist.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Education and Libraries.—</hi> Maryland has an excellent system
                    of free public schools supported by State, county, and municipal taxation. In
                    1881 the number of schools was 2039, the number of pupils 158,909, the number of
                    teachers 3180, and the total expenses $1,604,580. The schools are managed by
                    school commissioners who, in the counties, are appointed by the judges of the
                    circuit courts, and in Baltimore city are elected by the city council. There is
                    also a State board of education, invested with comprehensive visitorial powers.
                    A number of higher educational institutions are maintained in part by the State.
                    The principal of these are the normal school at Baltimore, St John’s College at
                    Annapolis (founded in 1783), the Western Maryland, Maryland Agricultural,
                    Baltimore Female, Washington, and Frederick colleges. In 1881 these colleges had
                    723 students and 56 instructors, and received from the State $40,300. In
                    Baltimore are two medical colleges—the college of physicians and surgeons, with
                    10 professors and 330 students, and the medical school of the university of
                    Maryland, with 10 instructors and 200 students. There are also two dental
                    colleges in the State. The law school of the university of Maryland has 4
                    instructors and 60 students. The Johns Hopkins University, at Baltimore, which
                    has an endowment of more than 3 million dollars, was opened in 1876. It has 34
                    professors and associates, 20 fellows, 155 students, and 12,000 volumes in its
                    library. The buildings of the Johns Hopkins Hospital, which has a similar
                    endowment of more than 3 million dollars, are now (1882) being erected. The
                    Peabody Institute, which has $1,300,000 in productive funds, the gift of George
                    Peabody, was founded in 1857. It embraces a lecture department, a conservatory
                    of music, a gallery of fine arts, and a library. The library, containing 75,459
                    volumes in 1882, is designed to be a collection of such books as are not
                    ordinarily accessible to scholars. The Pratt Public Library, endowed with one
                    million dollars, was founded in 1882.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration.—</hi> The chief executive officer of the State
                    is the governor, who is elected for the term of four years, and receives a
                    salary of $4500 per annum. He is invested with power to grant pardons and
                    reprieves except in cases of impeachment, and a three-fifths vote of the
                    legislature is necessary to overcome his veto of an Act. The legislature, called
                    the General Assembly, meets biennially, and its sessions are limited by the
                    constitution to ninety days. It is composed of a senate, elected for four years
                    (one-half being chosen every second year), and a house of delegates, elected for
                    two years. The present number of senators is 26, and of delegates 91. The
                    judicial power of the State is vested in a court of appeals, consisting of 8
                    judges, in a circuit court and an orphans’ court for each county, in six courts
                    of record for Baltimore city, and in justices of the peace. The judges are
                    elected by the people for fifteen years, and retire upon attaining the age of
                    seventy years. The justices of the peace are appointed by the governor, with the
                    consent of the senate. The law officers are an attorneygeneral for the State,
                    and a State’s attorney for each county, who is the prosecuting officer in all
                    criminal cases. The local affairs of the counties are managed by county
                    commissioners elected for two years, and those of each city by a mayor and city
                    council. All elections are by ballot, and every male citizen of the United
                    States who has been a resident of the State for one year and of the district in
                    which he offers to vote for six months preceding the election is entitled to be
                    registered as a voter. The present constitution was adopted in 1867. Maryland is
                    represented in the national congress by two senators and six representatives.
                    The arms of the State are those prescribed by Lord Baltimore for the province in
                    1648, viz. :—quarterly—1st and 4th, paly of six, or and sable, a bend

                    charter of Maryland, which constituted the first proprietary government
                    established in America, was obtained from Charles I. by Sir George Calvert, the
                    first Lord Baltimore, who had been one of the principal secretaries of state to
                    James I. Lord Baltimore died before the patent passed the seals, and it was
                    issued to his son the second Lord Baltimore on June 20, 1632. The name Maryland
                    <hi rend="italic">(Terra Maries')</hi> was bestowed upon the colony by Charles
                    I. in honour of his queen Henrietta Maria. In 1633 Lord Baltimore despatched a
                    number of emigrants, under the command of his brother Leonard Calvert, to
                    colonize the territory. They settled at St Alary’s on the 27th March 1634, and
                    the first legislative assembly, which was composed of all the freemen of the
                    province, met in February 1635. Before the grant of the charter a trading
                    station had been established, by William Clayborne of Virginia, upon Kent
                    Island, in Chesapeake Bay, and the early years of the colony were greatly
                    disturbed by contests with him, in which, however, Lord Baltimore was finally
                    successful. The Baltimores were Catholics, and Maryland was designed to be a
                    place of refuge for English Catholics, but, from the earliest period, religious
                    toleration for all Christians was proclaimed and practised. Maryland has always
                    claimed the honour of having been the first government in which liberty in
                    matters of faith was established by law. Under the charter by which Maryland was
                    made a province of the empire Baltimore was the owner of the soil, and enjoyed
                    all the rights that had ever been exercised by a count palatine. The laws of the
                    provincial assemblies which received his assent were not subject to the revision
                    of the crown. In 1652 the parliamentary commissioners deposed Lord Baltimore’s
                    officers, and appointed a Puritan council to govern the province. After several
                    years of contest between the proprietary and Puritan parties, the power of the
                    former was finally re-established. At the time of the Revolution of 1688 the
                    failure of Lord Baltimore’s deputies to proclaim William and Mary gave an
                    opportunity to the disaffected Protestants in the province to incite a revolt,
                    which resulted in the overthrow of their feudal lord. The king and queen
                    approved of this colonial Protestant revolution, and Maryland was taken directly
                    under the government of the crown. The Church of England was then established,
                    and disabilities imposed upon Catholics and dissenters. Maryland remained a
                    royal colony until 1714, when, upon the death of the third Lord Baltimore, his
                    son, who was a Protestant, was recognized as the proprietary. The province was
                    governed by the Baltimores until the revolution of 1776. The original charter
                    limits included all the present State of Delaware and a large part of
                    Pennsylvania. The grant to William Penn conflicted with that of Maryland, and a
                    controversy between the two colonies began in 1682, and was not concluded until
                    1760, when the Penns, armed with a decision of the privy council and a decree in
                    chancery, were successful. “ ^Iason and Dixon’s line”—famous in American
                    politics— was established between the provinces in 1763-67. During the war for
                    independence Maryland furnished her full quota of troops, but refused to ratify
                    the articles of confederation until those colonies which had claims to western
                    lands surrendered them to the general Government. Washington resigned his
                    commission as commander-in-chief to the colonial congress at Annapolis in
                    December 1783. Maryland ratified the constitution of the United States on
                    the</p>
                <p>28th April 1788, and in 1790 ceded to the United States 60 square miles of
                    territory, where the national capital is situated. At the outbreak of the civil
                    war Maryland was a slave-holding State, and popular sentiment was divided
                    between the North and the South, but the decisive measures adopted by the
                    Federal Government made it impossible for the State to leave the Union. The
                    history of the State has been written by M*Mahon (1831), Bozman (1837), M‘Sherry
                    (1849), and Scharf (1879). The Maryland Historical Society at Baltimore has a
                    large collection of colonial and revolutionary MSS., newspapers, and historical
                    works, and has published numerous essays upon questions of local history. (w. τ.
