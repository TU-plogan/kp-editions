                    rend="smallcaps">John, Count</hi></label> (1786-1855), Hungarian historian and
                    poet, was born at Pest on the 5th of October 1786. First educated at home, he
                    subsequently studied philosophy at Eger (Erlau) and law at Györ (Raab), his
                    father, Count Joseph Majlâth, an Austrian minister of state, eventually
                    obtaining for him an appointment in the public service. The weakness of his
                    eyesight having rendered it necessary for him a few years later to resign the
                    Government secretaryship to which he had been promoted, Majlâth turned his
                    attention to literature, especially devoting himself to historical research, and
                    the translation into German of Magyar folk-tales, and of selections from the
                    works of the best of his country’s native poets. Moreover, as an original
                    lyrical writer, and as an editor and adapter of old German poems, Majlâth showed
                    considerable talent; and, in general, his activity as an author was remarkable,
                    his various literary productions in German and Hungarian amounting together to
                    more than sixty volumes. During the greater part of his life he resided either
                    at Pest or Vienna, but a few years before his death he removed to Munich, where
                    he fell into a state of destitution and extreme despondency. Seized at last by a
                    terrible infatuation, he and his daughter Henriette, who had long been his
                    constant companion and amanuensis, determined to put an end to their dependent
                    position by drowning themselves in the Lake of Starnberg, a few miles south-west
                    of Munich. This fatal resolution was carried into effect on the 3d of January
                    1855.</p>
                <p>It is generally admitted that in his great historical treatises Count Majlath has
                    failed in a critical discrimination between the merely mythical or poetical and
                    the true historical element,—the former not unfrequently being allowed to unduly
                    influence and obscure the latter. The political tendency of his writings,
                    moreover, has been objected to, especially by his own countrymen, as being too
                    conservative and over-favourable to Austria. Of his historical works the most
                    important are the <hi rend="italic">Geschichte der Magyaren</hi> (Vienna,
