                <p><label type="entry">MAYENNE</label>, a department of north-western France,
                    three-fourths of which formerly belonged to Lower Maine and the remainder to
                    Anjou, lies between 47° 45' 10" and 48° 34' 30" N. lat., and 0° 2' E. and Γ 14'
                    W. long., and is bounded on the N. by Manche and Orne, on the E. by Sarthe, on
                    the S. by Maine-et-Loire, and on the W. by Ille-et-Vilaine, having a maximum
                    length from north to south of 51 miles, a breadth of 39 miles, and an area of
                    1996 square miles. Its ancient geological formations connect it with Brittany.
                    The surface is agreeably undulated; forests are numerous, and the beauty of the
                    cultivated portions is enhanced by the hedgerows and lines of trees by which the
                    farms are divided. Tie highest point of the department, and indeed of the whole
                    north-west of France, is the Mont des Avaloirs (1368 feet). Hydrographically
                    Mayenne belongs to the basins of the Loire, the Vilaine, and the Sélune; the
                    first-mentioned has the larger part of the entire area. The principal stream is
                    the Mayenne, which passes successively from north to south through the three
                    most important towns— Mayenne, Laval, and Château-Gontier; by means of weirs and
                    sluices it is navigable below Mayenne, but steamers do not ascend past
                    Château-Gontier. The chief affluents are the Jouanne on the left, and on the
                    right the Col-mont, the Ernée, and the Oudon. A small area in the east of the
                    department drains by the Erve into the Sarthe; the Vilaine rises in the west,
                    and in the north-west the S&lt;51une flows into the English Channel. The climate
                    of Mayenne, which is that of the Sequaniij^ region, is generally healthy except
                    in the neighbourhood of the numerous marshes. The temperature is lower and the
                    moisture of the atmosphere greater than in the neighbouring departments; the
                    rainfall is above the average for France.</p>
                <p>Of the entire area two-thirds are arable, and a twentieth is under wood. A large
                    number of horned cattle are reared (98,000 oxen, 150,000 cows), and in no other
                    French department are so many horses (92,500) found within the same area; the
                    breed, that of Craon, is famed for its strength. Craon has also given its name
                    to the most prized breed of pigs in western France. There are 83,000 pigs in the
                    department, 80,000 sheep, and 5000 goats. Mayenne produces excellent butter,
                    poultry, and game, and a large quantity of honey. The cultivation of the vine is
                    very limited, and the most common beverage is cider, of which nearly 9,000,000
                    gallons are annually made. Agriculture is in a flourishing condition; in 1878
                    were produced upwards of 3⅜ million bushels of wheat, f million of meslin,
                    nearly an equal amount of rye, 1⅛ million of barley, 2 million of oats, and
                    nearly 3 million bushels of potatoes, besides a large quantity of flax and hemp.
                    The timber grown is chiefly beech, oak, birch, elm, and chestnut. The department
                    produces a little iron-ore and manganese; it is rich in anthracite and coal, of
                    which, however, the annual production has recently decreased from 80,000 tons to
                    60,000. Marble and granite, limestone, slate, and porphyry are quarried; the
                    last-named material is capable of a fine polish, and is also used for paving the
                    streets of Paris. There are several chalybeate springs. The industries include
                    iron and brass founding, brick and tile making, brewing, the manufacture of
                    candles, cotton, linen, and woollen thread, and the production of various
                    textile fabrics (that of ticking being the specialty of the department),
                    agricultural implement making, wood and marble sawing, tanning, dyeing, and the
                    like. The population in 1881 was 343,167. The arrondissements are those of
                    Laval, Château-Gcntier, and Mayenne.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mayenne,</hi> capital of an arrondissement in the above
                    department of France, is an old feudal town irregularly built on two hillocks
                    which overlook the river Mayenne, at the point where the railway from Caen to
                    Laval is joined by that from Fougères to Alencon. The old castle still has
                    towards the river five towers, one of which has retained its conical roof; the
                    vaulted chambers and chapel are ornamented in the style of the 13th century; the
                    building is now used as a prison. The church of Notre Dame, dating partly from
                    the 12th century, is the only other building of any special interest. In the
                    Place de Cheverus is a statue, by David of Angers, to the cardinal of that name,
                    who was born in Mayenne. The chief <pb break="no"

                    which occupies 8000 persons in the town and neighbourhood. The population in
                    1876 was 10,098.</p>
                <p>Mayenne had its origin in the castle built here by Juhel, the son of Geoffroy of
                    Maine, in the beginning of the 11th century. It was besieged by William the
                    Conqueror, and afterwards by the earl of Salisbury; and the possession of it was
                    disputed by the Royalists and the Leaguers, as also by the Republicans and the
                    Vendeans.</p>
