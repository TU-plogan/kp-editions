                <p><label type="entry">MACEDONIA</label>, when that name is taken in its widest
                    signification, is the country between Thrace on the east and Illyria on the
                    west, bounded on the S. by Thessaly and the Aegean Sea, and on the N. by the
                    lands which belong to the basin of the D¾μube. The most definite limit in its
                    physical geography is that towards Illyria, where the Scardus range, which still
                    bears the name of <hi rend="italic">Schar,</hi> forms a continuous barrier
                    between the two countries; on the side of Thessaly also, Mount Olympus and the
                    Cambunian mountains constitute a well-marked frontier. In the other two
                    directions its natural limits are less clearly defined. Towards the east, during
                    the greater part of its history, the river Strymon was regarded as its proper
                    boundary; but after the foundation of the city of Philippi it encroached on
                    Thrace, and extended as far as the river Nestus, or even Mount Rhodope. With
                    regard to the features of the country immediately to the north of Macedonia a
                    misconception long prevailed, which has only of late years been dispelled by
                    geographical research. Owing to a misinterpretation of a passage in Strabo (vii.
                    fragm. 10; <hi rend="italic">cf.</hi> vii. 5, 1), it was long believed that the
                    country between the Danube and the Aegean was divided in the middle by a lofty
                    range of mountains, which formed a continuation of the main chain of the Alps as
                    far as the Euxine; and this mistake is perpetuated in many of our maps at the
                    present day. But since this district has been explored, first by Grisebach, and
                    afterwards by Von Hahn, it has been known that along one important portion of
                    this supposed line, directly to the north of Macedonia and south-east of the
                    modern principality of Ser via, the hills do not rise to any considerable
                    elevation, and that affluents of the Margus (Morava), which flows into the
                    Danube, and of the Axius (Vardar), which runs to the Aegean, rise close together
                    in the upland plain of Kossova, the scene of the great battle in which the
                    Servian monarchy was overthrown by Sultan Amurath I. in 1389. This watershed may
                    be regarded as the northern boundary of Macedonia. But the extended limits which
                    have here been given did not belong to the district that bore that name in early
                    times. The original Macedonia was confined to the inland region west of the
                    Axius, between that river and the Scardus mountains, and did not include the
                    northern portion, which was known as Paeonia,. or the coast-land which, together
                    with the eastern districts, was inhabited by Thracian tribes, and was regarded
                    by the Greeks at the time of the Peloponnesian war as part of Thrace. The people
                    of this country were not Hellenic, though its rulers ultimately succeeded in
                    claiming that title for themselves, at the time when Alexander I. was admitted
                    as a competitor at the Olympic games. The same thing may be said of the land
                    itself, the appearance of which presents many points of contrast to that of
                    Greece proper. Instead of the delicate, bright, and varied scenery of that
                    country, with its clear atmosphere and sharp outlines, we find in Macedonia
                    broad masses of mountains, extensive sweeps of lowland, and uniformity of
                    colour. The climate of the inland regions also is severe, so that the cypress
                    and other trees which flourish in Greece will not grow there.</p>
                <p>The river Axius divides Macedonia into two parts, the eastern of which resembles
                    the neighbouring country of Thrace in the irregularity of its surface; but in
                    the western part there is a succession of valley-plains, generally elevated
                    themselves, though deeply sunk among the rocky walls that surround them. These
                    lie under the flanks of Mount Scardus, and differ in a still more striking
                    manner from the country of Illyria on the further side of that chain, which is
                    made up of a number of irregular, and usually narrow, river-valleys, separated
                    from one another by rugged mountains. The characteristics of these valleyplains
                    are the well-defined basins in which they lie, their rich alluvial soil, and the
                    river which waters each of them respectively, and in each case makes its exit
                    through a narrow passage, which is its only means of escape. The northernmost
                    and smallest of these is now called the Tettovo, and from it the main stream of
                    the Axius issues. At the southern extremity of this a branch detaches itself
                    from the Scardus, and bending southward forms an important secondary chain,
                    which is continued until, under the name of Bermius, it approaches Mount
                    Olympus. This branch, in the upper part of its range, forms the eastern boundary
                    of the second and most important valley-plain, that of Pelagonia (now the plain
                    of Monastir), from which the Erigon (Czerna) forces its way to join the Axius.
                    This plain, which is 40 miles in length by 10 in breadth, and 1500 feet above
                    the sea, was one of the primitive seats of the Macedonian race, and was suited
                    for developing a hardy yet thriving population which might afterwards become a
                    great people. Here is laid the scene of the story of the foundation of the
                    Macedonian monarchy, which Herodotus has related (viii. 137, 138). According to
                    this, three brothers of the family of the Temenidae of Argos, having entered the
                    service of the king of the country, and having been defrauded by him of their
                    wages, made their escape in a romantic manner, the narrative of which contains
                    numerous fabulous incidents, and ultimately conquered all Macedonia. The
                    southern part of this plain was called Lyncestis, and was the scene of the
                    encounter between Brasidas and the Illyrians, which Thucydides has described
                    (iv. 124-28); the famous retreat of that general was made by the pass at its
                    south eastern extremity.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n154/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0154-0137"/>
                <p>Between Lyncestis and the lowlands, near the coast, is a lake district of
                    somewhat inferior elevation, which bore the name of Eordaea. Again, to the
                    southward of Pelagonia is another extensive plain, from which the Haliacmon
                    (Vistritza) draws its waters; that river ultimately breaks through the Bermian
                    range behind Berrhoea (Verria), and flows into the Thermaic Gulf. The coast
                    district between the Haliacmon and Olympus, as well as the sea slopes of that
                    mountain, formed Pieria, the original home of the Muses. The chief cities of
                    Pieria were Pydna, where Perseus, the last king of Macedon, was defeated by the
                    Romans, and Dium. From this neighbourhood to the head of the Thermaic Gulf a
                    vast maritime plain extended, which was intersected by the Lydias and the Axius,
                    as well as the Haliacmon.</p>
                <p>The Scardus chain, which has been spoken of as separating Macedonia from Illyria,
                    is the northern continuation of Pindus, and the two together form a well-defined
                    backbone, which may be compared to the <hi rend="italic">spina</hi> of an
                    ancient circus. At its northern extremity, where it rises from the plain of
                    Kossova, stands a lofty peak, which, to carry out the comparison, may be called
                    the <hi rend="italic">meta</hi> or goal of the circus. This summit, which
                    reaches a height of between 7000 and 8000 feet, had no name in antiquity, but is
                    now known by the Slavonic appellation of Liubatrin, or the “Lovely Thorn.” The
                    mountain wall which starts from it presents a most imposing appearance from
                    every point of view, and is broken through at only one point, where the river
                    now called Devol, rising on its eastern side, divides it to its base as it flows
                    to the Adriatic. Here the chain of Scardus ends, and that of Pindus commences.
                    Northward of this it is crossed by two passes,—one near the headwaters of the
                    Axius, between the modern towns of Prisrend aud Calcandele; the other farther to
                    the south, leading from the head of the Lacus Lychnitis (Lake of Ochrida) into
                    the Pelagonian plain. At the southern end of this plain another chain diverges
                    from Scardus, and takes an easterly direction through Macedonia; in the region
                    between the Strymon and Nestus this was called Orbelus, and between it and the
                    sea lies Mount Pangaeus, which was famed for its gold and silver mines.</p>
                <p>The rivers of this country, notwithstanding that they are larger than any that
                    are found in Greece proper, can hardly be called navigable, though barges are
                    floated down them at the present day. The Axius, which is the most important, is
                    celebrated by Homer, on account of its fertilizing water, as “the fairest stream
                    that flows in all the earth ’’ (Z∕., ii. 850), and the valley in which it runs
                    must always have formed a line of communication between the barbarous districts
                    of the interior and the sea. The point of demarcation between the uplands and
                    the lowlands is marked by the Stena, or, as it is now called, the Iron Gate
                    (Demir Kapu) of the Vardar. Here the river cuts through at right angles the
                    mountains that join the Scardus and Orbelus ranges, and forms a deep ravine,
                    through which it rushes in rapids for the distance of a quarter of a mile,
                    beneath steep cliffs that rise to the height of 600 or 700 feet above; and
                    traces of groovings in the rocks are visible, where a passage has been made in
                    ancient times. At the point in its upper course where it receives its northern
                    tributaries, and begins to bend towards the south, stood the town of Scupi, the
                    name of which was changed by the Byzantines into Scopia, or “the look-out
                    place,” and has now been corrupted into Uskiub. The importance of this consisted
                    in its neighbourhood to the pass over the Scardus, by which the barbarian tribes
                    to the west used to descend into the more level and fertile country, and in its
                    commanding the principal line of traffic. Between Scupi and the Stena, at the
                    confluence of the Axius and the Erigon, was Stobi, the ruins of which have
                    recently been discovered by Μ. Heuzey, of the French “Mission de Macédoine.”
                    This town was in Roman times the meetingpoint of four great roads—one from the
                    Danube by Scupi; another from Sardica, near the modern Sophia, to the
                    north-east; a third from Heraclea (Monastir) to the south-west; and a fourth
                    from Thessalonica. The Strymon (Struma) follows a direction nearly parallel to
                    the Axius in eastern Macedonia, and, after passing through the chain of Orbelus,
                    enters the rich plain of Serrhae (Seres), and flows into the Lake of Prasias or
                    Cercinitis, shortly after emerging from which it reaches the sea. On the shores
                    of the Lake Prasias were a number of lacustrine habitations which Herodotus has
                    described, corresponding in their general features to those of which so
                    considerable remains have recently been discovered in Switzerland and elsewhere.
                    At the point where the Strymon leaves the lake was built the important town of
                    Amphipolis, which was surrounded on three sides by the river, thus occupying a
                    very strong position. It was founded by the Athenians in 437 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and was valuable on account of its neighbourhood to
                    the mines of Pangaeus, and as furnishing a large supply of timber. Its port, at
                    the mouth of the Strymon, was called Eion. The ancient capital of Macedonia,
                    Aegae or Edessa (Vodena), stood at the point where the passes from Lyncestis and
                    Eordaea emerge into the lower country. Its situation seems to suggest dominion;
                    for, while it has at its back all the resources of the richest districts, the
                    view from it embraces the wide maritime plain, the mighty mass of Olympus, and a
                    portion of the Thermaic Gulf. The site, which resembles that of Tivoli, is one
                    of extreme beauty, for below the level table of land on which the city is built
                    the rock falls some 200 feet in steep precipices, and the river which passes
                    through it, a tributary of the Lydias, divides into a number of smaller streams,
                    which plunge at various points in cascades down the cliffs. When Philip of
                    Macedon transferred the seat of government to Pella, Edessa continued to be the
                    national hearth of the race, and the burial-place of their kings. Pella, the
                    later capital, occupied a much inferior position, being on low hills at the edge
                    of an extensive marsh in the middle of the maritime plain. This was naturally an
                    unhealthy site, and its only strength lay in its swampy surroundings; so that
                    its nearness to the sea must have been its chief recommendation. The place is
                    now deserted, but the name of Pel is still attached to its vicinity. In Roman
                    times Thessalonica became the chief centre of these parts, which at all times it
                    deserves to be, for it is admirably placed for purposes of communication and
                    trade, as it lies on the innermost bay of the Thermaic Gulf, and forms the
                    natural point of transit for exports and imports. Its appearance recalls that of
                    Genoa, from tho way in which the houses rise from the water’s edge, and ascend
                    the hill-sides behind. This city was the terminus of the Via Egnatia, the great
                    Roman road which joined the Adriatic and the Aegean, and formed the main line of
                    communication between the West and the East. Starting from Dyrrhachium, it
                    threaded the defiles of Illyria, and, passing the Lacus Lychnitis, crossed the
                    Scardus by the southernmost of its two passes, which descends on Heraclea;
                    thence it traversed Lyncestis and Eordaea, till it reached Edessa, and finally
                    crossed the plain to Thessalonica.</p>
                <p>It remains to speak of the maritime district of Macedonia, called Chalcidice,
                    which projects like a trident into the north of the Aegean between the Thermaic
                    and Strymonie Gulfs. When seen on the map, it strikingly resembles the
                    Peloponnese in miniature, from its three southern promontories, with deep
                    intervening bays, and the massive breadth of ground from which these spring.
                    This resemblance is still further borne out in the form of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n155/mode/1up"

                    respects it corresponds so well to what the Greeks desired for their settlements
                    that we cannot be surprised at finding its shores fringed with Hellenic
                    colonies. Several of these were founded from Chalcis in Euboea, which city gave
                    its name to the district; but the important town of Potidaea was a Corinthian
                    colony. The most eastern of the three peninsulas, that of Acte, is far the
                    highest, and rises from its isthmus until it forms a steep central ridge, which
                    gradually attains the height of 4000 feet, and finally throws up the vast
                    conical peak of Mount Athos (6400 feet). The isthmus, which is about a mile and
                    a half broad, still shows traces of the canal made by Xerxes for the passage of
                    his fleet, in order to avoid the dangers of shipwreck on the rocks of Athos,
                    which had destroyed the expedition of Mardonius. On the land side of the isthmus
                    stood the city of Acanthus. Separated from Acte by the Singitic Gulf was the
                    promontory of Sithonia, with the town of Torone; and still farther to the west,
                    beyond the Toronaic Gulf, was that of Pallene. The former of these, though of
                    lower elevation than Acte, is intersected by a well-marked ridge; but the latter
                    is almost level, and from the traces of volcanic action that are found there was
                    called by the Greeks Phlegra, and was said to have been the scene of the
                    conflict between the giants and the gods. On the southern side of Pallene were
                    the towns of Mende and Scione, and its isthmus was occupied by Potidaea, near
                    which, at the head of the Toronaic Gulf, stood Olynthus. The Greek cities on
                    this coast were a continual thorn in the side of the Macedonian monarchs, and
                    caused them to take part against Athens during the Peloponnesian War. The
                    northern part of Chalcidice is mountainous, and beyond these mountains is a
                    considerable depression, in which lies the Lake of Bolbe.</p>
                <p>Macedonia first comes into notice in history in the reign of Amyntas (about 500
                    B. c. ) and in that of his son Alexander, who was king at the time of Xerxes’s
                    invasion of Greece. But whatever historical interest attaches to it is due
                    rather to the great empire which sprang from it than to the importance of the
                    country itself. During the Peloponnesian War we notice it chiefly as it affects
                    the principal contending parties, but in the time of Demosthenes it attracts our
                    attention as furnishing the keynote of the policy of that statesman, and being
                    the proximate cause of the overthrow of Greek liberty. After the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Macedonian Empire,</hi><hi rend="italic">(q. v.</hi>) was
                    subjugated by the Romans in 168 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> the country was
                    left with a nominal autonomy, but lost its national unity by being divided into
                    four districts, which were separated from one another by rigid political and
                    social’limitations. Before long it was reduced to the form of a province, and
                    this, at the division of the provinces in the time of Augustus, was assigned to
                    the senate. Thenceforward it followed the fortunes of the Roman empire, and,
                    after the partition of that dominion, of the eastern branch of it. In the time
                    of Alaric it was frequently plundered by the Goths, and in the interval which
                    elapsed between Justinian I. and Heraclius a considerable part of it was
                    colonized by Slavonians. During the prosperous period of the great Bulgarian
                    monarchy in the 10th century a large portion of Macedonia was included in that
                    kingdom. After that <hi rend="italic">age</hi> extensive depopulation must have
                    ensued, for in the 11th and 12th centuries colonies of various tribes of Asiatic
                    origin—Uzes, Turks, and Patzinaks—were established there by the emperors of
                    Constantinople. In the partition of the Eastern empire, which followed the
                    capture of that city by the Latins at the time of the fourth crusade, in 1204,
                    Macedonia was assigned to Boniface, marquis of Monferrat, who assumed the title
                    of king of Saloniki. This kingdom in turn was brought to an end in 1224 by the
                    Greek despot of Epirus, Theodore I., and by him a Greek empire of Thessalonica
                    was founded, which for a time seemed likely to become the heir of the Byzantine
                    power, but afterwards was merged in that of Nicaea, and on the recapture of
                    Constantinople by Michael Palaeologus once more formed part of a united Greek
                    empire. In the latter half of the 14th century the greater part of Macedonia was
                    in the possession of the Servians, whose kingdom was now at the height of its
                    power; but before the middle of the 15th it had passed into the hands of the
                    Ottoman Turks, by whom it has been held ever since. At the present day the
                    population of the inland part of the country is mainly composed of Bulgarian
                    Christians, mixed with Turks, while the Greeks occupy the coasts, the whole of
                    Chalcidice, the plain of Seres, and some other districts. (H. F. T.)</p>
