                    (1805-1867), Scotch landscape painter, was born in Glasgow in 1805. An early
                    friendship with Sir Daniel Macnee, and William Leitch, the water-colourist, was
                    the means of turning the lad’s attention to art, which he studied for a year
                    under John Knox, a Glasgow landscapist of some repute, with whom Macnee was
                    apprenticed at the time. After leaving the studio of Knox, we find him engaged
                    at Cumnock, painting the ornamental lids of snuff-boxes in the manufactory of
                    the Messrs Smith, and afterwards he was employed in Edinburgh by Lizars, the
                    engraver, to colour the illustrations in Selby’s <hi rend="italic">British
                    Birds</hi> and similar works. Meanwhile he was diligently prosecuting his
                    studies in higher walks of art, and working unweariedly from nature, greatly
                    influenced in his early practice by the watercolours of H. W. Williams,—“Grecian
                    Williams” as he was called,—whose works had a charm for the young painter after
                    the drier and more elaborate method of his first master. Returning to Glasgow in
                    some four or five years, he was employed by Mr Lumsden, the lord provost, on
                    several large pictures for the decoration of a public hall which he had erected
                    in St George’s Place, and be did a little as a theatrical scene-painter in
                    Kilmarnock and other provincial towns. About this time he was greatly impressed
                    with a picture by Thomson of Duddingston, and upon the works of this artist, the
                    greatest Scottish landscapist that had yet appeared, the art of Macculloch may
                    be said to have been founded. Gradually he asserted his individuality, and
                    formed his own style on a closer study of nature than had been possible to his
                    predecessor, and his works form an interesting link of connexion between the old
                    world of Scottish landscape and the new. By its love of elaborate and balanced
                    compositions, by its choice «of noble and exceptional scenes, his art connects
                    itself with that of sixty years ago; by its brilliant and varied colouring, by
                    its care for detail, it differentiates itself from the quietude and the stately
                    abstraction of the older landscape. In 1829 Macculloch first figured in the
                    Royal Scottish Academy’s exhibition, with a View of the Clyde, and, year by
                    year, till his death on the 24th of June 1867, he was a liberal contributor to
                    its displays. In 1838 he was elected a member of the Scottish Academy, Und came
                    to reside in Edinburgh, where his genial manners gathered round him a large and
                    appreciative circle of the artists and litterateurs of the city.</p>
                <p>Among the more important of the long series of landscapes which he produced,
                    subjects almost exclusively from Scottish scenery, may be mentioned—Moonlight
                    Deer Startled, 1840; Moor Scene, Sunset, 1841; A Dream of the Highlands, 1844;
                    Inversnaid Ferry, Loch Lomond, 1847; A Highland Deer Forest, 1856.; Ben Venue
                    from Silver Strand, 1862; and Bothwell Castle, 1863. Several works by Macculloch
                    were engraved by William Miller and William Forrest, and a volume of photographs
                    from hi? landscapes, with an excellent biographical notice of the artist by
                    Alexander Fraser, B.S.A., was published in Edinburgh in 1872.</p>
