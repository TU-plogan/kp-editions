                    (1723-1762), one of the greatest of last century’s astronomers, was born at
                    Marbach in Würtemberg, February 17, 1723. He was brought up at Esslingen in
                    comparatively poor circumstances, and as a mathematician was mainly self-taught.
                    He had already published several original geometrical tracts when, in 1746, he
                    entered Homann’s cartographic establishment at Nuremberg. Here he introduced
                    many improvements in map-making, and gained a scientific reputation which led
                    (in 1751) to his election to the chair of economy and mathematics in the
                    university of Göttingen. In 1754 he became superintendent of the observatory,
                    where he laboured with great zeal and success till his death, February 20, 1762.
                    His first important astronomical work was a careful investigation of the
                    libration of the moon <hi rend="italic">(Kosmo-graphische</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Nachrichten,</hi> Nuremberg, 1750), the elements of which and the position of
                    the moon’s axis of rotation he determined with much greater accuracy than had
                    previously been done. His great fame rests on his lunar tables, which were
                    published in 1753 along with new solar tables, and transmitted to England in
                    1755. These tables, which were compared by Bradley with the Greenwich
                    observations, and found to be sufficiently accurate to determine the longitude
                    at sea to within half a degree, solved the problem of practically determining
                    longitude anywhere on the earth’s surface. An improved set was afterwards
                    published in London (1770), as also the theory <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Theoria</hi><hi rend="italic">Lunae</hi><hi rend="italic">juxta
                    Systema</hi><hi rend="italic">Newtonianum,</hi> 1767) upon which the tables are
                    based. They were sent to England by his widow, who in consideration received
                    from the British Government a grant of £3000. Appended to the London edition of
                    the solar and lunar tables are two short tracts, —the one on determining
                    longitude by lunar distances, together with a description of the repeating
                    circle (invented by Mayer in 1760), the other on a formula for atmospheric
                    refraction, which applies a remarkably accurate correction for temperature.</p>
                <p>Mayer left behind him a considerable quantity of manuscript, part of which was
                    collected by Lichtenberg and published in one volume <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Opera</hi><hi rend="italic">Inedita,</hi> Gottingen, 1775). It contains,
                    amongst other papers, an easy and accurate method for calculating eclipses; an
                    essay on colour, in which three primary colours are recognized; a catalogue of
                    nine hundred and ninety-eight zodiacal stars; and a memoir, the earliest of any
                    real value, on the proper motion of fixed stars, which was originally
                    communicated to the Gottingen Royal Society in 17 60. The other part still
                    remains in manuscript, and includes papers on atmospheric refraction (dated
                    1755), on the motion of Mars as affected by the perturbations of Jupiter and the
                    Earth (1756), andon terrestrial magnetism (1760 and 1762). In these last Mayer
                    seeks to explain the magnetic action of the earth by a simple hypothesis. He
                    supposes a small bar-magnet to be placed with its centre at the earth’s centre,
                    and calculates the position of equilibrium of a second small magnet at any given
                    point on the earth’s surface, assuming the law of magnetic attraction and
                    repulsion to be that of the inverse square. Though the values of the declination
                    and dip calculated according to this theory do not agree with the observed
                    values, Mayer must be credited with the first really definite attempt to
                    establish a mathematical theory of magnetic action, and as the first who gave
                    any experimental evidence in favour of the inverse square of the distance as the
                    law of force. See Han* steen’s <hi rend="italic">Magnetismus der Erde.</hi></p>
