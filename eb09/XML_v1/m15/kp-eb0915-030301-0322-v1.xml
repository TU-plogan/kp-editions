                    district in the lieutenantgovernorship of the North-Western Provinces, India,
                    between 26° 52' 30" and 27° 30' N. lat., and 78° 27' 45" and 79° 28' 30" E.
                    long., is bounded on the N. by Etah, on the E. by Farrukhâbâd, on the S. by
                    Etawah, and on the W. by Muttra and Agra, and has an area of 1697 square miles,
                    of which 949 are cultivated, and 190 cultivable. It consists of an almost
                    unbroken level plain, intersected by small rivers, but unvaried by any greater
                    elevations than a few undulating sand ridges. It is wooded throughout with mango
                    groves, and isolated clumps of <hi rend="italic">bâlnd</hi> trees occasionally
                    relieve the bareness of its saline <hi rend="italic">usar</hi> plains. On the
                    south-western boundary the Jumna flows in a deep alluvial bed, sometimes
                    sweeping close to the high banks which overhang its valley, and at others
                    leaving room for a narrow strip of fertile soil between the river and the upland
                    plain. From the low-lying lands thus formed a belt of ravines stretches inland
                    for some 2 miles, often covered with jungle, but affording good pasturage for
                    cattle. Moving north-eastward from this point, one reaches in succession the
                    small rivers Aganga, Sengar, Rind, Isan, and Kâli Nadi, most of which supply
                    water to a small tract on either side, besides giving origin to rich deposits of
                    cultivable silt. The Etawah and Cawnpur branches of the Ganges canal intersect
                    the district for irrigation purposes, and the Lower Ganges canal, when
                    completed, will furnish additional facilities in the same direction.</p>
                <p>The census of 1872 returned the population of the district at 765,783 (males,
                    426,955; females, 338,828). The Hindus numbered 724,663, Mohammedans 40,965,
                    Christians 85. Among high-caste Hindus, the Brahmans number 67,072, and form a
                    wealthy landholding class. Rajputs are returned at 60,155⅛ amongst whom the
                    Chauhans form the largest clan. They have long formed the aristocratic class of
                    the district, and in 1872 owned 44 per cent, of the total area. Much of their
                    hereditary property is, however, passing out of their hands into those of
                    merchants and traders. Of the lower castes, the most important are the Ahirs,
                    numbering 123,358, who own over 12 per cent, of the soil. For many centuries
                    this tribe consisted of lawless robber hordes, who held the fastnesses of the
                    Jumna ravines; and, though they have now been reduced to a comparatively
                    industrial life, they still continue to afford the local authorities much
                    trouble and anxiety. The Chamârs, 103,193 in number, are mere hewers of wood and
                    drawers of water for the landholding classes, who held them in a condition of
                    absolute serfdom under native rale. Other important Hindu tribes are Kâchhis
                    (72,898), Lodhas (53,658), Gadariyas (28,047), and Kahârs (25,273). The Moslems
                    are for the most part poor and without social influence. Only four towns in the
                    district contain a population exceeding 5000: Mainpuri, 21,117; Sbikohâbâd,
                    10,069; Bhongâon, 6271; and Karhal, 5574.</p>
                <p>Mainpuri is one of the districts where the question of female infanticide has
                    long, engaged the attention of Government, and even as late as 1872 this
                    practice was so common as in a great measure to account for the large
                    preponderance of males in the general population. In 1842 measures were first
                    introduced for the supervision of the Chauhân Rajputs and Phâtak Ahirs, among
                    whom the practice was most common. Every female birth had to be duly reported
                    and authenticated, together with a subsequent report on the child’s health.
                    Illness had to be immediately announced to the police, who held an
                    investigation. These rules remained in force until supplemented by those of the
                    Infanticide Act of 1870. In 1843 there was not a single female child among these
                    tribes; in 1847 there were but two hundred and ninety-nine. In 1851 <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> convention of the heads of clans was held, when a body of
                    rales was drawn up and subscribed to, but they were never observed. In 1865 a
                    census of the Chauhân and Phatak villages was held, when six of the former were
                    found without a single female infant. In some cases a daughter had never been
                    known in the village. In 1870 it was found necessary to impose more stringent
                    rales, and a special Infanticide Act was passed by the viceregal council.
                    Inquiries instituted in connexion with the census of 1872 revealed the fact that
                    many other tribes than the Chauhans and Phâtaks were implicated in the practice.
                    In 1875, although a large proportion of the community had so far reformed in
                    this respect as to be exempted from the special supervision provided by the
                    Infanticide Act, there were still two hundred and seventy-six villages on the
                    “proclaimed list” under the surveillance of a specially organized police,
                    maintained by a tax levied on the guilty communities.</p>
                <p>In Mainpuri almost every acre of available soil is under tillage. The total area
                    under cultivation at the date of the last settlement was 607,991 acres. <hi
                    rend="italic">Khαrif</hi> or rain crops included cotton, 48,901 acres; <hi
                    rend="italic">joar,</hi> 120,497; <hi rend="italic">b(tjra,</hi> 74,028; indigo,
                    5369; with a little maize, rice, hemp, &amp;c., making up a total of 299,850
                    acres. <hi rend="italic">Rabi,</hi> or spring crops were the following :—wheat,
                    105,488 acres; barley, 60,443; wheat and barley mixed together, 66,488; with
                    gram, poppy, &amp;c., making a total of 282,376 acres. There were also 17,523
                    acres under sugar-cane. Of the 607,360 acres cultivated in 1881, 337,726 were
                    unirrigated, 180,415 were irrigated by private individuals, and 89,219 by
                    Government. Two-thirds of the land is held by tenants with rights of occupancy,
                    and one-third by tenants-at-will. Mainpuri suffers little from floods or
                    blights, but in former years it used to be severely afflicted by drought. The
                    means of communication, added to the large and increasing irrigation system, are
                    now probably sufficient to protect the district from extreme distress in years
                    of famine.</p>
                <p>The district trade is almost entirely of a rural character. The chief exports are
                    cotton, grain, indigo, <hi rend="italic">gbi,</hi> and miscellaneous
                    agricultural produce; while metals, English piece goods, sugar, <pb break="no"

                    Cotton thread is largely manufactured, and there is some trade in bangles, <hi
                    rend="italic">hukΛs</hi> or pipes, inlaid wood-work, and other fancy articles.
                    Saltpetre is refined at several factories. The district is thoroughly supplied
                    with land and water communications. Good metalled roads connect all the
                    principal towns and villages; the East Indian Railway runs for 23 miles through
                    the south-western angle; the navigable branch of the Ganges canal intersects the
                    central plateau; and the natural highway of the Jumna skirts the district to the
                    south.</p>
                <p>The gross amount of assessment in 1880-81 was £115,132. Education was afforded in
                    1880-81 by 151 schools with 4146 pupils. The climate is hot but not excessively
                    sultry during the summer months, and damp or foggy during the cold weather
                    rains. The average annual rainfall for the five years ending 1870-71 was 32 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 20 inches. The chief endemic disease is malarial
                    fever.</p>
                <p>Mainpuri anciently formed part of the great kingdom of Kanauj, and after the fall
                    of that famous state it was divided into a number of petty principalities, of
                    which Râpri and Bhongaon were the chief. In 1194 Râpri was made the seat of a
                    Moslem governor. Mainpuri fell to the Mughals on Bâbar’s invasion in 1526, and,
                    although temporarily wrested from them by the short-lived Afghan dynasty of Sher
                    Shah, was again occupied by them on the reinstatement of Humâyûn after the
                    victory of Pânipat. Like the rest of the lower Doâb, Mainpuri passed, towards
                    the end of the last century, into the power of the Mahrattas, and finally became
                    a portion of the Erovince of Oudh. When this part of the country was ceded to
                    the ritish in 1801, Mainpuri town became the headquarters of the ex-extensive
                    district of Etawah, which was in 1856 reduced by the formation of Etah and
                    Mainpuri into separate collectorates. On the outbreak of the mutiny in 1857, the
                    regiment stationed at Mainpuri revolted, and attacked the town, which was
                    successfully defended by the few Europeans of the station for a week, until the
                    arrival of the Jhausi mutineers made it necessary to abandon the district.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mâinpurî,</hi> the chief town and headquarters of the above
                    district, is situated in 27° 14' 15" N. lat., 79° 3' 5" E. long., and had a
                    population in 1872 of 21,117, viz., Hindus, 17,596; Mohammedans, 3435;
                    Christians and “others,” 146. The town consists of two separate portions,
                    Mâinpurî proper and Mukhamganj; the former traditionally dates from the
                    prehistoric period of the <hi rend="italic">Mahabhdrata,</hi> while the latter
                    was founded by Râjâ Jas want Sinh in 1803. Holkar plundered and burned part of
                    the town in 1804, but was repulsed by the local militia. Since the British
                    occupation the population has rapidly increased, and many improvements have been
                    carried out. The Agra branch of the Grand Trunk Road runs through the centre,
                    and forms a wide street lined on both sides by shops, which constitute the
                    principal bazaar. Besides the usual Government offices, &amp;c., in the civil
                    station, the chief buildings are the police station, opium warehouses, jail,
                    post-office, dispensary, two large schools, American Presbyterian mission,
                    church, reading-rooms; there are two public gardens. The town carries on a
                    considerable trade in cotton, indigo seed, country produce, and iron; and there
                    is a manufacture of wooden articles inlaid with wire.</p>
