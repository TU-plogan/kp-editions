                    Marriage may be defined here as the act, ceremony, or process by which the legal
                    relation ship of husband and wife is constituted. In most if not all legal
                    systems it takes the form of a contract—the mutual assent of the parties being
                    the prominent and indispensable feature of the ceremony. Whether it is really a
                    contract or not, and if so to what class of contracts it belongs, are questions
                    which have been much discussed, but into which it is not necessary to enter.
                    While the consent of parties is universally deemed one of the conditions of a
                    legal marriage, all the incidents of the relationship constituted by the act are
                    absolutely fixed by law. In the United States it has been expressly decided that
                    marriage is not a contract within the meaning of the constitutional law, which
                    prohibits state enactments “impairing the obligation of contracts.” Mr Bishop,
                    however, in his very valuable book oh <hi rend="italic">Marriage and
                    Divorce,</hi> suggests that a State law permitting the status of marriage to be
                    created without the consent of both parties would not be constitutional; but
                    that is a difficulty arising out of the peculiar relation of the States to the
                    Union. The question whether marriage is merely a contract or more than a
                    contract, whether a purely civil or also a religious act, belongs to a similar
                    order of inquiries. The jurist has only to deal with marriage in so far as it
                    creates the legal »status of husband and wife. It should be added that, while
                    marriage is generally spoken of by lawyers as a contract, its complete isolation
                    from all other contracts is invariably recognized. Its peculiar position may be
                    seen at once by comparing it with other contracts giving rise to continuous
                    relationships with more or less indefinite obligations, like those of landlord
                    and tenant, master and servant, &amp;c. In these the parties may in general make
                    their rights and duties what they please, the law only intervening when they are
                    silent. In marriage every resulting right and duty is fixed by the law.<note

                    was a religious ceremony before ten witnesses, in which an ox was sacrificed and
                    a wheaten cake broken and divided between the spouses by the priest. <hi
                    rend="italic">Coemptio</hi> was a conveyance of the woman by <hi rend="italic"

                    through· her cohabiting with the husband for one year without having been absent
                    from his house three continuous nights. But a true marriage might be concluded
                    without adopting any of these modes, and they all fell into desuetude and with
                    them the subjection of the wife to the manus. Marriage without manus was
                    contracted by the interchange of consent, without writing or formality of any
                    kind. By some jurists it is regarded as incomplete until consummated by delivery
                    of the woman, and is accordingly referred to the class of <hi rend="italic"
                    >real</hi> contracts. The restrictions as to age, relationship by consanguinity
                    and affinity, previous marriage, &amp;c., were in the main those which have
                    continued to prevail in modern Europe with one important exception. The consent
                    of the <hi rend="italic">])aterfamilias</hi> to the marriage of the children
                    under his power was essential.</p>

                    marriage was not merely a contract but a sacrament, the validity of marriages by
                    consent was nevertheless admitted. “When the natural and civil contract was

                    a priest. It had even in that state the character of a sacrament, for it is a
                    misapprehension to suppose that this intervention was required as a matter of
                    necessity even for that purpose before the council of Trent.”<note

                    rend="italic">England.—</hi> Marriage may be the subject of an ordinary contract
                    on which an action may be brought by either party. It is not necessary that the
                    promise should be in writing, or that any particular time should be named. The
                    parties were formerly inadinissible as witnesses in this action; but they are
                    now competent to give evidence, subject to the condition that the plaintiff
                    shall not recover “unless his or her testimony shall be corroborated by some
                    other material evidence” (32 &amp; 33 Vict. c. 68). The ordinary defences, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> fraud, discharge, minority, are available in these
                    actions, and there are also special defences arising from the nature of the
                    contract, such as the bad character of the plaintiff, the relationship of the
                    parties within the prohibited degrees, &amp;c. Promises to marry are not within
                    the meaning of “agreement made in consideration of marriage” in the statute of
                    frauds, which requires such agreements to be in writing. Contracts in restraint
                    of marriage, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> whose object is to prevent a person
                    from marrying anybody whatever, are void, as are also contracts undertaking for
                    reward to procure a marriage between two persons. These latter are termed
                    marriage brocage contracts.</p>
                <p>Any man and woman are capable of marrying, subject to certain disabilities, some
                    of which are said to be canonical as having been formerly under the cognizance
                    of the ecclesiastical courts, others civil. The effect of a canonical disability
                    as such was to make the marriage not void but voidable. The marriage must be set
                    aside by regular process, and sentence pronounced during the lifetime of the
                    parties. Natural inability at the time of the marriage to procreate children is
                    a canonical disability. So was proximity of relationship within the prohibited
                    degrees, which has been made an absolute avoidance of marriage by 5 &amp; 6
                    Will. IV. c. 54. A pre-engagement to another person was at one time recognized
                    as a canonical disability. Civil disabilities are (1) the fact that either party
                    is already married and has a spouse still living;<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A divorce <hi rend="italic">nisi</hi> does
                    not enable the parties to marry until it is made absolute.</p></note> (2) the
                    fact that either party is a person of unsound mind; (3) want of full age, which
                    for this purpose is fixed at the age of puberty as defined in the Roman law,
                    viz., fourteen for males and twelve for females;<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A marriage in which either of the parties is
                    below the age of consent is, however, said to be not absolutely void; if the

                    necessary, but either of them may disagree and avoid the marriage.</p></note>
                    (4) proximity of relationship within the prohibited degrees, already alluded to.
                    The statute which lawyers regard as establishing the rule on this last point is
                    the 32 Henry VIII. c. 38 (repealed in part by 2 &amp; 3 Edw. VI. c. 23, in whole
                    by 1 &amp; 2 P. and Μ. c. 8, but revived by 1 Eliz. c. 1, and so left as under
                    the Act of Edward), which enacts that “no prohibition, God’s law except, shall
                    trouble or impeach any marriage without the Levitical degrees.” The forbidden
                    marriages, as more particularly specified in previous statutes, are those
                    between persons in the ascending and descending line <hi rend="italic">in
                    infinitum,</hi> and those between collaterals to the third degree inclusive,
                    according to the computation of the civil law, which reckons from one of the
                    persons related to the common stock and so down to the other person. The
                    prohibitions extend not only to <hi rend="italic">consanguinei</hi> (related by
                    blood) but to <hi rend="italic">affines</hi> (related by marriage). A man may
                    neither marry his sister nor his deceased wife’s sister, for both are related to
                    him in the second degree; nor his sister’s daughter, nor his deceased wife’s
                    sister’s'daughter, for both are in the third degree; but he may marry his first
                    cousin, for she is in the fourth degree. <hi rend="italic">Consanguinei</hi> of
                    either spouse are related by affinity to the other; but the <hi rend="italic"
                    >consanguinei</hi> of the one are not necessarily related to the <hi
                    rend="italic">consanguinei</hi> of the other. Hence two brothers may marry two
                    sisters, or a father and son a mother and daughter. A husband is not related to
                    the <hi rend="italic">affines</hi> of his wife, and so a man may marry the widow
                    Of his deceased wife’s brother. The. rule as to collaterals includes those
                    related by the half blood and bastards (see Stephen’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Commentaries,</hi> book iii. c. 2). Other disabilities previously admitted were
                    abolished by the statute of Henry. The Act of 5 &amp; 6 Will. IV. c. 54 enacted
                    that “all marriages which shall hereafter be celebrated between persons within
                    the prohibited degrees of consanguinity or affinity shall be absolutely null and
                    void to all intents and purposes whatsoever.” They had previously, as already
                    stated, been only voidable. The Act at the same time legalized marriages within
                    the prohibited degrees of affinity (but not consanguinity)actually celebrated
                    before the 31st August 1835.</p>
                <p>The celebration of marriages is now regulated wholly by statutory legislation.
                    The most important Acts now in force are the 4 Geo. IV. c. 76 and the 6 &amp; 7
                    William IV. c. 85.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A
                    complete list of the acts regulating the solemnization of marriage or confirming
                    marriages which through some defect might be void will be found in Phillimore’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Ecclesiastical Law,</hi> vol. i.</p></note> The former
                    regulates marriages within the Church of England, but was intended to be of
                    universal application, Jews and Quakers only being excepted by section 31. It
                    requires either the previous publication of banns, or a licence from the proper
                    ecclesiastical authority. As to banns, the rule of the rubric, so far as not
                    altered by the statute, is required to be observed. They must be published on
                    three successive Sundays at morning service after the second lesson, in the
                    church of the parish in which the parties dwell; the bishop may, however,
                    authorize the publication of banns in a public chapel. Seven days’ notice must
                    be given to the clergyman of the names of the parties, their place of abode, and
                    the time during which they have lived there. If either party is under age, the
                    dissent of the parents or guardians expressed at the time of publication of
                    banns renders such publication null and void. Licence in lieu of banns may only
                    be granted by the archbishop, bishop, or other authority, for the solemnization
                    of a maιτiage within the church of the parish in which one of the parties shall
                    have resided for fifteen days before. Before a licence can be granted an oath
                    must be taken as to the fact of residence and that the necessary consent has
                    been obtained in the case of persons under age. The father, or lawful guardian,
                    or mother if unmarried, or guardian appointed by the court, is each in order of
                    substitution the proper person to consent to the marriage of a minor, and the
                    place of any such person incapacitated mental ly is taken by the lord
                    chancellor. The absence of such consent does not, however, avoid a marriage once
                    solemnized. But if persons wilfully intermarry (unless by special licence) in a
                    place not being a church or public chàpel, or without due publication· of banns
                    or proper licence, or before a person not in holy orders, the marriage is null
                    and void tα all purposes. Marriage must be celebrated within three months after
                    banns or licence, and between the hours of eight and twelve in the morning.</p>
                <p>For the relief of the great body of dissenters the Act 6 &amp; 7 Will. IV. c. 85
                    was passed. It permits marriage to be solemnized in two additional ways,—viz.
                    (1) by certificate of the superintendent registrar of a district without
                    licence, and (2) by such certificate with licence. In the first case, notice
                    must be given to the registrar of the district or districts within which the
                    parties have resided for seven days previous, which notice is inscribed in a
                    marriage notice book, open to public inspection at all reasonable times, and
                    thereafter suspended for twenty-one days in some conspicuous place in the
                    registrar’s office. The notice must be accompanied by a declaration as to the
                    absence of impediments, necessary consent, &amp;c. Any person whose consent is
                    necessary to an ecclesiastical licence may forbid the issue of a certificate,
                    but in default of such prohibition the certificate will issue at the end of the
                    twenty-one days. The marriage may then take place on any day within three months
                    of the entry of notice, and in one of the following ways :—(1) in a certified
                    place of religious worship, registered for the solemnization of marriage; in
                    that case a registrar of the district with two witnesses must be present, and
                    the ceremony must include a mutual declaration of assent by the parties and a
                    disavowal of any impediment; (2) at the superintendent registrar’s office, with
                    the same <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n594/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0594-0567"/> declaration, but with no religious service; (3)
                    in a church according to the usual form, the consent of the minister thereof
                    having been previously obtained; (4) according to the usages of Jews and
                    Quakers. The place of marriage in all cases must have been specified in the
                    notice and certificate.</p>
                <p>In the second case, when it is desired to proceed by licence, notice must be
                    given to the registrar of the district in which one of the persons resides,
                    together with a declaration that he or she has resided for fifteen days therein,
                    that there is no impediment, and that the necessary consents if any have been
                    obtained. The notice is not exhibited in the registrar’s office, and the
                    certificate may be obtained at the expiration of one whole day after entry,
                    together with the licence. No registrar’s licence can be granted for a marriage
                    in church or according to the forms of the Church of England,—the ecclesiastical
                    authorities retaining their monopoly in that respect. It is also provided that
                    in the case of persons wilfully intermarrying in a place other than that
                    mentioned in the notice and certificate, or without notice or certificate,
                    &amp;c., the marriage shall be null and void. And, as under the former Marriage
                    Act of Geo. IV., a valid marriage between persons one of whom is under age,
                    brought about by fraud or false oath, subjects the offendingparty to a
                    forfeiture of all property that otherwise might accrue to him from the marriage,
                    a like penalty is provided in like cases under the later Act.</p>
                <p>11 will be observed that the various rules as to consent of parents, &amp;c., to
                    the marriages of minors are regulations of procedure only. The absence of the
                    necessary consent is not a disability invalidating a marriage actually
                    solemnized.</p>
                <p>The Act 26 Geo. II. c. 33, commonly known as Lord Hardwicke’s Act, which forbids
                    the solemnization of marriage without banns or licence, also enacts that “in no
                    case whatsoever shall any suit or proceeding be had in any ecclesiastical court
                    in order to compel a celebration <hi rend="italic">in facie</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ecclcsiae,</hi> by reason of any contract of matrimony whatsoever

                    verba de</hi><hi rend="italic">futuro."</hi> Blackstone observes that previous
                    to this Act “any contract made <hi rend="italic">per verba de presenti,</hi> or
                    in words of the present tense, and in case of cohabitation <hi rend="italic">per
                    verba de</hi><hi rend="italic">futuro</hi> also, was deemed valid marriage to
                    many purposes; and the parties might be compelled in the spiritual courts to

                    Dalrymple, which turned on the effect of promises exchanged between the parties
                    in Scotland, Lord Stowell laid it down “as the basis of the canon law, the known
                    basis of the matrimonial law of Europe,” that “in the irregular marriage, <hi

                    convert the engagement into an irregular marriage.” On the other hand, in the
                    case of the Queen <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Millis in the House of Lords on
                    appeal from the Irish Queen’s Bench, the position of Lord Stowell was strongly
                    criticized. Lord Lyndhurst’s conclusion was that, ‘ ‘ although a marriage
                    contracted <hi rend="italic">per verba de presenti</hi> was indissoluble, though
                    it could not be released even by the mutual consent of the parties, though
                    either of them might enforce it and compel solemnization, though it had the
                    effect of rendering voidable a subsequent marriage solemnized <hi rend="italic"
                    >in facie</hi><hi rend="italic">ecclcsiae,</hi> even after the cohabitation and
                    birth of children, though it was considered to be of the essence and substance
                    of matrimony—yet by the law of England it did not confer those rights of
                    property or the more important right of legitimacy consequent on a marriage duly
                    solemnized according to the rites of the church.” The lords were equally divided
                    in their decision, and the question has since been agitated not so much with
                    reference to England, where after the Act of Geo. II. it had a merely historical
                    interest, as to the colonies and the United States (see below), where the common
                    laλv of England prevails unless changed by legislation. Dr Lushington in the
                    case of a marriage in New South Wales declared that, when there has been a “fact
                    of consent between two parties to become man and wife,” such is “sufficient
                    marriage to enable me to. pronounce when necessary a decree of separation.” In
                    the cases noticed the promises had been exchanged before ministers of religion
                    not technically “in holy orders,” and the question has accordingly sometimes
                    been put in the form whether, according to the common law, the intervention of a
                    clergyman was necessary to a valid marriage.</p>
                <p>Royal Marriages in England have been subject to special laws. The Royal Marriage
                    Act of 1772 (12 Geo. III. c. 11), passed in consequence of the marriages of the
                    dukes of Cumberland and Gloucester, enacted that “no descendant of his late
                    majesty George II. (other than the issue of princesses married or who may marry
                    into foreign families) shall be capable of contracting matrimony without the
                    previous consent of his majesty, his heirs and successors, signified under the
                    great seal. But in case any descendant of George II., being above twenty-five
                    years old, shall persist to contract a marriage disapproved of by his majesty,
                    such descendant, after giving twelve months’ notice to the privy council, may
                    contract such marriage, and the same may be duly solemnized without the consent
                    of his majesty, &amp;c., and shall be good except both Houses of Parliament
                    shall declare their disapprobation thereto.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Scotland.—</hi> The chief point of distinction, as compared
                    with English law, is the recognition of irregular marriages above noticed. (1)
                    “A public or regular marriage,” says Fraser, “is one celebrated, after due
                    proclamation of banns, by a minister of religion; and it may be celebrated
                    either in a church or in a private house, and on any day of the week at any hour
                    of the day.” The ministers of the national church at first alone could perform
                    the ceremony; but the privilege was extended to Episcopalians by 10 Anne c. 7,
                    and to other ministers by 4 &amp; 5 Will. IV. c. 28. (2) A marriage may also “be
                    constituted by declarations made by the man and the woman that they <hi
                    rend="italic">presently</hi> do take each other for husband and wife.” These
                    declarations “may be emitted on any day at any time and without the presence of
                    witnesses,” and either by writing or orally or by signs, and in any form which
                    is clearly expressive of intention. Such a marriage is as effectual to all
                    intents and purposes as a public marriage. The children of it would be
                    legitimate; and the parties to it would have all the rights in the property of
                    each other, given by the law of Scotland to husband and wife. (3) A promise
                    followed by <hi rend="italic">copula</hi> does not, according to Fraser,
                    constitute marriage, unless followed either by solemnization <hi rend="italic"
                    >in facie</hi><hi rend="italic">ecclesiae</hi> or declarator. On the other hand,
                    in Lorimer’s <hi rend="italic">Handbook</hi> it is urged that the promise and
                    copula are mere tokens of consent recognized by the law, and that “the date of
                    the marriage is the date of the copula.” However this may be, Lord Moncreiff’s
                    opinion in the case of Brown <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Burns is admitted on both
                    sides to be good law, viz., that declarator is essential to the constitution of
                    a marriage of this kind, so that, if no such declarator be brought in the
                    lifetime of both parties, the marriage can never be established afterwards. The
                    <hi rend="italic">copula</hi> is presumed to have reference to the promise, but
                    evidence may be adduced to show that such was not the case.</p>
                <p>By 19 &amp; 20 Vict. c. 96, it is enacted that no <hi rend="italic"
                    >irregular</hi> marriage shall be valid in Scotland, unless one of the parties
                    has lived in Scotland for the twenty-one days next preceding the marriage, or
                    has his or her usual residence there at the time.</p>
                <p>“Habit and repute” has sometimes been spoken of as constituting marriage in the
                    law of Scotland, but it is more correctly described as evidence from which
                    marriage may be inferred. The repute must be the general, constant, and
                    unvarying belief of friends and neighbours, not merely the controverted opinion
                    of a section of them. The cohabitation must be in Scotland, but in one case
                    proof of cohabitation in another country was allowed, as tending to throw light
                    on the nature of the cohabitation in Scotland.</p>
                <p>The consent of parents is not necessary to the validity of the marriage, even of
                    minors, but marriage under the age of puberty with or without such consent is
                    void.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">United States.—</hi> The absence of ecclesiastical courts has
                    suggested difficulties as to the extent to which the law of England on this
                    subject continued to prevail after the revolution. Bishop holds it to be the
                    universal fact running through all the cases that everywhere in the country the
                    English decisions on marriage and divorce are referred to with the same apparent
                    deference which is shown on other subjects to the decisions of the English
                    common law and equity tribunals. The same author observes that “all our marriage
                    and divorce laws, and of course all our statutes on the subject, in so far as
                    they pertain to localities embraced within the limits of particular States, are
                    State laws and State statutes, the national power with us not having legislative
                    or judicial cognizance <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n595/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0595-0568"/> of the matter within those localities.” Some of
                    the States have extended the ages below which marriage cannot take place. The
                    common law of the States is assumed to be that “a contract <hi rend="italic">per
                    verba de presently</hi> or <hi rend="italic">per verba de</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >futuro</hi><hi rend="italic">cum copula,</hi> constitutes a complete marriage.”
                    Conditions, however, may be imposed by the various State legislatures, and as to
                    these the rule has established itself in American jurisprudence that “a marriage
                    good at common law is good notwithstanding the existence of any statute on the
                    subject, unless the statute contains express words of. nullity.” Thus in
                    Pennsylvania, where a statute provided that all marriages “jsliould be
                    solemnized before twelve witnesses,” marriages not so celebrated were
                    nevertheless held to be good. In New Hampshire justices and ministers of the
                    gospel are authorized to solemnize marriage, and all other persons are forbidden
                    to do so under penalties; yet a marriage by consent, as at common law, without
                    justice or minister, has been held valid. On the other hand, under a very
                    similar statute in Massachusetts, it was held that “parties could not solemnize
                    their own marriage,” and that a marriage by mutual agreement, not in accordance
                    with the statute, was void. Bishop regards this as an isolated exception to the
                    general course of the decisions. So when State legislation requires any
                    particular form to be used the want thereof only invalidates the act if the
                    statute expressly so enacts. Many of the State codes inflict penalties on
                    ministers or justices for celebrating the marriage of minors without the consent
                    of the parents or guardians. The original law as to prohibited degrees has been
                    considerably modified in the States. The prohibition of marriage with a deceased
                    wife’s sister is said by Bishop to be all but unknown in the United States,
                    Virginia apparently being the only one where it is still retained. Some writers
                    apply the term legislative marriages to cases in which the State by enactment
                    confirms a marriage which was void for some defect. Questions sometimes arise as
                    to whether such enactments are within the constitution of the State.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">France. —</hi> Articles 144-226 of the Code Napoléon prescribe
                    the qualifications and conditions of marriage. The man must be eighteen and the
                    woman fifteen years of age. A son under twenty-five, and a daughter under
                    twenty-one, cannot marry without consent of the father and mother, or of the
                    father only if they disagree, or of the survivor if one be dead. If both are
                    dead grandfather and grandmother take their place. A man after twenty-five and a
                    woman after twenty-one are still bound formally to ask the consent of their
                    parents; until the age of thirty and twenty-five respectively this request must
                    be repeated twice, and after the third application parties are at liberty to
                    marry without such consent. Even after the age of thirty, formal notice must be
                    served on the parents or grandparents one month before marriage. If neither
                    parents nor grandparents be alive, parties under twenty-onè require the consent
                    of the family council. These rules apply to natural children when affiliated;
                    those not affiliated require the consent of a specially appointed guardian.
                    Marriage is prohibited between all ascendants and descendants in the direct
                    line, and between persons related by marriage in the same liné, between brother
                    and sister, between uncle and niece, and brother-in-law and sister-in-law.</p>
                <p>Before the solemnization of marriage banns are required to be published on two
                    distinct Sundays, containing the names, occupations, and domiciles of the
                    parties and their parents. The marriage cannot take place until three days after
                    the second publication, and if a year is allowed to elapse fresh banns must be
                    put up. On the day appointed by the parties, and in the parish to which one of
                    them belongs, the marriage is celebrated by the civil officer or registrar
                    reading over to them the various necessary documents, with the chapter of the
                    code relating to husband and wife, receiving from each a declaration that they
                    take each other for husband and wife, and drawing up the act of marriage. All
                    this has to be done in the presence of four witnesses.</p>
                <p>Marriages contracted abroad between French subjects or between French subjects
                    and foreigners are valid in France if celebrated according to the forms of the
                    foreign law, provided the French conditions as to banns and consent of parents
                    have been observed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">International Law.—</hi> In the “conflict of laws” on the
                    subject of marriage, it has been well settled that the <hi rend="italic">lex
                    loci</hi> governs. If the marriage is valid by the law of the country where it
                    is celebrated it is recognized as valid everywhere; if invalid there it is
                    invalid everywhere. “This rule,” says Story, “has received the most deliberate
                    sanction of the English and American courts and of foreign jurists.” The most
                    prominent, if not the only known exceptions, Story considers to be marriages (1)
                    involving incest or polygamy, or (2) forbidden by the public law of a country
                    from motives of policy, and (3) marriages celebrated in a foreign country under
                    circumstances which impose on the parties the law of their own country. Westlake
                    <hi rend="italic">{Private International Law,</hi> chap, iv.) lays it down as
                    indispensable to the validity of a marriage that the <hi rend="italic">lex
                    loci</hi> should be satisfied in respect of forms, consent of parents and
                    guardians, and capacity of the parties. The law of the parties’ domicile should
                    also be satisfied as to capacity unless when it imposes incapacity of a penal
                    nature unknown to the <hi rend="italic">lex loci.</hi> Story, in reference to
                    the first of the.three exceptions alluded to above, attempted to set up a clear
                    and just moral difference between marriages that are incestuous by the law of
                    nature and those that are so by the municipal law of particular States only,
                    with more particular reference to consanguinity and affinity. “It would be a
                    strong point to put that a marriage perfectly valid between a man and the sister
                    of his former deceased wife in New England would be held invalid in Virginia or
                    England, even though the parties formerly belonged to or were born, in the
                    latter country or State. But, as to persons not so belonging, it would be of the
                    most dangerous consequence to suppose that the courts of either of them would
                    assume the liberty to hold such marriages a nullity merely because their own
                    jurisprudence would not in a local celebration of marriage therein uphold it.”
                    This position has been expressly disavowed by the English courts. In Brook <hi
                    rend="italic">V.</hi> Brook it was held that an Englishman’s marriage with his
                    deceased wife’s sister during a residence in Denmark where the union is lawful
                    is invalid in England. In Hyde <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Hyde in the English
                    divorce court it was held that a marriage contracted in a country where polygamy
                    is lawful between a man and a woman who profess a faith which allows polygamy is
                    not a marriage as understood in Christendom; and, although it was a valid
                    marriage by the <hi rend="italic">lex loci,</hi> and at the time when it was
                    contracted both the man and the woman were single and competent to contract
                    marriage, the court will not recognize it as a valid marriage in a matrimonial
                    suit. The difference in the law of divorce in different countries produces many
                    complications of this kind. It appears that a divorce of an English marriage
                    abroad for cause not recognized in England as ground for a divorce will be
                    upheld in England if the parties were domiciled at the time of the divorce in
                    the foreign state; otherwise not. Compare also the French rule as to marriages
                    of French subjects in foreign countries. The too frequent consequence of these
                    variances is that the same persons are held married in one country and unmarried
                    in another, while their children are legitimate in one country and illegitimate
                    in another. There is no subject in relation to which the establishment of a
                    common code for all civilized nations is more urgently required.</p>
                <p>Besides true marriage, with which we have been exclusively dealing hitherto,
                    inferior forms of union have from time to time been recognized, and may be
                    briefly noticed here. These have all but disappeared from modern society,
                    depending as they do oh matrimonial restrictions now obsolete.</p>
                <p>The institution of slavery is a fruitful source of this kind of debased
                    matrimony. In Roman law no slave could contract marriage whether with another
                    slave or a free person. The union of male and female slaves <hi rend="italic"
                    >{coontuberniunι)</hi> was recognized for various purposes; a free woman
                    entering into a union with a slave incurred under the S. C. Claudianum the
                    forfeiture of her own liberty; but the bondwoman might be the concubine of a
                    freeman. In the United States, where slavery was said to be regulated by the
                    principle of the civil law, the marriage of slaves was so far recognized that on
                    emancipation complete matrimony took effect and the children became legitimate
                    without any new ceremony. Such at least is the purport of the more recent
                    decisions.</p>

                    rend="italic">connubium</hi> bctween the parties. Originally there was no
                    connubium between plebs and patricians, and the privilege was conceded after a
                    long struggle by the Lex Canuleia. In later times Latini and Peregrini were
                    excluded from connubiuτn except where the right had been expressly conferred.
                    The great matrimonial law’ of the early empire (Lex Julia et Pania Poppaea)
                    introduced restrictions depending on the condition of the parties which later
                    legislation extended and perpetuated. Senators under that law’ were forbidden to
                    marry freedwomen or women of inferior rank, and the husband of a freedwoman
                    becoming a senator was set free from his marriage. In the canon law<note

                    approach ever made by concubinage to true marriage, the children being
                    legitimate, but neither they nor the wife acquiring any right to the rank or
                    fortune of the husband. Under the Royal Marriage Act in England a union of this
                    kind has no matrimonial effect whatever.</p>
                <p>Differences of religion are no longer regarded in Christian countries as
                    hindrances to marriage, except possibly in some branches of the Greek Church.
                    But the marriage of persons of different religions frequently requires the
                    intervention of the law as to the faith of the children, more particularly in
                    Europe as between Catholics and Protestants. In some countries the clergy make
                    it a condition of such marriages that the children shall be educated in the
                    Catholic faith. English law gives the father an indefeasible right to dictate
                    the faith of his children, no matter what engagements he may have entered into
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Infant).</hi> The practice on this point varies in
                    Europe—the question being ignored in French law, Germany following in some parts
                    the same rule as England, in others giving effect to ante-nuptial stipulations.
                    In Ireland mixed marriages (z.e., between Catholic and Protestant) were by 19
                    Geo. II. c. 13 null and void if celebrated by a Catholic priest. This Act is
                    repealed by 33 &amp; 34 Vict. c. 110, which permits mixed marriages to be
                    validly celebrated by an Episcopalian or Roman Catholic clergyman, subject to
                    conditions set forth in section 38. (E. R. )</p>
