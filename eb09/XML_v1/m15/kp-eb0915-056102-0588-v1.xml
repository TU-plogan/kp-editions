                <p><label type="entry">MARNE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Haute-</hi></label>, a department
                    of eastern France, made up for the most part of districts belonging to the
                    former province of Champagne (Bassigny, Perthois, Vallage), with smaller
                    portions of Lorraine and Burgundy, and some fragments of Franche-Comté. It lies
                    between 47° 35' and 48° 40' N. lat., and between 4° 40' and 5° 55" E. long., the
                    capital, Chaumont, being 133 miles east-south-east from Paris in a direct line,
                    and it is bounded on the N.E. by Meuse, on the E. by Vosges, on the S.E. by
                    Haute-Saône, on the S. and S.W. by Cote d’Or, on the W. by Aube, and on the N.W.
                    by Marne. The extreme length from north-north-west to south-south-east is 81
                    miles, and the area 2402 square miles. Its greatest elevation (1693 feet) is in
                    the plateau of Langres, between the sources of the Marne and those of the Aube;
                    the watershed between the basin of the Rhone on the south and those of the Seine
                    and Meuse on the north, which is formed by the plateau of Langres and the Monts
                    Faucilles, has an average height of 1500 or 1600 feet. The country descends
                    rapidly towards the south, but in very gentle slopes northwards. To the north is
                    Bassigny (“paybas, as distinguished from the highlands), a district of country
                    characterized by monotonous flats of small fertility, and generally under wood.
                    The lowest level of the department <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n589/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0589-0562"/> is 360 feet. Hydrographically Haute-Marne belongs
                    for the most part to the basin of the Seine, the remainder to those of the Rhone
                    and the Meuse. The principal stream is the Marne, which rises here, and has a
                    course of 75 miles within the department. Among the more important affluents of
                    the Marne are on the right the Rognon, and on the left the Blaise, one of the
                    rivers of France most fully utilized for the supply of water-power. The Saulx,
                    another tributary of the Marne on the right, also rises in Haute-Marne. Westward
                    the department is watered by the Aube and its tributary the Aujon, both of which
                    have their sources on the plateau of Langres. The Μ euse also rises in the Monts
                    Faucilles, and has a course of 31 miles within Haute-Marne. On the Mediterranean
                    side the department sends to the Saône the Apance, the Amance, the Salon, and
                    the Vingeanne. The climate is partly that of the Seine region, partly that of
                    the Vosges, and partly that of the Rhone; the mean temperature is 51° F., nearly
                    that of Paris; the rainfall is slightly below the average for F rance.</p>
                <p>Of the total area rather more than one half is arable, about a third is under
                    wood, a twentieth under meadow, and a fortieth is occupied by vineyards. There
                    are 39,000 horses (extensively bred in Bassigny), 86,000 head of cattle, 170,000
                    sheep, 58,000 pigs, 6000 goats, 25,000 beehives, and a large quantity of all
                    kinds of poultry. Though not very fertile, the soil is well cultivated, and in
                    1878 yielded 1,271,363 hectolitres of wheat, 144,348 of barley, 1,446,421 of
                    oats, 1,177,187 of potatoes, besides meslin, rye, buckwheat, dried legumes,
                    colza, beetroot, and hemp. Upwards of 8 million gallons of wine of ordinary
                    quality were produced in 1881. The timber consists chiefly of oak, beech, elm,
                    ash, maple, birch, and aspen; the orchards produce cherries, apples, pears, and
                    prunes. The department is very rich in iron; the annual output of 300,000 tons
                    is exceeded only by that of Meurthe-et-Moselle. Building and paving stones are
                    quarried. The warm springs cf Bourbonne-les-Bains are among the longest-known
                    and most frequented in France. The leading industry is the metallurgical; in
                    1881 76,000 tons of pig iron and 85,000 of wrought iron were produced. The
                    establishments include blast furnaces, foundries, forges, plate-rolling works,
                    and shops for nailmaking and smith work of various descriptions. St Dizier, the
                    place of largest population, is the chief centre of manufacture and
                    distribution. The cutlery trade alone occupies 6000 persons in the neighbourhood
                    of Langres. The department employs 1800 spindles in the woollen manufacture;
                    glove-making, basket-making, brewing, tanning, and other industries are also
                    carried on. The principal import is coal, while iron, stone, wood, and cereals
                    are exported. The population in 1876 was 253,943, making an increase of 27,288
                    since 1801. There are three arrondissements (Chaumont, Langres, and Vassy), the
                    capital being Chaumont.</p>
