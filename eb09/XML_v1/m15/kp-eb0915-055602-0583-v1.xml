                    (1564-1593), the father of English tragedy and the creator of English blank
                    verse, was born at Canterbury in February 1561, and christened on the 26th of
                    that month. John Marlowe, his father, is said, on authority which satisfied the
                    best editor of the poet, to have been a shoemaker by trade; it is supposed also
                    that he was clerk of his parish, and survived his illustrious son for upwards of
                    eleven years. The boy was educated at the King’s School, Canterbury;
                    matriculated as pensioner of Benet College, Cambridge, March 17, 1581; took the
                    degree of bachelor of arts in 1583, and that of master of arts four years later.
                    Before this date he had produced the first tragedy worthy of that name in our
                    language, and called into existence that highest and most difficult of all its
                    other than lyrical forms of verse, which alone has proved worthy of acceptance
                    among his countrymen as the fit and adequate instrument of tragic drama. At some
                    uncertain date of his early life he is supposed to have been an actor, and said
                    to have broken his leg in the practice of his profession. But for this and many
                    other traditions of his career and conversation there is no better evidence than
                    that of a religious libeller. His first tragedy of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Taml&gt;urlaine the Great,</hi> in two parts, was successively followed by <hi
                    rend="italic">Doctor Faustus, The Jew of Malta, Edward the Second,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">The Massacre at Paris.</hi> The tragedy of <hi rend="italic">Dido,
                    Queen of Carthage,</hi> was probably completed for the stage after his death by
                    Thomas Nash, the worthiest English precursor of Swift in vivid, pure, and
                    passionate prose, embodying the most terrible and splendid qualities of a social
                    and personal satirist; a man gifted also with some fair faculty of elegiac and
                    even lyric verse, but in no wise qualified to put on the buskin left behind him
                    by the “famous gracer of tragedians,” as Marlowe had already been designated by
                    their common friend Greene from among the worthiest of his fellows.</p>
                <p>The only authentic record concerning the death of Marlowe is an entry “in the
                    burial-register of the parish church of St Nicholas,” Deptford: “Christopher
                    Marlowe, slain by Francis Archer, June 1, 1593.” Two Puritan scribblers have
                    left two inconsistent reports as to the circumstances of this manslaughter. On
                    the more respectable authority of Francis Meres the critic (1598) we are told
                    that Marlowe was “stabbed to death” by a “servingman” of bad character, “a rival
                    of his in his lewd love.” The one thing unhappily certain is that one of the
                    greatest among English poets died of a wound received in a brawl (stabbed in the
                    head, according to one account, with his own dagger) at the untimely age of
                    twenty-nine years and three months. Like Sir Walter Raleigh and a few less
                    memorable men of the same generation, he was attacked in his own time not merely
                    as a freethinker, but as a propagandist or apostle of atheism; nor was the
                    irregularity of his life thought worthier of animadversion than the uncertainty
                    of his livelihood. The informer whose name has survived as that of his most
                    venomous assailant was duly hanged the year after Marlowe’s death; and the list
                    of his charges, first published by Ritson, is hardly a document which can
                    commend itself to any man’s confidence as plausibly or even possibly accurate in
                    all its detailed report of the violent and offensive nonsense attributed to the
                    freethinking poet in common conversation “concerning his damnable opinions.”</p>
                <p>The majestic and exquisite excellence of various lines and passages in Marlowe’s
                    first play must be admitted to relieve, if it cannot be allowed to redeem, the
                    stormy monotony of Titanic truculence which blusters like a simoom through the
                    noisy course of its ten fierce acts. With many and heavy faults, there is
                    something of genuine greatness in <hi rend="italic">Tanιburlaine the Great</hi>;
                    and for two grave reasons it must always be remembered with distinction and
                    mentioned with honour. It is the first poem ever written in English blank verse,
                    as distinguished from mere rhymeless decasyllabics; and it contains one of the
                    noblest passages, perhaps indeed the noblest in the literature of the world,
                    ever written by one of the greatest masters of poetry in loving praise of the
                    glorious delights and sublime submission to the everlasting limits of his art.
                    In its highest and most distinctive qualities, in unfaltering and infallible
                    command of the right note of music and the proper tone of colour for the finest
                    touches of poetic execution, no poet of the most elaborate modern school,
                    working at ease upon every consummate resource of luxurious learning and
                    leisurely refinement, has ever excelled the best and most representative work of
                    a man who had literally no models before him, and probably or evidently was
                    often if not always compelled to write against time for his living.</p>
                <p>The just and generous judgment passed by Goethe on the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Faustus</hi> of his English predecessor in tragic treatment of the same subject
                    is somewhat more than sufficient to counterbalance the slighting or the sneering
                    references to that magnificent poem which might have been expected from the
                    ignorance of Byron or the incompetence of Hallam. And the particular note of
                    merit observed, the special point of the praise conferred, by the great German
                    poet should be no less sufficient to dispose of the vulgar misconception yet
                    lingering among sciolists and pretenders to criticism, which regards a writer
                    than whom no man was ever born with a finer or a stronger instinct for
                    perfection of excellence in execution as a mere noble savage of letters, a rough
                    self-taught sketcher or scribbler of crude <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0584-0557"/> and rude genius, whose unhewn blocks of verse had
                    in them some veins of rare enough metal to be quarried and polished by
                    Shakespeare. What most impressed the author of <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi> in
                    the work of Marlowe was a quality the want of which in the author of <hi
                    rend="italic">Manfred</hi> is proof enough to consign his best work to the
                    second or third class at most. “How greatly it is all planned !” the first
                    requisite of all great work, and one of which the highest genius possible to a
                    greatly gifted barbarian could by no possibility understand the nature or
                    conceive the existence. That Goethe “had thought of translating it” is perhaps
                    hardly less precious a tribute to its greatness than the fact that it has been
                    actually and admirably translated by the matchless translator of Shakespeare—the
                    son of Victor Hugo; whose labour of love may thus be said to have made another
                    point in common, and forged as it were another link of union, between
                    Shakespeare and the young master of Shakespeare’s youth. Of all great poems in
                    dramatic form it is perhaps the most remarkable for absolute singleness of aim
                    and simplicity of construction; yet is it wholly free from all possible
                    imputation of monotony or aridity. <hi rend="italic">Tamburlaine</hi> is
                    monotonous in the general roll and flow of its stately and sonorous verse
                    through a noisy wilderness of perpetual bluster and slaughter; but the unity of
                    tone and purpose in <hi rend="italic">Doctor Faustus</hi> is not unrelieved by
                    change of manner and variety of incident. The comic scenes, written evidently
                    with as little of labour as of relish, are for the most part scarcely more than
                    transcripts, thrown into the form of dialogue, from a popular prose <hi
                    rend="italic">History of Dr Faustus,</hi> and therefore should be set down as
                    little to the discredit as to the credit of the poet. Few masterpieces of any
                    age in any language can stand beside this tragic poem—it has hardly the
                    structure of a play—for the qualities of terror and splendour, for intensity of
                    purpose and sublimity of note. In the vision of Helen, for example, the intense
                    perception of loveliness gives actual sublimity to the sweetness and radiance of
                    mere beauty in the passionate and spontaneous selection of words the most choice
                    and perfect; and in like manner the sublimity of simplicity in Marlowe’s
                    conception and expression of the agonies endured by Faustus under the immediate
                    imminence of his doom gives the highest note of beauty, the quality of absolute
                    fitness and propriety, to the sheer straightforwardness of speech in which his
                    agonizing horror finds vent ever more and more terrible from the first to the
                    last equally beautiful and fearful verse of that tremendous monologue which has
                    no parallel in all the range of tragedy.</p>
                <p>It is now a commonplace of criticism to observe and regret the decline of power
                    and interest after the opening acts of <hi rend="italic">The Jew of Malta.</hi>
                    This decline is undeniable, though even the latter part of the play is not
                    wanting in rough energy and a coarse kind of interest; but the first two acts
                    would be sufficient foundation for the durable fame of a dramatic poet. In the
                    blank verse of Milton alone, who perhaps was hardly less indebted than
                    Shakespeare was before him to Marlowe as the first English master of word-music
                    in its grander forms, has the glory or the melody of passages in the opening
                    soliloquy of Barabas been possibly surpassed. The figure of the hero before it
                    degenerates into caricature is as finely touched as the poetic execution is
                    excellent; and the rude and rapid sketches of the minor characters show at least
                    some vigour and vivacity of touch.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Edward the Second</hi> the interest rises and the execution
                    improves as visibly and as greatly with the course of the advancing story as
                    they decline in <hi rend="italic">The Jew of Malta.</hi> The scene of the king’s
                    deposition at Kenilworth is almost as much finer in tragic effect and poetic
                    quality as it is shorter and less elaborate than the corresponding scene in
                    Shakespeare’s <hi rend="italic">King Richard II.</hi> The terror of the
                    deathscene undoubtedly rises into horror; but this horror is with skilful
                    simplicity of treatment preserved from passing into disgust. In pure poetry, in
                    sublime and splendid imagination, this tragedy is excelled by <hi rend="italic"
                    >Doctor Faustus;</hi> in dramatic power and positive impression of natural
                    effect it is as certainly the masterpiece of Marlowe. It was almost inevitable,
                    in the hands of any poet but Shakespeare, that none of the characters
                    represented should be capable of securing or even exciting any finer sympathy or
                    more serious interest than attends on the mere evolution of successive events or
                    the mere display of emotions (except always in the great scene of the
                    deposition) rather animal than spiritual in their expression of rage or
                    tenderness or suffering. The exact balance of mutual effect, the final note of
                    scenic harmony, between ideal conception and realistic execution is not yet
                    struck with perfect accuracy of touch and security of hand; but on this point
                    also Marlowe has here come nearer by many degrees to Shakespeare than any of his
                    other predecessors have ever come near to Marlowe.</p>
                <p>Of <hi rend="italic">The Massacre at Paris</hi> it is impossible to judge fairly
                    from the garbled fragment of its genuine text which is all that has conje down
                    to us. To Mr Collier, among numberless other obligations, we owe the discovery
                    of a noble passage excised in the piratical edition which gives us the only
                    version extant of this unlucky play, and which, it must be allowed, contains
                    nothing of quite equal value. This is obviously an occasional and polemical
                    work, and being as it is overcharged with the anti-Catholic passion of the time
                    has a typical quality which gives it some empirical significance and interest.
                    That antipapal ardour is indeed the only note of unity in a rough and ragged
                    chronicle which shambles and stumbles onward from the death of Queen Jeanne of
                    Navarre to the murder of the last Valois. It is possible to conjecture, what it
                    would be fruitless to affirm, that it gave a hint in the next century to
                    Nathaniel Lee for his far superior and really admirable tragedy on the same
                    subject, issued ninety-seven years after the death of Marlowe.</p>
                <p>In the tragedy of <hi rend="italic">Dido, Queen of Carthage,</hi> a servile
                    fidelity to the text of Virgil’s narrative has naturally resulted in the failure
                    which might have been expected from an attempt at once to transcribe what is
                    essentially inimitable and to reproduce it under the hopelessly alien conditions
                    of dramatic adaptation. The one really noble passage in a generally feeble and
                    incomposite piece of work is, however, uninspired by the unattainable model to
                    which the dramatists have been only too obsequious in their subservience. It is
                    as nearly certain as anything can be which depends chiefly upon cumulative and
                    collateral evidence that the better part of what is best in the serious scenes
                    of <hi rend="italic">King</hi><hi rend="italic">Henry</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >VI.</hi> is mainly the work of Marlowe. That he is at any rate the principal
                    author of the second and third plays passing under that name among the works of
                    Shakespeare, but first and imperfectly printed as <hi rend="italic">The
                    Contention between the two Famoτιs Houses of York and Lancaster,</hi> can hardly
                    be now a matter of debate among competent judges. The crucial difficulty of
                    criticism in this matter is to determine, if indeed we should not rather say to
                    conjecture, the authorship of the humorous scenes in prose, showing as they
                    generally do a power of comparatively high and pure comic realism to which
                    nothing in the acknowledged works of any pre-Shakespearean dramatist is even
                    remotely comparable. Yet, especially in the original text of these scenes as
                    they stand unpurified by the ultimate revision of Shakespeare or his editors,
                    there are tones and touches which recall rather the clownish horseplay and
                    homely ribaldry of his predecessors than anything in the lighter interludes of
                    his very earliest <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n585/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0585-0558"/> plays. We find the same sort of thing which we
                    find in their writings, only better done than they usually do it, rather than
                    such work as Shakespeare’s a little worse done than usual. And even in the final
                    text of the tragic or metrical scenes the highest note struck is always, with
                    one magnificent and unquestionable exception, rather in the key of Marlowe at
                    his best than of Shakespeare while yet in great measure his disciple.</p>
                <p>Had every copy of Marlowe’s boyish version or perversion of Ovid’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Elegies</hi> deservedly perished in the flames to which it was
                    judicially condemned by the sentence of a brace of prelates, it is possible that
                    an occasional bookworm, it is certain that no poetical student, would have
                    deplored its destruction, if its demerits could in that case have been imagined.
                    His translation of the first book of Lucan alternately rises above the original
                    and falls short of it,—often inferior to the Latin in point and weight of
                    expressive rhetoric, now and then brightened by a clearer note of poetry and
                    lifted into a higher mood of verse. Its terseness, vigour, and purity of style
                    would in any case have been praiseworthy, but are nothing less than admirable,
                    if not wonderful, when we consider how close the translator has on the whole (in
                    spite of occasional slips into inaccuracy) kept himself to the most rigid limit
                    of literal representation, phrase by phrase and often line by line. The really
                    startling force and felicity of occasional verses are worthier of remark than
                    the inevitable stiffness and heaviness of others, when the technical difficulty
                    of such a task is duly taken into account.</p>
                <p>One of the most faultless lyrics and one of the loveliest fragments in the whole
                    range of descriptive and fanciful poetry would have secured a place for Marlowe
                    among the memorable men of bis epoch, even if his plays had perished with
                    himself. His <hi rend="italic">Passionate Shepherd</hi> remains ever since
                    unrivalled in its way—a way of pure fancy and radiant melody without break or
                    lapse. The untitled fragment, on the other hand, has been very closely rivalled,
                    perhaps very happily imitated, but only by the greatest lyric poet of England—by
                    Shelley alone. Marlowe’s poem of <hi rend="italic">Hero and Leander,</hi>
                    closing with the sunrise which closes the night of the lovers’ union, stands
                    alone in its age, and far ahead of the work of any possible competitor between
                    the death of Spenser and the dawn of Milton. In clear mastery of narrative and
                    presentation, in melodious ease and simplicity of strength, it is not less
                    pre-eminent than in the adorable beauty and impeccable perfection of separate
                    lines or passages.</p>
                <p>The place and the value of Christopher Marlowe as a leader among English poets it
                    would be almost impossible for historical criticism to overestimate. To none of
                    them all. perhaps, have so many of the greatest among them been so deeply and so
                    directly indebted. Nor was ever any great writer’s influence upon his fellows
                    more utterly and unmixedly an influence for good. He first, and he alone, guided
                    Shakespeare into the right way of work: his music, in which there is no echo of
                    any man’s before him, found its own echo in the more prolonged but hardly more
                    exalted harmony of Milton’s. He is the greatest discoverer, the most daring and
                    inspired pioneer, in all our poetic literature. Before him there was neither
                    genuine blank verse nor a genuine tragedy in our language. After his arrival the
                    way was prepared, the paths were made straight, for Shakespeare. <hi
