                <p><label type="entry">MADURA</label>, a district in the south of the Madras
                    presidency, India, lying between 9° 4' and 10° 44' N. lat., and 77° 14' and 79°
                    20' E. long., is bounded on the N. by Coimbatore, Trichinopoli, and Tanjore
                    districts, E. and S.E. by the sea, S.W. by Tinιlevelli district, and W. by
                    Travancore state. Broadly speaking, it consists of a section of the plain
                    stretching from the mountains east to the sea, coinciding with the basin of the
                    Vaigâi river, and gradually sloping to the south-east. The plain is broken in
                    the west by the outlying spurs of the Ghâts, and by a few isolated hills and
                    masses of rock scattered over the country. The most important spur of the Ghâts
                    is that known as the Palni hills, which project east-north-east across the
                    district for a distance of about 54 miles. Their highest peaks are more than
                    8000 feet above sea-level, and they enclose a plateau of about 100 square miles
                    in area, with an average height of 7000 feet. A sanatarium has been recently
                    established on this plateau, at Kodâikanal, and coffee planting is here
                    successfully carried on. Farther east a confused group of hills, known as the
                    Sirumalais, the highest of which has an elevation of nearly 4000 feet, clusters
                    round the village of Nattam. Among isolated rocks may be mentioned the
                    precipitous fortress of Dindigal, and the “Elephant Rock,” the “Cow Hill,” and
                    the sacred Skandamalia—all in the immediate vicinity of Madura town. The chief
                    river is the Vaigâi, which divides the district into two almost equal portions.
                    Very little forest is found in any part of the district. The cultivated plain is
                    absolutely barren of trees, except where a newly-planted avenue marks a line of
                    road. Groves of palmyra and cocoa-nut palms flourish along the sea-coast and
                    river banks. Among the wild products of the Palni hills are nutmeg, cinnamon,
                    and pepper. The predominant geological formation is granite. Syenite occurs in
                    large boulders. A gravelly bed of laterite, which runs across the district, is
                    quarried for building purposes; and sandstone is said to extend along the whole
                    length of the sea-coast. Mineral products include saltpetre, salt, lime, chalk,
                    and graphite. Iron in various forms is found, but it is nowhere worked
                    profitably, even by the rude native processes. Gold is washed in some of the
                    streams. Several kinds of opal, chalcedony, jasper, garnet, and rock-crystal are
                    found.</p>
                <p>The census of 1871 showed a total population of 2,266,615 persons (1,112,066
                    males and 1,154,549 females), spread over an area of 9502 square miles, and
                    inhabiting 5459 villages and 443,513 houses. Hindus numbered 2,062,768, and
                    Mohammedans 132,833; and the Catholics at the present day number about 60,000,
                    under the charge of the missions of the Jesuits and of the Church of Goa. The
                    Protestant population are under the charge of an American mission, first
                    established in 1834. The principal towns are Madura city (51,987), Dindigal
                    (12,818), Palni (12,801), Râmnâd (15,442), Tirumangalam (5772), Parambakudi
                    (6284), Sivagangâ (7392), Killakarài, Aruppukotai, and Periyakulam. The only
                    municipalities are Madura and Dindigal.</p>

                    and cotton. The rainfall is small and var⅛ble in its. seasons. Every possible
                    means of storing up surplus water has been resorted to from time immemorial. An
                    important engineering project, known as the Periyâr scheme, has long been under
                    consideration, by which the abundant rainfall on the farther slope of the
                    Travancore hills might be diverted into the drainage basin of the Vaigai. Salt
                    is manufactured at certain stations on the coast as a Government monopoly.
                    Handsome turbans fringed with gold cloth, and a peculiar kind of red cloth, are
                    specialities of Madura town. Considerable sea-borne trade is carried on by
                    native craft, chiefly with Ceylon. Rice and other food grains, gingelly oil,
                    spices, cloth, salt fish, tobacco, red ochre, and earthenware ate the principal
                    exports. The district is traversed by the South Indian railway from Tinnevelli
                    to Trichinopoli. The total imperial revenue in 1875-76 amounted to £393,448, of
                    which £280,067 was derived from the land. Education in 1876-77 was afforded by
                    424 schools, attended by 12,509 pupils. Besides ordinary diseases, Madura
                    possesses three special scourges :— endemic fever, which sometimes rages with
                    exceptional severity; cholera, disseminated by pilgrims to the sacred temple at
                    Râmes-waram; and the well-known “Madura foot.” This last complaint, known to
                    science as <hi rend="italic">morbus pedis entophyticus,</hi> is a species of
                    fungus which spreads over the whole foot in a mass of tubercles. Its primary
                    cause seems to be unknown.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> Madura was the seat of the Pandian monarchy,
                    which ruled over this part of India from the 5th century B.c. to the end of the
                    11th century of our era. The last of the Pandia kings is said to have
                    exterminated the Jains, and conquered the neighbouring kingdom of Chola; but he
                    was in his turn overthrown by an invader from the north, conjectured to have
                    been a Mohammedan. In 1324 a Moslem army under Malik Kafur occupied Madura, and
                    the Hindus were held in subjection for a period of fifty years. Subsequently
                    Madura became a province of the Hindu empire of Vijayanagar. In the middle of
                    the 16th century the governor Viswanath established an hereditary rule which
                    lasted for a century. The greatest of the line was Tirumala Nayak (1623-1659),
                    whose magnificence and military exploits are recorded in the contemporary
                    letters of the Jesuit missionaries. He adorned Madura with many public
                    buildings, and extended his empire over the adjoining districts of Tinnevelli,
                    Travancore, Coimbatore, Salem, and Trichinopoli. His repudiation of the nominal
                    allegiance paid to the raja of Vijayanagar brought him into collision with the
                    sultan of Bijapur, and Mohammedans, after the lapse of three centuries, again
                    invaded Madura, and compelled him to pay them tribute. After the death of
                    Tirumala the kingdom of Madura gradually fell to pieces. In 1740 the district
                    fell into the hands of the nawàb of the Carnatic, and the line of the Nâyaks was
                    extinguished. In 1762 British officers took charge of Madura, in trust for
                    Wallah Jah, the last independent nawab of the Carnatic, who finally ceded his
                    rights of sovereignty to the East India Company in 1801.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Madura,</hi> the chief town and headquarters of Madura
                    district, is situated on the south bank of the Vaigâi river in 9° <hi
                    rend="italic">55'</hi> 16” N. lat., and 78° 9' 44'' E. long., with a population
                    (1871) of 51,987, being the fourth largest town in the Madras presidency. Its
                    principal architectural feature is the great temple, forming a parallelogram 847
                    feet by 744 feet, surrounded by nine gopuras, one of which is 152 feet high. The
                    principal structure is the “Hall of a Thousand Pillats” (the actual number being
                    997). The other buildings comprise the celebrated palace of Tirumala Nâyak, the
                    most perfect relic of secular architecture in Madras. Its ruins cover a large
                    area of ground, and a considerable sum of money has been recently assigned by
                    Government for the restoration of the building. Only second in importance to the
                    palace is the Vasanta or Puthu <hi rend="italic">rnantapam</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> t</hi> which still exists in complete preservation, and is said to
                    have been built as a summer retreat for the god Sundareshwara, a form of Siva.
                    On the opposite bank of the river is the Tamakam, a two-storied building of
                    quaint architecture, said to have been erected as a stand from which to view
                    sports and combats. Last is the Teppu-kulam or great tank, situated 1⅜ miles to
                    the east of the town, and measuring 1200 yards each way. Once a year its banks
                    are illuminated by (it is said) 100,000 lamps, while the idols from the pagoda
                    are drawn round it on a <hi rend="italic">teppam</hi> or raft.</p>
