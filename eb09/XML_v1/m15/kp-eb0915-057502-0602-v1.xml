                <p><label type="entry">MARSTON, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label>, was one of
                    the most vigorous satirists and dramatists of the Shakespearean age. He was
                    probably some ten years younger than Shakespeare He has been identified with a
                    gentleman commoner of Brasenose College, Oxford, who entered in 1591, and was
                    admitted B.A. in 1593 as the eldest son of an esquire. If this is the same John
                    Marston that was buried in the Temple Church in 1634, under a tombstone <hi
                    rend="italic">Oblivioni</hi><hi rend="italic">sacrum,</hi> the identification of
                    him with the poet is most probably right, for one of Marston’s most singular
                    poems is a prayer to Oblivion—</p>
                <p>“Let others pray For ever their fair poems·flourish may; But as for me, hungry
                    Oblivion, Devour me quick.”</p>
                <p>In the superfluity of learned allusions and Latin quotations in his plays Marston
                    proclaims the fact that he was a university man. He entered the field of letters
                    in 1598, as a satirist, with a <hi rend="italic">Scourge of Villany.</hi> He was
                    professedly an imitator of Juvenal, but he wrote rather in the spirit of
                    Skelton, and · speedily earned something like Skelton’s reputation as a coarse
                    ribald buffoon of astonishing energy, girding at the grossest vices of the time
                    in “plain naked words stript from their shirts.” There was more of the
                    good-natured chuckling buffoon than of the cynic in Marston’s satire, though he
                    did profess unmeasured scorn for the vices and fopperies of his age. The coarse
                    energy of his invective pours out as if he loved strong language more than he
                    hated the subjects of his ridicule. Shakespeare’s <hi rend="italic">Venus and
                    Adonis</hi> was one of Marston’s first butts; in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pygmalion’s Image</hi> (1598) the wooing of Adonis by the queen of love is very
                    roughly but very cleverly parodied. The freshness and vigour of Marston’s vein
                    brought him at once into notice. He is mentioned (misspelt as Maxton or Mastone)
                    in Henslowe’s <hi rend="italic">Diary,</hi> in 1599, as “the new poet” receiving
                    payment as part author of a play; and in the same year he was probably ridiculed
                    by Ben Jonson as “Carlo Buffone” in <hi rend="italic">Every Man out of his
                    Humour.</hi> He and Dekker had a famous quarrel with Jonson arising out of the
                    latter’s attack .upon them in the <hi rend="italic">Poetaster</hi> (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Dekker).</hi> The literary enemies were reconciled; Marston
                    forswore literary quarrels,, dedicated a play to Jonson in terms of high eulogy,
                    and was conjoined with Jonson and Chapman in the play of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eastward Ho!</hi> some political allusions in which nearly cost the authors
                    their ears. Marston wrote comparatively few plays, published in quick succession
                    at the following dates :— <hi rend="italic">Antonio and Mellida</hi> (1602); <hi
                    rend="italic">Antonio’s Revenge</hi> (1602); <hi rend="italic">The
                    Malcontent</hi> (1604, his first and most powerful play); <hi rend="italic">The
                    Dutch Courtesan</hi> (1605); <hi rend="italic">Parasitaster</hi> (1606); <hi
                    rend="italic">Sophonisba</hi> (1606); <hi rend="italic">What You Will</hi>
                    (1607). Marston then apparently left off play writing; if he lived till 1631,
                    there is no explanation of his sudden stoppage. There is very little
                    constructive skill in his plays; the plots are uninteresting. He does little
                    more than send a procession of puppets across the stage, »one or more of which
                    “gird at” the others—very “loose libertines” and very contemptible some of
                    them—in the author’s own rough vein of satire. One scene in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Antonio and Mellida</hi> was much admired by Charles Lamb, and either suggested
                    or was suggested by one of the most powerful situations in <hi rend="italic"
                    >King Lear.</hi> But the passage taken out of the body of the play gives a very
                    misleading idea of its general tenor, or of the general cast of Marston’s
                    dramatic work.</p>
