                    >François-Pierre-Gonthier</hi></label> (1766-1824), a distinguished philosopher
                    of France, the son of a physician, was born at Bergerac November 29, 1766. After
                    studying with distinction under the <hi rend="italic">doctrinaires</hi> of
                    Perigueux, he entered the life-guards of Louis XVI., and was present at
                    Versailles on the notable 5th and 6th of October 1789. On the breaking up of the
                    <hi rend="italic">garde du corps,</hi> Maine de Biran retired to his patrimonial
                    inheritance of Grateloup, near Bergerac, where his sequestered residence and
                    limited income preserved him from the horrors of the Revolution. It was at this
                    period that, as he says himself, he “passed <hi rend="italic">per</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">saltum</hi> from frivolity to philosophy.” The forced leisure of
                    this fearful time decided the vocation of his life. He combined, in a more than
                    ordinary degree, subtle sensitiveness to external influences with singular
                    acuteness in surveying and analysing internal phenomena. The modes of the mind
                    and their organic causes or conditions were alike submitted to his scrutiny. He
                    began his philosophical studies with psychology, and he made psychology the
                    study of his life. When the Reign of Terror was succeeded by calmer days, Maine
                    de Bi ran was called to take part in the administrative and political affairs of
                    his country. After his exclusion from the council of the Five Hundred on being
                    suspected of royalism, he took part with his friend Lainé in the commission of
                    1813, which gave expression for the first time to direct opposition to the will
                    of the emperor. After the Restoration he held the office of treasurer to the
                    chamber of deputies, and habitually retired during the autumn recess to his
                    native district to pursue his favourite study. He died 16th July 1824.</p>
                <p>Maine de Biran’s philosophical reputation has suffered from two causes—the
                    obscure, laboured quality of his style, and the unfortunate mode of publication
                    of his writings. In all his work there is evidence of thorough originality of
                    thinking, but in the expression of his thoughts this very originality is so far
                    a disadvantage in that it imposes on him a mode of exposition little calculated
                    to attract and retain the attention of a reader. During his life, moreover, but
                    few, and these the least characteristic of his works, were formally published.

                    >Biographie Universelle</hi> (1819) appeared during his lifetime. A long memoir

                    in 1805, was. sent to press, but, for some reason, was not finally printed. His
                    manuscripts, very large in quantity, were not made accessible in their entirety
                    to Cousin when that writer desired to prepare a collective edition of De Biran’s
                    works. Tn 1834 the writings above enumerated, together with the important essay
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Nouvelles</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    1841 there were added three volumes by the same editor, under the title <hi
                    rend="italic">Oeuvres philosophiques</hi><hi rend="italic">de Maine de
                    Biran.</hi> The manuscripts from which Cousin had prepared this edition were,
                    however, in a most imperfect condition, and it was known that some memoirs to
                    which De Biran attached the greatest importance were still in obscurity. In 1845
                    a large mass of manuscript was placed by De Biran’s son in the hands of F. Μ. E.
                    Naville. The labour of preparing these for publication, interrupted by the death
                    of Naville in 1846, was continued by his son, E. Naville, and completed, with
                    the aid of Μ. Debrit, in 1859. The <hi rend="italic">Oeuvres inédites de</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Μ. de Biran,</hi> 3 vols., rendered it possible for the first time
                    to obtain a connected view of a very remarkable monument of philosophical
                    development. In these volumes the most important work is that entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Essai sur les fondements de la psychologie et sur ses rapports
                    avec l'étude de</hi><hi rend="italic">la nature,</hi> which represents the
                    completest stage of De Biran’s thinking. A later stage is represented by the
                    fragments of a projected work entitled <hi rend="italic">Nouveaux Essais</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">d'</hi><hi rend="italic">Anthropologie,</hi> in which the
                    psychology of the earlier treatise is developed in the direction of a somevdιat
                    mystical metaphysic.</p>
                <p>De Biran’s first essays in philosophy were written avowedly from the point of
                    view of Locke and Condillac, but even in them he was brought to signalize the
                    essential fact on which his later speculation turns. Dealing with the formation
                    of habits, he is compelled to note that passive impressions, however
                    transformed, do not furnish a complete or adequate explanation. With
                    Laromiguière he distinguishes attention as an active effort, of no less
                    importance than the passive receptivity of sense, and with Butler distinguishes
                    passively formed customs from active habits. Prolonged meditation, evidenced in
                    the occasional writings, prize essays, and the like of the subsequent years,
                    brought him to the far-reaching conclusion that Condillac’s notion of passive
                    receptivity as the one source of conscious experience was not only an error in
                    fact but an error of method,—in short, that the mechanical mode of viewing
                    consciousness as formed by external influence was fallacious and deceptive. For
                    it he proposed to substitute the genetic method, whereby human conscious
                    experience might be exhibited as growing or developing from its essential basis
                    in connexion with external conditions. The essential basis he finds in the real
                    consciousness of self as an active striving power, and the stages of its
                    development, corresponding to what one may call the relative importance of the
                    external conditions and the reflective clearness of self-consciousness, he
                    designates as the affective, the perceptive, and the reflective. These stages
                    are characterized with much skill and psychological acuteness, and in connexion
                    therewith De Biran treats most of the obscure problems which arise in dealing
                    with conscious experience, such as the mode by which the organism is cognized,
                    the mode by which the organism is distinguished from extra-organic things, and
                    the nature of those general ideas by which the relations of things are known to
                    us—cause, power, force, &amp;c. His views are always suggestive, and the best
                    recent psychology in France is but a reproduction of some of them.</p>
                <p>In the latest stage of his speculation De Biran distinguishes the animal
                    existence from the human, under which the three forms above noted are classed,
                    and both from the life of the spirit, in which human thought is brought into
                    relation with the supersensible, divine system of things. This stage, as above
                    said, is left imperfect. Altogether De Biran’s work presents a very remarkable
                    specimen of deep metaphysical thinking directed by preference to the
                    psychological aspect of experience. It is almost a solitary instance of an
                    effort to treat psychology in a wide and philosophical manner.</p>
