                    distinctive esoteric doctrines, associations for worship with peculiar
                    mysteries, and ascetic sects with special rules of conduct. Of churchly
                    organizations the most important, next to Catholicism, was the Marcionite
                    community. Like the catholic church, this body professed to comprehend
                    everything belonging to Christianity. It admitted all believers without
                    distinction of age, sex, rank, or culture. It was no mere school for the
                    learned, disclosed no mysteries for the privileged, but sought to lay the
                    foundation of the Christian community on the pure gospel, the authentic
                    institutes of Christ. The pure gospel, however, Marcion found to be everywhere
                    more or less corrupted and mutilated in the Christian circles of his time. His
                    undertaking thus resolved itself into a reformation of Christendom. This
                    reformation was to deliver Christendom from false Jewish doctrines by restoring
                    the Pauline conception of the gospel,— Paul being, according to Marcion, the
                    only apostle who had rightly understood the new message of salvation as
                    delivered by Christ. In Marcion’s own view, therefore, the founding of his
                    church—to which he was first driven by opposition—amounts to a reformation of
                    Christendom through a return to the gospel of Christ and to Paul; nothing was to
                    be accepted beyond that. This of itself shows that it is a mistake to reckon
                    Marcion among the Gnostics. A dualist, we shall see, he certainly was, but he
                    was not a Gnostic. For he ascribed salvation, not to “knowledge” but to “faith”;
                    he appealed openly to the whole Christian world; and he nowhere consciously
                    added foreign elements to the revelation given through Christ. It is true
                    that-in many features his Christian system—if we may use the
                    expression—resembles the so-called Gnostic systems; but the first duty of the
                    historian is to point out what Marcion plainly aimed at; only in the second
                    place have we to inquire how far the result corresponded with those
                    purposes.</p>
                <p>The doctrines of Marcion and the history of his churches from the 2d to the 7th
                    century are known to us from the controversial works of the catholic fathers.
                    From Justin downwards, almost every eminent church teacher takes some notice of
                    Marcion, while very many write extensive treatises against him. The most
                    important of those which have come down to us are the controversial pieces of
                    Irenaeus (in his great work against heretics), Tertullian <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Adv. Marc.,</hi> i.-v.), Hippolytus, Pseudo-Origen Adamantius, Epiphanius, and
                    the Armenian Esnik. From these works the contents of the Marcionite Gospel, and
                    also the text of Paul’s epistles in Marcion’s recension, can be settled with
                    tolerable accuracy. His opponents, moreover, have preserved some expressions of
                    his, with extracts from his principal work; so that our knowledge of Marcion’s
                    views is in part derived from the best sources.</p>
                <p>Marcion was a wealthy shipowner, belonging to Sinope in Pontus. He appears to
                    have been a convert from paganism to Christianity, although it was asserted in
                    later times that his father had been a bishop. That report is probably as
                    untrustworthy as another, that he was excommunicated from the church for
                    seducing a virgin. What we know for certain is that after the death of Hyginus
                    (or <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> 139 <hi rend="smallcaps">λ.d.)</hi> he arrived, in
                    the course of his travels, at Rome, and made a handsome donation of money to the
                    local church. Even then, however, the leading features of his peculiar system
                    must have been already thought out. At Rome he tried to gain acceptance for them
                    in the college of presbyters and in the church; indeed he had previously made
                    similar attempts in Asia Minor. But he now encountered such determined
                    opposition from the majority of the congregation that he found it necessary to
                    withdraw from the great church and establish in Rome a community of his own.
                    This was about the year 144. The new society increased in the two following
                    decades; and very soon numerous sister-churches were flourishing in the east and
                    west of the empire. Marcion took up his residence permanently in Rome, but still
                    undertook journeys for the propagation of his opinions. In Rome he became
                    acquainted with the Syrian Gnostic Cerdo, whose speculations influenced the
                    development of the Marcionite theology. Still Marcion seems never to have
                    abandoned his design of gaining over the whole church to his gospel. The proof
                    of this is found, partly in the fact that he tried to establish relations with
                    Polycarp of Smyrna,—from whom, to be sure, he got a sharp rebuff,—partly in a
                    legend to the effect that towards the end of his life he sought readmission to
                    the church. Such, presumably, was the construction put in after times on his
                    earnest endeavour to unite Christians on the footing of the “pure gospel.” When
                    he died is not known; but his death can scarcely have been much later than the
                    year 165.</p>
                <p>The distinctive teaching of Marcion originated in a comparison of the Old
                    Testament with the gospel of Christ and the theology of the apostle Paul. Its
                    motive was not cosmological or metaphysical, but religious and historical. In
                    the gospel he found a God revealed who is goodness and love, and who desires
                    faith and love from men. This God he could not discover in the Old Testament; on
                    the contrary, he saw there the revelations of a just, stern, jealous, wrathful,
                    and variable god, who requires from his servants blind obedience, fear and
                    outward righteousness. Overpowered by the majesty and novelty of the Christian
                    message of salvation, too conscientious to rest satisfied with the ordinary
                    attempts at the solution of difficulties, while yet he was in no position to
                    reach an historical insight into the relation of Christianity to the Old
                    Testament and to Judaism—who indeed was so in those days ?—he believed that he
                    expressed Paul’s view by the hypothesis of two Gods: the just God of the law
                    (the God of the Jews, who is also the Creator of the world), and the good God,
                    the Father of Jesus Christ. Paradoxes in the history of religion and revelation
                    which Paul draws out, and which Marcion’s contemporaries passed by as utterly
                    incomprehensible, are here made the foundation of an ethico-dualistic conception
                    of history and of religion. It may be said that in the 2d century only one
                    Christian—Marcion—took the trouble to understand Paul; but it must be added that
                    he misunderstood him. The profound reflexions of the apostle on the radical
                    antithesis of law and gospel, works and faith, were not appreciated in the 2d
                    century. Marcion alone perceived their decisive religious importance, and with
                    them confronted the legalizing, and in this sense Judaizing, tendencies of his
                    Christian contemporaries. But the Pauline ideas lost their truth under his
                    treatment; for, when it is denied that the God of redemption is at the same time
                    the almighty Lord of heaven and earth, the gospel is turned upside down.</p>
                <p>The assumption of two gods necessarily led to cosmological speculations. Under
                    the influence of Cerdo, Marcion carried out his ethical dualism in the sphere of
                    cosmology; but the fact that his system is not free from contradictions is the
                    best proof that all along religious knowledge, and not philosophical, had the
                    chief value in his eyes. The main outlines of his teaching are as follows. Man
                    is, in spirit, soul, and body, a creature of the just and wrathful god. This god
                    created man from Hyle (matter),<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>On the relation of matter to the Creator Marcion himself
                    seems not to have speculated, though his followers may have done so.</p></note>
                    and imposed on him a strict law. Since no one could keep this law, the whole
                    human race fell under the curse, temporal and eternal, of the Demiurge. Then a
                    higher God, hitherto unknown, and concealed even from the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n562/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0562-0535"/> Demiurge, took pity on the wretched, condemned
                    race of men. He sent His Son (whom Marcion probably regarded as a manifestation
                    of the supreme God Himself) down to this earth in order to redeem men. Clothed
                    in a visionary body, in the likeness of a man of thirty years old, the Son made
                    His appearance in the fifteenth year of Tiberius, and preached in the synagogue
                    at Capernaum. But none of the Jewish people understood Him. Even the disciples
                    whom He chose did not recognize His true nature, but mistook Him for the Messiah
                    promised by the Demiurge through the prophets, who as warrior and king was to
                    come and set up the Jewish empire. The Demiurge himself did not suspect who the
                    stranger was; nevertheless he became angry with Him, and, although Jesus had
                    punctually fulfilled his law, caused Him to be nailed to the cross. By that act,
                    however, he pronounced his own doom. For the risen Christ appeared before him in
                    His glory, and charged him with having acted contrary to his own law. To make
                    amends for this crime, the Demiurge had now to deliver up to the good God the
                    souls of those who were to be redeemed; they are, as it were, purchased from him
                    by the death of Christ. Christ then proceeded to the underworld to deliver the
                    spirits of the departed. It was not the Old Testament saints, however, but only
                    sinners and malefactors who obeyed His summons. Then, to gain the living, Christ
                    raised up Paul as His apostle. He alone understood the gospel, and recognized
                    the difference between the just God and the good. Accordingly, he opposed the
                    original apostles with their Judaistic doctrines, and founded small
                    congregations of true Christians. But the preaching of the false Jewish
                    Christians gained the upper hand; nay, they even falsified the evangelical
                    oracles and the letters of Paul. Marcion himself was the next raised up by the
                    good God, to proclaim once more the true gospel. This he did by setting aside
                    the spurious gospels, purging the real Gospel (the Gospel of Luke) from supposed
                    Judaizing interpolations, and restoring the true text of the Pauline epistles.
                    He likewise composed a book, called the <hi rend="italic">Antitheses,</hi> in
                    which he proved the disparity of the two gods, from a comparison of the Old
                    Testament with the evangelical writings.</p>
                <p>On the basis of these writings Marcion proclaimed the true Christianity, and
                    founded churches. He taught that all who put their trust in the good God, and
                    His crucified Son, renounce their allegiance to the Demiurge, and approve
                    themselves by good works of love, shall be saved. But he taught further—and here
                    we trace the influence of the current Gnosticism on Marcion—that only the spirit
                    of man is saved by the good God; the body, because material, perishes.
                    Accordingly his ethics also were thoroughly dualistic. By the “works of the
                    Demiurge,” which the Christian is to flee, he meant the whole “service of the
                    perishable.” The Christian must shun everything sensual, and especially
                    marriage, and free himself from the body by strict asceticism. The original
                    ethical contrast of <hi rend="superscript"> 41</hi> good” and “just” is thus
                    transformed into the cosmological contrast of “spirit” and “matter.” The good
                    God appears as the god of spirit, the Old Testament god as the god of matter.
                    That is Gnosticism; but it is at the same time illogical. For, since, according
                    to Marcion, the spirit of man is derived, not from the good, but from the just
                    God, it is impossible to see why the spiritual should yet be more closely
                    related to the good God, than the material. There is yet another direction in
                    which the system ends with a contradiction. According to Marcion, the good God
                    never judges,but everywhere manifests Hisgoodness,— is, therefore, not to be
                    feared, but simply to be loved, as a father. But here the question occurs, What
                    becomes of the men who do not believe the gospel? Marcion answers, The good God
                    does not judge them, but merely removes them from His presence. Then they fall
                    under the power of the Demiurge, who—rewards them for their fidelity? No, says
                    Marcion, but on the contrary—punishes them in his hell! The contradiction here
                    is palpable; and at the same time the antithesis of “just” and “good” ultimately
                    vanishes. For the Demiurge now appears as an inferior being, who in reality
                    executes the purposes of the good God. It is plain that dualism here terminates
                    in the idea of the sole supremacy of the good God.</p>
                <p>It is not surprising, therefore, that even in the 2d century the disciples of
                    Marcion diverged in several directions. Rigorous asceticism, the rejection of
                    the Ol&lt;l Testament, and the recognition of the “new God” remained common to
                    all Marcionites, who, moreover, like the catholics, lived together in close
                    communities ruled by bishops and presbyters (although their constitution was
                    originally very loose, and sought to avoid every appearance of “legality”).
                    Some, however, accepted three first principles (the evil, the just, the good);
                    others held by two, but regarded the Demiurge as the god of evil, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the devil; while a third party, like Apelles, the most
                    distinguished of Marcion’s pupils, saw in the Demiurge only an apostate angel of
                    the good God,—thus returning to monotheism. The.golden age of the Marcionite
                    churches falls between the years 150 and 250. During that time they were really
                    dangerous to the great church; for in fact they maintained certain genuine
                    Christian ideas, which the catholic church had forgotten. From the beginning of
                    the 4th century they began to die out in the West; or rather they fell a prey to
                    Manichaeism. In the East also many Marcionites went over to the Manichaeans; but
                    there they survived much longer. They can be traced down to the 7th century, and
                    then they seem to vanish. But it was unquestionably from Marcionite impulses
                    that the new sects of the Paulicians and Bogomiles arose; and in so far as the
                    western Katharoi, and the antinomian and anticlerical sects of the 13th century
                    are connected with these, they also may be included in the history of
                    Marcionitism.</p>

                    Marcion was the first to make a canonical collection of New Testament writings;
                    (2) his Gospel is to be regarded as a reconstruction, and not as the basis, of
