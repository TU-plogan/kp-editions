                <p><label type="entry">MEGARA</label> was the name of two Greek towns, one in
                    Sicily, which has been already described under <hi rend="smallcaps">Hybla,</hi>
                    the other on the road from Attica to Corinth. The country which belonged to the
                    city was called M∈γαptς or 17 M∈γapικτ); it occupied the broader part of the
                    isthmus between Attica, Boeotia, Corinth, and the two gulfs, and its whole area
                    is estimated by Clinton at 143 square miles. The range of Mount Geraneia extends
                    across the country from east to west, forming a barrier between continental
                    Greece and the Peloponnesus. The shortest road across this range passes along
                    the eastern side of the mountains, and the most difficult part is the celebrated
                    Scironian rocks, the mythic home of the robber Sciron. The only plain in the
                    rugged little country was the White Plain, in which was situated the only
                    important town, Megara. The town was one of the most important commercial and
                    colonizing centres of Greece in early times, and there is no doubt that its
                    trade, like that of Corinth, owed its origin to the Phoenicians, who found its
                    situation on the isthmus convenient. It became a Dorian city when that tribe
                    conquered the Peloponnesus. Like many other cities of Greece, Megara was formed
                    out of five villages, which were united on one political foundation; and this
                    event must have taken place not later than the middle of the 8th century. From
                    this time for two centuries Megara was among the most powerful cities of Greece.
                    Though it had a harbour called Pegae on the Corinthian Gulf, and founded a
                    Sicilian colony, Megara Hyblaea, in 728 B.C., yet it did not long compete with
                    Corinth and Corcyra for the western trade. Nisaea on the Saronic Gulf was a
                    better harbour, and gave the Megarians a stronger footing on the eastern seas.
                    In order to keep their hold on the Black Sea traffic, they founded numerous
                    trading stations alongside of their chief rivals, the people of Miletus:
                    Chalcedon and Byzantium on the Bosphorus, and Astacus and Heraclea in Bithynia
                    were colonies of Megara. Wealth and culture increased in the city; the country
                    festivals were celebrated in a more elaborate and orderly manner, and Susarion
                    of Tripodiscus first gave literary form to Grecian comedy, which was soon
                    transferred to Attica.</p>
                <p>The situation of Megaris on the isthmus gave it great political power, inasmuch
                    as it commanded all the roads from the Peloponnesus into continental Greece; and
                    so long as the people continued united under an orderly government they
                    maintained their high position. But the development of education prompted the
                    lower classes to demand from the nobles an equal share in the government, and
                    Megara did not, like Athens and Sparta, produce a constitution which could
                    reconcile the contending parties. A tyrant Theagenes raised himself to supreme
                    power as the leader of the popular party; he made an aqueduct for the city, and
                    appears to have maintained its power and splendour. But he was expelled by the
                    nobles about 600 B.c., and for many years Megara was the scene of continual
                    struggles. The poor, who were indebted to the rich, refused to pay what they
                    counted exorbitant interest, and plundered the houses of the nobles. A vivid
                    picture of the state of the city in the 6th century <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> is preservedin the writings of the poet Theognis, who belonged to the
                    aristocratic party. Meanwhile Athens was rising to power, and maintained a long
                    war with Megara for the island of Salamis. The Megarians gradually lost
                    strength, and finally Solon wrested the island from them for ever. They sent
                    three thousand troops to fight at Plataea. In the wars between Athens and Sparta
                    they were impelled by jealousy of their neighbours of Corinth to join the
                    Athenian alliance, 455-45; but they soon found that they were only the subjects
                    of Athens, and finally <pb break="no"

                    They suffered terribly during the Peloponnesian War: Athenian ships blockaded
                    their harbours and Athenian armies ravaged their land once or twice every year.
                    The long famine in the city is referred to by /kristophanes in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Acharnians.</hi> The city maintained a flourishing existence
                    throughout the Greek and Roman periods, but played a very subordinate part in
                    history. In the unsettled time when the Roman empire had decayed, it was often
                    plundered by pirates.</p>
                <p>As regards literature, Megara’s chief distinction, besides the poems of Theognis
                    and the comedy of Susarion, was the school of philosophy founded there by
                    Euclid, a disciple of Socrates. The coinage of the city is a very con« fused and
                    difficult subject; no very early coins can be with certainty attributed to it.
                    The usual types are Apolline. The topography is described by Pausanias, bk. i.
                    Megara is about four hours’ carriage-drive from Athens.</p>
