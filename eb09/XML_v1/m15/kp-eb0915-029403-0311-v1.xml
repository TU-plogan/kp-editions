                <p><label type="entry">MAIDSTONE</label>, a municipal and parliamentary borough, and
                    the county town of Kent, England, situated almost midway between London and
                    Dover. It lies principally on the eastern bank of the river Medway, the modern
                    part spreading over the western slopes of a picturesque valley, which is
                    intersected and environed by orchards and hop gardens. Although antiquaries have
                    conjectured that Maidstone was a military station of the Romans, few Roman
                    remains have been found in the neighbourhood. The Saxon spelling of the name was
                    <hi rend="italic">Medwegestun,</hi> “Medway’s town.” The manor, valued in
                    Domesday Book at £35, 10s., had from a very early period belonged to the see of
                    Canterbury. Archbishop Boniface in 1260 established a hospital here for poor
                    pilgrims, the chapel of which, with modern additions, is again used for public
                    worship. The parish church of St Mary, which had existed from Norman times, was
                    demolished in 1395 by Archbishop Courtenay, who erected on the site thereof the
                    present church of All Saints; he also, at a short distance, founded a college of
                    secular canons, the ruins of which are an interesting specimen of 14th century
                    architecture. From the reign of John until the Reformation the archbishops had
                    here a residence, at which Stafford and Courtenay died; but the existing
                    building known as the palace dates chiefly from Elizabethan times. The rectory,
                    with the manor, passed into lay hands at the Reformation; and, having been a
                    perpetual curacy for three hundred and twenty years, the living became a
                    vicarage in 1866. All Saints is one of the largest parish churches in the
                    kingdom, and contains, besides many excellent monuments, the richly carved
                    sedilia and the twenty-eight oak seats used by the collegiate priests. The
                    parish has, since 1837, been divided into nine ecclesiastical districts, each
                    with a church. The grammar school was founded in 1549, and endowed with the
                    estates of the local Corpus Christi fraternity, then dissolved; the hall in
                    which the guild assembled still remains. Broadcloth and linen thread, introduced
                    by Dutch settlers, were at one time manufactured here; but brewing and
                    papermaking have long superseded these industries. Of the barges trading on the
                    Medway, about sixty belong to Maidstone wharfingers. The river is crossed by a
                    stone bridge of three arches, completed in 1879. A museum, with public library
                    attached, was opened in 1858. The endowed charities yield an annual income of
                    £3000. Since the beginning of the 17th century the Kent assizes have generally
                    been held at Maidstone. From Saxon times down to 1830 condemned malefactors were
                    executed, and all the great county meetings were held, on Penenden Heath, a
                    common situated about a mile north-east of the town, and recently enclosed by
                    the corporation. The area of the municipal borough is 4008 acres, of the
                    parliamentary borough 4576 acres. The population has steadily increased during
                    the present century; in 1801 it was 8027, in 1881 29,632.</p>
                <p>With general history Maidstone has been intimately associated. Wat Tyler broke
                    into the prison, liberated John Ball, the rebel preacher, and committed other
                    depredations. Several of the leading inhabitants joined Jack Cade’s rising. Sir
                    Thomas Wyatt, who resided at Allington Castle, now an ivy-clad ruin a mile and a
                    half north of the town, raised the standard of rebellion at Maidstone on 25th
                    January 1554. As a punishment for their complicity with Wyatt, the burgesses
                    were for the next five years deprived of their charter of incorporation. The
                    rising of the Kentish royalists in 1648 collapsed at Maidstone, where, on the
                    1st June, Fairfax, after five hours’ obstinate fighting, captured the town at
                    midnight. Anciently governed by a portreve, Maidstone was first incorporated by
                    Edward VI., and since the beginning of Elizabeth’s reign it has sent two
                    representatives to parliament. Andrew Broughton, one of its mayors, as clerk of
                    the court which tried Charles I., read the fatal sentence to the king.</p>
