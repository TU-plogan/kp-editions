                <p><label type="entry">MANES</label>. This term, which is clearly euphemistic,
                    meaning “goodies” or “good fellows,” was applied by the Romans to the spirits of
                    the departed. As in all nations of antiquity, and in many existing savage
                    tribes, these spirits were held by them in great awe and veneration, as being
                    powerful for good or for harm. The doctrine, whether imported from the Egyptian
                    theology or of Turanian origin through the Etruscan tomb-builders, is closely
                    allied to that of the Greek belief in the existence of the souls of heroes,
                    ancestors, and generally of the “mighty dead,” whom they called δαίμονες, but,
                    of course, in a sense widely different from our notion of <hi rend="italic"
                    >demons.</hi> Thus in Aeschylus the spirits of Agamemnon and of Darius are
                    invoked as δαίμονες, and in the <hi rend="italic">Suppliant Women</hi> (24) they
                    are appealed to as <hi rend="italic">βαρν-ημοι χθόνιοι,</hi> where the notion of
                    “heavily-punishing” seems conveyed by the compound epithet. Generally, the <hi
                    rend="italic">daemones</hi> were regarded as hostile, or at least dangerous, and
                    blood-offerings (εvαγurμoi) were made to them to propitiate their wrath, and to
                    induce them to send aid or material blessings from the realms below. The idea
                    appears to have been that the spirits ranged the earth, hungry and forlorn, and
                    seeking whom they might devour. Hence pestilences and sudden deaths were
                    attributed to them, and in this sense they came to be regarded as the enemies of
                    the living. Victims were given to them, that they might not themselves make
                    victims of whomsoever they pleased. Offerings of all kinds were placed in the
                    tomb or burnt on the pyre, and the rites of burial were, with the lamentations
                    of surviving friends, thought necessary for the repose of the ghost. Hesiod,
                    however, in a remarkable passage <hi rend="italic">(Op.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >et</hi><hi rend="italic">D.,</hi> 122), speaks of the δαίμονες in terms more
                    allied to our ideas of “guardian angels.” He says they were the souls or spirits
                    of the men who lived in the golden age, and that their office now is to <pb

                    and conduct of man. The meaning of the word <hi rend="italic">demon</hi> is very
                    obscure. Some connect it with <hi rend="italic">8ιF,</hi> the root of <hi
                    rend="italic">Bis, Byaus, Zeυ&lt;s,</hi><hi rend="italic">Juppiter,</hi>
                    &amp;c., others with δαiαv, “to allot,” “to distribute,” (Curtius, <hi
                    rend="italic">Gr. Etym.,</hi> i. 230), while others, with Plato <hi
                    rend="italic">(Cratylus,</hi> p. 398, B), have supposed that <hi rend="italic"
                    >8aημMv,</hi> “knowing,”is the original sense. In a general way, δαίμων meant a
                    man’s luck or fortune in life, and hence δυσδαiμωv and <hi rend="italic"
                    >ev8alμMv</hi> are common phrases for “unfortunate” and “prosperous.”</p>
                <p>The word <hi rend="italic">manes</hi> seems referable to an old adjective, of
                    which there were two forms, <hi rend="italic">manis</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >manus,</hi> “good.” From the former comes <hi rend="italic">immanis,</hi>
                    applied to things or persons of formidable size, power, dimensions, &lt;tc., and
                    so “huge,” “savage,” or in any sense “uncanny.” The morning is <hi rend="italic"
                    >mane,</hi> “the good or lucky time,” because there was an old proverb (Hesiod,
                    <hi rend="italic">Op.</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">D.,</hi>
                    578) that morning was the best time for work. It is generally used as an
                    ablative, <hi rend="italic">mane novo,</hi> &amp;c., yet Virgil has <hi
                    rend="italic">dτιm mane novum, (Georg,</hi> iii. 325). <hi rend="italic"
                    >Manus</hi> is found in the old Italian divinity <hi rend="italic"
                    >Genita</hi><hi rend="italic">Mana,</hi> the “good mother,” also called Mania
                    and Larunda, the reputed mother of the Lares or household gods. To this goddess
                    Pliny tells us <hi rend="italic">(N.</hi><hi rend="italic">II.</hi> xxix. 58)
                    the Romans offered in sacrifice a puppy-dog, <hi rend="italic">catulus.</hi> In
                    xxi. 11 he says that chaplets used to be offered to the manes, and in xxxiii. 2
                    he speaks of men digging mines to get wealth <hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">sede manium,</hi> in the depths where the spirits reside.</p>
                <p>There can be no doubt that food offerings were, according to a widely spread
                    superstition, offered to the manes, as to the Lar, to Hecate, to Trivia, and to
                    other infernal powers. Thus Virgil (who is fond of the use of the word) says in
                    <hi rend="italic">Aen.</hi> iii. 63, “aggeritur tumulo tellus; stant Manibus
                    arae.” On these altars, he adds, goblets of milk and the blood of victims were
                    offered, though he evidently has in view the Greek rite of appeasing the
                    daemons. Perhaps there were not such solemn propitiatory sacrifices made to the
                    manes as to the Greek δαίμονες. But all nations have reverenced the spirits of
                    their ancestors, and especially those nations which retain strongly patriarchal
                    traditions and the distinctions of caste.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">genius</hi> was a kind of attendant on the living, the
                    sharer of his fortunes, and perhaps to some extent regulating them, from birth
                    to death. To indulge one’s genius originally meant to please him with good
                    cheer, an idea that lay at the root of all primitive notions of sacrifice. Of
                    this notion there is no Greek equivalent. It seems more nearly allied to the
                    superstition of a “double” or “wraith,” a kind of <hi rend="italic">alter
                    ego</hi> who at once was, and was not, identical with the individual person.
                    (See Hor., <hi rend="italic">Epist.</hi> ii. 2, 187.)</p>
                <p>Between the <hi rend="italic">manes</hi> and the received idea of <hi
                    rend="italic">souls</hi> there was a pretty close analogy. When Virgil says <hi
                    rend="italic">(Aen.</hi> vi. 743), “quisque suos patimur manes,” he appears to
                    mean that the souls of all receive the reward of deeds done in life. There was,
                    of course, a corresponding idea that the <hi rend="italic">manes</hi> could be
                    conjured up, and could appear as ghosts. Thus Propertius <hi rend="italic"
                    >(El.,</hi> v. 7), commencing with the verse “Sunt aliquid manes, letum non
                    omnia finit,” describes how the ghost of his Cynthia appeared to him and
                    upbraided him for his faithlessness. See also Virg., <hi rend="italic">Aen.</hi>
                    iv. 490 and v. 99. Like the <hi rend="italic">8aigove&lt;s,</hi> they were also
                    supposed to have the power of sending dreams <hi rend="italic">(ibid.</hi> vi.
                    897).</p>
                <p>In sepulchral inscriptions, even on early Christian tombs, the dedication <hi
                    rend="italic">dis</hi><hi rend="italic">manibus</hi> is common, showing the
                    strong tendency to deify which prevailed with the Romans under the empire.</p>
