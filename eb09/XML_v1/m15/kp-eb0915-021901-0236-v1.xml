                <p>In the following article we shall give, in the first place, a sketch of the
                    leading phenomena of strongly magnetic bodies. We shall then describe a
                    provisional theory sufficient to render a general account of these phenomena,
                    and shall afterwards proceed to render this theory more precise, to develop it
                    to its necessary conclusions, and to compare these with experiment, indicating
                    where the theory is either incorrect or incomplete. Then we shall discuss the
                    paramagnetic and diamagnetic properties of all bodies, as expounded by Faraday;
                    an account will be given of the connexion between the magnetic and the other
                    physical properties of bodies; and, lastly, we shall endeavour to give some idea
                    of the different physical theories that have been proposed in order to give
                    something more than a mere shorthand record of the facts of observation.</p>

                <p>It appears, from what Lucretius says in the passage above quoted,<note

                    Greeks and Romans were aware, not only that the loadstone, or magnetic iron ore,
                    attracted iron, but also that it endued iron in contact with it with its own
                    peculiar property. Thus an iron ring will hang suspended by the attraction of a
                    loadstone, and from that ring another, and so on, up to a certain number,
                    depending on the power of the stone and the weight, &amp;c., of the rings. They
                    were also aware that the attraction was confined to iron, or at all events was
                    not indiscriminate, and that it was not destroyed by the intervention of other
                    bodies, such as brass, between the magnet and the iron. It appears, too, from
                    the passage—</p>
                <p>Fit quoque ut a lapide hoc ferri natura recedat</p>
                <p>Interdum, fugere atque sequi consueta vicissim, &amp;c.— that they had an idea
                    that, under certain circumstances, the attraction might be replaced by a
                    repulsion. If, however, we understand aright the latter part of Lucretius’s
                    somewhat obscure description of what seems to have been an actual experiment of
                    his own, this notion was in reality a hasty generalization, not justified by the
                    observed facts.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See
                    below, p. 225.</p></note> In any case there seems no warrant for assuming, as
                    some have done, that the ancients had any definite conception of magnetic
                    polarity.</p>
                <p>What they wanted in definite experimental knowledge they supplied by an abundant
                    use of the imagination.</p>
                <p>We are told, for instance, that the magnet attracts wood and flesh, which was
                    certainly beyond their powers of observation; that it is effective in the cure
                    of disease; that it affects the brain, causing melancholy; that it acts as a
                    love philtre; that it may be used in testing the chastity of a woman; that it
                    loses its power when rubbed with garlic, but recovers it when treated with
                    goat’s blood; that it will not attract iron in the presence of a diamond, and
                    much else that was eagerly copied by the wonder-loving writers of the Middle
                    Ages.</p>
                <p>The science of magnetism made no real progress till the invention of the
                    mariner’s compass. The early history of this instrument is very obscure.
                    According to some authorities it was invented in China, and found its way into
                    Europe probably through Arabian sources. The light thrown by recent researches
                    on the literature of the Chinese has apparently thrown doubt upon their claim to
                    this invention,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See
                    Möllendorff, <hi rend="italic">Z. D. Μ. G.,</hi> xxxv. 76.</p></note> although
                    the knowledge of the loadstone and its attractive property may have been older
                    among them than even among the Greeks. The first accounts of the compass in
                    Europe go back to the 12th century, and, although the instrument described is
                    very rough, it is not spoken of as a new invention. In its earliest form it
                    seems to have consisted simply of an iron needle which was touched with the
                    loadstone and placed upon a pivot, or floated on water, so that it could turn
                    more or less freely. It was found that such a needle came to rest in a position
                    pointing approximately north and south (some accounts say east and west, in
                    which case there must have been a cross piece on the needle to indicate what was
                    probably the important direction for the mariner). As these compasses were made
                    of iron (steel was not used till much later), and were probably ill-pivoted,
                    they must have been very inaccurate; and the difficulty of using them must have
                    been much increased by the want of a card, which was a later addition made
                    apparently by the Dutch.</p>
                <p>It is unnecessary to enter into more detail here respecting the early history of
                    the compass, as the matter has been very fully treated in the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Compass.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>It may be mentioned that the statement that Peter Adsigβr,
                    in a letter written in 1296, mentions the magnetic declination, appears to be a
                    mistake, arising from the mistranscription of a title. See Wenckebach, quoted by
                    Lamont, <hi rend="italic">Handbuch des Magnetismus,</hi> p. 449. The passage
                    from Are Frode, quoted by Hansteen, and alluded to in last edition of this
                    encyclopaedia, appears also to be of doubtful antiquity. See Poggendorff, <hi
                    rend="italic">Geschichte der Physik,</hi> p. 99.</p></note> We proceed therefore
                    to show the bearing of the invention upon the science of magnetism. It will at
                    once be seen that it involves two scientific discoveries of capital importance
                    :— first, that the loadstone can transmit to iron with which it comes in contact
                    a permanent property like its own; and, secondly, that a loadstone or magnet if
                    suspended freely will turn so that a certain direction in it assumes a fixed
                    position relative to the geographical meridian, a certain part of the magnet
                    turning always towards the north, and the part opposite towards the south. These
                    opposite parts of the magnet are called its “poles.”</p>
                <p>To fix our ideas we shall describe a process by which we might definitely
                    determine this direction in the magnet. Following· the example of Gilbert, let
                    us consider a spherical magnet. Our reason for dealing with this form in the
                    first instance is to make it perfectly clear that the phenomena depend
                    essentially on something apart from the form of the body. We shall suppose that
                    the magnet is homogeneous as to its mass, so that its centre of gravity <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n237/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0237-0220"/> coincides with its centre of figure. Suspend this
                    spherical magnet by a fine thread of untwisted silk, attached to any point of
                    its surface, say P. After the magnet has come to rest, mark the vertical plane
                    through the centre which falls in the geographical meridian; this may be done by
                    tracing a great circle on the surface of the magnet. Next find the point P' in
                    which the vertical through P cuts the surface again, and suspend the magnet by
                    P', again marking the plane which falls in the meridian. Now, find the plane
                    which bisects the acute angle between the two former planes, mark it by a great
                    circle, and call it the axial plane of P. If we thus find the axial planes of
                    any number of points, we shall find that they all intersect in one common line
                    passing through the centre of the sphere. We may call this line the “axis” of
                    the magnet. Let us mark the points where it cuts the surface; we may call these
                    the “poles” of the magnet. We shall then observe that, however we suspend it,
                    the magnet will always come to rest so that the vertical plane through the axis
                    makes a definite angle with the meridian. This angle (δ) is called the
                    “declination” (also, by sailors, the “variation”.); it varies from place to
                    place, and from time to time, but very slowly, so that throughout a limited area
                    of the earth’s surface, and for a limited time, it may be regarded as
                    constant.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For the early
                    observations on the declination the reader is referred to the treatment of the
                    subject of terrestrial magnetism in the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Meteorology.</hi> At the present time the declination at Greenwich is a little
                    over 18°; at Edinburgh it would be about 4° more.</p></note></p>
                <p>One end of the axis always turns northwards, and the other always southwards; we
                    shall call the former the “north” and the latter the “south pole,” although, for
                    reasons to be afterwards explained, it would be more appropriate to invert the
                    order of these names. Henceforth the vertical plane in which the axis of the
                    magnet comes to rest will be called the magnetic meridian, and the two
                    horizontal directions in this plane magnetic north and magnetic south
                    respectively.</p>
                <p>It must be carefully noticed that there is a certain amount of arbitrariness in
                    our definition of the axis and poles of a magnet. In reality it is only the
                    direction of the axis that is fixed in the body, and not its absolute position.
                    This will be made plain if we repeat all our experiments with the spherical
                    magnet after fastening to it a piece of wax or other non-magnetic body, so as to
                    leave its magnetic properties unchanged, but to throw its centre of gravity out
                    of the centre of figure. Everything will fall out as before, only the axial
                    planes of the different points of suspension will now meet in a line, parallel,
                    it is true, to the axis determined before, but passing through the new centre of
                    gravity. In point of fact, therefore, we might choose any point in the body,
                    draw a line through it iu the proper direction, and call this the axis.
                    Hereafter we shall, unless the contrary is stated, draw the axis through the
                    centre of gravity of the body, or through its centre of figure if it has one;
                    and we define the poles, for the present, as the points in which the axis cuts
                    the surface of the magnet, supposing, as will be generally the case, that the
                    line cuts the surface iu two points and no more.</p>
                <p>Having now obtained a definite idea of the axis of a magnet, and seen that it
                    has, in the first instance at least, nothing to do with the external form of the
                    body, let us proceed to make an artificial magnet of the particular kind usually
                    called a “magnetic needle,” and briefly examine its properties. Take a tolerably
                    thin flat piece of pretty hard-tempered steel, of the elongated symmetrical form
                    NS shown in fig. 1. We suppose it, in the first place, in an unmagnetic
                    condition. Let it be pierced by a well-turned axis <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi>
                    passing accurately through its centre of gravity, and perpendicular to its
                    plane, so that, when the axis is placed on two horizontal knife edges, the
                    needle will rest in any position indifferently. Further, let four very small
                    hooks, c, <hi rend="italic">d, e,f,</hi> be attached, two (c, <hi rend="italic"
                    >d)</hi> to the ends of the axis, and other two (e,∕) to the edges of the needle
                    in a line perpendicular to NS. Now rub the half of the needle towards N with the
                    south pole of the spherical magnet whose properties we have just discussed,
                    beginning the stroke at the middle and ending it at the point of the needle, and
                    for symmetry’s sake let us do the same to the other side of the needle, and then
                    repeat this process with the north pole of the sphere on the other half towards
                    S. Let us examine the properties of the needle thus “magnetized.” If we suspend
                    it first by the hook <hi rend="italic">c</hi> and then by the hook <hi
                    rend="italic">d,</hi> we shall find that in both cases the line joining NS<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Or the vertical plane through
                    it, should it happen to be not quite horizontal.</p></note> makes very nearly
                    the same angle with the geographical meridian. Hence the magnetic axis must lie
                    in a plane through NS perpendicular to the plane of the needle. A similar
                    experiment with the two hooks <hi rend="italic">e, f</hi> will show that the
                    magnetic axis lies approximately in the plane of the strip, which we may suppose
                    for the present to be infinitely thin. Hence the magnetic axis may be taken to
                    be coincident with the line NS joining the points of the needle. This
                    coincidence is, however, in general only approximate, and in delicate
                    measurements corrections have to be made on that account, of which more
                    hereafter. If we now mount our magnetized needle on a piece of cork or two
                    straws, and float it in a basin of water, or replace its axle by a small cap and
                    set it on a pivot, we have the mariner’s compass in its early form. We shall
                    call it a magnetic needle, to distinguish it from the more elaborate compass of
                    the present day. A favourite way of showing the directive property of a magnet,
                    described by Gilbert, is to magnetize a sewingneedle, and lay it very gently, by
                    means of a fork of wire, on the surface of water; it will float and turn until
                    it takes up its position in the magnetic meridian.</p>
                <p>A needle mounted in this way, so as to have great freedom to move in a horizontal
                    plane, is of great use in magnetic experiments. Gilbert calls it a “versorium.”
                    When very delicate applications are in view, the point of the pivot on which it
                    is mounted must be very hard (say of hard tempered steel or iridium), and the
                    cap should be fitted with an agate or other hard stone having a polished cavity
                    of the form of a blunted cone to receive the pivot. A still better arrangement,
                    also used by Gilbert, is to suspend a short and very light piece of steel wire—a
                    fine sewing needle may be used— by means of a single fibre of silk. The most
                    delicate arrangement of all is to use one of Sir W. Thomson’s light galvanometer
                    mirrors with the magnets attached, and follow its movements by means of the lamp
                    and scale as usual. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Galvanometer.</hi></p>
                <p>Such, with as much of modem accuracy imported into them as was necessary for
                    clearness of exposition, were the facts of magnetism as known up to the
                    beginning of the 16th century.</p>
                <p>Another experiment with our magnetized needle will enable us to describe the next
                    important magnetic dis covery. In its unmagnetized condition the needle rested
                    indifferently in any position when its axis was placed on <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n238/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0238-0221"/> two horizontal knife edges. In the magnetized
                    state this is no longer the case. The axis of the needle now takes up a fixed
                    position, with its north end pointing downwards (fig. 2), and if disturbed will
                    oscillate about that position, and finally settle into it again. The angle which
                    the axis NS makes with the horizon is least when the plane of rotation of the
                    needle is in the magnetic meridian: the angle (t) in this case is called the
                    “dip,” or (by Continental writers) the “inclination.” It is greatest, viz., 90°,
                    when the plane of rotation of the needle is vertical and perpendicular to the
                    magnetic meridian. At Greenwich the dip is about 67° 30' at the present time. If
                    we place the needle with its plane of rotation perpendicular to the line of dip,
                    the equilibrium will be indifferent, as it was in all positions before
                    magnetization; but there is no other position of the magnetized needle for which
                    this is true.</p>
                <p>The remarks which we made as to variation in space and time of the declination
                    apply also to the dip. The variation from place to place differs, however, in
                    nature from that of the declination. Along a line running in the neighbourhood
                    of the geographical equator, partly north and partly south of it, the dip is
                    zero. North of this line, which is called the magnetic equator, the north end of
                    the needle dips below the horizon; and the angle of dip increases as we go
                    northwards, until, at a point in the Hudson’s Bay Territory, the needle dips
                    with its north pole vertically downwards. South of the magnetic equator the
                    south end dips below the horizon; and there is again a point in the southern
                    hemisphere where the south end dips vertically downwards. These points are
                    called the “magnetic poles” of the earth. For further details on this subject we
                    refer the reader to the discussion of terrestrial magnetism in the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Meteorology.</hi></p>
                <p>It was in the accurate observation of the declination and dip of the magnetic
                    needle that the science of magnetism arose. The dip appears to have been first
                    observed by Georg Hartmann, vicar of the church of St Sebaldus at Nuremberg
                    (1489-1564), who seems to have been in advance of his age in magnetical matters.
                    In a letter<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Brought to
                    light by Moser. See Dove’s <hi rend="italic">Repertorium der Physik,</hi> ii.,
                    1838. It does not appear that Hartmann’s letter was ever before published. Moser
                    is therefore scarcely justified in attacking Norman’s priority in this matter,
                    still less in attempting to deny him the credit of first observing the dip by a
                    sound method. Had he read the <hi rend="italic">Newe Attractive</hi> he could
                    scarcely have fallen into such an error; for in respect of clearness and
                    scientific precision Hartmann’s letter, interesting as it is, cannot for a
                    moment be compared with Norman’s little work.</p></note> to Duke Albrecht of
                    Prussia, dated 4th March 1544, he writes :—</p>
                <p>“Besides, I find this also in the magnet, that it not only turns from the north
                    and deflects to the east about 9° more or less, as I have reported, but it
                    points downwards. This may be proved as follows. I make a needle, a finger long,
                    which stands horizontally on a pointed pivot, so that it nowhere inclines
                    towards the earth, but stands horizontal on both sides. But as soon as I stroke
                    one of the ends (with the loadstone), it matters not which end it be, then the
                    needle no longer stands horizontal, but points downwards <hi rend="italic"
                    >(fällt unter sich)</hi> sonie 9° more or less. The reason why this happens was
                    I not able to indicate to his Royal Majesty.”</p>
                <p>From this it will be seen that Hartmann had unquestionably observed the tendency
                    of the magnetized needle to dip. His method of observing is of course unsuited
                    for <hi rend="italic">measurement,</hi> and it is not surprising that he got a
                    result of 9° instead of somewhere about 70°.</p>
                <p>In 1576 the dip was independently discovered by Robert Norman, a skilful seaman
                    and an ingenious artificer, according to Gilbert. He was in the habit of making
                    compass needles, and carefully balancing them so as to play Horizontally on
                    their pivots before magnetization. He found that, after they were magnetized,
                    they constantly dipped with the north end downwards, so that a counterpoise had
                    to be added to bring them back to the horizon. This led him to construct a
                    special instrument, the prototype of the modern dipping needle, to show this new
                    phenomenon. With this instrument he made the first accurate measurement of the
                    dip, and found it to be 71° 50' at London.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    able supplement to Norman’s work) were admirable examples, must have done much
                    for the introduction of precise ideas into magnetism. But their fame was

                    rend="italic">Mutual Action of Like and Unlike Poles.—</hi> If we take a magnet
                    whose poles N', S' have been determined and marked as above explained, and bring
                    its north pole N' near the north pole N of a magnetic needle, N will move in a
                    direction indicating repulsion between N and N'. The same result will follow if
                    the south pole S' of the magnet be brought near the south pole S of the needle.
                    But if S' be brought near N, or N' near S, attraction will be indicated. Hence
                    the following fundamental law of the action between two magnets :— <hi
                    rend="italic">Like poles repel each other; unlike poles attract each other.</hi>
                    It would appear, therefore, that the whole action of one magnet upon another is
                    of a somewhat complicated character, even if we take the simplest view of it
                    that the experimental facts will allow, viz., that the action may be represented
                    by forces acting between the two pairs of points in each magnet which we have
                    defined as north and south poles. On this assumption, the action of N'S' upon NS
                    would consist of the four forces represented in fig. 3, for all these must exist
                    in accordance with the law just established. Whether this is a sufficient <pb

                    the exact law of the forces ought to be, we are not yet in a position to decide.
                    One thing, however, is clear, that the action between two poles must diminish
                    when the distance between them increases; otherwise we should not have been able
                    to make the action of N or S upon N' prevail, by bringing the one or the other
                    nearer.</p>
                <p>It was perhaps the complexity of this analysis (along with the fact that the
                    action of the magnet upon soft iron, which was the earliest discovered magnetic
                    phenomenon, is not a pure case of this action, but involves also another
                    phenomenon, viz., magnetic induction) that prevented for so long the discovery
                    of the elementary law we are now discussing. At all events, it seems to have
                    been a new discovery in the 16th century, if we may judge from a passage in the
                    letter of Hartmann above alluded to. He was certainly aware of the existence of
                    magnetic repulsion in some form or other. It is somewhat difficult to gather
                    from his description what it was exactly that he observed, and he nowhere states
                    the law fully and explicitly. In Norman’s <hi rend="italic">Newe

                    i.</p></note> we find it clearly stated, and demonstrated by means of a needle

                    fact as his discovery. If, therefore, Hartmann was not the actual discoverer, we
                    may at least conclude that the law became familiar to magnetic philosophers
                    during the thirty years that separated him from Norman.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Magnetic Field.</hi> —We next introduce a method of
                    conceiving and describing magnetic actions which was invented and much used by
                    Faraday. Since a magnet acts upon a magnetic needle placed anywhere in the
                    surrounding space,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Gilbert uses the phrase <hi rend="italic">orbis virtutis</hi> in a somewhat
                    similar sense.</p></note> we call that space the magnetic field of the magι∣et
                    Neglecting the earth’s magnetism, we may map out this field as follows. Conceive
                    any plane drawn through the axis of the magnet, and place it so that this plane
                    shall be horizontal. Then at any point in this plane place a very small magnetic
                    needle, and note the direction which its axis assumes under the action of the
                    magnet; then proceed to move the centre of the needle in the direction in which
                    its north pole points, and continue the motion so that at each point the centre
                    is following the direction indicated by the north pole. The line thus traced
                    will at last cut the surface of the magnet at some point lying towards its south
                    pole; and if we continue the line backwards, by following the direction
                    continually indicated by the south pole of the needle, it will cut the surface
                    of the magnet at some point lying towards the north pole. Such a line is called
                    a line of magnetic force; and, since one such line can be drawn through every
                    point of the plane, and any number of planes can be taken through the axis of
                    the magnet, we can conceive the whole magnetic field filled with such lines.
                    Fig. 4, taken from Faraday, gives an idea of the distribution of the lines of
                    force in the field of a bar magnet; fig. 5 represents the lines in the field due
                    to two neighbouring like poles.</p>
                <p>These diagrams were not obtained by the method we have just described, but by a
                    much simpler process which we shall describe by and by. Their use, so far as we
                    have gone, is to tell us how a small needle, free to move about its centre in
                    any direction, will place itself at any part of the field, viz., it will place
                    its axis along the tangent to the line of force which passes through its centre,
                    its north pole pointing in that direction which ultimately leads to the south
                    pole of the magnet producing the field.</p>
                <p>Suppose we apply these ideas to a spherical magnet (a terella, or earthkin, as
                    Gilbert calls it). The lines of force in any plane through its axis would be
                    found to run something like the curves in fig. 6. If, therefore, we carried a
                    small needle (suspended from a silk fibre so as to be perfectly free to move in
                    all directions) round the magnet in a meridian plane, its axis would constantly
                    remain in the meridian plane, its north pole always point towards the south pole
                    of the spherical magnet, but dip more and more below the tangent plane to the
                    sphere as the centre recedes from the equator, and end by pointing straight
                    towards the south pole when the centre reaches the magnetic axis (see fig.
                    6).</p>
                <p>When we reflect that in all. our experiments the properties of magnets, whether
                    native, such as the loadstone, or artificial, such as the needles magnetized by
                    rubbing with the loadstone, have proved alike, and that every <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n240/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0240-0223"/> purely magnetic action on a magnet has its source
                    in some other magnetic body, we are naturally led to the conclusion that the
                    reason why at every point of the earth’s surface the axis of a freely suspended
                    magnet assumes a definite position is simply that the earth itself is a great
                    magnet, and that in observing the declination and dip we are simply exploring
                    the magnetic field of the earth. It is true that, according to the experiment
                    above described, the declination would every where be zero, and the magnetic
                    equator would coincide with the geographical, but that arises merely because we
                    assumed our earthkin, for simplicity of explanation, to be symmetrically
                    magnetized, so that its lines of force ran in planes passing through its axis.
                    It remains to be discussed whether the most general assumption, viz., that the
                    earth is a magnetic body, will not account for the facts of terrestrial
                    magnetism. The answer to this question has been given, as we shall see, by
                    Gauss.</p>
                <p>This idea, whose simplicity is the truest measure of its greatness, is due to
                    Gilbert, and was by him made the foundation of his work on magnetism. The
                    boldness of his theory will be appreciated when we remind the reader that in his
                    day the dip was but newly discovered, and had been measured only at London, so
                    that Gilbert’s very full and clear exposition of this phenomenon, which we have
                    given above, was in fact a scientific prediction, which was not fully verified
                    till long afterwards.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>The first verification was by Hudson, who, in 1608, found the dip in 75° 22'
                    N. lat. to be 89° 3.0'. Gilbert found 72° at London in 1600. The place of
                    vertical dip in the northern hemisphere was first reached by Sir James Ross in
                    1831. It was found about 70° 5' 17" N. lat. and 9645' 48" W. long.</p></note>
                    Before Gilbert a variety of wild conjectures had been made as to the cause of
                    the directive property of the magnet.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See Gilbert, <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Magnete,</hi> lib. i. cap. i.</p></note> Many, like Columbus, Cardan, and
                    Paracelsus, believed that the magnet was attracted by a point in the heavens,
                    possibly some magnetic star. Others supposed that the attracting point was
                    situated in the earth; Fracastorius imagined hyperborean mountains of loadstone
                    situated near but not quite at the north pole; and to this theory others
                    contributed the detail that the magnetism of these mountains was so powerful
                    that ships in these regions have to be built with wooden nails instead of iron
                    ones, which would be instantly drawn out by the magnetic attraction.</p>
                <p>It is clear that, if we call that magnetic pole of the earth which lies in the
                    northern hemisphere its north pole, we ought, in accordance with our fundamental
                    law of magnetic action, to call the northseeking pole of an ordinary magnet a
                    <hi rend="italic">south</hi> pole. When it is necessary to speak of magnets from
                    this point of view, the difficulty is got over by calling the north-seeking pole
                    the austral pole, and the south-seeking pole the boreal pole. In reality the
                    danger of confusion is more imaginary than real. The reader should be warned,
                    however, that in some French works the ordinary nomenclature is reversed, and
                    that Faraday uses “marked” and “unmarked,” and Airy “red” and “blue,” in the
                    sense in which north and south are commonly used.</p>

                    <hi rend="italic">Newe Attractive</hi> (chapters v. and vi.) discusses very
                    acutely the question whether there is any force of translation exerted upon a
                    magnet. He advances three conclusive experiments to prove the negative. First,
                    he weighed several small pieces of steel in a delicate gold balance, and then
                    magnetized them, but could not detect the slightest alteration in their weight,
                    “though every one of them had received vertue sufficient to lift up his fellow.”
                    Secondly, he pushed a steel wire through a spherical piece of cork, and
                    carefully pared the latter so that the whole sank to a certain depth in a vessel
                    of water and remained there, taking up any position about the centre
                    indifferently. After the wire was magnetized very carefully, without disturbing
                    its position in the cork, it sank to the same depth as before, neither more nor
                    less, the only difference being that now the wire set itself persistently in a
                    definite fixed direction parallel to the magnetic meridian, the north end
                    dipping about 71° or 72° below the horizon. Thirdly, he arranged a magnetized
                    needle on a cork so as to float on the surface of water, and found that,
                    although it set in the magnetic meridian, there was not the slightest tendency
                    to translation in any direction.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Hartmann (see his letter above cited) was in error on this
                    subject. He describes a somewhat similar experiment, and distinctly states that
                    the needle has a motion of translation. “Schwimmt mit dem Ort welcher ist

                    put this result into a positive form, and his “point respective,” as he calls
                    it, is not a very clear explanation of the earth’s action. What he wanted was
                    the modern idea of a “couple,” 7.e., a pair of equal but oppositely directed
                    parallel forces acting on the two ends of the needle; but such an idea was not
                    conceived in Norman’s day. Gilbert adopts Norman’s result in this matter, adding
                    nothing essential, reproducing even Norman’s diagram of the spherical cork with
                    the wire through it. It is clear therefore that Gilbert had a forerunner in the
                    practice, as Bacon had in the theory, of inductive science; for Norman says,
                    speaking of the mass of fables that had passed for truth in geography,
                    hydrography, and navigation before his time, “I wish experience to bee the
                    leader of Writers in those Artes, and reason their rule in setting it downe,
                    that the followers bee not Jed by them into errors, as oftentimes have beene

                    the question as to how we are to represent the action of a magnet ιipon other

                    there has always been a tendency in the more superficial treatises on the

                    obtain more than one perfectly general way of representing the action of a
                    magnet at external points, whereas there must be one and only one cause of this
                    action. A very old experiment<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Cf.</hi> Gilbert, <hi rend="italic">De
                    Magnete,</hi> lib. i. cap. v.</p></note> at once throws considerable light on
                    this point. If we break a bar magnet into two pieces, it will be found that each
                    of these is itself a magnet, its axis being in much the same direction as that
                    of the original magnet, and its poles in corresponding positions, see fig. 7.
                    The same holds if we break the bar into any number of pieces; and, quite
                    generally, if we remove any piece, however small, from a magnet, this piece will
                    be found to be magnetic, the direction of its axis usually bearing a distinct
                    and easily recognizable relation to the direction of the axis of the whole
                    magnet. We are therefore driven to the conclusion that the magnetic quality of a
                    body is related to its ultimate structure, and not simply to its mass as a
                    whole, or to its surface alone; and this conclusion is not to be invalidated by
                    the fact that we can in general, as will afterwards appear, represent the action
                    of the magnet at external points by means of a proper distribution of centres of
                    attractive and repulsive forces upon its surface merely.</p>

                    which they are placed, we shall henceforth call “permanent magnets.” The law of
                    the action of one permanent magnet upon another, as we have seen, is that like
                    poles repel and unlike poles attract each other. The action of a permanent
                    magnet on pieces of soft iron is, at first sight, different, for either pole
                    attracts them alike.</p>
                <p>To fix our ideas let us take a small thin bar of soft iron or of steel, and test
                    it with a delicate magnetic needle. It will usually be found, more particularly
                    if a steel bar is taken, that one end of the bar will <hi rend="italic"
                    >repel</hi> one or other of the poles of the needle. This is a sure sign of
                    permanent magnetism. If, however, we heat the bar to whiteness and allow it to
                    cool in a position perpendicular to the earth’s magnetic force, all permanent
                    magnetism will be found to have disappeared. If we now place the bar in a
                    horizontal plane (fig. 8) with its axis perpendicular to the axis of the needle,
                    and one of its ends A, B near either pole of the needle, that pole will be
                    attracted, no matter whether it be the north pole or the south pole of the
                    needle, or which end of the bar be used.</p>
                <p>Care must be taken in this experiment to avoid using a too strongly magnetized
                    needle, and to keep the needle from touching the bar, otherwise the bar may
                    receive traces of permanent magnetism which will disturb the result. It is very
                    easy, by repeating the above experiment with an unmagnetized needle, to show
                    that the power that the bar acquires of attracting the poles of the needle is
                    temporary and depends on the presence of a magnetized body.</p>
                <p>Keeping to our principle that a magnetic cause is to be sought for every magnetic
                    action, we are led to explain the above experiment by saying that in the
                    magnetic field a bar of soft iron or of unmagnetized steel becomes magnetic in
                    such a way that its north pole points as nearly as may be in the positive
                    direction of the lines of force passing in its neighbourhood (or, in other
                    words, in the direction, as nearly as may be, in which a magnetic needle would
                    point if placed in its neighbourhood). A body which becomes magnetic iu this way
                    by the magnetic action of another body is said to be “magnetized” by
                    “induction.” We shall suppose, in the meantime, that it loses all the magnetism
                    thus acquired when the inducing action is withdrawn; although this is not
                    necessarily,· and in fact not generally, the case, as we shall see by and by.
                    The reason why soft iron is attracted by a permanent magnet is therefore now
                    said to be that the iron becomes magnetic by induction, and is then acted upon
                    by the magnet like any other magnet similarly placed. The accuracy of this
                    analysis of the phenomenon may be confirmed by many simple but striking
                    experiments, such as the following.</p>
                <p>In the experiment above described, instead of placing the non-magnetic bar in a
                    horizontal plane, place it in the plane of the magnetic meridian with its axis
                    in the direction of the earth’s force <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> parallel to
                    the line of dip). The lower end of the bar will then be found to repel and the
                    upper end to attract the north pole of the needle (figs. 9, 10). This is at once
                    explained on the above hypothesis; for the bar will be magnetized inductively by
                    the earth’s force, so that its lower end becomes a north pole, and its upper end
                    a south pole.</p>
                <p>Let NS (fig. 11) be a bar magnet placed horizontally so that its axis produced
                    passes through O, the centre of suspension of the needle <hi rend="italic"
                    >sn,</hi> then the needle will be deflected in the direction of the arrow. If
                    now we place between S and O a small sphere of soft iron, this deflexion will be
                    increased, the reason being that the sphere is magnetized by induction, having a
                    south pole towards O and a north pole towards S, and the action of these is
                    added to that of NS.</p>
                <p>Let NS (fig. 12) be a magnet placed in the magnetic meridian, <hi rend="italic"
                    >ris'</hi> a small magnetic needle in the same horizontal plane, with its centre
                    in the line bisecting NS at right angles. When acted on by NS alone, <hi
                    rend="italic">n's'</hi> will place itself parallel to NS, with its north pole
                    pointing in the direction NS</p>
                <p>Let the dotted line represent a line of force. If we move a small piece of soft
                    iron <hi rend="italic">ns</hi> along this line in the direction from N towards
                    S, it will first deflect the needle as <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n242/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0242-0225"/> in fig. 13, and finally as in fig. 14, and in
                    each position reversing it end for end will not alter the effect. All this is at
                    once explained by the above hypothesis.</p>
                <p>A variation of the last experiment may be made thus. Place a magnet vertically,
                    in the neighbourhood of a magnetic needle; by moving it up and down a position
                    will be found in which the action of the magnet on the needle is wholly
                    vertical, so that the needle is not deflected from the magnetic meridian. Now
                    take a small piece of soft iron and move it along a line of force passing near
                    the needle, proceeding from the north to the south pole of the vertical magnet.
                    It will then be found, in accordance with our hypothesis, that the north pole of
                    the needle is first repelled, and finally attracted by the soft iron.</p>
                <p>If we hang two short pieces of iron wire alongside of each other by parallel
                    threads, they will be found to repel one another, and to hang separated by a
                    considerable interval when a magnet is brought under them (see figs. 15 and 16).
                    This experiment is due to Gilbert, who rightly explains it by saying that the
                    two ends nearer the magnetic pole S become like poles of opposite kind to S,
                    while the two farther ends are like poles of the same kind as S. The experiment
                    may be varied by placing some little distance below the pole of a magnet S a
                    piece of mica or thin card board M, and placing below that a short piece of soft
                    iron wire; it will remain adhering to the mica, and so long as it is alone will
                    hang more or less nearly vertical, but when another is placed alongside of it
                    the two will diverge as in fig. 17.</p>
                <p>One of the most interesting examples of magnetic induction is furnished by the
                    action of a magnet on iron filings. If we plunge a magnet into a quantity of
                    iron filings and then remove it, we find it thickly fringed around the poles,
                    where the filings adhere to the magnet and to one another so as to form short
                    bushy filaments: the thickness of the fringe diminishes very rapidly towards the
                    middle of the magnet, where very few adhere at all. These filaments are composed
                    of magnetized particles of iron adhering by their unlike poles.</p>
                <p>If we place a small bar magnet under a piece of moderately rough drawing paper,
                    strewn as uniformly as possible with fine iron filings, and then tap the paper
                    very gently so as to relieve the friction, and allow each filing to follow tho
                    magnetic action, then the filings will be seen to arrange themselves in a series
                    of lines, passing, roughly speaking, from pole to pole, as in fig. 4 (p. 222).
                    The explanation of this phenomenon is simply that each filing becomes magnetized
                    by induction, and, if it were quite free to move about its centre, it would not
                    be in equilibrium until it set its longest dimension along the line of force
                    through its centre. The roughness of the paper effectually prevents translation,
                    but does not hinder rotation, especially when the friction is relieved by
                    tapping; hence every filing does actually set as if it were a little magnetic
                    needle, subject of course to some slight disturbance from the neighbouring
                    filings. The whole therefore assumes a grained structure, and the graining runs
                    in the direction of the lines of force. We have thus an extremely convenient way
                    of representing these lines to the eye, which lends itself in a variety of ways
                    to the illustration of magnetic phenomena. In fig. 5 are shown the lines formed
                    in the field near two like magnetic poles. These magnetic figures may be fixed
                    in a great variety of ways, and projected on a screen so as to be visible to a
                    large audience, but it is scarcely necessary to dwell here upon details of this
                    kind.</p>
                <p>These magnetic curves seem to have fixed the attention of natural philosophers at
                    a very early period. They were originally called the magnetic currents, from an
                    idea that they represented the stream lines of magnetic matter, which explained
                    the magnetic action according to the theory then in vogue. La Hire mentions
                    them, <hi rend="italic">Mem. de ΓAcad,</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi>
                    1717. Bazin gives an elaborate account of them in his <hi rend="italic"

                    djaprès</hi><hi rend="italic">Hαture,</hi> Strasburg, 1753. Musschenbroek seems
                    to have been the first to give the correct explanation depending on magnetic
                    induction, <hi rend="italic">Diss, de</hi><hi rend="italic">Magnete,</hi>
                    1729.</p>
                <p>If the filings be laid very thickly on the paper, and one pole of the magnet be
                    brought under them at a short distance off, they will arrange themselves in a
                    pattern, and at the same time bristle up so as to stand more or less erect,
                    according as they are nearer or farther from the magnet. They have thus the
                    appearance of being <hi rend="italic">repelled</hi> from the magnet. It was, in
                    all probability, this phenomenon that was observed by Lucretius when he says
                    (vi. 1042):—</p>
                <p>“Exultare etiam Samothracia ferrea vidi, Ac ramenta simul ferri furere intus
                    alienis In scaphiis, lapis hic Magnes cum subditus esset.”</p>
                <p>His conclusion, therefore, that iron sometimes flies and sometimes follows the
                    magnet, was scarcely justified by his experimental facts, and it is a mistake to
                    suppose, as some have done, that he was aware of the polarity of <hi

                    magnet. The most probable explanation<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    latter as shown in fig. 19; that is, in both cases, owing to the action of
                    gravity, they are more acutely inclined to the card than the lines of force
                    (represented by dotted lines in the figure). Consequently, when the filing
                    springs up into the air, and is thus free to follow the magnetic couple, it
                    turns more into the direction of the line of force; the effect of this is to
                    carry its lower end each time a little farther from the axis of the magnet in
                    the one case, and a little nearer to it in the other.</p>
                <p>By far the most important case of magnetic induction is the electromagnet.
                    Whenever an electric current flows in a closed circuit, the surrounding space
                    becomes a field of magnetic force, and any piece of iron in it will be
                    inductively magnetized. Such an arrangement of an electric circuit and iron is
                    called an electromagnet. The variety of form and of application of such
                    instruments in modern science is endless. A few of the more important
                    modifications will be considered below.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Co-existence of Induced and Permanent Magnetism.—</hi> The fact
                    that a body is already a permanent magnet does not prevent its being susceptible
                    to magnetic induction. If we take any piece of iron at random, the chances are
                    that one end or other of it will repel the north pole of a magnetic needle,—in
                    other words, it will be to some extent permanently magnetic; but if we bring it
                    slowly nearer and nearer to the pole of the needle, provided its magnetism be
                    not <hi rend="italic">too</hi> strong, it will by and by attract the pole which
                    it at first repelled. Again, if we take two steel magnets, which may be as
                    powerful as we please, provided at all events that they are unequally powerful,
                    and bring two <hi rend="italic">like</hi> poles together, these poles will at
                    first repel each other in accordance with the fundamental law of permanent
                    magnets; but, when the distance is less than a certain amount, the repulsion
                    passes into an attraction, and when the poles are in contact this attraction may
                    be very considerable. These phenomena are at once explained by the law of
                    induction. The induced or temporary magnetism is superposed on the permanent
                    magnetism, and, when the poles are near enough, the opposite magnetism induced
                    by the pole attracts it more than the permanent like magnetism repels it; and
                    this happens even with steel, whose susceptibility for magnetic induction is
                    considerably less than that of iron. This phenomenon was observed pretty early
                    in the history of magnetism, but was not fully explained until the idea of
                    magnetic induction was fully developed. Michell, in his <hi rend="italic"

                    type="authorial"><p>Cambridge, 1750.</p></note> gives a tolerably clear account
                    of it. Musschenbroek mentions it,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    attracts iron more than it does another magnet, but offers no explanation of
                    either fact. The latter result, so far as it is true, can of course be explained
                    by the smaller susceptibility of steel, particularly of hard steel, to magnetic
                    induction, which is the main factor in attraction at small distances.
                    Poggendorff<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Pοgg. Ann.,</hi> xlv. p. 375, 1838.</p></note> and others have
                    experimented on the subject in later times. The reader should notice the close
                    analogy between these phenomena and the repulsion and attraction at different
                    distances between two similarly electrified conductors. See article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Electricity,</hi> vol. viii. p. 33.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Induction of Permanent Magnetism.—</hi> The case above
                    supposed, in which the induced magnetism is wholly temporary, although it can be
                    easily realized with small magnetizing forces, is not the general one, but in
                    fact the exception. Usually a certain proportion of the magnetism remains after
                    the inducing farce is removed. This happens even with the softest iron, when the
                    inducing force is very great. Just as bodies differ very much in their
                    susceptibility for induced magnetism, so they differ greatly in their power of
                    retaining this magnetism when the inducing force ceases, or, as the phrase is,
                    in “coercive force.” Thus, while the inductive susceptibility of steel is less
                    than that of iron, it retains much more of the magnetism imparted to it, and is
                    therefore said to have much greater coercive force; and the coercive force is
                    greater the harder the steel is tempered.</p>
                <p>It is obvious, therefore, that the principle of “induction,” along with the idea
                    of “retaining power” or “coerciveforce,” furnishes us with the key to the
                    explanation of the communication of permanent magnetism, whether by means of
                    natural magnets or of artificial magnets, or of the electric current. In
                    particular, we see at once the reason why the end of a needle which has been
                    touched by the north pole of another magnet becomes a south pole, and <hi
                    rend="italic">vice versa,—</hi> a fact which greatly puzzled the earlier
                    magnetic experimenters, and indeed all who were inclined to think that, in the
                    process of magnetization, something was communicated from the one magnet to the
                    other.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mathematical Theory of the Action of Permanently Magnetized
                    Bodies.</hi></p>
                <p>In this section we shall suppose the bodies considered to be rigidly magnetized;
                    <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> we shall suppose that magnetic action exerted on
                    any body produces no change in its magnetization. It is further to be observed
                    that we are merely establishing a compendious representation of observed facts,
                    and foreclosing nothing as to their physical theory or ultimate cause. Our
                    method is therefore to some extent tentative, and its success is to be judged by
                    the agreement of the results with experiment.</p>
                <p>There are two main facts to be borne in mind :—(1) that a magnet is polarized,
                    and (2) that the properties of its smallest parts are similar to those of the
                    whole. Adopting the mathematical fiction of action at a distance, we may
                    represent the action of such a body by a proper distribution of imaginary <hi
                    rend="italic">positive</hi> and <hi rend="italic">negative</hi> attracting
                    matter throughout its mass. This imaginary matter, following Sir W. Thomson, we
                    shall call “magnetism,” as we thus avoid suggesting other properties of matter
                    than attraction, of which in the present case experience has given no evidence.
                    We assume that <hi rend="italic">magnetism of any sign repels magnetism</hi><pb

                    magnetism of the opposite sign.</hi> Magnetism is supposed to be so associated
                    with the matter of the body that magnetic force exerted on the magnetism is
                    ponderomotive force exerted on the matter. On the other hand, magnetic force is
                    always supposed to be exerted by magnetism upon magnetism, and never directly by
                    or upon matter. Into the nature of this association of magnetism with matter
                    there is no pretence, indeed no need, to enter.</p>
                <p>The elementary law of action assumed is that <hi rend="italic">the attraction or
                    repulsion (as the case may be) between two quantities m and m' of magnetism
                    supposed concentrated in two points at α distance r apart is and is in the line
                    joining the two points.</hi> This supposes that the unit quantity of magnetism
                    is so chosen that two units of positive magnetism at unit distance apart repel
                    each other with unit force. This definition, which is fundamental in the
                    electromagnetic system of units, gives for the dimensions of a quantity of
                    magnetism [lJM <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> T <hi rend="superscript">
                    -1</hi>]. If the electrostatic system be adopted the result would of course be
                    different.</p>
                <p>An accurate meaning can now be given to the phrase “strength of a magnetic
                    field,” or its equivalent “resultant magnetic force at a point in the field ;”
                    it is defined to be <hi rend="italic">the force exerted upon a unit of positive
                    magnetism supposed concentrated at the point.</hi> The force exerted on a unit
                    of negative magnetism would of course be equal in magnitude, but oppositely
                    directed; and in general, if R denote the resultant magnetic force at the point,
                    the magnetic force exerted on a quantity <hi rend="italic">κ</hi> of magnetism
                    concentrated there is κR,</p>
                <p>We may, as in the corresponding theory of electricity, introduce the ideas of
                    volume density (p) and surface density (σ),—so that <hi rend="italic">ρdν</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">σdS</hi> denote the quantities of magnetism in an element
                    of volume and on an element of surface respectively; <hi rend="italic">p</hi>
                    and σ may of course be positive or negative according to circumstances.</p>
                <p>It will now be seen that, mathematically speaking, the theories of action at a
                    distance for electricity and magnetism are identical, and every conclusion drawn
                    will have, so far as the physical diversity of the two cases may allow, a double
                    application.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>To prevent
                    needless repetition, we shall adopt henceforth, without further explanation, the

                    >Electricity,</hi> vol. viii. p. 24 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi></p></note> In
                    particular it will be found that the theory of magnetism, when properly
                    interpreted, gives the theory of dielectrics polarized in the way imagined by
                    Faraday.</p>
                <p>The fact of magnetic polarity requires the conception of negative as well as
                    positive magnetism; the fact that the properties of the smallest parts of a
                    magnet are similar to those of the whole requires that in every element of the
                    body there shall be both negative and positive magnetism. From the fact that in
                    <hi rend="italic">a. uniform field, i.e.,</hi> one in which the resultant
                    magnetic force has at every point the same magnitude and direction, the force of
                    translation upon a magnet is nil, it follows that the algebraic sum of all the
                    magnetism in any magnet must be zero; for, if R denote the strength of the
                    field, by the theory of parallel forces the whole force on the magnet will be
                    S(κR), = R≤κj hence ‰ = 0. In other words, <hi rend="italic">in every magnet
                    there must be as much negative as positive magnetism</hi>; and this conclusion
                    also must be extended to the smallest parts of every magnet, so long as we do
                    not go behind the mere facts of observation. The positive and negative magnetism
                    cannot be coincident throughout, otherwise there would be no external magnetic
                    action, but the separation is in the elements of the body. Thus, although there
                    is no force of translation in a uniform field, there will in general be a
                    couple. Consider the positive and negative magnetism separately, and let <hi
                    rend="italic">κ</hi> denote any element of the former and <hi rend="italic"
                    >κ</hi> any element of the latter. Let N be the centre of mass of the positive,
                    S the centre of mass of the negative magnetism; so that, if the magnet be
                    referred to a set of rectangular axes, the coordinates of N and S are <hi
                    rend="italic"> 2κχ 'S.κy ½κz</hi></p>

                <p>2/c' ’ 2/c' ’ 2κ' -</p>
                <p>Let the distance NS = <hi rend="italic">l,</hi> and let K = <hi rend="italic"
                    >Γ½κ, = - ι⅜κ,'</hi>; this quantity K is called the “magnetic moment.” By the
                    theory of parallel forces, if we suspend the magnet in a uniform field of
                    strength R, the action upon it reduces to two forces R≤κ and - R2∕c, each
                    parallel to the direction of the field, acting respectively at N and S, in other
                    words to a couple whose moment is RSκZsinχ or KRsinχ, where χ is the angle
                    between SN and the direction of the field. Hence, if the magnet be perfectly
                    free to follow the magnetic action &gt;→ ' &gt;—► of the field, it will set so
                    that the linβ SN or the line NS is parallel to the direction of the field, the
                    equilibrium being stable in the former case, but unstable in the latter. The
                    line NS is therefore parallel to what we have already defined on experimental
                    grounds as the axial direction in the magnet. N, S, and NS are sometimes called
                    <hi rend="italic">par excellence</hi> the poles and the axis of the magnet; we
                    have adopted the looser definition given above because it is more convenient and
                    nearer the popular usage.</p>
                <p>The above results maybe applied to some cases very important in practice. Let the
                    magnet whose centres of positive and negative magnetism are N and S be suspended
                    by the middle point of NS, which, for simplicity, may be assumed to be also its
                    centre of gravity. Let OX (fig. 20) be a horizontal line drawn northwards,
                    OZ</p>
                <p>a vertical drawn downwards, both in the magnetic meridian. Let the vertical plane
                    through NS make an angle 0 with the magnetic meridian, and let ON make an angle
                    &lt;ρ with the horizon. If R be the strength of the earth’s magnetic field, and
                    <hi rend="italic">ι</hi> the angle of dip, then the horizontal and vertical
                    components of the eartn s force are H = R cos» and Z = R sinι.</p>
                <p>First, suppose the angle <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> fixed, and the magnet free to
                    rotate about OZ only; then the couple tending to diminish the angle 0 is 2.2/c.
                    R cost-^- cosφ sinø, or KR cost cos≠ sinø.</p>
                <p>In other words the directive couple varies as the sine of the angle of deviation
                    from the magnetic meridian. This conclusion was verified experimentally by
                    Lambert, and also by Coulomb<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The angle at which the axis is depressed below the horizon is therefore least

                    the field and of the axis of the magnet respectively, then, resolving the forces
                    acting at N and S, we see at once that the three components of the magnetic
                    couple are</p>
                <p>KR(∕∕x- <hi rend="italic">μ'v),</hi> KR(λ ’ p — ∕λ), KR(μ'λ-λ⅛) . . . (2).</p>
                <p>These are clearly the same as the components of the couple on a system of three
                    magnets whose axes are parallel to OX, OY, OZ, and whose magnetic moments are
                    Kλ, K∕z, Kv. Hence, so far as the action of a uniform field is concerned, we may
                    resolve the magnetic moment like a vector, and replace a given magnet by others
                    the resultant of whose moments is the moment of the given magnet.</p>
                <p>It appears therefore that in a uniform field every magnet behaves as if it were
                    made up of a certain quantity of positive magnetism and an equal quantity of
                    negative magnetism placed at such a distance apart on a line parallel to the
                    magnetic axis that the product of the quantity of magnetism into that distance
                    has a value equal to the magnetic moment of the magnet. It is very important to
                    observe that the magnetic moment alone appears in the above formulae for the
                    magnetic action. We cannot therefore separately determine from observations in a
                    uniform field either the quantity of positive or negative magnetism in a magnet
                    or the distance between the magnetic centres of mass.</p>
                <p>Let M be any magnet, and P a point whose distance from any point of M is
                    infinitely great compared with the linear dimensions of M. Then, since all the
                    lines drawn from P to different points of M are sensibly parallel and equal in
                    length, we may suppose the positive and negative magnetism of M to be collected
                    at their mass centres, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> M to be replaced by an ideal
                    magnet. It is also obvious that, throughout a region around P whose linear
                    dimensions are of the same order as those of M, the field due to M may be
                    regarded as uniform. Hence we conclude that in calculating the mutual action of
                    two magnets M and M' we may replace each of them by an ideal magnet, provided
                    the distance between them be infinitely great compared with the linear
                    dimensions of either. This condition may be satisfied either by making the
                    distance between the magnets very great if their dimensions be finite, or by
                    making their dimensions infinitely small if the distance between them be finite.
                    The second alternative suggests at once a method for representing the magnetic
                    action of magnetized bodies at finite distances. We may divide up the body into
                    portions whose linear dimensions are infinitely small compared with their
                    distance from any point at which their action is to be considered; each of these
                    portions is itself a magnet, and may be replaced by an ideal magnet having the
                    same axis and moment. The whole magnetic action is obtained by integrating the
                    action of all the ideal magnets of which the body is thus supposed to be
                    composed.</p>

                    at the point where the element is taken. I may be regarded as a vector which
                    specifies the magnetization of the body; in general it varies continuously from
                    point to point; if it has the same value and direction at every point, the body

                <p>The magnet may also be replaced, so far as its external action is concerned, by a

                    This will be seen at once if we replace the positive and negative magnetism
                    throughout the body by positive and negative electricity, and suppose the
                    surface of the magnet covered with a conducting layer in connexion with the
                    earth. The surface will thus become charged with a distribution of positive and
                    negative electricity whose total sum is zero, such that the potential of the
                    surface is zero, and hence the potential at every external point zero. The
                    potential of this surface layer <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n246/mode/1up"

                    equal and opposite to that of the internal electricity. If, therefore, we change
                    the sign of the surface density at every point, we obtain a surface distribution
                    whose potential at every external point is the same as that of the body. There
                    is of course only one such distribution: we may call it Gauss’s
                    distribution.</p>
                <p>Poisson’s distribution will coincide with that of Gauss provided the

                <p>So long as the point considered is external to the magnet there is no difficulty
                    in attaching a definite meaning to the resultant magnetic force (∣∣) at a point;

                    values obtained will be the same whether V be calculated by means of Poisson’s
                    or of Gauss’s distribution. Inside the body the result is otherwise, for reasons
                    that are not difficult to understand, when we examine the nature of our
                    fundamental assumptions. It is therefore necessary to be careful to define what
                    we mean by resultant magnetic force in the interior of a magnet. It is defined
                    by the above equation (9) on the understanding that V is calculated from
                    Poisson’s distribution. We can show that ∣j thus defined is the resultant force
                    in an infinitely small cylindrical cavity within the magnet, whose axis is
                    parallel to the line of magnetization, and whose radius <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    is infinitely small compared with its axis 2δ.</p>
                <p>The removal of the matter filling such a cavity will affect Poisson’s volume
                    distribution to an infinitely small extent; the alteration of the force if any,
                    will therefore arise simply from the surface distribution which we must place on
                    the walls of the cavity in order to make up the complete representation of the
                    action of the magnet in the cavity. This distribution reduces to two circular
                    disks of radius <hi rend="italic">α</hi> at the two ends, the densities of the
                    magnetism on which are - I and +1 respectively. The action due to these is a
                    force 4πl(l - δ∕Vα <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> + δ <hi rend="superscript">

                <p>If, on the other hand, the cavity in the magnet be diskshaped—say a narrow

                    distribution on its walls becomes 4ττl, and the resultant force in the cavity is

                <p>In fact there will be tangential discontinuity of the magnetic induction unless

                    case there is complete continuity of the magnetic induction. When the
                    magnetization at the surface is tangential, there is, on the other hand,
                    complete continuity of the magnetic force.</p>
                <p>It follows from the above that the surface integral of the magnetic induction
                    taken ov⅛r any closed surface S vanishes.</p>
                <p>First, let the surface be wholly within or wholly without continuously magnetized
                    matter. We have, integrating all over S and all over the space enclosed by S,
                    the analytical theorem</p>
                <p>^ <hi rend="superscript"> fa</hi> ÷" <hi rend="superscript"> ii</hi> +^ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> s</hi> ^(S <hi rend="superscript"> +</hi> S <hi
                    rend="superscript"> +</hi> ⅛&gt;∙ · <hi rend="superscript"> (14)!</hi> hence the
                    result follows, for every element of the right-hand integral vanishes. Next,
                    suppose S to be partly within and partly without a magnetized body. Divide it
                    into two parts by a double partition one of whose walls runs outside the surface
                    of the body and infinitely near it, the other inside and infinitely near it;
                    then, on account of the normal continuity of the surface integral will be the
                    same in absolute value over each of these walls. Hence the integral over the
                    whole of S differs infinitely little from the sum of the integrals over the two
                    surfaces into which it is broken up by the double partition, each of which
                    vanishes by the former case. Hence the theorem holds in this case also.</p>
                <p>We may therefore apply to lines and tubes of magnetic induction without
                    restriction all the theorems proved for lines and tubes of electric force in
                    space free from electrified bodies. We may speak of the number of lines of
                    magnetic induction instead of the surface integral if we choose. And we have
                    this important theorem :—</p>

                <p>The lines of magnetization, therefore, have all the properties of lines of
                    magnetic induction or electric force. In particular, if we consider a portion of
                    the magnet enclosed by a tube of the lines of magnetization, the product of the
                    intensity of magnetization by the section at each point is the same. Such a
                    portion of magnetized matter taken by itself is called a “magnetic solenoid,”
                    and the product mentioned is called its “strength.” It is clear (from the
                    general definition, or it may be proved directly from the secondary property
                    just mentioned) that the action of the solenoid may be represented by the
                    distribution of a certain quantity ωl of positive magnetism on the one end and
                    an equal quantity of negative magnetism on the other, I being the intensity of
                    magnetization, <hi rend="italic">ω</hi> the normal section at the end. The
                    action therefore depends merely on the strength of the solenoid and on the
                    position of its ends. The shape of the intervening portion is immaterial. If we
                    suppose it straight, and if the section be infinitely small so that the
                    magnetism at the ends may be regarded as condensed at two points, we have an
                    ideal magnet of finite length. The equipotential lines of such a magnet in any
                    plane through its axis are of course given by the equation <hi

                    the reader an idea of the general appearance of the two sets of lines. He may
                    compare the ideal with the actual cases by referring to figs. 4 and 5, p.

                    proposition which the reader will easily verify. These propositions are of
                    considerable use in rough magnetic calculations. As this is an important case we

                <p>We may, if we choose, consider a filament of matter magnetized longitudinally at
                    every point, but so that the strength ωl ( = J, say) is variable. Such a
                    filament is called a complex solenoid. It may clearly be supposed made up of a
                    bundle of simple solenoids whose ends are not all coincident with the ends of
                    the filament. If <hi rend="italic">ds</hi> be an element of such a filament, the

                <p>That is, its action may be represented by two particles of magnetism J <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and J <hi rend="subscript"> a</hi> at its two ends, and
                    by a continuous distribution &lt;&gt;f free magnetism along its length whose
                    density is <hi rend="italic">-dJjds.</hi> This is of course merely a particular
                    case of Poisson’s distribution.</p>
                <p>When a body is solenoidally magnetized, the magnetic force H both external and
                    internal depends solely on the surface distribution, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> merely on the ends of the solenoids of which the body is composed.
                    We may therefore suppose the two ends of any solenoid joined by a solenoid of
                    equal strength lying in the surface of the body. Proceeding thus, we may in an
                    infinite number of ways construct a surface layer of <hi rend="italic"
                    >tangentially</hi> magnetized matter which will represent the magnetic action of
                    a solenoidally magnetized body. Thomson has shown by means of a highly
                    interesting piece of analysis how to find the components of this tangential
                    magnetization. See <hi rend="italic">Reprint of Papers on Electricity and
                    Magnetism,</hi> p. 401.</p>
                <p>The magnetic theorems just stated will suggest at once to the mind of the reader
                    acquainted with the analysis employed in hydro kinetical problems the close
                    analogy that subsists between the two methods. In fact, by proper arrangement,
                    every problem in the one subject can be converted into a problem in the other.
                    For details we refer the reader to Thomson, who was, so far as we know, ;he
                    first to work out this matter fully; in the present connexion lie should consult
                    more particularly §§ 573 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi> of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Reprint.</hi><hi rend="italic">Uniformly Magnetized Bodies</hi> constitute in
                    practice the mo&gt;t important ease of solenoidal magnets. In the first place it
                    is obvious that the whole magnetic moment ρf such a body is simply its volume
                    multiplied by the intensity of magnetization, and that the axis of the whole is
                    parallel to the axis of each of its infinitely small parts. The method usually
                    applied to calculate the potential in this case may be presented in two ways.
                    The potential is calculated according to Poisson’s method in this case merely
                    from a surface distribution of varying density I cos <hi rend="italic">θ.</hi>
                    We may replace this by a layer of uniform density <hi rend="italic">ρ</hi> and
                    varying normal thickness. Let the thickness at any point measured parallel to
                    the magnetic axis be <hi rend="italic">t;</hi> then the normal thickness is
                    icosø; hence <hi rend="italic">ptcosθ≈</hi> Icosθ, and <hi rend="italic">ρt≈l;
                    i.e., t</hi> is constant. We may therefore suppose the magnet replaced by itself
                    (fig. 24) with a uniform volume distribution <hi rend="italic">p</hi> of
                    positive magnetism, and itself displaced through a distance <hi rend="italic"

                    potential of the magnet at P is p(U - IF), where U is the potential at P of a
                    uniform volume distribution of density +1 throughout the magnet, and IF the

                    that side of the shell is positive towards which the lines of magnetization

                <p>There is, however, another way of looking at the result. Since A, B, C are

                    Hence if the tangential component of magnetization be given in direction and

                    is given all over that surface. We conclude therefore that, if a body be

                <p>One most important conclusion follows at once from these formulae, viz., that the
                    translatory forces vary inversely as the fourth power of the distance, whereas
                    the directive couple varies only inversely as the third power. Hence the couple
                    may be quite sensible at distances for which the force of translation is
                    inappreciably small. These conclusions apply of course equally to any pair of
                    magnetized bodies, provided the distance between them be sufficiently great as
                    compared with their linear dimensions. This, applied to the case of the earth,
                    at once explains the phenomena that puzzled Norman and the earlier magnetic
                    philosophers so greatly. The following particular cases are important (fig.

                    terrestrial magnetism. The following is a brief account of the theory, which has
                    not been greatly added to since he left it.</p>
                <p>Let X, Y, Z be the components of the earth’s resultant magnetic force at any
                    point on its surface, in the directions of geographical north, geographical
                    west, and vertically upwards respectively. The force is completely known when
                    these are given, since it depends on three elements only. If H, δ, ι have the
                    meanings formerly assigned (p. 220, 221, 227), we have of course</p>
                <p>H = √X <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> + Y <hi rend="superscript"> 9</hi>, tauδ =
                    Y∕X, tan∣ = Z∕√X <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> +Y <hi rend="superscript">
                    2</hi>.</p>
                <p>Again, if V be the magnetic potential of the earth» <hi rend="italic">l</hi> the
                    latitude, and λ the longitude of any point on its surface, then, supposing the
                    earth to be a sphere of radius <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> we have</p>
                <p>X=-lf , Y=-_L_ <hi rend="subscript"> Z</hi>._^, . (53), <hi rend="italic">α

                    distance of any point from the centre of the earth. When V is known, therefore,
                    the force is completely determined.</p>
                <p>If now we suppose all the magnetized matter (or its equivalent—say, electric
                    currents) to be within the earth, it follows, from the theory of spherical
                    harmonics, that we can write down a convergent series for its potential at all
                    external points, when the potential at every point of its surface is given.<note

                    2</hi> ÷27 arbitrary constants. These must be determined by observation, and
                    then the magnetic action at all points on the surface or outside the earth is
                    known irrespective of the internal distribution of the magnetic causes.</p>
                <p>If we look at the matter from the general point of view that V is determined when
                    its surface value is known, we have the following propositions.</p>
                <p>I. V is determined when the vertical force is known at every point of the earth’s
                    surface.</p>
                <p>For, let the surface value of Z be expanded in a series of surface harmonics of
                    which the 7 <hi rend="superscript"> th</hi> is Z,∙; then, equating this to the ι
                    <hi rend="superscript"> th</hi> harmonic in the surface value of Z = - <hi
                    rend="italic">df∕dr</hi> derived from (54), we have (i + l)Si=αZ,∙, which
                    determines S,∙. Thus the proposition is proved.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n252/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0252-0235"/>
                <p>II. The surface value of V, and hence its general value for external points, is
                    determined if the northward component of the magnetic force be known at every
                    point of the earth’s surface.</p>
                <p>This follows at once from the fact that the difference of the values of V at any
                    two places is the line integral of the magnetic force along <hi rend="italic"
                    >any</hi> fine joining them; thus, if V <hi rend="subscript"> o</hi> be the
                    value of V at the geographical north pole, we have</p>
                <p>V = <hi rend="italic">-af</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> l</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Xdl + Υ</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 0</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p>∙∕ <hi rend="superscript"> 7r</hi></p>
                <p>2</p>
                <p>But the constant V <hi rend="subscript"> o</hi> does not affect the general value
                    of V; hence the proposition is established.</p>
                <p>III. The same conclusion follows if the westward horizontal component be known
                    all over the earth’s surface and the northward component along any one
                    meridian.</p>
                <p>In fact, if V be the potential at any place whose latitude is <hi rend="italic"
                    >I</hi> and longitude λ, then <hi rend="italic">N--af</hi><hi rend="italic

                <p>2</p>
                <p>the first integration being performed along the given meridian, the second along
                    the parallel of latitude corresponding to the place.</p>
                <p>From I., II., and III. we have the remarkable conclusion that, if the vertical
                    component be given all over the earth, or the northward component, or the
                    westward component and the northward along one parallel, then in each case the
                    other two elements are determined.</p>
                <p>Gauss gives another interesting application of the line integral of magnetic
                    force. If this integral be taken all round any closed curve or polygon, the
                    result is zero. Let us express this for any geodesic triangle ABC, at whose
                    vertices the horizontal force has the values</p>
                <p>H <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi>. If the inclinations of H to BC at B and C be <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> and α', to CA at C and A <hi rend="italic">β</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">β',</hi> to AB at A and B γ and <hi rend="italic">y',</hi> then,
                    if the arcs BC, CA, AB be not too long, we may replace the component along BC at
                    every point by the average of its values at B and C, and so on. We thus get</p>
                <p>⅜BC (H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> cosa + H <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> cosα')
                    + ⅛CA (H <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> cos0 + H <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>
                    cosβ')</p>
                <p>+ ⅛AB (H <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> cosγ + H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>
                    cos7') = O (56).</p>
                <p>If we suppose the values of H at B and C to be known, and the values of the
                    declination to be known at all three places, the above equation determines the
                    value of H at A. Calculating in this way from observed values at Gottingen,
                    Milan, and Paris, Gauss found for H at Paris 0’51696, the observed value being
                    0'51804.</p>
                <p>It has been supposed hitherto that the magnetic causes are entirely internal to
                    the earth. The foregoing theory enables us to test how far this assumption is
                    correct.</p>
                <p>If we suppose that there are external causes, then the potential at internal
                    points due to these will be <hi rend="italic superscript"> τ</hi><hi

                <p>We have seen already that the acti&lt;∙n of any body can be represented at
                    external points by an ideal layer of positive and negative magnetism. Gauss
                    finds for the surface density of the layer in the case of a spherical body like
                    the earth, the expression (V/re - 2Z)∕4∙∏∙, which may be deduced immediately
                    from the formulae already given.</p>
                <p>If we draw a series of equipotential surfaces corresponding to small
                    equidifferent values oï V, these will cut the earth’s surface in a series of
                    equipotential lines, which are called the “magnetic parallels.” These lines
                    obviously have the following properties. The horizontal force is everywhere
                    perpendicular to them, and is at any point inversely proportional to the
                    distance between two consecutive lines there. So that, if these lines were drawn
                    upon a terrestrial globe, their crowding would indicate increase of horizontal
                    force. The lines of horizontal force, or “magnetic meridians,” the tangent at
                    every point of which is parallel to the horizontal component, are everywhere
                    orthogonal to the magnetic parallels, and their positive direction is from p
                    ιrallels of greater potential to parallels of less potential. If, as has been
                    tacitly assumed hitherto in accordance with the results of observation, the
                    potential on the earth’s surface have but one maximum and one minimum, then the
                    parallels will be closed curves expanding successively from the maximum point
                    and then closing again round the minimum point, and the magnetic meridians will
                    all run between these two points. It is clear that at each of these points the
                    equipotential surface and the earth’s surface touch; at the minimum point the
                    line of total resultant force will pass <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the earth, at
                    the maximum point <hi rend="italic">from</hi> it; at the former, therefore, the

                    vertically downwards, at the latter the <hi rend="italic">south</hi> end will do
                    the same. This is the simplest possible case for a magnetized sphere. It is easy
                    to see that, if we define a north pole<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    his reduction of the magnetic observations at his disposal that, apart from
                    purely local disturbances, the earth has, as a matter of fact, only one north

                    It may assist the practical magnetist to indicate the nature of this disturbance
                    in a particular case. Let us suppose that a magnet is placed some distance
                    underground, vertical, with its north pole uppermost. Then, if its moment be
                    sufficiently great, the equipotential lines will be as in fig. 27.<note

                    >l,c.,</hi> § 13.</p></note> The upper side of the figure is supposed to be
                    magnetic north, and it is supposed that the undisturbed parallels would be
                    straight lines running magnetic east and west, which is sufficiently near the
                    truth in most cases. It should be observed that fig. 27 is in reality a
                    transformation of figure 26, one of the poles being projected to infinity. The
                    reader should notice that the double point F, due south of the point <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> vertically over the disturbing magnet, is a point of
                    equilibrium at which the horizontal components of the forces of the earth and
                    the magnet destroy each other; it will be a false pole, south or north according
                    as the magnet or the earth prevails.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Experimental Foundation for the Law of the Inverse
                    Square.</hi></p>
                <p>From what has already been laid down, it will be seen that the determination of
                    the elementary law of magnetic action is a very complex problem. The action
                    between two magnets depends, not only on their distance apart, but also on their
                    relative angular position. Then we have to distinguish force of translation,
                    which varies inversely as the fourth power of the distance, and directive
                    couple, which varies inversely as the third power. It must also be remembered
                    that the elementary law results in part from an hypothesis as to the nature and
                    distribution of the cause of the magnetic action, for, until some such
                    hypothesis is made, no clear conception is possible of what is to be understood
                    by elementary action. Lastly, we have the disturbance which arises from magnetic
                    induction, the consequence of which is that magnetically speaking two magnets
                    are not the same at different distances apart. When all these circumstances are
                    considered, it is not surprising to find considerable uncertainty and difference
                    of opinion among the earlier magnetic philosophers. The truth is that the law as
                    now established owes quite as much to the development of magnetic theory as to
                    the work of magnetic experimenters.</p>
                <p>The question attracted the notice of Huygens and Hooke, but Newton seems to have
                    been one of the first who propounded any law on the subject. He says <hi
                    rend="italic">{Principia,</hi> lib. iii. prop. 6, cor. 5) that some rough
                    experiments had led him to the conclusion that the magnetic force (vis
                    magnetica) decreases according to the ]aλv of the inverse cube of the distance.
                    No account of the experiments is extant, and it does not appear what he means
                    exactly by vis magnetica. If the directive couple is meant, and the action of
                    the <hi rend="italic">entire</hi> magnet is intended, then, as we have seen,
                    this is in agreement with modern theory. In a remarkable note in the annotated
                    edition of the <hi rend="italic">Principia</hi> by Le Sueur and Jacquier
                    (assisted by Calandrini <hi rend="italic">T)</hi> (1742) on the passage
                    inquestion, a series of deflexion experiments are described, and an accurate
                    discussion is given, from which results the law of the inverse cube for the
                    deflecting couple. Hawksbee<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    a view to determine the law of magnetic action, in which a deflecting magnet was
                    moved at various distances round a compass, and the corresponding deflexions
                    noted. A few years later Brook Taylor<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">PhU. Trans.,</hi> 1715 and
                    1721.</p></note> and the same experimenter made a series of observations in
                    which the “end on” method of deflexion still in use was adopted. But in neither
                    case was any definite result arrived at. A similar uncertainty appeared in the
                    experiments of Whiston, who indicates the inverse f th power of the distance as
                    the law of decrease. Musschenbroek’s experiments, which were extensive, also led
                    to no final result. He used the method of Hooke, in which the attraction of a
                    vertical bar magnet upon another suspended from one arm of a delicate balance is
                    balanced by weights attached to the other arm. F rom some of his experiments he
                    deduces as low a power as the inverse 1st, from others the ∣th, and so on; but
                    no attempt is made to analyse the phenomena. Michell, in his treatise on
                    artificial magnets (1750), however, deduces the law of the inverse square from
                    Musschenbroek’s results. Although Aepinus does not arrive at any definite result
                    as to the elementary law, there can be no doubt that his <hi rend="italic"

                    (1759) contributed powerfully towards the solution of the question. Tobias Mayer
                    seems to have been the first to publish the law of the inverse square as the
                    actual result of an experimental investigation. His paper was read before the
                    Royal Society of Göttingen, and was referred to in the <hi rend="italic"

                    and to point out the various elements of disturbance to be provided for. We
                    regret that we are unable to devote space to an exhaustive account of his
                    memoirs,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>An excellent

                    even now. He showed that the effect of an oblique magnetic force on the needle
                    varies as the sine of the inclination; and, making allowances for this, he
                    deduced the law of the inverse square from deflexion experiments made at
                    different distances. He also described the method of oscillations, but found
                    difficulties in its practical application. It is upon his theoretical work,
                    however, rather than upon his experiments, that his claim to be remembered
                    rests. About the same time as Lambert, <pb break="no"

                    of Hooke and Musschenbroek, but discussed more carefully the exact nature of the
                    resultant action. His results indicated the law of the inverse square. Robison
                    used both the method of deflexion and the method of oscillation, the peculiarity
                    in his apparatus being the movable magnet, which was composed of two magnetized
                    spheres connected by a slender rod, and suspended either in the field of the
                    earth alone, or at different distances from a large magnet. He made several
                    independent investigations, and seems to have arrived in each case at the law of
                    the inverse square as his final result.</p>

                    present many features of great interest. He used the improved form of Michell’s
                    torsion balance, which had served him so well in his electrical experiments. In
                    order to realize as nearly as possible the ideal case of a linear solenoid,
                    whose action can be represented by positive and negative magnetism concentrated
                    at its ends, he worked with magnets made of thin steel wire magnetized
                    longitudinally. The circumstances of the experiment are thus considerably
                    simplified, for the acting magnet may be so arranged that the action of one of
                    the poles may be neglected, or, failing that, the action of both can be easily
                    calculated.</p>
                <p>In one of his experiments he took a magnetized steel wire 25 inches long, and 1⅜
                    lines thick, and placed it vertically in the magnetic meridian before a
                    horizontal magnetic needle some 3 inches long, delicately suspended by a silk
                    fibre. The rod was raised and lowered at a given distance from the needle until
                    the attraction on the near pole of the needle, as tested by the rapidity of the
                    vibrations, was a maximum; it was then found that the lower end of the bar was
                    about 1 inch below the needle. Again, the rod being placed horizontal and
                    perpendicular to the magnetic meridian on a level with the needle, it was
                    displaced until the needle returned to the magnetic meridian; it was then found
                    that the needle was directed to a point about 1 inch from the end of the bar.
                    Both these experiments thus indicate that the magnetism at one end may be
                    supposed concentrated at a point about an inch from the end of the bar. It is
                    clear that, in these experiments, provided the rod is sufficiently long or the
                    distance between it and the needle not too great, the action of the distant pole
                    may be neglected, for the double reason that the pole is more distant and that
                    the force exerted by it is nearly perpendicular to the direction in which it can
                    be effective, ∆iaking this assumption, Coulomb observed the number of
                    vibrations, when the vertical rod was absent, and when it was placed at various
                    distances.</p>
                <p>The forces thence deduced were found to vary very nearly as the inverse square of
                    the distance. Statical experiments with the torsion balance led to a like
                    result.</p>

                    magnet was a bar magnet, the action of which he represents by a distribution of

                    Assuming that the force due to an element of positive magnetism varies as the
                    inverse nth power of the distance, he showed that, when the distance between the
                    magnets is sufficiently great compared with the greatest linear dimensions of

                    that tan&lt;∕&gt; and tan&lt;∕&gt;' can be expressed so accurately by two terms
                    of a series, the first of which contains r^ <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi>;
                    second, in the fact that the coefficient of the first term in tan&lt;∕&gt; is
                    exactly double that in tanφ'. These researches of Gauss are remarkable, not only
                    for the great generality of the theory, but also for the novelty of the
                    experimental method, and the exceeding accuracy and refinement of the
                    observations. The law of the inverse square has in fact been regarded as settled
                    ever since they were made. They are important from another point of view, to

                    important magnetic determinations that have to be made are the direction of the
                    axis of a magnet relatively to its mass, the magnetic moment of a magnet, the
                    direction of a magnetic field, and the strength of a magnetic field, or its
                    component in any given direction. In most of these cases the measurement may be
                    either relative or absolute. For example, we may determine the moment of a
                    magnet either relatively, in terms of the moment of some other magnet
                    arbitrarily chosen, or absolutely, in terms of the fundamental units of space,
                    mass, and time. The complete theory of measurements of the latter kind is due to
                    Gauss, and the carrying of them into practice to him in conjunction with Weber
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Magnetischer Verein,</hi> of which these two German

                    rend="italic">Axial Direction and Magnetic Declination.—</hi> The magnet is
                    suspended, usually by means of one or more fibres of unspun silk, so as to be
                    free to move about a vertical axis. We shall suppose, for simplicity, that the
                    magnetic axis is in a horizontal plane. If this is not so, instead of
                    determining the axial direction, we determine a vertical plane through it. In
                    order to obtain a fixed line of reference in the magnet, two marks may be made
                    on it as nearly in the direction of the axis as can be guessed to begin with;
                    this arrangement is used with dipping needles and also for horizontal needles
                    when no great accuracy is required. For declination needles two contrivances of
                    greater refinement are used.</p>

                    is nearly parallel to the magnetic axis. The image of a fixed horizontal scale
                    in this mirror is observed by means of a fixed telescope, and the angular motion
                    of the magnet deduced from the motion of the scale divisions over the wires of

                <p>2. A more compact arrangement is to attach to the magnet a small photographic
                    scale and a lens, the former being placed at the principal focus of the latter,
                    so that the line joining the middle division of the scale to the optical centre
                    of the lens is nearly parallel to the axis of the magnet. The scale is viewed
                    through the lens by means of a fixed telescope, and it is clear that the line
                    just mentioned gives us a fixed direction in the magnet, and that the motion of
                    the magnet can be followed by observing the apparent motion of the scale across
                    the wires of the telescope. This may be called the collimator method.<note

                    absolute magnetic measurements, is the portable unifilar magnetometer, the upper
                    part of which is shown in figs. 28, 29. The lower part consists simply of a
                    tripod stand supporting three V-shaped groves, into which the points of the
                    levelling screws attached to the fixed limb of the instrument are set. In making
                    an observation of the declination the instrument is arranged as in fig. 28. The
                    declination collimator magnet is suspended in the box A (the sides of which are
                    removed to allow the interior to be seen) by means of the suspension fibre D,
                    attached to the torsion head PH. The scale of the magnet is observed through the
                    small telescope QBG. The first step is to remove the torsion as far as possible
                    from the suspension fibre by hanging to it a brass plummet E of the same weight
                    <hi rend="italic">as</hi> the declination magnet. After this weight has come to
                    rest, it is replaced by the declination magnet, so that the latter shall rest as
                    nearly as possible in the magnetic meridian without introducing torsion of the
                    fibre. The movable limb is now turned till some division of the magnet scale is
                    on the cross wires of the telescope. It is then clamped. The magnet is now
                    inverted, and the number of the scale division on the wires again read. The mean
                    of these readings gives the point of the scale the line from which to the centre
                    of the collimating lens is parallel to the axis of the magnet. This point of the
                    scale (axial point) will remain the same so long as the magnetism of the magnet
                    does not alter, or the adjustment of the scale and collimating lens is not
                    interfered with. The tangent screw is now worked until the cross wires of the
                    telescope are on the axial point of the scale. The verniers of the limb are then
                    read. The next step is to observe the azimuth of the sun or of some other
                    heavenly body, by means of which we can refer the azimuth of the magnetic
                    meridian to the true north. For this purpose the instrument is provided with a
                    small transit mirror NO, which has a motion in altitude so as to bring any
                    object into the field of the telescope. To use it, the limb is unclamped, and it
                    and the mirror moved until the sun or star comes into the field of the
                    telescope; the limb is then clamped and the time noted at which the heavenly
                    body passes the intersection of the cross wires. The verniers are again read.
                    The differences of the readings, added to the azimuth of the heavenly body found
                    by means of the time from the <hi rend="italic">Nautical Almanac,</hi> gives the
                    declination at the time and place of observation.</p>
                <p>There are several causes of error to be guarded against. (1) Torsion is reduced
                    within as small limits as possible to begin with, and if there is reason to
                    suspect any residual error we may test the apparatus by turning the torsion head
                    of the suspension tube first 90° one way and then 90° the other. If the
                    deflexion of the magnet is exactly the same and oppositely directed in the two
                    cases, then we may conclude that the torsion is zero in the azimuth of
                    equilibrium. If not, then we may turn the torsion head so as to reduce the error
                    still further; or we may calculate its amount (assuming torsion to be
                    proportional to twist) from the two observations, and allow for it. (2) If the
                    axis of the magnet is not very nearly parallel to the line of collimation of the
                    telescope to begin with, and consequently the two scale readings far apart, an
                    error may arise<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See
                    Swan, <hi rend="italic">Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin.,</hi> vol. xxi., 1855.</p></note>
                    from the vertical axis of suspension not being exactly reversed by the
                    inversion. This error is reduced by repeating the observation, after adjusting
                    the axis of the magnet and telescope so as to be more nearly parallel. (3) If
                    mean declination for a given day be desired, correction must be made for the
                    diurnal variation, and under certain circumstances this variation may even
                    produce disturbances in the course of a single observation.</p>

                    say, is found. In this method K is used as the <hi rend="italic">deflecting</hi>
                    magnet, and the moment K' of the <hi rend="italic">deflected</hi> magnet does
                    not appear in the result.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>This important fact was first noticed by Lambert.</p></note> It is obvious
                    that, if we know the value of H, or may assume it constant, either of these
                    methods will enable us to express the moment of any magnet in terms of that of
                    another arbitrarily chosen as unit; and, reciprocally, if we operate with a
                    magnet of known or of constant moment, we can determine the values of H at

                <p>The observations are made with the magnetometer arranged as for the declination
                    experiment. The swinging magnet is brought to rest, and the circle so clamped
                    that the axial point of the magnet scale is on the cross wire of the telescope;
                    the magnet is then slightly disturbed so as to oscillate through a small arc
                    (16' or so). The time of vibration is found first roughly, by taking the time of
                    a single vibration, then more accurately by counting a large number of
                    vibrations and timing the end of the last as accurately as possible. τ is found

                    we may also determine <hi rend="subscript"> 7</hi> when necessary.</p>
                <p>The most troublesome part of the whole process still remains, viz., the
                    determination of A. This is effected by attaching to the magnet a body whose
                    moment of inertia B can be calculated from its dimensions. For this purpose
                    Gauss fixed a cross bar of wood to the magnet, and attached to it at known equal
                    distances from the axis of suspension two cylindrical weights of known mass and
                    dimension. Sometimes a cylinder of gun metal is slung below the magnet by means
                    of two loops. Perhaps the best method is to use a ring of gun metal attached to
                    the magnet so that its plane is horizontal and its centre as nearly as possible
                    in the line of suspension. The new time of vibration being T <hi

                <p>There are several corrections which, although in general negligible may sometimes
                    require to be considered. (1) H may vary so much during the experiment as to
                    cause a sensible error; (2) if the arc of vibration be too large, it may be
                    necessarv to apply the reduction to infinitely small arcs; (3) if the amplitude
                    of the vibrations decrease too rapidly, account must be taken of the resistance

                    has on this account to be made; but, on the other hand, there is no torsion,
                    and, from the symmetry of the position of the two magnets, the approximate
                    formulae have a more exact application.</p>

                    The instrument arranged as in fig. 29 is first carefully levelled, and fitted
                    with the graduated cross bar D, which is so set in its sockets as to be
                    perpendicular to the line of collimation of the telescope A. The box is opened,
                    and the torsion removed from the suspending fibre by means of a plummet as
                    already explained. The deflected magnet is then suspended so as to be at the
                    same height as the deflecting magnet wh&lt; n the latter is placed in its
                    carriage on the cross bar. The sides of the box are now closed, and the circle

                    exerted by the earth on the magnet in a given position, so that there may be
                    equilibrium; the statical couple, which may arise from the torsion of a fibre,
                    from a bifilar suspension, or other gravitational force, thus becomes the
                    measure of the magnetic couple; and hence KH can be determined in absolute
                    measure. Coulomb’s torsion balance experiments are an example of this method. It
                    finds numerous applications in the variation instruments of fixed magnetical
                    observatories, and also in instruments for magnetic observations at sea, but it
                    is very little used in the ordinary work of a physical laboratory.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Magnetic Measurement by Electromagnetic Induction.—</hi> It has
                    been explained in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Electricity</hi> that, if,
                    either owing to the variation of the magnetic field, or owing to the motion of a
                    closed linear conductor in it, the number of lines of magnetic force N passing
                    in the positive direction through the conductor vary, this variation will cause
                    an electromotive force - dN∕&lt;Zi in the positive direction round the circuit.
                    Let us suppose, to take a simple case, that we have a coil of wire made up of a
                    number of parallel plane circular windings, and that the sum of all the areas of
                    the separate windings is A. If we place this in a field of uniform intensity R,
                    so that the normal to the windings makes an angle <hi rend="italic">Θ</hi> with
                    R, the number of lines of force passing through the coil will be N <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> = ARcos0. If we now suddenly reverse the coil, by
                    turning it through 180° about an axis perpendicular to its normal, the value of
                    N in the new position is N <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> = -ARcosØ. Hence the <hi

                    the whole quantity Q of electricity which passes will be Q = - 2ARcos0∕S, where
                    S is the resistance of the coil. If Q be found in absolute measure,<note

                <p>If the test coil be made very small, so that the portion of the field which it
                    occupies may be supposed uniform, this method may be applied to measure the

                    impossible, suddenly removed to a part of the field where the number of lines of
                    force passing through it is zero. The integral electromotive force is of course
                    in the latter case only half what it is in the former. This method is often of
                    use where, owing to the great strength of the field and the consequent
                    disturbances arising from induction, any other method would be utterly
                    useless.</p>
                <p>The method of electromagnetic induction may also be applied to measure the

                    Measurements.—</hi> The method of vibrations came very early into use iu
                    magnetic measurements. Whiston and Graham made vibration observations with a
                    dipping needle. Musschenbroek and Mallet also used a horizontal needle. Lambert
                    appears, however, to have been the first to thoroughly understand and appreciate
                    the method. For long it was the only accurate process in use for obtaining
                    relative measures of the earth’s force. It was so used by Rossel,
                    D’Entrecasteaux, and Humboldt. Coulomb, Hansteen, and Poisson, all contributed
                    more or less to its improvement; and it finally reached perfection in the hands
                    of Gauss,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See his

                    improvement of eliminating the constants depending on the magnetic distribution
                    by observations at different distances is due to Gauss. The advantages of the

                <p>Poisson seems to have been the first to conceive the idea of absolute magnetic

                    >Connaissance</hi><hi rend="italic">des Temps</hi> for 1828, he describes a
                    method for obtaining the value of H in absolute measure. Horizontal vibration
                    experiments are to be made with two magnets A and A', whose moments of inertia A
                    and A' are known. The times of vibration <hi rend="italic">t</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">t'</hi> of A and A', each suspended alone, are to be observed.
                    Then both are to be placed in the magnetic meridian at a distance <hi

                <p>He recommends, however, that comparatively small values of <hi rend="italic"

                <p>Nothing came of Poisson’s proposal until Gauss took up the subject, both
                    theoretically and experimentally, as above described. The first absolute measure
                    of the earth’s horizontal force was made by him at Göttingen on the 18th

                    the literature of magnetic science relates to it; and we must give some account
                    of what has been done, although the results obtained are of comparatively slight
                    physical interest, and of small practical value.</p>
                <p>Experimenters have been somewhat slow in recognizing the essential
                    indeterminateness of the problem. This no doubt has arisen from their imperfect

                    distribution which will represent the magnetic action at all external points,
                    however difficult, is quite determinate. This surface distribution has been
                    called by some the “free magnetism” of the body; and some, all the powerful

                    physical existence, and have even spoken of the depth to which the free
                    magnetism penetrates into the magnet. Others have confounded the free magnetism
                    of Gauss’s distribution with that of Poisson’s; and in many cases it is
                    impossible to gather what the experimenter meant to indicate exactly by the
                    phrase.</p>
                <p>The case in which, from the circumstances, the variation of the internal
                    distribution is confined within the narrowest limits is that of bar magnets,
                    whose length considerably exceeds their lateral dimensions; and this is
                    practically the only case that has been much studied. The most natural way of
                    attempting to represent the action of such a magnet would be to suppose it
                    replaceable by a fixed ideal magnet, and then to determine by experiment the
                    strength and position of the poles of this magnet. The earliest notion was that
                    the poles were situated exactly at the ends of the bar. It was soon found,
                    however, that, if the poles did exist, they were not in general exactly at the
                    ends. Lambert and Kupfer<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    cases the poles lay outside the bar, while in weak magnets they lay inside.
                    Coulomb, as we have seen, and also Dalla Bella, inferred from their results that
                    the poles fell within. Recent experiments have been made by Pouillet,<note

                <p>The word “pole,” like the phrase “free magnetism,” has been used by different
                    writers in very different senses. Some have applied that name to the mass
                    centres of the positive and negative magnetism of the actual molecules. But,
                    although as a matter of convenience we have used these points in our theoretical
                    development, they have, as far as physical observations are concerned, no
                    existence. Others have defined the poles to be the mass centres of the positive
                    and negative parts of Gauss’s surface distribution. These might of course be
                    determined, although the process would be extremely troublesome, and the result
                    of no practical value whatever. In point of fact, if the magnet be in a uniform
                    field, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> at a very great distance from the system
                    that acts on it, the action depends solely on the magnetic moment, and the
                    magnetic distribution has nothing to do with it; the poles in this case are
                    physically indeterminate. If, on the other hand, two magnets are within a
                    moderate distance of each other, we may set to ourselves the problem to find two
                    points in each of them such that the mutual action will be represented by
                    quantities of positive and negative magnetism concentrated there. Then, in
                    general, such points may or may not exist. Riecke has shown (see above, p. 233)
                    that, if the distance between the magnets exceed a certain limit, then, as a
                    matter of approximation, these equivalent poles, as he qalls them, do exist.
                    Except, however, in the case of magnets symmetrical about an axis, and also
                    about an equatorial plane, they are not fixed in the magnets, but <pb break="no"

                    results are extremely interesting from a mathematical and theoretical point of
                    view, we do not see that much practical advantage would attend the use of these
                    equivalent poles; and we are inclined to think that, except in the popular usage
                    for distinguishing one end of a magnet from the other, and in the case of ideal
                    magnets, the word pole had better be abandoned altogether.</p>
                <p>The idea of representing the action of a linear magnet by a continuous
                    distribution of free magnetism, positive in one half and negative in the other,
                    is very old. It appears in Bazin’s work on the magnetic curves published in
                    1753; and Tobias Mayer, in his memoir above quoted, assumes that the density of
                    the distribution is proportional to the distance from the middle of the bar.
                    Four distinct methods have been used in attempting to determine the law of
                    distribution.</p>
                <p>1. The deflexions of a small needle in different positions near the magnet have
                    been observed, and by means of these the constants in some formula assumed for
                    the distribution have been calculated. This was the process adopted by Lambert
                    and Hansteen, and, in some of his experiments, by Lamont.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="superscript"> @1</hi> See also Airy
                    and Stuart, <hi rend="italic">Phil. Mag.,</hi> 1873.</p></note></p>
                <p>2. Instead of measuring deflexion, we may count the oscillations of the needle,
                    and proceed as before. This method was used by Coulomb, Becquerel, and Kupfer,
                    but it led to no satisfactory results, partly owing to the disturbances arising
                    from induction and the force of translation upon the needle, partly owing to the
                    difficulty of putting a satisfactory theoretical interpretation upon the
                    results.</p>
                <p>3. Some observers have measured the force required to detach a small armature of
                    soft iron or steel from different parts of the bar, thinking thereby to obtain a
                    direct measure of the free magnetism. It is not very easy to say what is
                    measured by this process, but it is obvious, on a little consideration, that the
                    effect is complex, depending greatly on the nature and extent of the surfaces in
                    contact, and also upon the mutual induction between the magnet and the armature.
                    Experiments of this kind have been made by Dub, Lamont, and others.</p>
                <p>4. Another method frequently employed is to slide along the bar a small
                    ring-shaped coil embracing it as closely as possible, and to measure the
                    induction currents for a given displacement. The assumption usually made is that
                    the integral electromotive force is proportional to the free magnetism on the
                    portion of the bar passed over, or, what amounts to the same thing, to the
                    difference between the magnetic moments per unit of length of the sections of
                    the bar on which the coil rests at the beginning and end of the motion. This is,
                    however, only an approximation to the truth, and the accuracy of this
                    approximation is very difficult to estimate in the practical case where the
                    lateral dimensions of the bar are finite. The following investigation will show
                    the nature of the difficulty.</p>
                <p>The integral electromotive force is - (N <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>- N <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>), where N <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and N <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> are the surface integrals of magnetic induction taken
                    over the coil in its initial and final positions. Let us take first a linear
                    solenoid SN (fig. 31) of length <hi rend="italic">l,</hi> and magnetic moment
                    <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> and a coil of a single winding PQ, which moves so that
                    its centre R is always in the line SN, and its plane always perpendicular to SN;
                    then</p>
                <p>N = <hi rend="italic">ffτdydz =ffadydz + ±ιjfhdydz,</hi> the former integral
                    extending all over PQ, the latter over the infinitely small section of the
                    solenoid at R, « being the force due to the end distribution at N and S. We thus
                    get</p>
                <p>N=~(cos0- cosfl') (70),</p>
                <p>V <hi rend="italic">9</hi> where <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >θ'</hi> are the angles PSX and PNX. This shows, in the first place (see
                    equation (2δ) above), that if the coil PQ were to expand and contract as it
                    moves, so as always to remain a section of the same tube of force, there would
                    be no variation of N, and no electromotive force, which is as it should be. If
                    we were at liberty to suppose PQ infinitely small, then, when R is between S and
                    N, cos <hi rend="italic">θ</hi>- cos fl' would be the sum of two unities, and,
                    when R is outside, the difference. In such a case, so long as PQ moved on the
                    magnet, there would be no electromotive force, but if we suddenly move it over
                    the end, there would be an electromotive force <hi rend="italic">- iιrm∕l,</hi>
                    which is proportional to the moment of the bar. When PQ is not infinitely small,
                    there is a variable part of N, depending on the dimensions of PQ, which will
                    give rise to an electromotive force, even when the coil is moved along a
                    uniformly magnetized bar, where there is no free magnetism except at the
                    ends.</p>
                <p>It is now easy to form a conception of what happens in the case of an ordinary
                    complex solenoidal bar. We may suppose such a bar made up of a number of simple
                    linear solenoids. A certain number of these, corresponding to the end parts of
                    Poisson’s distribution, will have the same length as the bar; the others,
                    corresponding to the lateral surface and volume parts of the distribution, will
                    be of continuously diminishing lengths. If we were at liberty to suppose the
                    lateral dimensions of the bar and the radius of the coil to be infinitely small,
                    then, as the coil moves along the bar, we should have an electromotive force due
                    to passage over the ends of the short solenoids, and, as it moves over the end,
                    an electromotive force due to passage over the ends of the long solenoids. We
                    might in this way by a sufficient number of observations determine the
                    distribution of the free magnetism throughout the bar and at its ends; and in
                    this case no distinction would be necessary between the volume and the surface,
                    distribution in any section.</p>
                <p>If, however, the dimensions of the section of the bar, and consequently of the
                    coil, be finite, a correction would have to be applied, depending, not only on
                    the dimensions of the bar and coil, but also on the magnetic distribution. All
                    that we can then do is to assume a formula for Gauss’s surface distribution and
                    determine its constants. We thus get Gauss’s distribution, and a formula that
                    will account for the electrical observations; <hi rend="italic">but we obtain no
                    information as to the actual internal distribution of the magnetism in the
                    bar.</hi></p>

                    and entered more fully into the theory, though still with insufficient
                    generality. The most recent experiments of the kind we are aware of are those of
                    Schaper,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>After what has been said, the reader will scarcely be surprised to find that the
                    different experimenters assigned very different formulae for the distribution in
                    bar magnets. Lambert deduces from his experiments a distribution whose density

                    formula; but none of these experimenters give any proper account of the ends,
                    which must be specially represented in all but those cases where the magnetic
                    moment is zero there. Schaper finds that the results of experiment can be
                    adequately represented by means of end distributions, and a lateral surface

                    —It is obvious that the magnetization of a piece of iron must affect its force
                    of cohesion. The most familiar case is that of a magnet to which an armature is
                    fitted. If the surfaces of the pole, and armature be carefully ground flat, so
                    as to fit, we may regard the magnet and the armature as continuations of each
                    other. The force of cohesion here is mainly due to the magnetism; and the force
                    required to separate the two is called the “carrying power” of the magnet. To
                    simplify the question, let us consider a cylindrical bar of section ω, uniformly
                    magnetized in the direction of its length with intensity I. Suppose the bar cut
                    so that the normal to the plane of section makes an angle <hi rend="italic"
                    >θ</hi> with I, and let the surfaces of section be separated infinitely little,
                    then the surface density of Poisson’s distribution will be I cos# on each
                    surface. Assuming that the cohesion is caused solely by the attraction of these
                    surface layers, we get for the carrying power P = 2τrlcos0 × Icos0ωsec0, 7.e., P
                    = 2τrl <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> ωcos0. The carrying power is therefore
                    greatest, viz., 2τrωl <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, when the surface of the
                    pole is perpendicular to the lines of magnetization.</p>
                <p>A great variety of experiments have been made on this subject by Joule, Dub,
                    Tyndall, Lamont, and others, mostly, however, under circumstances that do not
                    admit of the application of the above theory. For an account of what lias been

                <p>2. The magnetic moment induced by any force ∣j is the resultant of the magnetic
                    moments induced separately by any forces of which ∣∣ is the resultant.</p>
                <p>With reference to axiom 1 it is to be remarked that account must be taken of the
                    physical condition of the body as to temperature, and so forth; but it is
                    implied that no account is to be taken of its magnetic state, except in so far
                    as that affects the resultant magnetic force. In other words, it is asserted
                    that the moment induced by any force does not depend upon any pre-existing
                    magnetic moment in the element, and is the same whatever forces may have acted
                    on the element previously. The full significance of these statements will be
                    better appreciated when we come to consider the exceptions to them in case of
                    strongly magnetic bodies. It should also be noticed that it is supposed that the
                    body has reached a state of magnetic equilibrium, and that by whole resultant
                    magnetic force is understood, not only that arising from the given inducing
                    system, including pre-existing magnetism in the body itself, but also that
                    arising from induced magnetism.</p>
                <p>In the mathematical theory no distinction is drawn between the part of the
                    induced magnetism which disappears when the inducing force is removed, and that
                    which remains. If anywhere we contemplate what happens after the removal of the
                    force, it is assumed that <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the induced magnetism
                    disappears. This important restriction must be borne in mind in applying the
                    results in practice.</p>
                <p>Axiom 2 enables us to assign at once the law connecting the components of induced
                    magnetization A <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, B <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, C
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> with the components α, <hi rend="italic">β,</hi> γ

                <p>Hence the most general expressions for the components of magnetization compatible
                    with our axioms are three linear functions of the components of the resultant
                    force.</p>
                <p>Here it is necessary to introduce a classification of bodies according to their
                    magnetic properties.</p>
                <p>If equal, similar, and <hi rend="italic">similarly situated</hi> elements cut
                    from different parts of a body have identical magnetic properties, it is said to
                    be “magnetically homogeneous,” if not, “heterogeneous.”</p>
                <p>If equal and similar elements cut around the same point <hi rend="italic"
                    >in</hi><hi rend="italic">different</hi><hi rend="italic">directions</hi> be
                    identical in their magnetic properties, the body is said to be magnetically
                    “isotropic”; if not, “aeolotropic.”</p>
                <p>These are not cross classifications; for a body <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi>
                    Iceland spar) may be aeolotropic and yet homogeneous, and it might be
                    heterogeneous and yet isotropic. We must regard the coefficients <hi
                    rend="italic">p, q, r</hi> of (71) as belonging to a point of the body; and we
                    see that in a homogeneous body they will be the same for all points, whereas in
                    a heterogeneous body they will vary from point to point, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> they will be functions continuous or discontinuous of the position
                    of the point.</p>
                <p>In the case of an isotropic body it is obvious <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi>
                    that the induced magnetization must be coincident in direction with the
                    resultant force; the conditions for this are that the coefficients <hi
                    rend="italic">p</hi> and <hi rend="italic">q</hi> should all vanish, and that r
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> =≡.r <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> = r <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi> = <hi rend="italic">κ.</hi> The equations (71) thus
                    reduce to</p>
                <p>A <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> = κα, B <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> = κ∕3, C <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> =κγ .... (72).</p>
                <p>In an aeolotropic body, on the other hand, the coefficients may be all different
                    from zero and from one another; but, as we shall see, at all events in the ideal
                    case contemplated by the mathematical theory, the conservation of energy reduces
                    the number of independent constants by three; while a proper choice of axes
                    reduces it by three more; so that the magnetic properties of any element of an
                    aeolotropic body depend virtually on three independent constants.</p>
                <p>The theory here given is the generalization of Poisson’s theory due to Sir
                    William Thomson. It aims at giving the simplest possible exposition of the
                    results of experiment with the fewest assumptions as to the molecular structure
                    of bodies. We first discuss specially a few of the cases <hi rend="superscript">

                <p>1. The induced magnetization is not in general in the direction of the inducing
                    force; but there are in general at every point three directions, called the
                    three principal magnetic axes, mutually at right angles to each other, for which
                    the directions of the induced magnetization and of the inducing force coincide.
                    If the axes of coordinates be parallel to these principal axes, the equations
                    (75) reduce to</p>

                    <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> in this case are called the “principal magnetic
                    inductive susceptibilities.” Bodies for which these coefficients are all
                    positive are called paramagnetic or ferromagnetic. Bodies for which they are all
                    negative are called diamagnetic. No substance is known for which some are
                    positive and others negative, although this is a mathematically possible case.

                    formulae which we need not stop to deduce.</p>

                    Let the body be homogeneous, and let us cut from it a cylindrical piece whose
                    axis is parallel to the principal axis of susceptibility r <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi>. Place this cylinder in the direction of the lines of force in a uniform
                    field of unit strength, then, provided the cylinder be infinitely thin, and of
                    longitudinal dimensions infinitely great compared with its lateral, the internal
                    force due to the induced magnetization will be zero (see above, p. 229), and it
                    will be magnetized inductively with a uniform intensity r <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi>. Similarly for r <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, r <hi rend="subscript">
                    3</hi>.</p>
                <p>The three coefficients w <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> = l+4πr <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, α ’ <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> = 1 ÷ 4τrr <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, w <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> = l÷4πr <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, used later on, are called by Thomson the three
                    principal permeabilities of the body at any point. These are of course pure
                    numbers, and they are positive for all known substances.</p>
                <p>2. If the susceptibilities for any two principal asis be equal, then every axis
                    in the plane of these two is a principal axis.</p>
                <p>3. If all three principal susceptibilities be equal at any point, then every axis
                    through that point is a principal axis, and the susceptibility for every such
                    axis is the same. The body is therefore isotropic at that point, and the
                    direction of the induced magnetization coincides with the direction of the
                    inductive force for every direction of the latter.</p>
                <p>Returning to the problem of the aeolotropic sphere, let us simplify our equations
                    by taking the coordinate axes parallel to the common directions of the principal
                    axes throughout the homogeneous sphere. We then get for the components of
                    magnetization <hi rend="superscript smallcaps"> a</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"

                <p>Using these formulae, we get, by means of (22), for the components of the couple
                    acting on the sphere (of volume <hi rend="italic">υ),</hi></p>
                <p>^∖ι+⅜⅛l⅛^ <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi></p>

                <p>J</p>
                <p>There is of course no force of translation. As a special case let us suppose- <hi
                    rend="italic">r</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> v</hi> r <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi>, and r <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> to be in descending order of
                    algebraical magnitude, and suspend the sphere with the axis of <hi rend="italic"
                    >r</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 1</hi> perpendicular to the lines of force.
                    We may put β <hi rend="subscript"> o</hi> = Fcos0, γ <hi rend="subscript">
                    o</hi> = Fsin0, where <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> is the angle between the axis of
                    γ (r <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>) and the direction of the field, then we have
                    ί = ⅜√F <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> (r <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>- r <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi>) sin 20∕(1 + ⅜wr <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>)(l + ⅜wr
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>).</p>
                <p>Hence the sphere tends to turn so as to place the axis of algebraically greatest
                    susceptibility parallel to the lines of force. It will be in equilibrium when
                    either principal axis is parallel to the lines of force; but in stable
                    equilibrium only when the axis of greatest permeability is in that position. It
                    is to be noticed that the couple is proportional to the square of the strength
                    of the field.</p>
                <p>There is another way of expressing these results more in accordance with the
                    ideas of Faraday.</p>
                <p>If N be the surface integral of magnetic induction taken over the meridian
                    section («) of the sphere perpendicular to the direction of the vector inside,
                    or, as we may call it, the number of lines of force that pass through the
                    sphere, then we have</p>

                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">The sphere is in equilibrium when the number of lines of
                    force passing through it is a maximum or a minimum, the equilibrium being stable

                <p>In order to familiarize the reader with this important case, we give two figures
                    of the lines of force from Sir W. Thomson’s <hi rend="italic">Reprint,</hi> pp.
                    490, 491,—one for a paramagnetic.</p>
                <p>(fig. 32) having w = 2 ’ 8, and another for a diamagnetic (fig. 33) having ≡r =
                    ∙48. The former represents a paramagnetic whose susceptibility is something like
                    <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ∣ <hi rend="subscript"> 17</hi> th of the maximum
                    observed for the best Norway iron. The latter corresponds to a diamagnetic
                    having a susceptibility some 16,000 times that of bismuth, which is the most
                    powerfully diamagnetic substance known.</p>
                <p>The reader should observe that, although the field inside the isotropic sphere is
                    uniform, this is not the case outside, a fact sometimes forgotten by
                    experimenters. Of course the disturbance in the case of a bismuth sphere would
                    be infinitesimal.</p>

                    rend="italic">Ellipsoid in a Uniform Field.</hi> —In the case of a sphere the
                    tendency to set in a uniform field is wholly dependent on the aeolotropy of the
                    sphere, and is independent of its form. It is important, in order to get a
                    complete picture of the behaviour of inductively magnetized bodies, to obtain a
                    solution for some case where the form has an effect upon the result. A solid
                    bounded by a surface of the second degree affords such a case.</p>
                <p>If an ellipsoid be uniformly magnetized so that the components of magnetization

                <p>It is obvious, therefore, that the equations (75) of induction can, as in the
                    case of a sphere, be satisfied by the assumption of uniform magnetization.</p>
                <p>There is no difficulty in dealing with the general case in which the principal
                    magnetic axes are not parallel to the principal axes of figure; we shall content
                    ourselves, however, with the case in which the principal magnetic axes r <hi

                <p>1. When r <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, r <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, <hi

                    squares may be neglected, as in fact is the case with all bodies except iron,
                    nickel, and cobalt, the components of magnetization reduce to r <hi

                    what happens is simply that the part of the internal inducing force which
                    depends on the squares of the susceptibilities is not sensible. In other words,
                    the <hi rend="italic">form</hi> of the body is without influence on the induced
                    magnetization. Or, what is again equivalent to the same thing, the induced
                    magnetism may be supposed to produce no disturbance in the inducing field.</p>
                <p>These conclusions are of course not limited to the ellipsoidal form in
                    particular; but we have the general result that, <hi rend="italic">if the
                    squares of the susceptibilities are negligible, then the form of the body has

                <p>4. From 1, 2, and 3 we have the following most important results. In
                    experimenting with weakly magnetic bodies in a uniform field—in order, say, to
                    determine their susceptibility—the form of the body is indifferent. On the other
                    hand, with strongly magnetic bodies an elongated form must be used, because in
                    that case only does the induced magnetism depend mainly on the susceptibility oi
                    the material. With bodies approaching the spherical form differences in form
                    produce far more effect on the experimental results than differences in the
                    susceptibility of the material, so that in such cases the experimenter really
                    measures the accuracy of his instrument maker<note anchored="true"

                    theorem has already been proved above (p. 245) for strongly magnetic bodies.</p>
                <p>We next apply the formula (87) to deduce the force of <hi rend="italic"

                <p>1. We see that in a uniform field W is constant so long as there is translation
                    merely without rotation, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> there is no tendency in an
                    aeolotropic or isotropic sphere to move bodily in a uniform field.</p>
                <p>2. If we suppose the sphere isotropic <hi rend="italic">(Le.,</hi> s <hi

                    the force tending to move the sphere in the direction of <hi rend="italic"

                <p>In other words, the small sphere is subject to a force of which the scalar
                    potential is ∣τvR <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>. If then we draw the isodynamic
                    surfaces R <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> = const., the force on an inductively
                    magnetized isotropic sphere will be everywhere at right angles to these; that
                    is, the direction of this force at every point will be tangential to the <hi
                    rend="italic">lines of slope</hi> of the resultant force, viz., in the direction
                    in which that force varies most rapidly. In the case of paramagnetic bodies, for
                    which τ is positive, <hi rend="italic">the spheres will tend to move from places
                    of weaker to places of stronger resultant force</hi>; in the case of diamagnetic

                    places of weaker force.</hi> This is the famous law found experimentally by
                    Faraday, and afterwards theoretically established by Sir William Thomson.</p>
                <p>It must be carefully borne in mind that the lines of slope of the field are not
                    necessarily coincident with the lines of force, <hi rend="italic">but may cross
                    them at any degree of obliquity.</hi></p>
                <p>As strange mistakes have been made in this matter, <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>
                    it may be well to illustrate this statement by a few examples.</p>
                <p>In the case of an isolated north pole the lines of slope coincide with the lines
                    of force, which are straight lines radiating from the pole. In this case a
                    paramagnetic sphere would approach and a diamagnetic sphere recede from the pole
                    <hi rend="italic">along the lines of force.</hi></p>
                <p>The lines of force for a rectilinear electric current are circles of which it is
                    the axis; the lines of slope are straight lines radiating from the current. A
                    paramagnetic sphere would therefore move towards, a diamagnetic sphere away from
                    the current in a direction <hi rend="italic">perpendicular to the lines
                    offorce:</hi></p>
                <p>In the case of an infinitely small magnet, whose lines of force are given by <hi

                <p>Hence, as before, <hi rend="italic">the resultant force of translation cm the

                    of the radii of an ellipsoid, we have the following proposition :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The force of translation on an</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p>Or, using permeability instead of susceptibility,—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The force of translation is greatest for a paramagnetic sphere
                    when its axis of greatest permeability is parallel to the lines of force, for a

                    of force, and</hi> vice versa.</p>
                <p>Or, yet again, in the words of Faraday :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The force of translation exerted upon a paramagnetic sphere is

                    when it is so placed that the least number of lines of force pass through it,
                    and</hi> vice versa.</p>

                    replace the spheres of the foregoing discussion by cubes, and determine the
                    action on a body of finite size by integrating the action on the elementary

                <p>It is quite easy to see, without any mathematical calculation, what will happen
                    in a field of force which diminishes in intensity outwards from an axial line.
                    If we suspend an elongated paramagnetic body with its centre in the axis of the
                    field, it will evidently be in stable equilibrium with its longest dimension
                    placed axially; for if it were slightly displaced every little cube of it would
                    move into a place of weaker force, and would therefore tend to return. If, on
                    the other hand, the body were diamagnetic, it would be in stable equilibrium in
                    an equatorial position; for any displacement from that position would bring
                    every little cube nearer the axis of the field, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi>
                    into a place of stronger force, and therefore each such cube would tend to

                <p>From these last, combined with( 93), we have the important consequence that the
                    induced magnetization is both solenoidal and lamellar. This is true only for
                    homogeneous isotropic media in which the pre-existing magnetism, if any there
                    be, is solenoidal.</p>
                <p>In all cases such as we are now considering, the part of the magnetic potential
                    due to induced magnetism may be calculated wholly from surface distributions at
                    the surfaces of discontinuity. If σ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> be this surface

                <p>Let us suppose that a body A of permeability <hi rend="italic">-ar</hi> is sus
                    pended in a medium of permeability -≈'. If the susceptibilities be small,' the
                    forces arising from the induced magnetism will be so small that the direction of
                    the normal force at the surface of A will be the same as if the field were
                    undisturbed by its presence.</p>
                <p>First, let the medium be vacuum, for which we suppose √≡1, then, if A be
                    paramagnetic <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> w&gt;1), κ <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi> will be positive, and the surface magnetism will be positive where the
                    lines of force leave the body, and negative where they enter it. If A be
                    diamagnetic <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> w&lt;l), κ <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi> will be negative, and the magnetic polarity of the body as a whole will
                    be opposite to what it was in the former case.</p>
                <p>Secondly, let the surrounding medium have permeability w', then κ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> is positive or negative according as w &gt; or <hi
                    rend="italic">&lt;ιsr';</hi> in the former case A will behave like a
                    paramagnetic body in vacuo, in the latter like a diamagnetic body in vacuo.</p>
                <p>It appears then that, <hi rend="italic">by virtue of differential action, a body
                    may behave paramagnetically or diamagnetically according as it is placed in a

                <p>In practice it is most convenient in general to determine V <hi rend="subscript">

                    the case in nature, however. It is of importance therefore to consider how the

                    of the magnetization already induced. Subject to the restriction (obviously
                    necessary for isotropic media) that the resultant magnetization shall coincide
                    in direction with the total resultant magnetic force ('∣J), the most general

                    words, I, and therefore /(I), are functions of ∣j. Hence we may write the

                    easy by means of these to introduce the requisite modifications into the general
                    equations of magnetic equilibrium. For the details we refer our readers to
                    Kirchhoff’s memoir in <hi rend="italic">Grelles</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    seen at once that the induced magnetization is in general neither solenoidal nor

                <p>There is one important class of cases in which the conclusions arrived at on the
                    assumption that <hi rend="italic">κ</hi> is constant still hold, viz., those in
                    which the induced magnetization is uniform. In such cases I has the same value
                    throughout the body, and <hi rend="italic">κ</hi> is therefore constant
                    throughout the body <hi rend="italic">in any one case,</hi> although it differs
                    from one case to another. For example, in the case of an ellipsoid the equations
                    (85) above given for the components of magnetization still hold good, provided
                    we understand <hi rend="italic">κ</hi> to be defined by the equation</p>

                <p>It is clear, therefore, that by experiments on an ellipsoid placed in a uniform

                    be found in the whole literature of mathematical physics. In the first two he
                    investigates expressions for the force due to bodies magnetized in any manner;
                    he then applies his formulae to the case of bodies inductively magnetized but
                    having no coercive force. Although he confines his investigations to the case of
                    isotropic bodies, he is quite aware of the general nature of the consequences of
                    aeolotropy, and in fact distinctly predicts as possible the magnecrystallic
                    phenomena afterwards discovered by Pliicker and Faraday. The formulae he gives
                    are practically identical with those given above (p. 248). He works out in
                    detail the solution for the case of a hollow or solid sphere exposed to any
                    system of inducing forces having a potential,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>He did not use the word “potential,” although
                    he uses the corresponding function.</p></note> and in particular compares the
                    results, when the inducing field is uniform, with the experiments of Barlow. In
                    the second memoir he works out the solution of his equations for an ellipsoid in
                    a uniform field, examining specially the case of an ellipsoid of revolution and
                    its extreme cases (see above, p. 245). At the end of this memoir he discusses
                    the disturbing forces on a compass, arising from the earth’s induction on any
                    distribution of soft iron, and shows that the given components of the disturbing
                    force are expressed by linear functions of the components of the earth’s force,
                    involving nine constants which depend on the quantity and distribution of the
                    iron. The third memoir, on magnetism in motion, is an attempt to explain the
                    phenomena of the deviation of the magnetic needle caused by rotating metal
                    spheres or disks. Although the physical interest of this memoir was in a great
                    measure destroyed by the discoveries of Faraday as to the true nature of this
                    action, yet, as a piece of profound mathematical investigation, this work of
                    Poisson’s is still worthy of study; nor is it perfectly certain that his theory
                    will not after all be required to explain certain residual phenomena. The fourth
                    memoir develops the mathematical theory of the deviation of the compass caused
                    by the iron of ships. After Poisson the most important investigators are Green
                    and Gauss. Green’s services have already been alluded to in the article <hi

                    solution of the problem of the magnetic distribution on cylindrical bars, which
                    gives a formula agreeing with that of Biot. The all-important work of Gauss has

                    infinite length. We are not aware that the solution of Poisson’s equations in
                    particular cases has been carried any farther, unless we include as new the case

                    observation. He enters more fully than Poisson had done into the specification
                    of magnetic distribution. He gives simple synthetic solutions of the induction
                    problem for spheres and ellipsoids in a uniform field. He gives for the first
                    time with full generality the theory of induction in aeolotropic media, and
                    shows that Poisson’s theory thus fully developed leads to all the laws of
                    paramagnetic and diamagnetic action discovered by Faraday, and also to the laws
                    of magnecrystallic action discovered by Pliicker and Faraday. The value of his

                    of cast iron inductively magnetized by the earth’s force. They found that the

                    lines and the plane of the magnetic meridian. It was also found that the

                    the mathematical theory, viz., that inside a hollow iron sphere of any
                    considerable thickness the magnetic force is very small in comparison with the
                    external inducing force. Sir William Thomson takes advantage of this principle
                    to render his marine galvanometers independent of external magnetic force by
                    surrounding them with a tube of soft iron.</p>

                    of the mathematical theory to the magnetization of soft iron. In Plücker’s
                    experiments an ellipsoid of soft iron was fixed in a graduated brass ring with
                    its longest and shortest axes (α and c) in the plane of the ring. When the ring
                    was suspended with the longest axis <hi rend="italic">a</hi> vertical in the
                    nearly uniform field between the two flat vertical faces of the poles of an
                    electromagnet, the mean axis <hi rend="italic">b</hi> set itself parallel to the
                    horizontal line of force; as the point of suspension was moved along the
                    circumference of the ring a point was reached at which the plane of <hi

                    certainly the most important of the applications of the mathematical theory of
                    magnetic induction was the discussion of the deviation of the compass caused by
                    the magnetism of the iron in ships. This disturbance seems to have been first
                    noticed by Wales the astronomer, who accompanied Cook on his voyages of
                    discovery (1772 to 1779). The same thing was noticed during the voyage of
                    D’Entrecasteaux in search of La Pérouse; .and Beautemps-Beaupré, who accompanied
                    him, calls attention to the errors thence arising in the surveying of coasts by
                    means of the compass. Flinders,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    the numerous observations made by Wales and by himself, endeavoured without
                    success to construct empirical formulae for correcting the errors of the
                    compass. He also attempted to correct the errors partially by means of a
                    vertical bar of soft iron placed near the binnacle. Barlow<note anchored="true"

                <p>The unusually great deviations observed during the Arctic voyage of the
                    “Isabella” and “Alexander” in 1818 attracted the attention of Poisson, and gave
                    rise to his memoir on the subject already alluded to. Important as the matter
                    then appeared, it became still more so after the introduction of iron ships.

                    stands is mainly due.</p>
                <p>The cause of the deviation of the compass is twofold; it arises partly from the
                    permanent magnetism of the ship, partly from the temporary or induced magnetism.
                    The permanent magnetism of the ship is acquired for the most part during the
                    process of building. The earth’s force acts on the iron, and the constant
                    jarring in the process of construction enables it to induce a considerable
                    permanent magnetization, which the ship carries with her to sea. The quantity
                    and distribution of this magnetism will depend greatly on the build of the ship
                    (whether of wood or of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n268/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0268-0251"/> iron), and on her position with respect to the
                    magnetic meridian during building. A considerable portion of it is what Airy
                    calls subpermanent; <hi rend="italic">de.,</hi> it diminishes gradually as the
                    ship is worked. This magnetic settling down will take place more rapidly in a
                    steamer which is constantly agitated by the jarring of machinery than in a
                    sailing ship, unless the latter be subjected to shocks from the impact of waves
                    in rough weather. After a time the ship reaches a more or less stationary
                    condition as to permanent magnetism. Along with the phenomenon of subpermanent
                    magnetism has to be classed what is sometimes called the sluggishness of ships’
                    magnetism; this arises from the fact that all the temporary magnetism of a ship
                    which has sailed for some time on any one magnetic course in any one latitude
                    does not at once disappear when the course or the latitude is changed, so that
                    to the permanent magnetism of the ship has to be added a subpermanent magnetism
                    depending on her course and position several days before. It is evident that the
                    cause of disturbance at present under discussion is somewhat capricious, and can
                    only be controlled by constant attention on the part of the mariner.</p>
                <p>The temporary induced magnetism depends on the ship’s position on the earth, and
                    on her angular position relative to the magnetic meridian; but, so long as the
                    iron in the ship or the position of the compass is not altered, the constants
                    which determine it remain the same; the disturbance can be foreseen, and either
                    allowed for or mechanically corrected with much greater certainty than in the
                    case of the permanent magnetism.</p>

                    constants depending on the temporary induced magnetism.</p>
                <p>By a synthetic process of great interest and importance we may show that the nine
                    constants <hi rend="italic">a, b, c, d, e,f, g, h, k</hi> are all independent.
                    For example, if we place a rod of practically infinite length with its end
                    before the binnacle, and stretching forward, or with its end abaft the binnacle
                    and stretching aft, it will give rise to the term <hi rend="italic">ax</hi> in
                    <hi rend="italic">x'.</hi> If <hi rend="italic">a</hi> be negative the rod must
                    be finite and it must run under the binnacle, ending a little fore and aft;
                    again, to represent <hi rend="italic">dx,</hi> we must have a pair of infinite
                    rods with their ends to starboard and port of the binnacle, and running fore and

                    above and below the binnacle, running fore and aft or aft and fore respectively.
                    The reader will have no difficulty in completing the scheme, the rule being that
                    the ends lie in the direction of a/, <hi rend="italic">y',</hi> or √, and the

                <p>The part of the deviation which depends mainly on 2( is called the “constant

                <p>The part depending mainly on $ and βf, viz., Bcos^' + CsinC» is called the
                    “semicircular deviation” because it vanishes and changes sign on two
                    diametrically opposite compass courses, or neutral points. The principal
                    coefficient of the semicircular deviation is ⅛J = (ctan0 +P∕H)∕λ; ctanØ/λ arises
                    from vertical induction in soft iron before or abaft the compass; P∕λH arises
                    from the permanent magnetism of the ship. The second coefficient φ = (∕tan0 +
                    Q∕H)∕λ consists of ∕tan0∕λ, arising from soft iron unsymmetrically placed, and
                    therefore in general very small, and Q∕λH arising from permanent magnetism. ⅛)
                    can be reduced to zero by a magnet placed fore and aft with its centre in a
                    transverse vertical plane passing through the compass, ® by means of a
                    transverse magnet in a fore and aft plane through the compass.</p>
                <p>In wooden ships the courses for which the semicircular deviation vanishes are
                    nearly north and south; but in iron ships they approximate to those points of
                    the compass towards which the stem and stern lay in building.</p>
                <p>The terms Dsin <hi rend="italic">2ζ</hi> ’ + Ecos2^', depending mainly on the
                    constants ,51 and C, are called the “quadrantal deviation.” This part is
                    alternately easterly and westerly in the four quadrants, vanishing on four
                    compass courses. § = (α— e)∕2λ is the principal coefficient of the quadrantal
                    deviation; it depends on horizontal induction in symmetrically placed fore and
                    aft or transverse soft iron. It is in general positive, and in that case can be
                    reduced to zero by two transverse rods with their ends symmetrically placed to
                    starboard and port of the compass. In practice two hollow spheres an inch or so
                    thick are used instead of the rods. The other coefficient ® = (d + δ)∕2λ is in
                    general small, as it depends on horizontal induction in soft iron
                    unsymmetrically placed. It is only when the ship heels that this coefficient is
                    in general of any importance.</p>
                <p>.Whereas the semicircular deviation depends both on the geographical position of
                    the ship and on the state of its subpermanent magnetism, the quadrantal
                    deviation is independent of both, and can be corrected mechanically once for
                    all, or allowed for by means of tables constructed from observations made in any
                    one place. The amount of the semicircular deviation in England does not exceed
                    10° for wooden ships of war, but in iron-built ships it frequently exceeds 30°
                    even at the standard compass. <hi rend="subscript"> o</hi> The quadrantal
                    deviation in wooden ships does not often exceed l <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi>

                <p>The chief part of the heeling deviation is the term Jzcosf', depending on the
                    coefficient J = (e- <hi rend="smallcaps">ä</hi>- R∕Z)tan0∕λ. This coefficient
                    may be reduced to zero by increasing or diminishing the earth’s vertical force
                    by means of a vertical magnet under the compass.</p>
                <p>The usual way of ascertaining the deviations of a ship’s compass is to “swing”
                    the ship gently round so that her head comes into various positions, and to
                    observe with the compass the magnetic bearing of some well-defined distant point
                    (compass mark) on shore. The true magnetic bearing of this point is then
                    ascertained, which may be done by taking the compass ashore, carefully placing
                    it in a line joining the compass mark with the point on board at which the
                    compass was formerly placed, and then taking the magnetic bearing of the mark
                    once more. Care must of course be taken that there is no local magnetic
                    disturbance at the shore station. The differences between the bearings on board
                    and the bearing on shore give of course the deviations for the various
                    positions, of the ship’s head.</p>
                <p>When the deviations have thus been ascertained they may be either corrected by
                    means of tables, by graphical methods, such as the steering diagram of Napier or
                    the dygograms of Smith, or mechanically as we have partially explained. For full

                <p>Of late years Sir W. Thomson has devoted his great scientific knowledge and
                    well-known practical sagacity and inventive skill to the improvement of the
                    compass. By reducing the size of the magnets and increasing their number he has
                    succeeded in reducing Airy’s apparatus for the mechanical correction of the
                    quadrantal deviation within convenient bulk, and by lightening the card and
                    suspension of the magnets in a very ingenious manner (at the same time throwing
                    all the remaining weight as much as possible to the circumference) he has
                    reduced the friction on the pivot to a minimum while retaining a sufficiently
                    long period of vibration to secure perfect steadiness. He has also contrived
                    apparatus for facilitating the determinations of the deviation on different
                    courses and of the heeling error.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    rend="italic">ττ)</hi> upon the magnetizing force ∣j. Confining ourselves to the
                    strongly magnetic metals, iron, nickel, and cobalt, it will be seen presently
                    that <hi rend="italic">κ</hi> depends, not only upon ∣j, but also upon the
                    magnetic condition of the body at the actual moment when is in action, and upon
                    its previous magnetic history, <hi rend="italic">κ</hi> also depends greatly on
                    the temperature, on the state of the body as to purity (notably in the case of
                    iron and steel on the percentage of carbon present), and on the temper. Thus, if
                    we make one experiment on a body by magnetizing it in any way, we permanently
                    alter its magnetic properties, and can restore it to the magnetically virgin
                    condition only by heating it to a high temperature; but in this process we are
                    very apt to permanently alter its molecular condition, so that, although
                    magnetically indifferent, it is physically changed. Owing to the fact, already
                    insisted upon, that we cannot infer the magnetic distribution inside a
                    heterogeneously magnetized body from its external magnetic action, and to the
                    fact, presently to be established, that <hi rend="italic">κ</hi> varies with %j,
                    it is of the last importance to choose the experimental circumstances so that
                    both the magnetic field and the induced magnetization shall be uniform, or very
                    approximately so. A further necessity for the fulfilment of these conditions
                    arises from the fact that we must in all cases be able to render an account of
                    the effect of the <hi rend="italic">form</hi> of the magnetized body, because
                    the true argument of <hi rend="italic">κ</hi> is not the strength of the
                    original field but the whole force ∣j due to the original field and the induced
                    magnetism together.</p>
                <p>The simplest method for securing a uniform field whose strength can be controlled
                    is to place the body inside a hollow cylindrical coil (usually called the
                    magnetizing spiral), whose length so far exceeds that of the body that the
                    disturbance arising from the ends of the coil may be neglected in the
                    neighbourhood of the body. The results in all cases where the length of the body
                    or core is nearly equal to or exceeds that of the coil are impure, and can only
                    be used with the greatest caution in drawing general conclusions as to the value
                    of <hi rend="italic">κ.</hi> The core should always be either exactly or
                    approximately one of the calculable forms, but preferably such that the
                    dimension parallel to the axis of the spiral very much exceeds the others,
                    because in this case the effect of the form is of secondary importance compared
                    with the effect of the susceptibility (see above, p. 245). Thus a very thin
                    cylindrical core is convenient, because the force inside it differs very little
                    from that of the undisturbed field, and any small difference can be easily
                    calculated by supposing the cylinder replaced by a very elongated ellipsoid. On
                    the other hand, a thick-cylindrical bar is a bad form of core for the
                    determination of <hi rend="italic">κ,</hi> both because the magnetizing force
                    inside it is less than the intensity of the undisturbed field by a large
                    quantity, which it is impossible to calculate, and because the magnetization at
                    the end is not uniform, and the disturbance thereby arising is so great that it
                    may mask the general character of the function <hi rend="italic">κ</hi>
                    altogether. A further question arises as to how far the time during which a
                    magnetizing force acts affects the resulting magnetization, whether temporary or
                    permanent. It is also important to consider the disturbances arising during the
                    make and break of the current in the magnetizing spiral. As the resistance in
                    the circuit is usually small, and the self-induction and capacity sensible,
                    oscillatory currents may arise; to these will correspond oscillatory magnetizing
                    forces, which may even vary in sign. When we consider that the permanent
                    magnetization produced by any force may be very much weakened or even altogether
                    destroyed by a smaller force in the opposite direction, it is evident that we
                    have no right to conclude that these disturbances, especially at break, will be
                    without effect upon the permanent magnetization. In order to elude these
                    difficulties, some experimenters have followed the practice of first
                    establishing the current, then gently<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Carefully avoiding all shocks or tremors which exercise a
                    very important influence on the induced magnetism, see below, p. 268.</p></note>
                    introducing the core into its place, and finally removing it before breaking the
                    circuit. In this way the disturbances just alluded to are avoided; but another
                    difficulty is raised, for it is clear that in this operation the core passes
                    through a heterogeneous field before it reaches the final position where the
                    magnetizing force is uniform; different parts of it have therefore been
                    subjected successively to different influences, and we are not at liberty <hi
                    rend="italic">α priori</hi> to conclude that this fact will not influence the
                    results. Perhaps the best plan would be to place the core iu its position, and
                    allow the current to rise very slowly to the maximum value required, and then to
                    fall slowly to zero. This, however, is not the place to dogmatize concerning the
                    best method of experimenting; all that is necessary is to furnish the reader

                    the magnetic moment of the core was measured by the induction current in a
                    secondary coil placed upon the magnetizing spiral. A considerable portion of
                    their work was directed to proving principles which we here take for granted,

                    of the magnetizing spiral, of the radius of its windings, and so on. They

                    to a similar result. His method consisted in measuring by means of a balance the
                    attraction P between two electromagnets actuated by the same current C. If the
                    magnetization of the core were strictly proportional to the magnetizing force,
                    <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> to the current, then P would be proportional to C
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, and P∕C <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> would be
                    constant. In most cases this was so; but in two cases, where the cores of the
                    electromagnets were very thin and the windings more than usually numerous, the

                    mm. thick, his magnetizing spirals from 48 ’ 2 cm. to 53 ’ 2 cm. long; his
                    results are therefore impure, and the empirical formula by means of which he
                    represents them of comparatively little importance; but the approach to a
                    maximum of magnetization (saturation) is quite clearly demonstrated. He found,
                    in accordance with theory, that if we increase the <hi rend="italic"

                    more quickly reached in thin than in thick bars. Somewhat similar experiments

                    the experiments of Müller, Weber, and Dub, 1678 to 2125 mm. mg. sec. units of
                    magnetic moment per mg. of iron as the maximum of magnetization. This would give
                    from 1317 to 1668 C.G.S. units for the maximum magnetic intensity in iron. These
                    numbers, derived from more or less impure results, are merely rough
                    approximations, but they agree very well with those derived at a later date by
                    methods less open to theoretical objections.</p>
                <p>The approach to saturation may be very neatly demonstrated as follows.<note

                    The same current is sent through a galvanometer and through the coil of an
                    electromagnet with a thin core. The electromagnet is so placed that its action
                    on the needle of the galvanometer just compensates the action of the
                    galvanometer coil for a particular strength of current; the needle then points
                    to zero. If now the current be increased, since the increase of magnetization
                    does not keep up with the increase of the current, the action of the coil
                    prevails, and the needle deviates accordingly.</p>

                    contemporary or preceding researches in the same direction, will put the reader
                    in possession of almost all the more important general facts known until the
                    quantitative experiments of Stoletow, Rowland, and their followers gave a
                    complete account of the general characteristics of the function <hi
                    rend="italic">κ.</hi></p>
                <p>In these experiments the method of deflexion was used. The magnetizing spiral was
                    placed magnetic east and west, and in the continuation of its axis was hung a
                    magnetic steel mirror in a thick copper box to damp its oscillations. The
                    deflexions of this mirror, read as usual with a scale and telescope when the
                    core was not in, gave a measure of the current; and the increase of the
                    deflexion on introducing the core gave a measure of the magnetic moment of the
                    core. The cores were cylinders 22 cm. long., 1 ’ 35 cm. thick, and the length of
                    the spiral was only 24 cm.,—so that perfectly pure results could not be
                    obtained. To compensate to some extent for the shortness of the spiral, the bars
                    were gently drawn to and fro several times before being placed in the final
                    position· for which the reading was taken. In order to measure the permanent
                    magnetism the core was removed, the current broken, the core returned to its
                    former position, and a reading again taken. The conclusions arrived at were as
                    follows.</p>
                <p>I. When a steel or iron bar is magnetized for'the first time by a current C, the
                    temporary moment K produced during the action of the current at first increases
                    faster than the current, then more slowly, and finally tends to a maximum, as
                    shown by Joule and Müller. The period of quicker increase is more marked in long
                    than in short bars; it shows itself even on remagnetizing bars that have been
                    several times magnetized and demagnetized. As C increases, the maximum of K is
                    reached sooner in thin and long bars than in short and thick bars. Between the
                    period of increase of K/C and its period of decrease there is no period of any
                    considerable length for which it is constant. This last fact may be shown by
                    means of the experiment of Koosen described above; viz., if the compensation be
                    made for very small currents, when the current is increased, at first the
                    electromagnet prevails, and the needle goes to one side of zero, then the
                    current in the coil prevails, and the needle returns towards zero, and finally
                    deviates on the other side.</p>
                <p>The point at which the ratio K/C has its maximum for any particular electromagnet
                    is called by Wiedemann the “turning point” (Wendepunkt). The turning point
                    relates to the body as a whole, and the value of the external magnetizing force
                    ∣p <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> for which it occurs depends both on the form of
                    the body and on the nature of the metal. It has therefore no very definite
                    physical meaning. It must be carefully distinguished from the “saturation
                    point.” Any element of a body is said to be magnetized to saturation when no
                    increase of the magnetic force can increase its magnetization any farther. It
                    may happen, however, that some parts of a body are magnetized to saturation
                    while others are not. With regard to the turning point, Dub<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Pogg. Ann.,</hi>
                    1868.</p></note> has shown that with similar and similarly wound cores the
                    turning point occurs for the same value of the current. This is of course in
                    agreement with an obvious corollary of the general theory of magnetic
                    induction.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Thomson,
                    quoted by Joule, <hi rend="italic">Phil. Trans.,</hi> vol. cxlvi.,

                    magnetized bar the permanent moment which remains after the action of the
                    current has ceased at first increases quicker than the producing current; but
                    for stronger currents a turning point is reached; and then the moment increases
                    more slowly than the current, and approaches a maximum.</p>
                <p>III. In attempting to destroy the permanent magnetism of a bar by means of a
                    demagnetizing current, it may happen that a current, which, during its action,
                    already <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n271/mode/1up"

                    sign, still leaves on ceasing to act a permanent magnetic moment of the same
                    sign as before, although less in amount.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See Poggendorff, <hi rend="italic">Pοgg. Ann.,</hi>
                    1852.</p></note> On increasing the demagnetizing current still farther the
                    permanent moment is at last destroyed. In this process the permanent magnetism
                    decreases faster than the demagnetizing current increases,—so that <hi
                    rend="italic">the current required to destroy a given permanent magnetism is
                    less than the current that originally produced it.</hi><note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This result had also been arrived at by

                <p>IV. When a fresh bar has been magnetized with any permanent moment, and then
                    demagnetized by a current</p>
                <p>- C', opposite to the magnetizing current C, a second application of - C', or of
                    any <hi rend="italic">weaker</hi> current in the same direction, will not
                    produce a reverse <hi rend="italic">permanent</hi> moment, although a current C'
                    in the same direction as C <hi rend="italic">will</hi> magnetize the bar
                    permanently in the original direction more or less strongly. It follows
                    therefore that demagnetizing by an opposite magnetic force, although it may
                    destroy the permanent magnetism of a body, does not render it magnetically
                    indifferent, as heating to a white heat would do. The body remains in fact more
                    easily magnetizable in one direction than in another.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Similar conclusions were arrived at by
                    Ritchie, <hi rend="italic">PhU. Mag.,</hi> 1833; Jacobi, <hi rend="italic">Pοgg.
                    Ann.,</hi> 1834; Marianini, <hi rend="italic">Ann. Chirn.</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p>V. In certain cases a fresh bar was magnetized by a current C, and then partly
                    demagnetized; it was then found that a current C was required to bring it back
                    to its original permanent moment.</p>
                <p>VI. In another case a fresh bar was magnetized by a current C to permanent moment
                    K, then reduced by a demagnetizing current C' to permanent moment K', then by a
                    direct current C" less than C brought to permanent moment K". It was then found
                    that a current C' was necessary to bring it back to permanent moment K'; and
                    this held whether K' was positive, zero, or negative.</p>
                <p>VII. When a bar is repeatedly magnetized and demagnetized by currents of the same
                    intensity, the permanent magnetic moments corresponding to a given force become,
                    to begin with, a little greater than at first; to begin with, they increase
                    faster than the magnetizing force, though not so fast as at the first. The
                    turning point, however, occurs for a weaker current than before. The
                    magnetization obtained with the strongest current gradually decreases a little.
                    The moments left by the demagnetizing current decrease less rapidly than before,
                    so that a current at first capable of demagnetizing the bar altogether leaves
                    after repeated magnetization and demagnetization a slowly increasing residual
                    moment. After a large number of repetitions of the operation of magnetization by
                    a current C and demagnetization by a current</p>
                <p>— C', the bar finally reaches a constant state, so that each magnetization and
                    demagnetization leaves a corresponding invariable permanent moment. When we pass
                    beyond the limits C and - C', these phenomena are repeated in the same order as
                    before.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>On the same
                    subject see Joule, <hi rend="italic">Phil. Trans.,</hi> 1856; also Von
                    Waltenhofen, <hi rend="italic">Pοgg. Ann.,</hi> 1864.</p></note></p>
                <p>VIII. All the above phenomena are most clearly seen in hard steel, less clearly
                    in soft steel and iron. For small magnetizing forces the temporary moment in
                    hard steel is less than in soft steel, and greatest of all in soft iron. The
                    general rule is, the harder the material the less the temporary and the greater
                    the permanent moment for a given magnetizing force.</p>
                <p>IX. If, however, we consider the ratios of the temporary moments in soft steel
                    and iron to the temporary moment in hard steel, all for the same force, then
                    these ratios decrease gradually as the force increases: so that the tem porary
                    moment in soft iron reaches its maximum sooner than in soft steel, and still
                    sooner than in hard steel.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    long and <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 36 cm. thick, was placed inside a spiral
                    so long that the magnetizing force throughout the length of the bar could be
                    assumed to be uniform. The moment of the bar was measured by the method of
                    deflexion, the action of the spiral on the deflected magnet being compensated by
                    means of a part of its own circuit suitably arranged. The intensity of the
                    current, in the spiral was found in absolute measure by means of a tangent
                    galvanometer. Assuming that the bar could be replaced by a very elongated
                    ellipsoid, Kirchhoff calculated by means of the theory explained above (p. 249)
                    the values of <hi rend="italic">κ</hi> for values of g) ranging from 29 ’ 6 to
                    248 ’ 4 (C.G.S. units), and found that it decreased steadily from 25Ό to 5 ’ 6.
                    In the experiments of Von Quintus Icilius<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    possible to the form of ellipsoids of revolution. The magnetic moments were
                    measured partly by the deflexion method, partly by the method of electromagnetic
                    induction. In this last method a secondary spiral is placed upon the magnetizing
                    spiral, and the induced current in it, caused by reversing the magnetizing
                    current, is observed first when the ellipsoid is in the magnetizing spiral,
                    secondly when it is not. When these currents are known in absolute measure, the
                    moment of the ellipsoid can be calculated. The experimenter did not himself
                    reduce his results so as to obtain κ, but contented himself with remarking that

                    magnetizing forces. Long bars were placed in the axis of a cylindrical coil
                    considerably exceeding them in length. This coil was caused to rotate 180° about
                    a horizontal-axis, so that the magnetization induced by the earth’s vertical
                    force was reversed relatively to the coil. The current thus caused was meaured
                    by means of the swing of a galvanometer in circuit with the coil; from this (see
                    above, p. 240) the moment of the induced magnetism was calculated; and thence,
                    assuming the bar to be replaceable by an ellipsoid, <hi rend="italic">κ</hi> was
                    calculated. From three bars of the same metal each 400 ’ 4 mm. long, having

                    seven in number, were all cut from tl⅛e same piece of soft iron, but varied in
                    volume and in eccentricity. The resulting values of <hi rend="italic">κ</hi>
                    were found to be independent of the volume of the ellipsoids and of the part of

                    exception, they increased with the eccentricity of the ellipsoids. Kohlrausch,

                    >η</hi> ( = 800) windings; over this, in one or more shorter or longer
                    stretches, was wound a secondary coil of n'( = 50 to 750) windings. The

                    measured. If E be the electromotive force of this current, then (see above, p.

                    conclusions drawn from the results of Von Quintus Icilius and Riecke. The

                <p>About the same time as Stoletow, and independently, Rowland<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Phil. Mαg.,</hi> 1873,
                    1874.</p></note> made a much more extensive series of experiments, the results
                    of which form one of the most important contributions yet made to our knowledge
                    of magnetic induction. The experiments were made partly on very long bars; but
                    the published results were mostly obtained from rings, it having been found that
                    the effect of the ends of the bar was sensible even when the length was as much
                    as 144 times the diameter. About a dozen rings of iron, nickel, and cobalt were
                    used; the section was circular in all cases; and a primary and a secondary coil
                    were used as in Stoletow’s experiments. The primary current was measured by
                    means of a tangent galvanometer in which 1, 3, 9, 27, or 48 coils could be
                    brought into operation according to the sensibility required. The induction
                    current in the secondary was measured by the swing of a Thomson’s galvanometer
                    fitted with a heavier needle than usual. The indications of this last were
                    reduced to absolute measure by taking the swing caused by turning over a
                    horizontal coil of known area, inserted in its circuit, so as to produce the
                    full induction current due to the earth’s vertical force. In order to obtain the
                    total induced magnetization the primary current was reversed. To obtain the
                    permanent magnetism it was simply broken; this gives the part of the induced
                    magnetism that disappears with the inducing force (temporary magnetism Rowland
                    calls it); subtracting this from the total magnetization, we get the permanent
                    magnetization. Care was taken in these experiments always to work with
                    magnetizing forces of ascending magnitude, as it was found that the effect of
                    any force is considerably modified if a greater force has previously acted on
                    the body,—in other words, that the magnetic permeability of iron or steel is
                    much affected by pre-existing permanent magnetism. This fact raises an objection
                    to the ring method; for permanent magnetization in a ring is not easily
                    discoverable, and would give it a one-sidedness, so that a magnetizing force
                    would produce much more alteration when exerted in one direction than it would
                    when exerted in the other.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    satisfactory than those for iron and nickel, for a variety of reasons which he
                    assigns.</p>
                <p>In treating his results graphically, two methods are followed. In the first the
                    magnetic induction ∣J is plotted against the magnetizing force ∣) as abscissa.
                    Figure 34 shows the curve obtained in this way from one of his tables. In the
                    second method (1) the permeability ∏r is plotted against the magnetic induction
                    or (2) the susceptibility <hi rend="italic">κ</hi> is plotted against the
                    intensity of magnetization $. Either variety of the second method leads to a
                    curve having the general form shown in figures 35 and 36.</p>
                <p>The curves obtained, whether for ≡∙ and or for <hi rend="italic">κ</hi> and $,
                    fall very rapidly* and ultimately to all appearance almost straight, towards the
                    axis of or $. This suggests that or $ or both reach a maximum when ∣) is
                    increased indefinitely. Supposing such an increase of ∣) possible, the question
                    arises as to which it is that actually reaches a maximum. Most experimenters
                    seem to assume that $ does so, but it must be remarked that this is simply an
                    assumption.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>All the more

                    of great physical interest might be discussed here, but it will be sufficient to

                <p>The general conclusions to be drawn from these experiments are as follows :—</p>
                <p>1. The magnetic properties of iron, nickel, and cobalt at ordinary temperatures
                    differ in degree but not in quality.</p>
                <p>2. As the magnetizing force ∣j increases from 0 upwards, the permeability of
                    iron, nickel, and cobalt increases until it reaches a maximum, and. after that
                    diminishes down to a very small value. The maximum value<note anchored="true"

                <p>4. If a metal is permanently magnetized, its permeability is less for low
                    magnetizing forces, but is unaltered for high magnetizing forces. This applies
                    to the permanent state finally attained after several reversals of the
                    magnetizing force; but if we strongly magnetize a bar in one direction, and
                    apply a weak magnetizing force in the opposite direction, the change of
                    magnetization will be very great.</p>
                <p>5. Iron, nickel, and cobalt all probably have a maximum of magnetization,
                    although its existence can never be entirely established by experiment, and must
                    always be a matter of inference. If such a maximum exists, then at ordinary
                    temperatures it will be roughly as follows :—</p>

                <p>6. The permeability of any metal depends on the quality of the metal, on the
                    amount of permanent magnetization, on the total magnetization, and on the
                    temperature.</p>
                <p>7. The permeability of nickel and cobalt varies very much with temperature. In
                    nickel for a moderate amount of magnetization the permeability increases with
                    rise of temperature, but for high magnetization it decreases. This is very well
                    shown in fig. 36, where the permeability curves for 15° C. and 220° C. intersect
                    each other. In cobalt, on the other hand, the permeability appears to be always
                    increased. The permeability of iron is not much affected by moderate changes of
                    temperature.</p>
                <p>8. The maximum of magnetization of iron and nickel decreases with rise of
                    temperature, at least between 10° C. and 220° C., the first very slowly, the
                    second very rapidly. At 220° C. the maximum for iron is $ = 17200 or ∣ = 1360,
                    and for nickel $ = 4900 or ∣ = 380.</p>
                <p>The researches of Stoletow and Rowland have undoubtedly made clear the main
                    phenomena of magnetic induction; but in so doing they have raised a host of
                    other questions which have not as yet been settled. There is no lack of recent
                    work bearing on them, but it would be a difficult matter to give succinctly a
                    complete account of the conclusions arrived at. The results of the different
                    experimenters are not seldom contradictory, and the circumstances of experiment
                    are often so complicated that criticism with the view of reconciling them seems
                    hopeless in the meantime. While, therefore, we shall give a fairly complete list
                    of the literature, the reader must not expect in this article an exhaustive
                    analysis of the different memoirs that have recently appeared. Any remarks we
                    shall make have chiefly for their object to call attention to the prominent
                    questions that have been raised by the different workers.</p>

                    forces. The results, although wanting in regularity and smoothness for the
                    harder kinds of steel, agree in the main with those of Stoletow and Rowland.
                    Holz enters largely in this and in a former paper<note anchored="true"

                <p>Green for the magnetic distribution in thin needles and cylindrical bars of
                    steel. Two points as to his methods are worthy of notice. He employs a very
                    simple method of measuring the magnetic moment of small pieces of steel: a small
                    needle of moment <hi rend="italic">m</hi> attached to a stiff stem, which
                    carries a mirror, is freely suspended and allowed to come to rest in the
                    magnetic meridian; the needle whose moment <hi rend="italic">x</hi> is to be
                    measured is then inserted into a tube fixed to the stem with its axis at right
                    angles to the former needle. The deviation α of the compound system being
                    measured by means of the mirror, we have <hi rend="italic">x = m</hi> tana. He
                    studies the magnetic distribution in very thin hard needles by the method of
                    rupture, finding that, if the needle be carefully broken, so that the distortion
                    or shock caused by the bending does not extend far from the point of rupture,
                    the magnetic moment of the different parts is little, if at all, affected. For
                    thicker magnets he uses the ordinary method of deflexion.</p>

                    remagnetized bars by the superposition of long and short distributions. His
                    final conclusionis that there is a greater independence between permanent and
                    temporary magnetism than is usually admitted; and he starts a theory that
                    magnetic bodies are composed of a mixture of two kinds of magnetic molecules,
                    one kind retaining all the induced magnetism, the other wholly devoid of
                    coercive force.</p>
                <p>It is obvious, from the results of Wiedemann, Frankenheim, and Bouty just alluded
                    to, that the assumption made in the mathematical theory, that the effect of a
                    magnetizing force is independent of the previous magnetic history of the body,
                    is not even a first approximation to the actual truth. It becomes a matter of
                    importance therefore to study the modification in the induced magnetism
                    corresponding to any force produced by the forces that have preceded it. This
                    effect has been called by German experimenters the <hi rend="italic">magnetic
                    after-effect</hi> (Magnetische Nachwirkung). Fromme and Auerbach have recently
                    occupied themselves with this subject, and it may be of some interest to the
                    reader to indicate a few of their conclusions.</p>
                <p>In his first paper<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Pogg. Ann.,</hi> Ergbd. vii., 1875.</p></note> Fromme experiments
                    with rotational ellipsoids of soft steel, using partly the method of Weber,
                    Thalén, and Riecke, partly the ordinary method of deflexion. He found, in the
                    first place, that the generalized theory of magnetic induction was applicable
                    for values of ∣j varying from Ό061 to ’ 132, <hi rend="italic">κ</hi> decreasing
                    between these limits from 23’5 to 8 ’ 68. He attempted to find the maximum force
                    for which permanent magnetism first appears, and fixes it with some reserve at
                    from *2 to ’ 3.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>So far
                    confirming Maxwell’s conclusions from his modification of Weber’s theory of
                    molecular magnets, <hi rend="italic">El. and Mag.,</hi> vol. ii. §
                    445.</p></note> The curve which he indicates for the temporary magnetization of
                    soft steel has two points of inflexion, being first concave to the axis of ∣j,
                    then convex, and finally concave again.</p>
                <p>He confirms the observation of Frankenheim that repeated applications of the
                    magnetizing force increase the permanent magnetization up to a certain limit,
                    and finds that when that limit is reached the body behaves towards all smaller
                    forces having the same direction as if it were devoid of coercive force.
                    Experimenting on ellipsoids permanently magnetized in this way, he found the
                    mathematical theory of Kirchhoff to be inapplicable, it being impossible to fit
                    the results obtained with the different ellipsoids together; and the discrepancy
                    was greater with the softer than with the harder steel. For forces that are not
                    sufficient to alter the permanent magnetization, <hi rend="italic">κ</hi>
                    decreases with decreasing force, as is the case with soft iron, so long at all
                    events as the forces are not very great; and, again, for such forces the
                    variation of <hi rend="italic">κ</hi> is more regular the greater the permanent
                    magnetization.</p>
                <p>The number of impulses required to saturate with permanent magnetism was greater
                    the greater the ratio of the moment of saturation to the initial moment, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> greater for hard than for soft steel. It was found, in
                    extension of a result of Frankenheim’s, that, if U be the original moment, R <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> that produced by one and R that produced by an infinite
                    number of impulses of the magnetizing force, then (U + Rj)∕(U + R) is tolerably
                    constant; but R <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> ∕R decreases with increasing
                    magnetizing force.</p>
                <p>With reference to the non-permanent magnetism of a bar repeatedly magnetized by
                    the same constant current, he concludes from his researches that it diminishes,
                    but in such a way that the total induced magnetism remains constant,—so that
                    what is lost in non-permanent is gained in permanent magnetism.</p>
                <p>In his second paper<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Wied Ann.,</hi> iv., 1878.</p></note> Fromme experimented both
                    with iron and with steel cylinders, pointed at the end, of lengths varying from
                    140 to 220 mm., and of thicknesses from 1 ’ 5 to 8 mm. The method of deflexion
                    was used, the effect of the magnetizing spiral itself being compensated by an
                    auxiliary spiral suitably placed. The cores were carefully introduced into the
                    spiral after the current was established, removed before it was broken, and then
                    replaced when the permanent magnetism was determined.</p>
                <p>In the following extract from his conclusions T <hi rend="subscript"> n</hi>
                    denotes the total induced magnetization, R <hi rend="subscript"> n</hi> the
                    whole residual or permanent magnetization, V„ the non-permanent or vanishing
                    magnetization, after <hi rend="italic">n</hi> impulses of a given magnetizing
                    force, the suffix being dropped when the number of impulses is not in question,
                    and replaced by ∞ when the number is so great that by further increasing it no
                    alteration in the effect is produced.</p>
                <p>A constant force greater than all preceding induces a T which varies with
                    successive impulses, sometimes increasing, sometimes decreasing. If a bar
                    previously heated white hot be subjected to a large force, successive impulses
                    usually give a decrease of T. If, however, the force is preceded by one somewhat
                    smaller, successive impulses usually give an increase. It depends merely on the
                    magnitude and the number of impulses of the preceding force P whether the
                    repeated impulses of a force <hi rend="italic">p</hi> will give an increasing or
                    a decreasing T.</p>
                <p>R always increases with successive impulses until the limit is reached, and
                    always faster than T; hence increase of R and decrease of V go hand in hand; the
                    magnitude of this increase depends on P and <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> and
                    approaches zero with P- <hi rend="subscript"> j</hi> o.</p>
                <p>In order that the action of a force <hi rend="italic">p</hi> may not be
                    influenced by the after-effect of smaller forces preceding it, it must be
                    applied so often that its further application ceases to increase R. When
                    saturation for R is thus reached, then T, R, and V have the values corresponding
                    to frequent impulses of <hi rend="italic">p</hi> for a fresh bar.</p>

                    by the increase Of R; so that it would appear that the after-effect of a
                    preceding force P depends on the R which it produces. It would therefore be more
                    correct to say that the after-effect depends on <hi rend="italic">r</hi>-- R
                    than to say that it depends on <hi rend="italic">p</hi>- P.</p>
                <p>When a bar has been magnetized by any force P, all <hi rend="italic">smaller</hi>
                    succeeding forces leave R unaltered, yet by repeated impulses of <hi
                    rend="italic">p</hi> (&lt;P) T decreases until it reaches a certain limit. We
                    may repeat the process as often as we please by always beginning with a new
                    application of a larger force P; if we vary P, keeping <hi rend="italic">p</hi>
                    constant, T <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, T <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>,
                    &amp;c., vary, but the limit T <hi rend="subscript"> 00</hi> is always the same.
                    In these experiments it was indifferent whether a few seconds or several hours
                    elapsed between the applications of P and <hi rend="italic">p;</hi> time had no
                    influence on the vanishing of this species of magnetic after-effect. On the
                    other hand, several impulses of the greater force gave no more after-effect than
                    a single impulse, of whatever duration. If N denote the after-effect of a
                    greater force P upon the action of a smaller <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> the law

                    was much the same as that of Fromme, except that the core was left in the
                    magnetizing spiral during the make and break of the current. The core was
                    generally a hollow cylinder of soft iron 1484 mm. long, 17*8 mm. in diameter, 1
                    ’ G mm. thick, with end plates 1 ’ 5 mm. thick. He distinguishes two kinds of
                    magnetic after-effect. The first kind consists in alteration of the
                    magnetization of the body during the action of a constant force, or after it has
                    ceased to act. The second kind is that already mentioned, in which the action of
                    any force is influenced by preceding forces. It is this second kind of
                    after-effect that is dealt with in the paper from which we are quoting.</p>
                <p>The leading peculiarity of his view of the phenomenon is the introduction of the
                    force <hi rend="italic">zero,</hi> both as a preceding and as a final force. The
                    fundamental principle laid down is the following :—</p>
                <p>When the force <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> which, following immediately after the
                    force 0, would produce a magnetization T <hi rend="subscript"> o</hi>, is
                    preceded by a series of forces P <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, P <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. . . .P <hi rend="subscript"> n</hi>, the magnetization
                    which results is T, differing from T <hi rend="subscript"> o</hi> by an amount N
                    called the after-effect. N is wholly determined by the first of the preceding
                    forces P <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, which is such that all the forces that
                    act between P <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> and <hi rend="italic">p</hi> lie in
                    magnitude between P <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >p.</hi></p>
                <p>This general law is, however, subject to exceptions. For example, let the whole
                    series of forces acting be P <hi rend="subscript"> 10</hi>, <hi rend="italic"
                    >ρ,</hi> P <hi rend="subscript"> 9</hi>, <hi rend="italic">ρ</hi> (evidently an
                    extreme case), then experience shows that neither T <hi rend="subscript">
                    10</hi> nor T <hi rend="subscript"> 9</hi> is the resulting magnetization, but
                    something intermediate, much nearer to T <hi rend="subscript"> 10</hi>, however,
                    than to T <hi rend="subscript"> 9</hi>. In order to obtain T <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 9</hi> a force P <hi rend="subscript"> o</hi> &lt;∕&gt; must
                    be interposed before P <hi rend="subscript"> 9</hi>; even then the magnetization
                    varies a little with P <hi rend="subscript"> o</hi>, but, if the stationary
                    condition for P <hi rend="subscript"> 9</hi>, <hi rend="italic">p</hi> be
                    established by alternating P <hi rend="subscript"> 9</hi>, <hi rend="italic"
                    >p</hi> many times after applying P <hi rend="subscript"> o</hi>, thus P <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 10</hi>, <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> P <hi rend="subscript">
                    o</hi>, P <hi rend="subscript"> 9</hi>, <hi rend="italic">P,</hi> P <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 9</hi>, <hi rend="italic">P,</hi> P <hi rend="subscript">
                    9</hi>, <hi rend="italic">P,</hi> · the limit is found to be independent of P
                    <hi rend="subscript"> o</hi>, and is held to be the true value of T <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 8</hi> ∙</p>
                <p>In this way, for a given <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> T can be determined as a
                    function of P. It is necessary, however, to attend to the following
                    principle,—that, of two preceding forces lying in magnitude on different sides
                    of <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> the second determines the after-effect exclusively
                    only when it differs more from <hi rend="italic">P</hi> than the first; in other
                    cases both contribute to the aftereffect; in no case does the first exclusively
                    determine the after-effect. In the case where both preceding forces lie on the
                    same side of <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> the exceptions to the general law are far
                    less marked; only where the second force is very nearly equal to <hi
                    rend="italic">p</hi> does it exercise a disturbing influence on the after-effect
                    of the first.</p>
                <p>The process used for obtaining T as a function of P, for a given <hi
                    rend="italic">p,</hi> say 10, is therefore to cause the influencing forces to
                    alternate with the influenced, the succession of the former being such that the
                    one preceding <hi rend="italic">p</hi> always differs less from <hi
                    rend="italic">p</hi> than the one following. The stationary condition is
                    supposed to be established for each pair as above explained; <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> starting with P=11, the series might be 11, 10, 8, 10, 13, 10, 6,
                    10, 15, 10, 4, 10, &amp;c. In this way T <hi rend="subscript"> 11</hi>, T <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 8</hi>, T <hi rend="subscript"> 13</hi>, &lt;fcc., can be
                    determined.</p>
                <p>When the values of T are plotted against the values of P, the curves
                    corresponding to different values of <hi rend="italic">p</hi> have all a similar
                    character (see figure 37). They consist of two congruent parts lying on the two
                    sides of a point of inflexion, which is the only point that has any marked
                    character. To the right of the inflexion the concavity is towards the axis <hi
                    rend="subscript"> a</hi> of P, to the left in the opposite direction. The
                    infinite branches appear to approach asymptotes parallel to the axis of P. The
                    abscissa oi the point of inflexion for any particular curve <hi rend="italic"
                    >p</hi> is P <hi rend="italic">—p;</hi> the ordinate is T <hi rend="subscript">
                    p</hi>, which may be called the normal magnetization corresponding to <hi
                    rend="italic">p</hi> when <hi rend="italic">p</hi> alone has acted before. This
                    of course is an ideal case; but a process is indicated for determining T <hi
                    rend="subscript"> p</hi> directly.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>A particular case of this process is interesting and
                    practically important; viz., in order to demagnetize a core (i.e., to find Tθ)
                    possessing a moment T. Apply in succession the forces - P, + (P - *), -(P-2e),
                    +(P-3e), &amp;c., down to 0, P being chosen of sufficient magnitude, rather too
                    great than too small (the smaller c the better).</p></note> The dotted curve in
                    the figure is the curve of normal magnetization, whose abscissa and ordinate are
                    <hi rend="italic">p</hi> and T <hi rend="subscript"> p</hi>.</p>
                <p>From the symmetry of the curves representing the aftereffect Auerbach concludes
                    that the after-effect of forces on opposite sides of <hi rend="italic">p</hi> as
                    to magnitude, and equidifferent from it, is equal and opposite, and ascribes the
                    failure to observe the after-effect of forces smaller than <hi rend="italic"
                    >p</hi> to the interposition of the force zero. He further concludes that the
                    after-effect depends in the same way on <hi rend="italic">P -p</hi> as T <hi
                    rend="subscript"> p</hi> depends on <hi rend="italic">p.</hi></p>
                <p>There is one of the curves of after-effect, that, viz., for <hi rend="italic">p —

                    in Auerbach’s view a particular case of after-effect. To it we can apply the
                    general rule given above, subject of course to like exceptions.</p>
                <p>It would be premature to pronounce any opinion as to the ultimate value of
                    Auerbach’s results; but the elegance of his representation of the phenomena will
                    scarcely be disputed. In the latter part of his paper he applies his views to
                    explain the peculiarities in the curve of magnetization with forces of ascending
                    magnitude obtained when the after-effect is neglected, and to the cyclical

                    influence of the duration of the impulse of the magnetizing force and of the
                    sudden closing and opening of the current. His conclusions agree in the main
                    with those of Fromme: in particular he inclines to Fromme’s view<note

                    cases by the breaking of the current while the core is in the spiral. This
                    effect in certain cases (with short thick cores) is so great that a permanent
                    magnetization of opposite sign to the total induced magnetism remains.<note

                    general result, of which this is an extreme case, viz., that the residual
                    magnetism of the core depends upon the rapidity with which the magnetizing force
                    is reduced to zero. Auerbach lays down as a general principle that when the
                    variation of the magnetizing force is slow and continuous the velocity of the
                    transition does not influence the final magnetization; but sudden transition
                    causes the final magnetization to be less or greater than that obtained by
                    gradual transition, according as the passage is from a greater to a less or from
                    a less to a greater force.</p>

                    >Comptes Rendus,</hi> passim.</p></note> who holds what he apparently regards as
                    a new theory of magnetization. It is in point of fact merely a modification of
                    the theory of solenoids, somewhat restricted in its application to the phenomena
                    of magnetic induction. His special point is that the lines of magnetization in a
                    bar magnetized (say) by a magnetizing spiral only penetrate to a limited depth,
                    which is greater the greater the current. The following experiments<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Comptes
                    Rendus,</hi> lxxx., 1875.</p></note> are adduced in confirmation of his views.
                    The steel tube of a Chassepot rifle was plugged at both ends by screwing into it
                    bolts of the same metal. Inside was placed a cylindrical rod. It was found that,
                    so long as the current in the spiral was not very great, the rod was not
                    sensibly magnetized; but, as the current increased, it became more and more
                    affected, and by and by was as much permanently magnetized as if the enveloping
                    tube had been absent. Again, the rod having been magnetized to saturation and
                    inserted in the tube, a demagnetizing force was applied to the whole, and it was
                    found possible to render the tube and core together seemingly neutral, or even
                    oppositely magnetic, while the rod when taken out proved to be still powerfully
                    magnetized in the original direction. Again, a bar was magnetized by a powerful
                    current, and then magnetized in tho opposite direction by another current. The
                    surface of the bar was then eaten away to a certain depth; and it was found that
                    the original magnetization reappeared. These experiments, although most
                    interesting in themselves, do not appear to warrant the interpretation which
                    their author puts upon them. Jamin has made extensive researches on the magnetic
                    distribution in bars and ribbons of steel, partly with a view to obtain
                    empirical rules for the construction of powerful permanent magnets, in which he
                    has been very successful.</p>

                    have not as a rule acquired a command over the delicate manipulation of the
                    forging and tempering of steel, an art which those who possess it usually find
                    difficult to describe in words or reduce to rules. There is the further
                    circumstance that many who have been successful in making good steel for
                    magnetic or other purposes have found it for their interest not to publish the
                    process by which success was attained.</p>
                <p>Fineness of grain and uniformity of temper are the greatest requisites in steel
                    for permanent magnets. The latter in bars of any size is never attained in
                    perfection, for the surface is always harder than the interior. The mischief
                    which thereby arises may be understood by taking the extreme case of a thin
                    steel tube magnetized to saturation, and then fitted with a perfectly soft iron
                    core. It is clear that the core will act very much like the armature of a
                    horse-shoe magnet; the lines of force will run back through it, and the external
                    action will be in a great measure destroyed.</p>
                <p>The different tempers of steel may be roughly classified as glass hard, straw
                    colour, blue, and soft. The current statement is that the harder the steel the
                    more difficult it is to magnetize, but the better it retains its magnetism. If
                    this were so, provided sufficient magnetizing force to produce saturation were
                    at command, the best temper for magnets would be glass hard. Lamont, however,
                    whose experience was great, states that he found the loss after magnetization to
                    be as great, and to continue as long, with glass hard as with blue tempered
                    magnets. The same experimenter gives it as his opinion that great differences in
                    the quality of magnets arise more from defects as to homogeneity, continuity,
                    and uniformity of temper than from the quality of the steel in other respects;
                    he inclines, however, to a preference for English cast steel.</p>
                <p>Purity and homogeneity of structure are equally necessary in iron of high
                    magnetic inductive susceptibility and small coercive force. Hammering, rolling,
                    and drawing diminish the susceptibility and increase the coercive force. Rolling
                    does so more in the direction of rolling than transversely, so that the iron
                    becomes aeolotropic. It is advisable in all cases where high susceptibility is

                    in a wood fire and allowing it to cool very gradually; this process is still

                    finely divided iron was made by Coulomb, who mixed iron filings with wax, and
                    found that the magnetic moment was proportional to the mass of magnetic metal.
                    Similar experiments were made by the elder Becquerel,<note anchored="true"

                    moment was proportional to the weight of magnetic substance, so long as the
                    filings were not too densely distributed; with increasing density the mixture
                    acquires magnetic properties more like those of a continuous metallic mass.
                    Several modern experimenters have gone into the matter with considerable care;
                    but their results are not sufficiently concordant, or of sufficient general
                    interest, to justify us in dwelling at length upon them here. A few references

                <p>Using a fine scratch on a varnished silver wire as electrode, Beez deposited a
                    thread of iron between the poles of an electromagnet, and thus obtained a
                    permanent magnet of extreme tenuity. It was found that the inductive
                    susceptibility of this linear magnet was very small, and that considerable
                    magnetizing force produced no increase of its permanent magnetism. Thus in one
                    case the original magnetism was 360, the total magnetism under the inducing
                    force 370, the magnetism remaining after the force ceased to act 360. Broader,
                    but equally thin, magnets deposited in a strong field in the same way gave more
                    temporary magnetism than the linear magnets, but never more permanent magnetism
                    than they possessed originally. Thicker plates exhibited greater temporary
                    magnetism, and also an increase of the permanent magnetism acquired during
                    deposition. With continued reversals of the magnetizing force electrolytic iron
                    gave a continual decrease of the temporary magnetism down to a certain limit (as
                    does steel); but the negative permanent magnetism never approaches so near the
                    positive after many reversals as in the case of steel. On the other hand, Jacobi
                    found that iron reduced electrolytically from ferrous sulphate and sulphate of
                    magnesia, even after· tempering, took a considerable temporary moment, but
                    retained very little permanent magnetisfm Holz found that the iron reduced from
                    the solution of Jacobi and Klein was not sensibly hardened by heating and
                    suddenly cooling, although its density was increased, and that its coercive
                    force was diminished. On the other hand, it was found that hard tempering
                    decreased the density of steel. He draws the conclusion that the coercive force
                    is greater the farther apart the molecules. Baur’s main result is that the
                    maximum of magnetization with electrolytic iron occurs for much larger forces
                    than with ordinary iron. These results are not wholly concordant; but the
                    discrepancies may be reasonably assigned to differences in the preparation of
                    the metal.</p>

                    repulsion of neutral bodies was rediscovered by Faraday in 1845. He speedily
                    unravelled the laws of the phenomenon, showing how much depends on the nature of
                    the body, and how much upon the nature of the magnetic field. His observations
                    enabled him in fact to comprehend under a few general principles the action of
                    all magnetic bodies whether of the nature of iron or of the nature of bismuth.
                    The earlier observers had fallen into difficulties by neglecting the effects due
                    to heterogeneity of field; these were pointed out for the first time by Faraday,
                    and since then order reigns where there was formerly confusion.</p>
                <p>The best arrangement for testing the behaviour of weakly magnetic bodies is to
                    suspend either a small sphere of the substance or else a small cylinder in a
                    heterogeneous magnetic field. This field is usually produced by placing two
                    pointed soft iron poles (fig. 38) on the arms of a powerful electromagnet. The
                    line joining these poles is called the <hi rend="italic">axial</hi> direction of
                    the field; directions perpendicular to this line are called <hi rend="italic"
                    >equatorial.</hi> The magnetic force varies along the axial line, being less in
                    the middle than at the poles; and it decreases everywhere from the axial line
                    outwards. For some purposes poles of the shape shown in figure 39 are used; here
                    the line along the upper edges of the poles are lines of greatest force, whereas
                    the line in the plane of the upper faces equidistant from the upper edges is a
                    line of weakest force; the force also decreases to the right of <hi

                <p>In suspending small spheres the best plan is to hang them from one end of an arm
                    of wood <hi rend="italic">db</hi> (fig. 40). At the other end of this arm is
                    placed a counterpoise <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> and the whole is suspended by a

                    there by the exertion of a known torsional couple. The arm and suspension must
                    be carefully guarded from draughts by enclosing it in a glass case, which fits
                    over the poles of the electromagnet, and is provided with a door and with means
                    for bringing the torsion head <hi rend="italic">t</hi> over any given part of
                    the magnetic field. When a cylindrical piece is to be tested it is suspended
                    from the fibre %soas to hang horizontally. For this purpose Faraday was in the
                    habit of using a stirrup of carefully selected writing paper attached to the
                    lower end of the fibre. It is of the utmost importance to guard against magnetic
                    action on the suspension · the least trace of iron in the arm <hi rend="italic"
                    >db</hi> for instance, or in the paper stirrup, would in many cases be more than
                    sufficient to mask the action proper to a weakly magnetic body.</p>
                <p>In every experiment the magnetic behaviour of the support should be tested by
                    itself beforehand, so that if any residual effect be present it may be allowed
                    for. The greatest caution is also requisite in choosing the material to be
                    experimented upon. There must be no chemical impurity, especially no trace of
                    iron; the spheres and cylinders must not be worked with iron tools or even with
                    dirty hands. A source of error<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    with metals, or other good conductors, is the action arising from induced
                    currents in the mass of the tested body caused by the increase and decrease of
                    the strength of the magnetic field when the circuit of the electromagnet is made
                    and broken. This error is wholly avoided by waiting till the suspended body has
                    come to rest, and attending only to deflexions which are permanent after the
                    intensity of the field has become steady.</p>
                <p>The first substance with which Faraday experimented was a bar of the heavy glass
                    with which he had discovered the rotation of the plane of polarization of light.
                    It took up the equatorial position between the poles of the electromagnet as
                    soon as the current was established. There was no distinction between its ends,
                    or according to the direction of the lines of force; the bar always took the
                    shortest course to the equatorial position, and remained there in stable
                    equilibrium. When placed in the axial position it was in unstable equilibrium,
                    and on the slightest displacement either way it moved off in that direction to
                    the equatorial position. A further action was observed when the bar was placed
                    with its centre of mass out of the centre of the field; it was then repelled as
                    a whole away from the nearest pole (no matter which). On testing a small cube or
                    sphere of the substance, no pointing tendency was observed, but the mass as a
                    whole when it was placed unsymmetrically with respect to the poles tended to
                    pass away from the poles towards the centre of the field, and from the axial
                    line outwards.</p>
                <p>Faraday sums up the matter by saying that every element of the heavy glass tends
                    to move from places of stronger to places of weaker resultant magnetic force.
                    This is exactly the opposite of the law for bodies like iron (see mathematical
                    theory above, p. 247). All bodies that follow the same law as heavy glass he
                    calls <hi rend="italic">diamagnetics,</hi> all that follow the opposite law,
                    like iron, <hi rend="italic">paramagnetics.</hi> For the purposes of
                    experimental demonstration it is better to take some weaker paramagnetic than
                    iron, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> a tube filled with a solution of ferric
                    chloride; for the order of magnitude of the effect obtained is then the same as
                    with diamagnetics, and there is no danger of complications arising from the
                    mutual action of the particles of the substance (see above, p. 245).</p>
                <p>Faraday found the following substances to be diamagnetic; <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> pieces of them tended to set their longest dimension equatorial
                    between pointed poles, and spheres and cubes of them tended to pass from places
                    of stronger to places of weaker force :—rock crystal, sulphate of lime, sulphate
                    of baryta, sulphate of soda, sulphate of potash, sulphate of magnesia, alum,
                    muriate of ammonia, chloride of lead, chloride of sodium, nitrate of potash,
                    nitrate of lead, carbonate of soda, Iceland spar, acetate of lead, tartrate of
                    potash and antimony, tartrate of potash and soda, tartaric acid, citric acid,
                    water, alcohol, ether, nitric acid, sulphuric acid, muriatic acid, solutions of
                    various alkaline and earthy salts, glass, litharge, white arsenic, iodine,
                    phosphorus, sulphur, resin, spermaceti, caffeine, cinchonia, margaric acid, wax
                    from shellac, sealing wax, olive oil, oil of turpentine, jet, caoutchouc, sugar,
                    starch, gum arabic, wood, ivory, mutton (dried), beef (dried), blood (dried or
                    fresh), leather, apple, bread.</p>
                <p>In testing liquids Faraday used a very thin glass tube of the form shown in
                    figure 41; the opening being very fine, there was no need for a cork or other
                    stopper which might have caused disturbance; the slight diamagnetic effect
                    arising from the glass was allowed for. Another way of testing a liquid<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Plücker, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pogg. Ann.,</hi> 1848.</p></note> is to place it in the bottom of a watch glass
                    which rests on the edges of the pole of the electromagnet. When the fluid is
                    paramagnetic, it collects in the places of greater force, forming a depression
                    in the centre of the field as in figure 42; when it is diamagnetic, it collects
                    in the places of weaker force in the centre of the field, as in fig. 43. Yet
                    another method<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Quet, <hi
                    rend="italic">Comptes Rendus,</hi> 1854.</p></note> is to put a small quantity
                    of the fluid in a narrow tube, and place the tube horizontally in the equatorial
                    line so that the end of the liquid column is just on the axial line. When the
                    electromagnet is excited the liquid will be driven away from the axial line or
                    drawn in according as it is diamagnetic or paramagnetic.</p>
                <p>Faraday found that breaking a weakly magnetic body into pieces, or even reducing
                    it to powder, produced no effect upon its magnetic behaviour provided its
                    general form was unaltered. In order to avoid disturbance from <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n280/mode/1up"

                    presently, it is often advisable to reduce certain substances to powder before
                    testing them; the powder is filled into a thin glass tube and then tested like a
                    liquid. By means of powdered bismuth the tendency of a diamagnetic to pass from
                    places of stronger to places of weaker force can be very prettily shown. If the
                    powder be strewn upon the circular end of the core of an electromagnet, it will
                    leave the edges and collect in the centre, whereas iron filings will leave the
                    centre and arrange themselves round the edges, the fact being that at the edges
                    the force is much more intense than in the centre.<note anchored="true"

                    by which the material is prepared, being doubtless determined by the presence or
                    absence of slight impurities. The copper of commerce is magnetic, owing to
                    traces of iron; but when it is reduced by means of zinc from the chloride or
                    sulphate it is diamagnetic. It would appear that the paramagnetism of titanium,
                    palladium, platinum, and osmium is due to iron impurity.<note anchored="true"

                    subject. Faraday caused the gas under examination to stream vertically upwards
                    or downwards (according as it was lighter or heavier than the surrounding gas)
                    between the poles of an electromagnet, and observed how the stream was
                    deflected. In the case of colourless gases the deflexion was observed by
                    allowing small traces of hydrochloric acid to mix with the gas, and then placing
                    in different parts of the field small tubes containing pieces of filter paper
                    moistened with ammonia; by noticing in which of these the white fumes of
                    ammonium chloride were formed the course of the gaseous current could be
                    determined. Another method employed was to fix two thin glass tubes containing
                    gases to be tested to the ends of a cross piece on one end of the arm of a
                    torsion balance; the tube containing the most magnetic then moved towards the
                    axial line. Another method, employed both by Plücker and by Faraday, is to blow
                    soap bubbles with the gas to be tested, and observe their behaviour in the
                    magnetic field, allowing of course for the feeble diamagnetism of the water
                    film. Faraday’s results are as follows :—</p>

                    concluded from recent experiments of his own that the specific magnetism of
                    ozone is still greater than that of oxygen. Faraday was able by filling thin
                    glass bulbs with oxygen at different densities to show that the magnetic
                    susceptibility decreased with the density, apparently in simple proportion. Some
                    numbers giving an idea of the magnetic susceptibility of the various weakly
                    magnetic bodies are given below.</p>
                <p>In all experiments with gases or fluid media, and indeed in every possible
                    magnetic experiment more or less, it is important to notice that the resulting
                    magnetic action is the difference between the action of the movable body and the
                    action on the surrounding medium. This was first pointed out by Faraday.<note

                    than itself. In cases where the square of the <pb break="no"

                    the resultant action on any body is the difference between the action upon it
                    and the portion of the medium which it displaces. This principle, which is the
                    analogue of the Archimedean law for floating bodies, is of great use in
                    quantitative magnetic experiments. It was exemplified by Pliicker,<note

                    in magnesium chloride and in air, and in nickel sulphate and in air were very

                    collect and displace the olive oil in the places of stronger force. Another

                    consists in placing a layer of oil of violets over a layer of solution of
                    chloride of iron. When a narrow cell filled in this way is placed equatorially
                    with the interface of the two liquids in the axial line, on exciting the
                    electromagnet the iron solution rises in the equatorial plane forming a
                    disk-shaped mass around the axial line. Notwithstanding these results the
                    general opinion of experimenters seems to be that no separation of the parts of
                    a solution can be effected magnetically once the constituents have been
                    thoroughly mixed. Thus Faraday<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    “specific susceptibility,” and the product <hi rend="italic">μ</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">= Am,</hi> where A is the molecular weight of the salt, the
                    “molecular susceptibility,” then the molecular susceptibility of the dissolved
                    salt of the same metal with different acids is approximately the same. The mean
                    molecular susceptibilities for nickelous, cobaltous, ferrous, and manganous
                    salts are as 142: 313: 387: 468.</p>
                <p>3. The molecular susceptibility of cobaltous salts stands about midway between
                    the molecular susceptibilités of nickelous and manganous salts; and the ferrous
                    salts stand midway between cobaltous and manganous.</p>
                <p>4. The molecular susceptibility of dry salts (combined with water of
                    crystallization) is for the most part nearly the same as their molecular
                    susceptibility in solution.</p>
                <p>A similar law holds to a certain extent for insoluble salts freshly precipitated;
                    and generally, with like chemical properties of the metallic molecule, the
                    molecular susceptibility remains the same.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>For qualifications see Wied., <hi rend="italic">Galν.,

                <p>5. Two diamagnetic elements may give a magnetic compound; <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> copper and bromine, both diamagnetic, give bromide of copper, which
                    is paramagnetic.</p>
                <p>6. When two solutions are mixed and the salts exchange their constituents by
                    double decomposition, the specific magnetism of the solutions taken together is
                    unchanged. Whence the conclusion is drawn that the susceptibility of a binary
                    compound is made up by addition of the susceptibilities of its constituents, and
                    that these constituents preserve their susceptibilities unaltered when their
                    constitution or atomic arrangement in composition is unaltered.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Magnecrystallic Action.—</hi> In what precedes we supposed the
                    inductively magnetized body, whether paramagnetic or diamagnetic, to be
                    isotropic, and all experiments on its magnetic properties to be conducted in a
                    heterogeneous magnetic field. In a uniform field such a body would be acted upon
                    neither by force of translation nor by rotational couple. The case is otherwise
                    if the body be magnetically aeolotropic. In this case, according to the
                    mathematical theory, (1) the body ought to set in a uniform field so as to place
                    its axis of greatest magnetic permeability <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> of
                    greatest paramagnetic and of least diamagnetic susceptibility) parallel to the
                    lines of force, and (2) in a heterogeneous field Faraday’s translational force
                    from places of less to places of greater resultant force in the case of
                    paramagnetic, and from places of greater to places of less in the case of
                    diamagnetic bodies, ought to be greatest when the axis of greatest
                    susceptibility is parallel to the lines of force, least when the axis of least
                    susceptibility is in the same position, and intermediate for other positions of
                    the body.</p>
                <p>In observing the first class of phenomena above mentioned, poles with flat faces
                    are placed on the electromagnet. Faraday recommends that the faces should be
                    placed at a distance of about one-third of their breadth. He warns the
                    experimenter, however, that the uniformity with this arrangement is by no means
                    perfect, although in general sufficient. The best arrangement would be to use
                    the magnetic field in the interior of a cylindrical coil of sufficient length
                    were it not for the difficulty of attaining the requisite intensity in this way.
                    In cases where there is any doubt it is well to give the body under examination
                    a spherical or cubical shape, and so eliminate the tendency to set arising from
                    heterogeneity of field.</p>
                <p>The first observations of the magnecrystallic couple were made by Plücker,<note

                    investigations of the phenomenon were made by him in conjunction with Beer,<note

                    magnetic properties of a large number of crystalline bodies were examined.
                    Plücker also detected the magnecrystallic property in a rapidly cooled cylinder
                    of glass. Shortly after Plücker’s first results were published, Faraday
                    discovered the magnecrystallic action of crystallized bismuth. At first, misled
                    no doubt by the language in which Plücker stated the newly discovered facts, he
                    did not recognize the identity of the two phenomena; but on further
                    investigation he was able to class all the observations under a few simple
                    laws,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"

                    mathematical form given to them by Thomson constitute the theory already given.
                    To the observations of Plücker and Faraday Knoblauch and Tyndall added the
                    important discovery that bodies in which the linear density in one direction is
                    greater than in another, whether as a consequence of compression or of
                    stratification artificial or natural, exhibit magnetic aeolotropy.</p>

                <p>It is convenient, following the analogy of physical optics, to divide
                    magnetically aeolotropic bodies into (a) “uniaxal” bodies, <hi rend="italic"
                    >ue.,</hi> those that are symmetrical about one principal axis of magnetic
                    susceptibility, or, in other words, have two of the principal coefficients of

                    those that have the three principal susceptibilities unequal.</p>
                <p>Class <hi rend="italic">(a)</hi> naturally divides itself into those in which the
                    susceptibility parallel to the axis of symmetry is greater and those in which it
                    is less than that in the plane perpendicular to it. The former (where κ <hi

                <p>Faraday found for example that a crystal of bismuth suspended with its plane of
                    smoothest cleavage vertical set with this plane perpendicular to the lines of
                    force, but was indifferent when suspended with this plane horizontal. The axis
                    of magnetic symmetry is therefore perpendicular to the plane of smoothest
                    cleavage, and, since the substance is diamagnetic, it is a negative uniaxal.
                    When suspended in any other way the crystal set so that the magnetic axis rested
                    in a vertical plane through the direction of the lines of force. The difference
                    between the behaviour of magnetic and diamagnetic uniaxals is beautifully
                    illustrated by the behaviour of pure Iceland spar, which is a positive
                    diamagnetic uniaxal, and sets the optic axis, which is the magnetic axis,
                    equatorially; when, however, as sometimes happens, the calcium is partly
                    replaced by iron, its physical properties (optical included) being thereby
                    unchanged, except that the mass of the crystal becomes magnetic, it sets the
                    optic axis axial.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>All these cases are of course included in the single rule that the body sets the
                    axis of greatest permeability parallel to the lines of force. Since the setting
                    of weakly magnetic aeolotropic bodies depends merely on the differences between
                    the principal magnetic susceptibilities, it follows that it is independent of
                    the medium in which the body is placed. This was established experimentally by

                <p>The phenomena in the case of biaxal aeolotropics are naturally more complicated;
                    but they are all comprehended in the simple rule given above (page 244) that the
                    axis of greatest paramagnetic or of least diamagnetic resultant susceptibility
                    in the horizontal plane tends to set itself parallel to the lines of force, or,
                    in the words of Faraday, the body tends to set so as to allow the greatest
                    number of lines of magnetic induction to pass through it. In the azimuth just
                    mentioned the body is in stable equilibrium, in the perpendicular azimuth in
                    unstable equilibrium. There are two axes of suspension in the plane of the axes
                    of least and greatest susceptibility, viz., the normals to the circular sections
                    of the ellipsoid κ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> V + κ <hi rend="subscript">

                    of the first kind, for he alluded to the subject more than once, and finally in
                    the twenty-sixth series of his experimental researches, where he explained at
                    length his magnetic theory, he showed that such an effect ought to exist, and
                    actually succeeded in observing it in the case of a crystal of bismuth, which he
                    found to be less repelled from places of stronger to places of weaker force when
                    its axis was parallel to the lines of force than when it was perpendicular to
                    them. He concluded that with Iceland spar the translational force ought to be

                    this conclusion experimentally by covering crystals of the red prussiate of
                    potash with a thin layer of wax to prevent dissolution, and immersing them in
                    solution of sulphate of iron of various strengths between the pointed poles of
                    an electromagnet. In water the crystal was attracted to places of stronger force
                    in all positions, in concentrated solution of sulphate of iron repelled in all
                    positions, while in a solution of 14 or 15 volumes of the concentrated solution
                    to 6 volumes of water it was attracted when the axis of symmetry was parallel to
                    the lines of force and repelled about as strongly when the axis was
                    perpendicular to them. Here then the crystal actually behaved paramagnetically
                    in one direction and diamagnetically in the other. Similar results can be
                    obtained with Iceland spar in a mixture of alcohol and water.</p>

                    might be regarded as merely a skilful classification of observed facts, but the
                    passage therefrom to the second class was a step of the first magnitude; it

                    >—</hi> In general the magnetic aeolotropy stands in close relation to the
                    crystalline form, and consequently to a considerable extent also to the optical
                    properties. Thus crystals of the regular system exhibit as a rule no
                    magnecrystallic properties, but there appear to be exceptions in the case of
                    certain pyroelectric crystals such as boracite. Again, crystals that have one
                    crystallographic axis of symmetry are usually magnetically uniaxal, but the
                    optical distinction of positive and negative does not involve the corresponding
                    magnetic distinction, as is shown by the results of Tyndall and Knoblauch with
                    pure Iceland spar and Iceland spar in which part of the calcium is replaced by
                    iron. Crystals that are optically biaxal are as a rule magnetically biaxal, but
                    the magnetic properties cannot be deduced immediately from the optical.</p>

                    Knoblauch concluded that, if the arrangement of the particles of any body be
                    such Us to present different degrees of proximity in different directions, then
                    the line of closest proximity, other circumstances being equal, will stand axial
                    if the mass be magnetic, equatorial if the mass be diamagnetic. They constructed
                    parallelepipeds (1 in. × ⅛ in. × ∣ in.), first, by gumming together rectangular
                    slips of sandpaper (1 in. × ∣ in.), secondly, by gumming together squares of the
                    same (∣ in. × ∣ in.). The paper was comparatively indifferent, while the sand by
                    itself was magnetic; and it was found that the first model set its longest
                    dimension axially, while the second set its longest dimension equatorially; <hi

                    magnecrystallic actions with naturally stratified bodies such as shale, and in
                    fibrous bodies such as wood. He was even able by squeezing plates of bismuth to
                    apparently reverse the magnetic character of the substance; for the compression
                    rendered the plates aeolotropic with an axis perpendicular to their longest
                    dimension, and in consequence they set axially like plates of a paramagnetic
                    substance. A crystal of bismuth compressed in a direction perpendicular to the
                    ordinary magnetic axis, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> parallel to the planes of
                    principal cleavage, had its behaviour reversed as to the second class of
                    magnecrystallic effects, the ratio of the repulsions when the crystal was set
                    with its original axis axial and with its original axis equatorial having been
                    changed from 71 :100 to 112 :100. It was also found possible by squeezing a ball
                    of bismuth dough unequally in two perpendicular directions to imitate a biaxal
                    magnetic crystal such as heavy spar. Tyndall and Knoblauch attempt to explain
                    the magnetic phenomena exhibited by crystals proper by means of these results.
                    They assume that the planes of cleavage are directions of closer aggregation,
                    and therefore tend to point axially in magnetic and equatorially in diamagnetic
                    crystals. For example, the first of the above-mentioned sandpaper models would
                    represent magnetic crystals that cleave parallel to their axis, the second
                    magnetic crystals which cleave perpendicular to their axis. If we regard this
                    theory merely as a way of representing the facts of observation, even if we
                    allow it to be sufficient, it is far inferior in simplicity to the theory of
                    Faraday and Thomson, the sufficiency of which is not disputed. Regarded as an
                    attempt to penetrate a little farther into the relation between molecular
                    structure and magnetic properties, it is of great interest and importance, even
                    if we admit that like most other speculations of the kind it leads us but a
                    little way; for the question arises immediately, How does proximity of the
                    molecules increase specific inductive capacity? This last question is all the
                    more difficult to answer that no experiment has ever yet been adduced wherein
                    the effect of the mutual induction of the parts of a diamagnetic or weak
                    paramagnetic body plays an undoubted part.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    There is a further difficulty in the case of diamagnetic bodies. See Thomson’s
                    letter to Tyndall, <hi rend="italic">Reprint of Papers on Elec, and Mag.</hi>,
                    p. 536.</p></note><hi rend="italic">Discussion as to the Existence of
                    Diamagnetic Polarity.—</hi> Soon after Faraday’s first discovery of
                    diamagnetism, an animated discussion arose as to the proper way of stating the
                    facts involved in the new phenomenon. Faraday himself inclined in the first
                    instance to put the matter by saying that under the action of an inducing force
                    a diamagnetic body is magnetized in a direction opposite to that of soft iron;
                    at a later period he abandoned this form of statement in favour of what he
                    called the theory of magnetic conduction, which fitted better with his ideas as
                    to the part played by the surrounding medium by means of which magnetic action
                    is transmitted from one body to another. Faraday’s first theory under the name
                    of the theory of diamagnetic polarity was immediately adopted by the Continental
                    physicists, such as Weber, Reich, and Poggendorff, who naturally found it
                    consonant with their favourite views as to action at a distance. It was also
                    supported in England by Tyndall and others. Many experiments were advanced on
                    both sides of the question, and the result was much instructive illustration of
                    the laws of magnetic action. But the controversy settled nothing, because in
                    point of fact there was nothing to settle. Either theory was perfectly
                    sufficient, when properly applied, to represent the phenomena, and each left the
                    question of the ultimate nature of paramagnetic and diamagnetic action where it
                    found it. This ought to have been evident after Thomson had shown that the
                    phenomena were included in a perfectly natural generalizatian of Poisson’s
                    theory, indicated in fact by <pb break="no"

                    conception of the phenomena was only another method of viewing the facts leading
                    to identical conclusions. Faraday himself<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    matter of phrases. Since Clerk Maxwell’s elaborate mathematical reconstruction

                    rend="italic">Wien. Ber.,</hi> 1882.</p></note> in the most recent research on
                    the subject with which we are acquainted has made determination of the
                    susceptibility of bismuth by four different methods. The first of these was that
                    formerly used by Toepler and himself, with the addition that the action of the
                    bismuth bar was compared with that of a solenoid of as nearly the same
                    dimensions as possible through which flowed a current of given strength (an
                    artifice previously used by Christie). The second method consisted in measuring
                    the force with which a portion of the diamagnetic substance hung in the axis of
                    a coil and near one of its ends was repelled out of the coil when a known
                    current passed through it. The third method was that of Rowland and Jacques. The
                    fourth consisted in measuring the deflexion of a magnetometer needle produced by
                    placing a piece of the diamagnetic substance between the poles of a powerful
                    magnet under whose action the magnetometer needle had come to rest in the first
                    instance.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This was one
                    of the experiments adduced by Weber in the controversy regarding diamagnetic
                    polarity; see <hi rend="italic">Pοgg. Ann.,</hi> 1848.</p></note> The agreement
                    between the results obtained by all the different methods was very fair
                    considering the smallness of the effects to be measured in some of them. The
                    second method is pronounced to be the best, and by means of it he gives also a
                    determination of <hi rend="italic">κ</hi> for ferric chloride.</p>

                <p>Most of the specimens contained slight traces of iron. Although the range of the
                    magnetizing force in Von Ettingshausen’s experiments was considerable, <hi
                    rend="italic">κ</hi> was very nearly constant; if there was any tendency to
                    variation, it was decrease with the large magnetizing forces.</p>
                <p>The results for ferric chloride are not so concordant. Silow, after comparing his
                    own earliest result (10 <hi rend="superscript"> 6</hi> κ = 81 for a solution of
                    density 1 ’ 475, magnetized by the earth’s horizontal force) with those of
                    Borgmann (10 <hi rend="superscript"> 6</hi> κ = 48"8, density 1 ’ 87, magnetic
                    force 40 to 59), concluded that the susceptibility of ferric chloride probably
                    follows the same law as that of iron <hi rend="italic">; ue.,</hi> it first
                    increases, then reaches a maximum, and afterwards decreases more or less slowly.
                    His later experiments confirm this conjecture, and he finds that <hi
                    rend="italic">κ</hi> has a maximum value for a magnetizing force of about ∙4
                    C.G.S. The smallest force used was about ’ 08 C.G.S. and the corresponding value
                    of 10 <hi rend="superscript"> 6</hi> κ was 34; the largest value of 10 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 6</hi> κ occurring in his tables is 179. The values obtained
                    in his last investigation are smaller than those given in his first table, but
                    there is the same increase and decrease. The following are his latest results

                    shortened, but in general not quite to its <pb break="no"

                    in part to permanent magnetism, but he found that the permanent magnetization
                    due to a current 1088 was reversed from - 1 3 to + ’ 25 by a current 175, while
                    two-thirds of the permanent extension was still left. The actual elongation of
                    an iron bar magnetized to saturation was found to be from <hi rend="subscript">

                    of the intensity of magnetization (temporary or permanent). The general
                    character of the phenomena is the same in soft or hard iron, and in soft or hard
                    steel;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In the case of a
                    bar of hard steel he found a considerable increase in length every time the
                    magnetizing current was interrupted. This he attributes to a state of ‘ ‘
                    tension” in the hardened steel.</p></note> but the effects are smaller with hard
                    than with soft bars.</p>
                <p>It was found that longitudinal compression of the bar influenced the magnetic
                    extension little if at all; on the other hand, longitudinal traction was found
                    to diminish it, and in the case of thin wires under considerable tension the
                    magnetization caused a contraction. Thus in the case of a bar 1 foot long, ∣
                    inch in diameter, with a weight of 600 lb, there was neither extension nor
                    contraction, even with a current of 1600; with weights of 1040 ft and 1680 B⅛,
                    and a current of 1804, there was a contraction of •00002 inch and *000032 inch
                    respectively. The contraction under tension was found to vary approximately as
                    the product of the magnetizing current and the intensity of magnetization. After
                    the magnetizing force was withdrawn the wire regained its original length,
                    permanent magnetization notwithstanding.</p>
                <p>Joule made careful experiments to determine whether the magnetization of an iron
                    bar produced any alteration of its volume, but could find none. He therefore
                    concluded that the longitudinal extension of a magnetized bar is accompanied by
                    an equal lateral contraction; and, in accordance with this conclusion, he found
                    that when an iron tube is circularly magnetized, perpendicular to its length, by
                    passing a current along its axis, it contracts longitudinally.</p>

                    magnetizing coils shorter than the bar, and found that the extension was much
                    greater when the coil was near the free end than when it was near the fixed end
                    of the bar. This of course raises the question how far the extension is due to
                    electromagnetic action between the coil and the bar, and how far to internal
                    molecular disturbance.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    Mayer’s results are in agreement with Joule’s except in the case of bars of soft
                    steel, which (not under traction) when the magnetizing current was first
                    established, elongated in some cases ana retracted in others,—at the first break
                    elongated, and subsequently retracted at make and elongated at br’eak. Righi’s

                    first effect, which is always increase, the application of the traction will
                    cause increase if the intensity of magnetization is not beyond a certain
                    critical value, but decrease if that value is surpassed; the removal of the

                <p>The effect of the first traction on the permanent magnetization, whether of iron
                    or steel, is a diminution; the effect of subsequent tractions in steel is a
                    diminution on application, with increase on removal; in soft iron an increase on
                    application, a diminution on removal. Partial demagnetization of a steel bar by
                    an opposite magnetic force causes it to behave like soft iron; when the

                    was in both cases to <hi rend="italic">diminish</hi> the magnetization. The
                    effect appeared to increase up to a maximum, and then to diminish as the
                    magnetizing force increased; but the critical value was not reached with the
                    largest forces employed.</p>
                <p>Traction perpendicular to the lines of magnetization was found by Thomson to
                    diminish the magnetic susceptibility. The experiment was made by means of a gun
                    barrel magnetized longitudinally, and subjected to internal hydrostatic
                    pressure.</p>
                <p>.The effect of pressure along or perpendicular to the magnetization would in all
                    probability be opposite (and equal 1) to that of an equal amount of traction;
                    but no experiments have as yet been made on the subject.<note anchored="true"

                <p>The alterations of the longitudinal and circular magnetization of iron wires may
                    be shown by the induced currents thereby caused in a coil surrounding the wire
                    or in the wire itself. For example, if an iron wire be circularly magnetized by
                    passing a current through it, and then twisted in either direction, an induction
                    current flows through the wire in the same direction as the original current;
                    and an opposite current is observed when the wire is untwisted again. This shows
                    that twisting the wire diminishes the permanent circular magnetization, while
                    untwisting partially restores it.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    concur in producing them, and it is often difficult to say how much is due to
                    each of these several causes. This is especially to be observed where the sounds
                    are produced by the passage of interrupted or undulatυry currents through wires
                    of the strongly magnetic metals. A full discussion of the matter belongs more
                    properly to the subject of electric telephony; but a few notes on the history
                    and literature of the subject may be given here.</p>

                    clearly that magnetic-mechanical strain was a specific cause. He says that the
                    magnetic extension in the core of an electromagnet takes place so suddenly that
                    the shock is sensible to the touch, and is accompanied by a musical note arising
                    from vibration in the metal. Marrian,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    investigations concerning it. In 1861 Reiss published the invention of an
                    electric telephone for the transmission of music and speech, which depended
                    essentially on the magnetic sounds produced by a varying current in an iron
                    core. This instrument was the prototype of the telephone of Gray, and of the
                    still more famous instrument of Bell, whose action, although often described as
                    purely electromagnetic, is no doubt in part due to the magnetic strains. Among
                    the more recent investigations on this subject may be mentioned Ferguson, <hi

                    action, we must distinguish (1) the mere disturbing effect of jarring: thus the

                    and magnetization; (3) the proper effect of mechanical stress or magnetic force,

                <p>In his excellent analysis of the phenomena, Wiedemann coordinates them throughout
                    by means of an extension of Weber’s theory of “molecular magnets” <hi
                    rend="italic">{Drehbare</hi><hi rend="italic">Mole-cularmagnete).</hi> This of
                    course involves an attempt to pass beyond the mere results of experience; and
                    there can be no question that, on the whole, this theory explains the facts in a
                    highly instructive and suggestive manner. The main defect in it is the multitude
                    of assumptions and the want of clearness and definiteness in its conclusions.
                    Thus it is sometimes not easy to see why exactly the opposite conclusion should
                    not be drawn; and it appears hopeless to bring it to the test of a quantitative
                    comparison with experiment.</p>
                <p>Without entering into the ultimate causes of magnetism, we might endeavour to
                    reduce the phenomena to the smallest number of experimental facts. Thus,
                    assuming merely the effects of longitudinal and transverse traction upon
                    magnetization and the magnetic extension and compression along and perpendicular
                    to the lines of magnetization, we might explain many of the results concerning
                    the relation between torsion and magnetization.</p>
                <p>Let us take for example No. VI. of Wiedemann’s parallel statements. In fig. 44
                    let the upper end of the wire be the fixed end, and let P be a point in any of
                    the thin coaxal cylindrical shells into which the wire may be supposed divided.
                    First suppose the wire to be circularly magnetized by the action of a downward
                    current, the resultant magnetic force at P being in the horizontal direction PB.
                    If now the wire be twisted in the direction of the arrow T, it acquires two axes
                    of greatest and least magnetic susceptibility <hi rend="italic">Pe</hi> and Pr.
                    The resultant magnetic force PB being resolved along these axes will induce more
                    magnetism along <hi rend="italic">Pe</hi> than along Pr; hence the aeolotropy
                    will cause the resultant magnetization to take the direction PB'; it will
                    therefore have a positive vertical component downwards, which agrees with
                    statement VI. In fact the twisting converts the circular lines of magnetization
                    into right-handed helices.</p>
                <p>Next let us suppose the wire untwisted to begin with, but magnetized both
                    circularly and longitudinally, the components being PB and PA. The resultant
                    magnetization will then have some direction such as <hi rend="italic">Pe,</hi>
                    but, by Joule’s principle, this will cause extension along <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pe</hi> and compression along the perpendicular direction Pr; consequently the
                    wire will twist in the direction of the arrow T, which agrees with statement 6.
                    Moreover, since magnetization along PB alone would simply cause the tube to
                    expand along a horizontal section, and magnetization along PA alone would simply
                    cause longitudinal extension, it is clear that when either A or B is given the
                    twisting reaches a maximum and then diminishes when the other is increased.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>According to the results of
                    Villari and Thomson, if the magnetization were beyond a certain critical value,
                    <hi rend="italic">Pe</hi> would become an axis of compression and <hi
                    rend="italic">Pr</hi> an axis of extension, in which case the wire would twist
                    in the opposite direction.</p></note></p>
                <p>It does not seem unreasonable to expect that a general mechanical theory of this
                    kind will yet be found to coordinate all the facts; although there are
                    difficulties in its way at present.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    the business of some ultimate dynamical theory of magnetism to explain.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Effect of Temperature.—</hi> Some information on this subject
                    has been given incidentally above, p. 256. We collect here a few additional
                    facts; but a complete account of all that has been done could not be compressed
                    within our available space, owing to the great diversity of opinion upon the
                    subject. That the question is a very difficult one will appear at once, if we
                    reflect that variations of temperature influence the density and molecular
                    structure of magnetic bodies to a remarkable degree, and that thus secondary
                    influences arise in addition to the proper effect of temperature.</p>
                <p>That very high temperatures destroy both the magnetic susceptibility aud the
                    power of retaining magnetism altogether has been known since the infancy of
                    magnetic science. Thus Gilbert found that a loadstone and a piece of iron
                    equally lost their power of affecting the magnetic needle when heated very hot,
                    and remarks that the magnetic property returns to the iron after it has cooled a
                    little, but that the magnetic virtue of the loadstone is altogether
                    destroyed.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    steel magnet lost its permanent magnetism rather suddenly at a temperature a
                    little under the boiling point of almond oil; it behaved like soft iron till it
                    was raised to an orange-red heat, and then it lost its magnetic susceptibility
                    and became indifferent. The temperature at which retentive power for permanent
                    magnetism was lost appeared to vary in steel with the hardness and structure; in
                    fragments of loadstone it was very high: they retained their permanent magnetism
                    until just below visible ignition in the dark, but, on the other hand, they lost
                    their susceptibility at dull ignition, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> at a much
                    lower temperature than iron. Nickel was found to lose its magnetic
                    susceptibility at a much lower temperature than iron, viz., about 330° to 340°
                    C.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>According to

                <p>The effect of moderate alteration of temperature varies greatly according to
                    circumstances. We shall consider separately the effect upon the magnetic
                    susceptibility and upon the permanent magnetism; but it must be noticed that no
                    such separation is possible in actual experiment.</p>

                    insensible at a white heat, but to be much greater at a dark red heat than at
                    the temperature of the air. The difference was most marked in the case of hard
                    steel, no doubt partly because of the softening of the bar. Similar experiments
                    were made by Barlow, Seebeck, and others. Kupfer<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Wied., <hi rend="italic">Galv.,</hi> ii. §
                    521.</p></note> experimented on the subject using variations of temperature
                    between 0° and 100° C., and found the susceptibility of soft iron to increase
                    with the temperature. Wiedemann’s conclusion is that the first alteration of
                    temperature, whether increase or decrease, increases the temporary magnetism of
                    iron or steel, whatever the temperature at starting. If the temperature be
                    repeatedly altered and brought back to its initial value, the magnetization
                    continues to increase, but after a time becomes more and more nearly constant at
                    the initial temperature. After this state has been reached, an increase of
                    temperature causes increase of magnetization in very hard steel bars, a decrease
                    of temperature a decreàse of magnetization; the behaviour of soft steel bars is
                    exactly opposite.</p>

                    of modern experience. The former concludes from his experiments on iron by the
                    ring method, at temperatures between 0° and 150° C., that the magnetic
                    susceptibility for a given magnetizing force increases with the temperature if
                    the force be below a certain critical value (3 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 6
                    or so), but decreases as the temperature increases if the force be above that
                    value.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See the results
                    of Faraday, <hi rend="italic">Exp. Res.,</hi> ser. xxx. 3424, &amp;c.</p></note>
                    The smaller the magnetizing^force the greater the influence of temperature on
                    the magnetic susceptibility. The result of his experiments at very high
                    temperatures is that, for small magnetizing forces, the susceptibility at first
                    increases rapidly as the temperature increases, reaches a maximum at red heat,
                    and then falls suddenly to zero. For large forces, the susceptibility decreases
                    gradually until red heat, and then falls suddenly to a very small value.
                    According to him, if a bar be cooled from white heat the first traces of
                    susceptibility are observed at a very bright red, - the brighter the greater the
                    magnetizing force. He gives a variety of interesting results concerning the
                    phenomenon of Gore,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>In his earlier researches Faraday was unsuccessful in obtaining any evidence of
                    the influence of temperature on the susceptibility of weakly magnetic bodies,
                    such as the chlorides of the magnetic metals or of diamagnetic bodies.<note

                    gases, and that too, strange to say, before the magnetic character of gases was
                    fully investigated. It was Bancalari’s discovery of the extraordinary behaviour
                    of flame between the poles of an electromagnet that led Faraday to resume his
                    magnetic experiments on gases. Flames of all descriptions are strongly repelled
                    from the axial line of a heterogeneous magnetic field,—so much so that it is
                    impossible to induce the flame of a candle to go between the pointed poles of a
                    powerful electromagnet when they are placed at a short distance apart. The flame
                    is blown aside, or even downwards, as if by a strong current of air issuing from
                    between the poles. If a flat pointed flame is placed with its centre a little
                    below the axial line, when the magnet is excited it drops down and spreads out
                    below and around the axial line, assuming a fish-tail shape. It appears that the
                    effect is not due to the solid matter in the flame but simply to the hot gases

                    into two independent streams. A careful investigation led Faraday to the
                    conclusion that oxygen, carbonic acid, and coal gas are rendered more

                    the magnecrystallic property of bismuth was destroyed at a temperature a little
                    below its melting point, and that the same thing happened to crystalline
                    antimony a little below red heat. In the thirtieth series of his experimental
                    researches he states that between 35° and 142° C. the susceptibility of a
                    specimen of spathic iron ore perpendicular to its magnetic axis decreased by
                    *333 per cent, per degree centigrade of rise of temperature; this agrees very
                    closely with the formula which was found by Wiedemann to represent very
                    approximately the temperature effect for salt solutions, viz., <hi rend="italic"

                    difference between the susceptibilities along and perpendicular to the magnetic
                    axis, he found for the spathic iron ore ’ 482 per cent, between 0° and 138° C.,
                    and the percentage of (decrease was four times as great between -14° and 0° as
                    between 129° and 143°. The corresponding decrease in the case of crystalline
                    bismuth between 36° and 137° C. was <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 53 per cent.
                    The experiments of Pliicker and Matteucci led them to conclude that the
                    susceptibility of diamagnetics diminishes with increase of temperature; in the
                    case of bismuth the decrease between ordinary temperatures and its melting point
                    is said to be about one-sixth or more.</p>
                <p>Canton seems to have been one of the first to study the effect of moderate
                    variations of temperature on the permanent magnetism of iron and steel. The
                    results of his and Hallström’s experiments went to show that permanent
                    magnetization decreases when the temperature rises, and increases again when the
                    temperature falls. In reality, however, as was shown by Kupffer, Riess and
                    Moser, G. Wiedemann, and others, the phenomenon is complicated; <hi
                    rend="italic">for,</hi> if we repeatedly heat a magnet and allow it to cool to
                    its initial temperature, the magnetization lost at each heating is only
                    partially recovered on cooling, and thus a progressive <hi rend="subscript">
                    ι</hi> loss goes on, until at last a constant state is reached, in which the
                    magnetization lost on heating is completely recovered on cooling. In this
                    respect, as well as in the effect on the magnetic susceptibility already
                    discussed, there is an analogy between the effect of temperature and the effect
                    of strain; <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> there is a first or permanent effect and
                    a proper or temporary temperature •effect. The permanent effect is that any
                    alteration of temperature, be it increase or decrease, diminishes the permanent
                    magnetization just as a shock or a jar would do, and probably for a similar
                    reason. The proper or temporary effect consists in a decrease of magnetization
                    with increase of temperature, which is completely recovered on decrease of
                    temperature and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi><note anchored="true"

                    bar, and its magnetic history will all influence the temperature
                    coefficient.</p>
                <p>To take one example, Wiedemann found that a bar magnetized at 0° C. and then
                    partially demagnetized by an opposite force, lost magnetism when heated; if the
                    demagnetization was not carried too far, it did not when cooled again to 0°
                    wholly recover what it had lost. If the demagnetization was carried a certain
                    length, it recovered all that it had lost; if farther still, more than it had
                    lost. It was in fact found possible to demagnetize a bar, so as to render it
                    apparently unmagnetic, and then to restore part of its original magnetism by
                    merely heating and cooling it again. Similar phenomena were observed with a bar
                    magnetized and demagnetized at 100°, and then alternately cooled and heated.

                    ordinary temperatures and cobalt at high temperatures (between the melting point
                    of copper and some lower temperature) experience the same kind of effect; (2)

                    heating when drawn away; (3) that a crystal in a magnetic field experiences
                    cooling when the axis of greatest paramagnetic or of least diamagnetic

                    development of heat may accompany magnetization and demagnetization. The
                    experimental verification of this suspicion is, however, a matter of great
                    difficulty, owing to the enormous generation of heat arising secondarily from
                    induced currents in the mass of the metal. The development caused by
                    magnetization and demagnetization was taken advantage of by Joule in one of his
                    determinations of the mechanical equivalent of heat, but he makes no attempt to
                    separate the effect of the two causes, indeed it did not concern his purpose to

                <p>A relation between magnetism and light was first established by Faraday’s
                    discovery of the magnetic rotation of the plane of polarization of a ray passing
                    along the lines of force. This subject belongs more properly to physical optics,
                    but there is one magnetic phenomenon apparently closely connected with it which
                    falls to be mentioned here. This is Hall’s discovery<note anchored="true"

                    strip in a direction AB, the effect of placing the strip in a magnetic field
                    with its plane perpendicular to the lines of force is to cause a transverse
                    electromotive force perpendicular to AB, which changes in sign when the
                    direction either of the current or of the magnetic field is changed. This
                    transverse electromotive force is proportional to the product of the current

                <p>If, as modern physicists suppose, magnetism be a dynamical phenomenon, time must
                    enter as a conditioning element. The question has been raised how long any
                    magnetizing force takes to develop the maximum magnetization that it is capable
                    of producing. There are many facts that go to prove that this time is very
                    small, or, at all events, that any force develops a very large fraction of the
                    total magnetization due to it in a very short period of time. Perhaps the most
                    wonderful evidence on this head is the fact that the telephone, which depends
                    essentially on varying magnetic action, can reproduce the sounds of human speech
                    even to the consonants.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    perpendicular to the axial line, so that rotation brought the different radii

                    the rate of 110, 121, 143, and 180 turns per second reduced the magnetic
                    rotation of the plane of polarization by 2, 5, 10, and 17 divisions
                    respectively; the reduction was less the greater the magnetic force. From this
                    Villari concluded that in flint glass not less than 0Ό01244 second is required
                    to produce such a diamagnetic intensity as can be observed by the rotation of
                    the plane of polarization, and that 0Ό0241 second at least is required to
                    develop the greatest diamagnetization of which this substance is capable; he
                    also states that the diamagnetism lasts for less than ΟΌ0018 second after the
                    inducing force is withdrawn. A series of interesting experiments on the

                    definite, however, was established. A similar fate befell the attempts to trace
                    the influence of magnetic force upon crystallization, and to detect a relation

                <p>This subject occupied a large portion of most of the earlier treatises on
                    magnetism. Much of the information given, however, either has now been
                    recognized to be of questionable value or has been superseded by recent
                    progress, and retains a merely antiquarian interest; a few brief remarks, mainly
                    historical, will therefore be sufficient.</p>
                <p>The oldest form of magnet was a piece of magnetic iron ore or loadstone. The
                    power of these natural magnets varied exceedingly from one specimen to another.
                    An elaborate discussion of the various kinds of loadstone will be found in
                    Gilbert’s <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Magnete.</hi><note

                    order to increase the carrying power, the loadstone was usually fitted with
                    armatures of soft iron upon its polar regions; figure 45, taken from Gilbert,
                    represents one of the oldest arrangements.</p>
                <p>Figure 46 is taken from a loadstone in the collection of physical apparatus
                    belonging to the university of Edinburgh, the carrying power of which is 205
                    ft&gt;. A loadstone in the Teylerian Museum at Haarlem has a carrying power of
                    230 lb; and one at Lisbon, pre sented by the emperor of China to King John V. of
                    Portugal, is said to support as much as 300 ft&gt;. Small loadstones are often
                    very powerful in proportion to their weight; <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> Newton
                    is said to have worn in a ring one that weighed only 3 grains, and yet was able
                    to carry about 746 grains; and one in the physical collection at Edinburgh,
                    formerly belonging to Sir John Leslie, weighing itself 3⅛ grains, had at one
                    time a carrying power of 1560 grains.</p>
                <p>The introduction of steel magnets, and the perfection to which they were
                    gradually brought, caused the loadstone to fall into disuse. It is said that
                    Galileo possessed the art of making steel magnets about the beginning of the
                    17th century. It was early discovered that the earth’s force could be utilized
                    in magnetizing steel.</p>
                <p>Gilbert was aware that a feeble magnetization could be produced in this way; and
                    Michell, in his treatise on artificial magnets, minutely describes how weak
                    magnets may be made by means of the earth’s force, then combined into bundles or
                    “magazines” and used in turn to produce stronger magnets, these used to produce
                    still stronger, and so on.</p>
                <p>The earliest process of all was no doubt the method of rubbing or touching by
                    another magnet. This method of making magnets was studied with much attention by
                    the natural philosophers of the 18th century, among whom we may mention Savery,
                    Knight, Duhamel, Le Maire, Canton, Michell, Aepinus, Coulomb, and Euler. The
                    method of single touch consists simply in stroking the bar to be magnetized
                    alternately on its two halves with the south and north poles of a loadstone or
                    bar magnet, the stroke beginning always at the middle and ending at the end.
                    According to Lamont, the best plan is to lay the magnet flat, overlapping one
                    half of the bar to be magnetized, and then draw it off; when the magnet is held
                    perpendicular to the bar during the process, the result is apt to give an
                    irregular magnetization: <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi>, we may even get a magnet
                    with its two ends north poles and with a south pole in the middle, or one with
                    four poles, a north and south pole at the two ends and a south and north pole in
                    the middle.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Poles
                    situated abnormally in this way are called “consecutive points.”</p></note></p>
                <p>The first improvement on single touch was double touch with separate magnets.
                    This consists in using two magnets simultaneously on the two halves of the bar
                    undergoing magnetization. The north pole of one and the south pole of the other
                    are placed either close together, or at a small distance apart near the middle
                    of the bar, and then each is drawn towards the end of the half on which it lies;
                    according to Lamont, here, as in single touch, the magnets should be laid flat
                    on the bar.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This method
                    appears to have been invented by Knight (about 1740), and used in producing the
                    powerful magnets for which he was famous. The secret of his process was never
                    divulged by himself, but was published by Wilson after his death. See art. <hi

                    introduced the further improvement of using two bar magnets (or bundles of such)
                    fastened together and kept parallel at a small distance apart by means of small
                    pieces of wood, the north pole of one being conterminous with the south pole of
                    the other. This pair is placed vertical with one end on the middle of the bar,
                    drawn towards one end and slipped off, then replaced on the middle and drawn to
                    the other end, and so on alternately until the moment of the bar ceases to
                    increase any farther. Instead of the pair of bar magnets a horseshoe magnet
                    might of course be used.</p>

                    magnetized upon a larger bar, and then magnetizing the two together. The
                    advantage of this is best seen in the form of the same device adopted by
                    Canton<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"

                    them up parallel to each other by means of two pieces of soft iron, and then
                    magnetizing them in opposite directions. It is easy to see that the
                    magnetization of the one reacts on the magnetization of the other and
                    strengthens it. Michell <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> obtained a similar
                    advantage by magnetizing a number of bars placed end to end in a line; he found,
                    as was to be expected, that the end bars were weaker, but this defect he
                    remedied by repeating the process with the bars arranged in a different order.
                    Coulomb’s method was to place the ends of the bar on the north and south poles
                    of two bar magnets arranged in line at the proper distance apart. This process
                    of connecting up the bars to be magnetized in a closed magnetic circuit is
                    sometimes called circular touch; it can be applied to horse-shoe magnets by
                    placing a pair of them with their ends together, and then passing round and
                    round upon them a horse-shoe magnet or a pair of bar magnets arranged as already

                    constructed for carrying power have surpassed this limit. As a specimen of
                    scientific toys of this description may be mentioned the electromagnet of
                    Roberts (fig. 47), which consists of a square block of iron deeply slotted with
                    four parallel grooves into which three layers of copper wire cable are wound in
                    zigzag fashion so that the current converts the flanges alternately into north
                    and south poles; the armature is a square block planed to fit the face of the
                    magnet. The carrying power of a machine of this kind was 2949 ft, <hi

                    allude to those constructed for the purpose of producing an intense magnetic
                    field, uniform or non-uniform, over a larger or smaller area; these find their
                    practical application in the construction of dynamo-electric machines, but they
                    are mainly interesting to purely scientific men on account of their use in the
                    investigation of the properties of weakly magnetic bodies. Figure 40 shows the
                    usual arrangement adopted for large laboratory magnets. In considering the
                    greatest available strength of such magnets, it is necessary to bear in mind the
                    fact that magnetic saturation of iron is practically reached with magnetic
                    forces much under the greatest that we can command. The strength of field in a
                    narrow crevasse perpendicular to the lines of magnetization in saturated iron is
                    less than 18,000 C.G.S. units;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See above, p. 256.</p></note> and this is practically the
                    utmost at present attainable, for any addition to the strength of the field,
                    arising from direct action of the magnetizing helix, would not under ordinary
                    circumstances affect the hundreds in this number. Further increase of
                    magnetizing current after we have reached λvithin a small percentage of the
                    limit of saturation is a waste of power.</p>

                    first who applied the electric current directly with success in the manufacture
                    of powerful permanent magnets. He used a short flat magnetizing coil which was
                    pushed backwards and forwards along the bar, the ends of which were caused to
                    abut against two pieces of iron, which becoming inductively magnetized reacted
                    on the bar, and also served to keep the magnetization at the ends more uniform.
                    The famous Logeman magnets were constructed by this process.</p>
                <p>By far the most convenient way of magnetizing steel is to use an

                    <hi rend="italic">Pogg. Ann.,</hi> 1849, was one of the earliest who practised
                    this method.</p></note> The bar to be magnetized may be laid flat on the pole of
                    the magnet before it is excited, and after excitation drawn slowly off. By
                    repeating this process several times, with the north pole of the electromagnet
                    for one half and the south pole for the other half, saturation can be very
                    quickly obtained. Perhaps a better plan is to lay the bar with its ends on the
                    two poles, and then excite the electromagnet. For reasons already sufficiently
                    explained, it is advisable to hammer the bar with a mallet while the magnetizing
                    force is in action, and to turn the current off and on several times in
                    succession.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It has been
                    several times proposed to magnetize steel bars by heating them red hot, allowing
                    them to cool to the proper temperature under the magnetizing force, and then
                    tempering while the force is still acting. Gilbert, Knight, Robison, Haman,
                    Gaugain, Aimé, and Holz <hi rend="italic">( Wied. Ann.,</hi> vii., 1879) have
                    all experimented with this method, but it does not appear to possess any
                    advantage over the ordinary modern process, and need not be discussed
                    here.</p></note></p>
                <p>On account of the difficulty of tempering steel to any great depth from the
                    surface, and for specific magnetic reasons as well, it has been customary in
                    constructing powerful permanent magnets to build them up of thin laminae of
                    steel, each of which is separately magnetized. Figure 48 represents an
                    arrangement of this nature adopted by Coulomb, and figure 49 a horse-shoe magnet
                    constructed in the same way. It will be observed that the ends of the laminae
                    are not exactly conterminous, the middle ones projecting more than the others;
                    this arrangement was adopted with the view of getting rid to some extent of the
                    weakening effect which the induction of one lamina has upon the other. That such
                    an effect exists and is very great was conclusively shown by Coulomb; how far
                    the modification in question cures it is another matter; much no doubt depends
                    on the purpose for which the magnet is required; but it is scarcely worth while
                    to discuss the subject here. We may call attention to a farther point in the
                    construction of Coulomb’s magnet, viz., that the ends of the laminae are
                    embedded in two soft iron terminals N and S; there can be no doubt that, for
                    some purposes at least, this is an advantageous arrangement. Among the famous

                <p>In the preservation of permanent magnets it is essential to avoid extreme changes
                    of temperature and shocks. When the magnet is laid aside it should be made part
                    of a closed magnetic circuit; in the case of a horse-shoe magnet this is
                    attained by simply laying a piece of soft iron, called the keeper, across the
                    poles; bar magnets should be kept in parallel pairs, north pole to south pole
                    and south pole to north pole, with two pieces of soft iron between the poles.
                    When this is done the induced magnetism reacts on the magnets and diminishes the
                    demagnetizing force; the action of shocks then ceases to destroy the permanent
                    magnetism, and may even increase it.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Ultimate Theories of Magnetic Phenomena.</hi></p>
                <p>If we pass over the stream theory, which, although partially developed by Euler,
                    has never taken root in modern physical science, the first great theory that we
                    find proposed with a view to the explanation of magnetism is the two-fluid
                    theory of Coulomb and Poisson. This is not an ultimate theory in the modern
                    sense, inasmuch as it is not dynamical; but it was, doubtless, looked upon as
                    ultimate in the days when the imponderable fluids had a recognized role in the
                    physical sciences. In the two-fluid theory the imaginary positive and negative
                    attractive agents (called magnetism in the empirical theory developed above) are
                    regarded as imponderable fluids; but the essential point in the definite form of
                    the theory due to Poisson is that he regards a body susceptible to magnetic
                    induction as made up of an infinite number of particles of infinite permeability
                    immersed in an impermeable medium. After pointing out that, if the particles
                    were of elongated form, and arranged so that the axes of elongation had one
                    preponderating direction, or if they were arranged so that the linear density in
                    different directions varied, the result would be aeolotropy, he assumes that
                    they are spheres uniformily distributed in the impermeable medium so that the
                    volume of the magnetic particles in unit volume of the substance is the fraction
                    <hi rend="italic">h.</hi> The problem of magnetic induction under the influence
                    of a uniform force is then the same as the problem of electric induction for an
                    infinite number of perfectly conducting spheres uniformly distributed in a
                    non-conducting medium. He finds for the permeability <hi rend="subscript">
                    w</hi> =(1 + 2½)∕(1-4</p>
                <p>Maxwell has pointed out one fundamental objection to this theory, viz., that the
                    value of <hi rend="italic">k</hi> calculated from the formula just given by
                    means of observed values of <hi rend="italic">w</hi> in the case of iron is
                    greater than it would be even if the magnetic spheres were packed in the closest
                    possible manner. Another objection is that the theory affords no explanation of
                    the variability of <hi rend="italic">k</hi> with different forces. We might of
                    course modify the hypothesis, as was done by Plücker, by supposing that a
                    resistance depending on the magnitude of the force opposes the separation of the
                    fluids in the magnetic molecules, and that in certain cases a frictional
                    resistance tends to prevent their reunion. We might in this way explain magnetic
                    saturation and permanent magnetism; but the theory thus burdened has no more
                    scientific value than the purely empiric theory, and, moreover, affords no
                    clueto the phenomena of diamagnetism.</p>

                <p>Iu a very important class of modern theories, the fundamental assumption is that
                    the molecules, or at all events a certain proportion of the molecules, of
                    magnetic substances are small permanent magnets. In a body which is to outward
                    appearance unmagnetized, the axes of these molecular magnets are turned
                    indifferently in all directions; in a body which is magnetized in a certain
                    direction a larger proportion than usual of the molecular magnets have their
                    axes more or less in that direction. Magnetic induction is supposed to consist,
                    not in any alteration of the molecular magnets themselves, but in the
                    orientation of their axes under the action of the inducing force. The reader may
                    figure to himself the nature of the action by imagining a line of small magnetic
                    needles with their axes all horizontal, but all pointing in different
                    directions; the whole system thus arranged will have no determinate magnetic
                    moment, and will represent an unmagnetized body. Next, suppose a magnetizing
                    force to act parallel to the line joining the centres of the needles, they will
                    then arrange themselves in that line, and the magnetic moment of the system will
                    be the sum of the moment of the different parts; we have thus an image of a body
                    magnetized by induction.</p>
                <p>The notion of molecular magnets seems to have been suggested by Kirwan; but it
                    was not until a definite form was given to it by Weber that it acquired any
                    importance. The mathematical problem presented is one of great complexity. In
                    the position of equilibrium any molecule is acted on by the magnetizing force,
                    by a magnetic force due to the combined action of the other molecules, and
                    possibly by a force arising from the displacement as well. Weber assumes that
                    the couple tending to restore the molecule to its original position is that due
                    to a constant magnetic force D, parallel to the original direction of its axis.
                    If <hi rend="italic">m</hi> be the magnetic moment of a molecule, and there be
                    <hi rend="italic">n</hi> molecules in a unit of volume, then the magnetic
                    intensity $ due to the magnetizing force is given by ⅛==2rnn^∕3D, if ⅛j&lt;D;
                    and by $ = rnn(l - D <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> ∕3¾) <hi rend="superscript">
                    2</hi>), if</p>
                <p>&gt; D. In other words, the curve (∣, H) is straight till it reaches the point (
                    ∣mn, D), it then becomes concave towards the axis of ⅛j, and rises towards an
                    asymptote parallel to the axis of ∣); the maximum value of $ is <hi
                    rend="italic">mn.</hi> The theory does, therefore, give a general explanation of
                    the phenomena of magnetic induction. The reader will be able by comparison with
                    the experimental data given above to see how far it falls short of a complete
                    explanation.</p>
                <p>If the magnetic substance be devoid of coercive force, we must suppose that the
                    molecules return to their original positions when the magnetizing force is
                    removed. In substances capable of being permanently magnetized, <hi
                    rend="subscript"> i</hi> we must imagine something of the nature of a frictional
                    resistance to the motion of the magnetic molecules; so that, when they are
                    deflected through more than a certain angle, they retain a permanent set after
                    removal of the magnetizing force. Maxwell has worked out the particular
                    hypothesis that each molecule which is deflected through an angle less than <hi
                    rend="italic">β</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 0</hi> returns when the
                    magnetizing force ceases to act, but that a molecule deflected through an angle
                    <hi rend="italic">β&gt;β</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 0</hi> retains the
                    deflexion <hi rend="italic">β-β</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 0</hi><hi

                    subscript"> 0</hi> by I., he finds as the result of the above supposition that
                    the curve of temporary magnetization is a straight line from Ü = 0 to $) = I.;
                    after that it is concave to the axis of and rises to an asymptote, the maximum
                    value of $ being <hi rend="italic">mn</hi> as before. The curve of residual
                    magnetization begins when = I.; it is concave to the axis of $, and rises to an
                    asymptote corresponding to the maximum ⅛' = jmn{l + √l-I. <hi rend="superscript"
                    > 2</hi> ∕D <hi rend="superscript"> s</hi>} <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>. It
                    results from the hypothesis that, when a bar is permanently magnetized by a
                    positive force ^j <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, its magnetism cannot be
                    increased by a positive force &lt; ^ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, but may be
                    diminished by a negative force &lt;‰ and, when the bar is exactly demagnetized
                    by a negative force $ <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, it cannot be magnetized in
                    the opposite direction without the application of a force &gt; but a positive
                    force &lt; H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> is sufficient to begin to remagnetize
                    the bar in the original direction.</p>
                <p>Behind the molecular magnet theory there arises the question, What is the nature
                    of the magnetic molecule? One answer to this question is given by the hypothesis
                    of Ampère, that around each such molecule a current circulates in planes
                    perpendicular to the axis of the molecule. That such an arrangement will be
                    equivalent to an infinitely small magnet in the axis of the molecule, so far as
                    external action is concerned, we know from the laws of electrodynamics. It
                    remains only to inquire what the nature and properties of these molecular
                    currents must be, to trace the full logical consequences of the assumption, and
                    to compare them with experience. This was first done by Weber, and afterwards
                    more completely by Clerk Maxwell.</p>
                <p>It is obvious in the first place that the circuits in which the molecular
                    currents flow must be perfectly conducting; for otherwise the electrokinetic
                    energy of the molecular currents would be continually transformed into heat, and
                    a constant supply of energy from without would be necessary to support the
                    magnetism of a permanent magnet, which is contrary to experience. Let A be the
                    effective area of a molecular circuit, I. its coefficient of selfinduction, <hi
                    rend="italic">θ</hi> the inclination of its axis to the inducing force 7 <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 0</hi> the primitive current, and 7 the current after the
                    inducing force is in action. Then γ=-=7 <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi>-∣jAcos0∕I.;
                    and the component of the moment parallel to $ will be A(7 <hi rend="subscript">
                    o</hi>-^Acos0∕I.)cos0. There are three different cases to consider.</p>
                <p>1. Let either 7 <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> be so great, or ^A∕I. be so small,
                    that the effect due to the electromagnetic induction may be neglected in
                    comparison with the effect due to the deflexion of the molecule; putting m=A7
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi>, we have thus merely the theory of molecular
                    magnets already explained.</p>
                <p>2. Let the force resisting the turning of the molecules be infinitely great, we
                    then find for the magnetic susceptibility the value κ= - ⅜nA <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> ∕I.. This is the theory originally proposed by Weber
                    to explain diamagnetism.</p>
                <p>3. If the effects due to deflexion of the molecules and to electromagnetic
                    induction in the molecular circuits be both considered, we have a theory
                    intermediate to (1) and (2), inclining to the one or the other according to the
                    assumptions made as to the relative values of 7 <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi>, A,
                    and I..</p>
                <p>The reader will find a full discussion of the different cases in Maxwell’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Electricity and Magnetism,</hi> vol. ii. chap. xxii.</p>
                <p>The most important attempt that has yet been made to realize a mechanism
                    affording a dynamical explanation of magnetic phenomena is the theory of
                    molecular vortices, published by Clerk Maxwell in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philosophical Magazine</hi> for 1861 and 1862 (4th ser., vols. 21 and 23). The
                    general results, stripped of all particular assumptions, will be found embodied
                    in his great treatise on <hi rend="italic">Electricity and Magnetism;</hi> but
                    the following summary, taken from the original paper, may be of some
                    interest.</p>
                <p>1. Magnetoelectric phenomena are due to the existence of matter under certain
                    conditions of motion or of pressure in every part of the magnetic field. The
                    substance producing these effects may be a certain part of ordinary matter, or
                    it may be an aethcr associated with matter.</p>
                <p>2. The condition of any part of the field through which lines of magnetic force
                    pass is one of unequal pressure in different directions, the pressure being
                    least along the lines of force, so that they may be considered as lines of
                    tension.</p>
                <p>3. This inequality of pressure is due to vortices coaxial with the lines of
                    force. The density of the revolving matter is proportional to the magnetic
                    permeability of the medium. The direction of rotation is related to the
                    direction of the line of force; and the velocity at the circumference of the
                    vortex is proportional to the resultant magnetic force.</p>
                <p>4. The vortices are separated from each other by a single layer of round
                    particles; so that a system of cells is formed, the partitions being layers of
                    these particles, and the substance of each cell being capable of rotating as a
                    vortex.</p>
                <p>5. The particles forming the layer are in rolling contact with both the vortices
                    which they separate, but do not rub against each other. They are perfectly free
                    to roll between the vortices and so to change their place, provided they keep
                    within one <hi rend="italic">complete molecule</hi> of the substance; but in
                    passing from one molecule to another they experience resistance and generate
                    irregular motions which constitute heat. These particles play the part of
                    electricity. Their motion of translation constitutes an electric current; their
                    rotation serves to transmit the motion of the vortices from one part of the
                    field to another; the tangential pressures thus called into play constitute
                    electromotive force; and the elastic yielding of the connecting particles
                    constitutes electric displacement.</p>
                <p>Maxwell deduces without difficulty all the principal electrical and magnetic
                    phenomena from this theory; and he points out that its general conclusions have
                    a value which does not depend upon the somewhat intricate kinematical
                    arrangements supposed to exist in the magnetic medium. The theory certainly
                    affords us a most instructive dynamical picture of the phenomena of electricity
                    and magnetism; and it remains, so far as we know, the only successful attempt of
                    its kind. <hi rend="smallcaps">(g. ch.)</hi><pb break="no"
