                    (1545-1622), a distinguished Scottish scholar, theologian, and religious
                    reformer, was the youngest son of Richard Melville, proprietor of Baldovy, near
                    Montrose, at which place Andrew was born in 1545. His father fell at the battle
                    of Pinkie, fighting in the van of the Scottish army, two years after the birth
                    of his son; and, his wife having soon after followed him to the grave, the young
                    orphan, then a gentle and delicate child, was tenderly cared for by his eldest
                    brother Richard and his amiable and pious wife, whose memory the great scholar
                    ever afterwards cherished with the warmest gratitude and affection. At a very
                    early age Melville began to show a strong taste for learning, and his brother
                    did every thing in his power to give him the best education the country could
                    then afford. The rudiments of Latin he obtained at the grammar school of
                    Montrose, after leaving which he prosecuted the study of Greek for two years
                    under Pierre de Marsilliers, a Frenchman whom John Erskine of Dun had induced to
                    settle at Montrose; and such was the proficiency Melville made that on going to
                    the university of St Andrews he excited the astonishment of both students and
                    professors by using the Greek text of Aristotle, which no one else there
                    understood, the Latin translation being that which was alone employed in the
                    teaching of logic. On completing his course of study, Melville left St Andrew’s
                    with the character of “the best poet, philosopher, and Grecian of any young
                    master in the land.” He then, in 1564, being nineteen years of age, set out for
                    France fo perfect his education at the university of Paris. He there applied
                    himself especially to the study of the Oriental languages, but he had also the
                    advantage of attending the last course of lectures delivered by Turnebus in the
                    Greek chair, as well as those of the celebrated Ramus, whose mode of
                    philosophizing and plan of teaching he afterwards introduced into the
                    universities of Scotland. From Paris he proceeded to Poitiers for the purpose of
                    studying civil law, and though only twenty-one years of age he was apparently at
                    once made a regent in the college of St Marceon. After a residence of three
                    years, however, the political troubles of the country compelled him to leave
                    France, and he then went on to Geneva, where he was warmly welcomed by Theodore
                    Beza, at whose instigation he was appointed to fill the chair of humanity in the
                    academy of Geneva, which then happened to be vacant. In addition to his
                    teaching, however, he also applied himself to the further prosecution of his
                    studies in Oriental literature, and in particular acquired from Cornelius
                    Bertram, one of his brother professors, a knowledge of Syriac. While he resided
                    at Geneva the massacre of St Bartholomew in 1572 drove an immense number of
                    Protestant refugees to that city, including several of the most distinguished
                    French men ‘of letters of the time, with whom Melville had now the opportunity
                    of intimate intercourse. Among these were several men deeply learned in civil
                    law and political science, and their society no doubt tended greatly both to
                    increase Melville’s knowledge of the world and to enlarge his ideas of civil and
                    ecclesiastical liberty— acquisitions which he must have found of essential
                    service when at a later period as a leader of the General Assembly he had to
                    struggle against the attempts of James VI. to crush the liberties of the church
                    of the Scottish Reformation. In 1574 Melville returned to Scotland, and almost
                    immediately afterwards received the appointment of principal of Glasgow
                    University, which at the time had fallen into an almost ruinous state, the
                    college having in fact been shut up and the students dispersed. Melville,
                    however, with the knowdedge of academic methods of training which he had
                    obtained abroad, immediately set himself with immense energy to establish a good
                    educational system, and in a short time his fame spread through the kingdom, and
                    students flocked in from all quarters, till the class-rooms lately empty could
                    not contain those who came for admission. After labouring for six years in
                    Glasgow, and having brought the seminary into a state of the most thorough
                    efficiency, it was thought desirable that he should undertake the same duties at
                    St Andrews. He accordingly proceeded there in 1580, and was installed as
                    principal of the new theological college. His duties there comprehended the
                    teaching, not only of theology, but of the Hebrew, Chaldee, Syriac, and
                    Rabbinical languages, and the great ability of his lectures was universally
                    acknowledged, and excited quite a new interest in the university. The sweeping
                    reforms, however, which his new modes of teaching necessarily involved, and even
                    some of the new doctrines which he began to introduce, such as the
                    non-infallibility of Aristotle, soon brought him into collision with some of the
                    other teachers in the university; and this, along with the troubles which arose
                    from the attempts of the court to force a bastard system of Episcopacy upon the
                    Church of Scotland, forced him to flee into England in order to escape the
                    consequences of an absurd charge of treason which was made against him, and
                    which seemed to threaten a prolonged imprisonment and not improbably even his
                    life. After an absence of twenty months be returned to Scotland in November
                    1585, and in March 1586 resumed his lectures in St Andrews, where he continued
                    to fulfil the duties of his office for <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0875-0844"/> twenty more years. During the whole of that time,
                    however, his more prominent work was that of contending with unwearied energy
                    and indomitable courage against the encroachments of an unscrupulous and
                    tyrannical Government upon the liberties of the Scottish Church. Into the
                    details of these it is of course impossible to enter here. But that in the main
                    he and his coadjutors were fighting for the constitutionally guaranteed rights
                    of the church is now admitted by all candid inquirers. (See in particular <hi
                    rend="italic">The History of England from</hi> 1603 <hi rend="italic">to</hi>
                    1616, by Samuel Rawson Gardiner, vol. i. chap, ix.). The chief charge against
                    Melville is that his fervour often led him to forget the reverence due to an
                    “anointed monarch.’' Of this, however, it is not very easy now to judge. Manners
                    at that time were rougher than at present. Any thing more rude, insolent, and
                    brutal than James’s own occasional explosions it would be difficult to match,
                    and a king so undignified could scarcely expect to be treated with dignity.
                    Besides, what title had one who was acting in a purely arbitrary and illegal
                    manner to receive other than the plainest dealing,—such as being reminded that
                    though he was king over men he was only “God’s silly vassal?” Melville’s
                    rudeness (if it is to be called so) was simply the outburst of just indignation
                    from a brave, true, and upright man, zealous only for the purity of religion and
                    regardless of consequences to himself, and it contrasts nobly with the
                    grovelling sycophancy of most of the English bishops towards Janies. The close
                    of Melville’s career in Scotland was at length brought about by James iu
                    characteristic fashion. In 1606 he and seven other clergymen of the Church of
                    Scotland were summoned to London in order “that his majesty might treat with
                    them of such things as would tend to settle the peace of the church.” The
                    contention of the whole of these faithful men was that the only way to
                    accomplish that purpose was a free Assembly. Melville delivered his opinion to
                    <hi rend="subscript"> j</hi> that effect with his accustomed freedom and
                    boldness, and, having shortly afterwards written a sarcastic Latin epigram on
                    some of the superstitious practices he had observed in the chapel of Hampton
                    Court, and some eavesdropper having conveyed the lines to the king, ho was
                    committed to the Tower, and detained there for the space of four years. On
                    regaining his liberty, and being refused permission to return to his own
                    country, he was invited to fill a professor’s chair in the university of Sedan,
                    and there he spent the last eleven years of his brave, active, noble, and useful
                    life. He died at Sedan in 1622, at the age of seventy-seven.</p>
