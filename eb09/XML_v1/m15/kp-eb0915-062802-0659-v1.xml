                <p><label type="entry">MATHEMATICAL DRAWING AND MODELLING</label>. The necessity for
                    geometrical drawings and models is as old as geometry itself. The figure has
                    formed the basis of many a geometrical truth; and demonstration by mere
                    inspection of this has frequently to do service for more rigorous proof. So
                    necessary is this visual representation of an idea that there is hardly a branch
                    of mathematics which does not make use of it in the form of tables, symbols,
                    formulae, &amp;c. The visual method is especially important in geometry. The
                    figure is to the geometer what the numerical example is to the algebraist—on the
                    one hand limiting the horizon, on the other imparting life to the conception.
                    Herein lies the didactic value of the figure, which is the more indispensable
                    the more elementary the stage of instruction. To be able to dispense with it is
                    a faculty acquired only after a long and special training. The power of mental
                    picturing is a talent which can be so strengthened by use that even a slightly
                    gifted mind may acquire the power of carrying out a series of geometrical
                    operations without the aid of a figure, provided these do. not lead into
                    unfamiliar regions. But each new group of ideas which the geometer would master
                    requires a new graphic setting forth, which not even the experienced can
                    dispense with. Drawings are sufficient in plane geometry; but solid geometry
                    requires models, except in specially simple cases, in which delineation by means
                    of perspective or some conventional method may suffice. Then, again, in passing
                    from the geometry of the plane, straight line, and point in space to that of
                    curved surfaces, tortuous curves, &amp;c., new and distinct graphical methods
                    are necessary. The difficulties encountered in understanding new groups of
                    geometrical forms are best removed by a careful study of a small number of
                    characteristic models and drawings. As a means of education, the model is lively
                    and suggestive, forming in this way a completing factor in the course of
                    instruction. We remember the pleasure experienced when, after a discussion which
                    has yielded a series of hardly reconcilable properties of one and the same
                    geometrical figure, a model is exhibited which combined these properties in
                    itself; or the striking manner in which a deformable model either of pasteboard
                    or thread executes its transformations before the eye of the observer and
                    scientific student. The study of the model raises new and unexpected questions,
                    and can even do valuable service in leading to new truths.</p>
                <p>In the more elementary departments of plane and solid geometry and descriptive
                    geometry, models are abundant and easily obtainable; but there are comparatively
                    few collections of drawings and models for instruction in higher geometry. There
                    are numerous drawings of algebraic and transcendental curves in the well-known
                    treatises on analytical geometry of Cramer, Euler, Salmon, in Frost’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Curve Tracing,</hi> &amp;c.; but there is still a deficiency in
                    systematic enumerations of the forms of curves and surfaces of a given order or
                    class. In this connexion we may mention Pliicker’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >System</hi><hi rend="italic">der analytischen Geometrie</hi> (curves of the
                    third order), and Beer’s <hi rend="italic">Enumeratio</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >linearum IV.</hi><hi rend="italic">ordinis.</hi> A graphical representation of
                    all the characteristics of the singular points of an algebraic curve of the
                    fourth order is given in Zeuthen’s <hi rend="italic">Systemer af plane
                    Kurver</hi> (1873). As regards tridimensional figuring, the oldest known models
                    for instruction in the higher geometry are the thread models of skew surfaces
                    constructed about the year 1800 under the direction of G. Monge for the École
                    Polytechnique in Paris. In 1830 Th. Olivier of Paris got the same executed in
                    movable form. The great development in modern times of certain branches
                    especially of the higher geometry has given a new importance to such methods of
                    graphical representation.</p>
                <p>Amongst the larger collections we must mention the elegant series of complex
                    surfaces, consisting of twentyseven items, constructed by the celebrated J.
                    Plücker of Bonn. After Pliicker’s death copies, not very satisfactory, were made
                    from zinc casts. The collection of plaster and thread models published by Muret
                    of Paris (now Delagrave), and intended for instruction in descriptive geometry,
                    contains many architectural forms. The wire models of tortuous curves by
                    Professor Wiener of Carlsruhe, and the threadmodels of developable surfaces by
                    Professor Bjorling of Lund, merit notice amongst others. Perhaps the largest and
                    most extensive of the collections is that of I.. Brill, bookseller in Darmstadt.
                    These represent every department of the higher and applied mathematics. The
                    catalogue embraces some seventy numbers, with over a hundred plaster, thread,
                    and metal models. Several series of this collection were prepared in the
                    mathematical department of the technical college of Munich. In the preparation
                    of these models, involving the development of a comparatively novel art, certain
                    practical lessons were gained, especially in the working of plaster models, to
                    which we may direct attention.</p>
                <p>We assume that the preliminary designs are prepared with the aid of board, ruler,
                    square, compasses, and such well-known instruments as are used by the
                    draughtsman.</p>
                <p>The material to be employed, whether wire or thread, interlaced pasteboard
                    strips, or plaster, depends upon the special circumstances of each case, and
                    upon the purpose aimed at in the construction of the model. Two bundles of
                    parallel disks of cardboard or metalsheeting, inclined at an adjustable angle,
                    may bo used with advantage in representing a series of different but mutually
                    transformable surfaces. For ruled and developable surfaces the thread model is
                    to be recommended. The surface is enclosed in a cube, or more generally in a
                    region of space bounded by plane walls. Upon these bounding walls are marked the
                    series of points in which they are cut by the generative lines that are to be
                    represented by threads. Through these points the threads are drawn, and parts of
                    the supporting walls are then cut away so as to allow a convenient glance into
                    the interior of the region. The more densely the threads are strung, the liker
                    is the appearance to that of a continuous surface.</p>
                <p>In the majority of cases plaster will be found the most convenient substance,
                    being easily worked, and giving a result convenient and clear to the eye. There
                    is the disadvantage, however, that one of the regions of space bounded by a
                    surface is filled up. Should the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n660/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0660-0629"/> boundaries of the surface be plane or capable of
                    being turned on the lathe, the desired form is best approximated to by working
                    wood or plaster blocks. Plaster is not easily worked on the lathe, but a plane
                    surface is readily got by rubbing, and if not too dry it may be cut with the
                    knife.</p>
                <p>A surface which cannot be conveniently approximated to by the above method may be
                    built up of strips cut to pattern, which are then filled in with some plastic
                    material. To accomplish this, a system of sections either parallel or having a
                    single axis is laid through the region to be filled up; the bounding lines of
                    these sections are calculated or obtained by geometrical construction. Strips of
                    plate zinc are then cut to the required form and fixed securely by cross-pieces
                    or soldered if necessary. Between the interstices of this zinc scaffolding some
                    plastic material is filled in, such as embossing wax or damp clay; and thus the
                    form of the surface is rendered. The substance known in trade as plastilin is
                    especially suitable for use in this way, as it retains its plastic property a
                    long time. The finishing touches are given to the surface by means of a
                    sculptor’s style. From the clay model a plaster cast is formed and well dried;
                    and its imperfections are removed by means of plasterfiles and other instruments
                    familiar to those who work in plaster. Lines which are to be shown on the model
                    are drawn through points already marked on the original clay model, and engraved
                    with fine files. A galvanoplastie copy of such a plaster model, not too deeply
                    deposited, shows the surface even better than the plaster itself.</p>
