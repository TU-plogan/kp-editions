                    small tree of Surinam in honour of the negro Quassi or Coissi, who employed the
                    intensely bitter bark of the tree as a remedy for fever. This bark was
                    introduced into European medicine about the middle of the last century, and was
                    officially recognized in the <hi rend="italic">London Pharmacopoeia</hi> of
                    1788. In 1809 it was replaced by the bitter wood or bitter ash of Jamaica, <hi
                    rend="italic">Picraena</hi><hi rend="italic">excelsa,</hi> Lindl., which was
                    found to possess similar properties and could be obtained in pieces of much
                    larger size. Since that date this wood has continued in use in Britain under the
                    name of quassia to the exclusion of the Surinam quassia, which, however, is
                    still employed in France and Germany. <hi rend="italic">Picraena</hi><hi

                    resembles the common ash in appearance. It has imparipinnate leaves composed of
                    four or five pairs of short-stalked, oblong, blunt, leathery leaflets, and
                    inconspicuous green flowers. The fruit consists of shining drupes about the size
                    of a pea. It is found also in Antigua and St Vincent. <hi rend="italic"

                    belonging to the same natural order as <hi rend="italic">Picraena,</hi> viz.,
                    <hi rend="italic">Simarubaceae,</hi> but is readily distinguished by its large
                    handsome red flowers arranged in terminal clusters. It is a native of Panama,
                    Venezuela, Guiana, and northern Brazil. Jamaica quassia is imported into England
                    in logs several feet in length and often nearly one foot in thickness,
                    consisting of pieces of the trunk and larger branches. The thin greyish bark is
                    usually removed. The wood is nearly white, or of a yellowish tint, but sometimes
                    exhibits blackish markings due to the mycelium of a fungus. The wood has a pure
                    bitter taste, and is without odour or aroma. It is usually to be met with in the
                    form of turnings or raspings, the former being obtained in the manufacture of
                    the “bitter cups” which are made of this wood. The medicinal properties are due
                    to the presence of quassiin (first obtained by Winckler in 1835), which exists
                    in the wood to the extent of <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi><hi rend="superscript">

                    substance, soluble in hot dilute alcohol and chloroform and in 200 parts of
                    water. It is also readily soluble in alkalies, and is reprecipitated by acids.
                    It is almost insoluble in ether, and forms an insoluble compound with
                    tannin.</p>
                <p>Quassia is used in medicine in the form of infusion and tincture as a pure bitter
                    tonic and febrifuge, and in consequence of containing no tannin is often
                    prescribed in combination with iron. An infusion of the wood sweetened with
                    sugar is also used as a fly poison, and forms an effectual injection for
                    destroying thread worms. Quassia also forms a principal ingredient of several
                    “hop substitutes,” for which use it was employed as long ago as 1791, when John
                    Lindsay, a medical practitioner in Jamaica, wrote that the bark was exported to
                    England “in considerable quantities for the purposes of brewers of ale and
                    porter.”</p>
