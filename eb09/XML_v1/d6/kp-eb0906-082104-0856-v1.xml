                    (1752-1840). Frances Burney, daughter of Charles Burney, D.Mus., was born at
                    Lynn Regis, in Norfolk, 1752. Her mother was a Miss Esther Sleepe, distantly of
                    French descent. In 1760 the Burneys moved to London; and in 1761 Mrs Burney
                    died, leaving six children, of whom Fanny, the third, was but nine years old.
                    Her sisters were sent to school, but she, as 61ie tells <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n857/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0857-0822"/> us herself, “never was placed in any seminary,
                    and never was put under any governess or instructor whatsoever.” At ten years
                    old she had taught herself to read and write, and became an incessant scribbler
                    both of prose and verse, aud ardently fond of reading. Six years after his
                    wife’s death Dr Burney married again; and from her fifteenth year onwards Fanny
                    lived in the midst of an exceptionally brilliant social circle, gathered round
                    her father in his house in St Martin’s Street, Leicester Fields, which included
                    the chief musicians, actors, and literary men of the day, and not a few of his
                    aristocratic patrons. Her father’s drawing-room was in fact Fanny’s only school,
                    and not a bad one. Her stepmother, although a spirited and sensible woman, did
                    not encourage Fanny’s habits of scribbling, which she considered dangerously
                    unfeminine. Fanny, therefore, when she was fifteen, solemnly burnt all her
                    manuscripts,—among them <hi rend="italic">The History of Caroline Evelyn,</hi> a
                    story of which her first published novel, <hi rend="italic">Evelina,</hi> was
                    the sequel. At the same time she began her famous <hi rend="italic">Diary,</hi>
                    which extended over seventy-two years of her life. She was not much more than
                    fifteen when she planned the story of <hi rend="italic">Evelina;</hi> but it was
                    not written till some years later, and was not published till the year 1778,
                    when its authoress was six-and-twenty. Having, she tells us, an “odd
                    inclination” to see her work in print, she confided her secret to her sisters,
                    copied out part of her manuscript in a feigned hand, and persuaded her younger
                    brother Charles to be her agent with the booksellers, the interviews being held
                    at a coffee-house in the evening, and young Charles being disguised in a big
                    cloak aud hat for the purpose. Dodsley refused her MS. as anonymous, but
                    Lowndes, after its completion, accepted it, and gave her .£20 for it. Dr Burney
                    was told of what was going on, and good-naturedly favoured his daughter’s whim,
                    without so much as asking the name of her book. <hi rend="italic">Evelina, or a
                    Young Lady's Entrance into the World,</hi> was therefore published quite
                    clandestinely, and Miss Burney herself knew the event only through an
                    advertisement in the papers; while it had been six months in print, and had been
                    reviewed and praised everywhere, before her father held the three little volumes
                    in his own hand. Dr Burney proudly told Mrs Thrale the secret of the authorship,
                    and Miss Burney was at once taken to Streatham, and admitted into a coterie of
                    which Johnson was the great centre. Her fame spread. Johnson had declared that
                    there were passages in <hi rend="italic">Evelina</hi> which might do honour to
                    Richardson; Sir Joshua Reynolds could not be persuaded to eat till he had
                    finished the story; and Burke had sat up all night to read it. Miss Burney was
                    introduced to Mrs Montagu and the <hi rend="italic">Bas-hleus,</hi> to Sheridan,
                    who wanted her to write for the stage, and to her special admirers Mrs
                    Cholmondely and the beautiful Mrs Bunbury. But the chief feature in her early
                    literary life was Dr Johnson’s friendship for her, which excited the jealousy of
                    Boswell, and ended only with Johnson’s death. The second story, <hi
                    rend="italic">Cecilia, or Memoirs of an Heiress,</hi> in five volumes, 1782,
                    greatly increased her popularity, and brought her a letter from Burke, in which
                    he said, “In an age distinguished by having produced extraordinary women, I
                    hardly dare to tell you where my opinion would place you amongst them.” In 1786,
                    through the influence of the good old Mrs Delany, known as the correspondent of
                    Swift and Young, Miss Burney obtained the post of second keeper of the robes to
                    Queen Charlotte, consort of George III., with a salary of £200. For five years
                    (from her thirty-fourth to her thirty-ninth year) it was her duty to attend at
                    the Queen’s daily <hi rend="italic">toilettes,</hi> to take care of her lap-dog
                    and her snuff-box, to read to her now and then, and to preside over the teatable
                    of the equerries. Her <hi rend="italic">Diary and Letters</hi> of this time
                    abound in amusing court gossip; but the post was an uncongenial one, and she
                    resigned it in 1791 on account of ill-health. The queen allowed her a pension of
                    £100 a year, the king saying, “It is but her due; she has given up five years of
                    her pen.” In 1793 Miss Burney became the wife ofM. D’Arblay, a French officer of
                    artillery, who, with Madame de Stael, Talleyrand, and other refugees, lived at
                    “Juniper Hall,” Dorking. In the same year she published a pamphlet on the
                    emigrant French clergy. Her only child, afterwards the Rev. A. D’Arblay, was
                    born in 1794; and in 1795 appeared her third novel, <hi rend="italic">Camilla,
                    or a Picture of Youth,</hi> in five vols. This book was published by subscrip
                    tion, and brought her more than £3000. From 1802 to 1812 Madame D’Arblay was in
                    France with her husband and son, and in 1814 she published <hi rend="italic">The
                    Wanderer, or Female Difficulties,</hi> another five-volumed story, a comparative
                    failure, though at the time it realized £1500. Madame D’Arblay was in France and
                    Belgium through the war 1814-15, her husband having regained the post of
                    marechai de camp, which he had formerly held under Louis XVI. They returned to
                    England, and General D’Arblay died at Bath in 1818.</p>
                <p>In Sir Walter Scott’s diary for November 18, 1826, he describes his being taken
                    to see Madame D’Arblay by Mr Rogers, and says, “I have been introduced to Madam©
                    D’Arblay, the celebrated authoress of <hi rend="italic">Evelina</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Cecilia,</hi> —an elderly lady with no remains of personal beauty,
                    but with a simple and gentle manner, and pleasing expression of countenance, and
                    apparently quick feelings.” In 1832, when she was eighty years of age, Madame
                    D’Arblay published the memoirs of her father, who died in 1814. This book, the
                    rambling recollections of an old lady, is full of imperfections and
                    extraordinary affectations of style. Madame D’Arblay died at Bath, 1840, aged
                    eighty-eight, and her <hi rend="italic">Journal and Letters</hi> were edited by
                    her niece, and published in seven volumes, 1842-6.</p>
                <p>Madame D’Arblay was not remarkable for personal beauty. She was small, retiring,
                    and rather prudish, delighting to be lionized, while she dreaded nothing more
                    than to be thought unfeminine or eccentric. Her style in writing was considered
                    remarkable for its sprightliness and humour. Some of her most vivid characters
                    were extremely popular. “You are a perfect <hi rend="italic">Branghton,”</hi>
                    exclaimed Dr Johnson when Boswell was about to quit Mrs Thrale’s table before
                    the guests had finished eating. And Miss Burney tells us how “the Doctor” was
                    one day seen laughing to himself, and suddenly turned to her, quoting from <hi
                    rend="italic">Evelina,</hi> with “Only think, Polly, Miss has danced with a lord
                    1” Her best character sketches and most spirited dialogues are, however, to be
                    found, not in her novels, but in her <hi rend="italic">Journal and Letters.</hi>
                    The drawback of everything which she wrote of an autobiographic kind was her
                    painful self-consciousness and astounding egotism. It was her great ambition to
                    write for the stage. She made three attempts to write a play; and her tragedy,
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Edwy and Elgiva,</hi> was acted by Mrs Siddons and
                    Kemble at Drury Lane in 1795, but had to be withdrawn as a failure, and was
                    never printed. <hi rend="smallcaps">(f. m.)</hi></p>
