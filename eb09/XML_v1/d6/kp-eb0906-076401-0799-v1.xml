                    (1661-1709), whose original surname was <hi rend="smallcaps">Eurelius,</hi> the
                    Swedish poet, was born September 7,1661, in the parish of Ohr, in Dalsland,
                    where his father was rector. He entered the university of Upsala in 1677, and
                    after gaining his degree, entered the Government office of land-surveying. He
                    was sent in 1681 on professional business to Livonia, then under Swedish rule,
                    and after some time took thence a scientific journey into Germany, in the course
                    of which, being at Leipsic, he published and publicly read, in 1687, a
                    dissertation, <hi rend="italic">De Electro,</hi> which caused such a sensation
                    that he was offered a professorial chair at the university of that city. He
                    refused this honour, however, and busied himself, on his return to Sweden, with
                    carrying out the numerous commissions in land-surveying directed by King Charles
                    XL, and in 1699 he became head of the whole department. In 1702 he was ennobled
                    under the name of Dahlstjerna. He spent his life in travelling, and wandered
                    over the whole of the coast of the Baltic, Livonia, Riigen, and Pomerania,
                    preparing maps which still exist in the office of Public Land-Surveying in
                    Stockholm. He died in Pomerania on his forty-eighth birthday, September 7, 1709,
                    just after the disastrous news of the lost battle of Pultowa had reached him. .
                    Dahlstjerna’s life was, as it might seem, fully occupied with those practical
                    mathematical studies in which he laboured so conscientiously for his country;
                    but it is indisputable that his passion for poetry was still more absorbing. His
                    patriotism was touching in its pathos and intensity, and during his long periods
                    of professional exile he comforted himself by the composition of songs to his
                    beloved Sweden. His genius was most irregular; at his best he surpasses all the
                    Swedish poets of his time, and that with ease; but no writer of that country has
                    sunk to lower depths of bombastic puerility. He formed his style after two
                    thoroughly bad models,—the so-called Second Silesian School, of which Lohenstein
                    was the leader, and the florid Italian pastoralists, Marini and Guarini. His
                    best known original work is <hi rend="italic">Kungaskald,</hi> an elegy on the
                    death of Charles XI., published in 1697. It is written in alexandrines, arranged
                    in <hi rend="italic">ottava rima.</hi> The poem has faults enough; it is pompous
                    and allegorical, but there are passages full of melody and high thoughts. The
                    whole bearing of the work, judged from a national point of view, is noble and
                    even sublime, and could only have been conceived at such a time, when Sweden was
                    a great power in Europe. Dahlstjerna was a reformer in language, and it has been
                    well said by Atterbom, that in this poem “he treats the Swedish speech just as
                    dictatorially as Charles XI. and Charles XII. treated the Swedish nation.” In
                    1706 he printed a volume of poems celebrating the victories of Charles XII.,
                    which, to the serious loss of Swedish literature, has unaccountably disappeared.
                    In 1690 was printed at Stettin his translation or rather paraphrase of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Pastor Fido of</hi> Guarini, which was very much admired and often
                    reprinted. But of all the works of Gunno Eurelius the one that has attained most
                    living popularity is <hi rend="italic">The Goth's Battle Song concerning the
                    King and Master Peter,</hi> published in 1701. The king is Charles XII. and
                    Master Peter is, of course, the ezar of Russia. There is a proud maiden whom
                    Peter will ravish from the king, and her name is Narva Castle. It is an
                    exceedingly spirited and felicitous ballad, and lived almost until our own days
                    on the lips of the people as a folk-song. In a more tasteful age, and with more
                    leisure for poetic study, there can be no doubt that the vivid genius of
                    Dahlstjerna would have produced works of a far higher order. As it is, there is
                    no Swedish writer of his age who has approached him in his sublimer moments. The
                    works of Dahlstjerna have been collected by Hansellius.</p>
