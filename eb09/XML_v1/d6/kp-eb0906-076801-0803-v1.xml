                <p><label type="entry">DAIRY</label>. Milk, either in its natural state, or in the
                    form of butter and cheese, is an article of diet so useful, wholesome, and
                    palatable, that dairy management, which includes all that concerns its
                    production and treatment, constitutes a most important branch of husbandry. The
                    physical conditions of the different countries of the world have determined in
                    each case the most suitable animal for dairy purposes. The Laplander obtains his
                    supplies of milk from hi3 rein-deer, the roving Tartar from his mares, and the
                    Bedouin of the desert from his camels. In the temperate regions of the earth
                    many pastoral tribes subsist mainly upon the milk of the sheep. In some rocky
                    regions the goat is invaluable as a milk-yielder; and the buffalo is equally so
                    amid the swamps and jungles of tropical climates. The milking of ewes was once a
                    common practice in Great Britain; but it has fallen into disuse because of its
                    hurtful effects upon the flock. A few milch asses and goats are here and there
                    kept for the benefit of infants or invalids; but with these exceptions the Cow
                    is the only animal now used for dairy purposes in this country.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Breeds.—</hi> Cows of every kind are used for the dairy; but
                    there are several of our native breeds of cattle which are called <hi

                    already been given in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Agriculture,</hi> vol. i.
                    page 388. Whatever the breed, the quality is much influenced both by the age of
                    the cow and by the way in which she is fed. So clearly is it ascertained that
                    the milk of cows not exceeding four years of age yields a larger proportion and
                    richer quality of curd than the milk of older animals, that it is customary in
                    some of the cheese-making districts of England to draft off the cows to the
                    grazier after they have borne two or at most three calves each.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In those districts it is
                    usual to rear one heifer calf for each three cows, and to have the heifers to
                    calve for the first time at 3 years old,— so that the young stock of all ages
                    are equal in number to the cows. As many pigs are kept as suffice to consume the
                    whey,—the proportion, in summer, being one pig to two cows.</p></note> Cows that
                    are prized for their pedigree, however, are of course kept for longer periods,
                    and few will part with a good cow so long as she continues to yield abundance of
                    milk. In large well-conducted dairies, especially where, as in a yearly
                    increasing number of cases, shorthorns are kept, the cows are fed so well that
                    they are sold to the butcher at very nearly their original cost as milch
                    cows.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Food.—</hi> The influence which the food of the cow exerts upon
                    the amount and qualities of her milk has always been recognized; but at one time
                    a large yield of milk, free from any unpleasant taste, was made the chief object
                    of regard. It was accordingly the practice in new-milk dairies to feed the cows
                    principally with soft sloppy food, such as boiled turnips, brewers’ grains, and
                    distillery wash. The milk produced from such food contains an undue proportion
                    of serum, and is deficient in butter, caseine, sugar, and phosphates—the very
                    elements which give to milk its value as an article of food, and fit it so
                    peculiarly for building up the frame of young animals. When these elements are
                    wanting in the cow’s food they are to a certain extent supplied to her milk from
                    her own system; and hence it is that cows which give a very large quantity of
                    milk generally lose the fat and flesh which they had accumulated before calving.
                    In order, therefore, to maintain the condition of the cow, and enable her to
                    give milk of the best quality, it is necessary that her food contain an adequate
                    supply of the requisites for good milk. Her food, in short, must be
                    substantially the same as that found most useful in feeding cattle for the
                    butcher. It is now pretty well ascertained that the fattening process is
                    accomplished most economically by giving a moderate allowance of linseed or
                    other cake, and of the meal of beans, Indian corn, and other grains in addition
                    to the pasturage, green forage, roots, and loader, which constitute the bulk of
                    the food of such animals. The following approved dietary for milch cows is taken
                    from a Report on Harvey’s Dairy Company, Glasgow, by H. M. Jenkins, F.G.S.,
                    published in the <hi rend="italic">Journal of the 'Royal Agricultural Society of
                    England</hi> in 1871.</p>
                <p>“During the seven winter months, when the cows remain entirely in the byre, the
                    daily food commences with draff (distillery refuse) about four or five o'clock
                    in the morning, mixed with bean, pea, or Indian meal, preferably the
                    first-named, unless beans are too dear, when mixed kinds of meal are
                    substituted. Linseed cake is occasionally given at this time to cows beginning
                    to run dry, and also in spring to those that require a little laxative. After
                    the first milking, viz., about seven in the morning, as much distillery refuse
                    as they can take is freely given, and at eight o’clock either oat-straw or hay
                    (if possible). The latter is generally rye-grass hay of the irrigated fields
                    which are held by the Company. The next feed consists of raw turnips or
                    cabbages, given about ten o’clock, and at eleven the cows are milked for the
                    second time. The afternoon meal is given at two o’clock, and consists of steamed
                    meal, turnips, and draff. At four o’clock some fodder, generally straw, is
                    placed in the mangers, and between four and five more draff is run in. Some
                    turnips are always put in the steamed food. At five o’clock the cows are milked
                    for the third time, and are afterwards made up for the night.</p>
                <p>“During the summer the cows get nothing in the byres but a little draff in the
                    morning, when they come in to be milked, except towards the fall of the year.
                    They are then allowed some fodder at mid-day; and in a bad season they get a
                    little meal with their draff in the morning. They are kept on the pastures all
                    day, but are brought up to the steading to be milked about eleven o’clock, as
                    well as at night.”</p>
                <p>The ordinary management of cows in the cheese manufacturing districts is of a
                    much more simple and less expensive nature than the above. In Ayrshire the cows
                    generally begin to calve early in March, and they are all giving milk by the
                    time when the pasture is ready for them. That time varies in ordinary seasons
                    from the middle of April on fine early land to the middle of May on the colder
                    soils of the uplands. The female calves from the best cows are reared on most
                    farms. The calved cows get two meals of cooked food daily. The cooked food
                    consists of chaff and turnips or mangold, boiled together, with bean and Indian
                    com meal added. The other food consists of hay or straw produced on the farm.
                    The chaff and meal are frequently given, especially in backward seasons, for
                    some time after the cows are on the pasture. On bare inland farms good managers
                    use meal of some kind during a considerable part of the summer. In hot days, or
                    cold boisterous nights, the cows are sometimes kept in the house and supplied
                    with a little food. In August, when young grasses are failing, the cows are fed
                    partly on second clover, or on vetches, and later in autumn cabbages and soft
                    turnips come in to supplement the pastures. When the weather becomes inclement
                    the cows are kept in at night, and get hay or straw with good supplies of
                    turnips. The turnips are reduced in quantity when the cows are put dry, which
                    may be from one to two months before the expected time of calving, and the
                    dietary is improved again when that time approaches. Where butter is made,
                    mangold or turnips have to be given in a judicious manner, on account of the
                    flavour. With the turnips given soon after milking, and a little nitre put into
                    the shallow vessels in which the milk is cooled, there is little danger of
                    unpleasant flavour. Mangold is most valuable in the latter part of spring. Its
                    feeding quality is then at the best, and turnips are not so good. But for
                    quality of milk, carrots are the best food of all the so-called root crops.</p>
                <p>Gorse, bruised and chopped, has been found a suitable kind of green winter forage
                    for milch cows. On the large dairy farm of F. Leser &lt;fc Co., near St Louis,
                    Missouri, the daily winter food of a cow consists of about half a bushel of
                    brewers’grains, 6 gallons of distillery slop, mixed with from 2 to <hi
                    rend="italic">5</hi> K&gt; of ship stuff, malt sprouts, bran, and Indian or
                    cotton<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n804/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0804-0769"/>-seed meal, and 6 to 10 lb of good hay, chiefly
                    Hungarian. On another American farm, at Cumberland, Rhode Island, each cow
                    receives in summer 2 quarts of cotton-seed meal daily in addition to pasturage,
                    and in winter 4 quarts of cotton-seed meal, and from 2 to 4 quarts of Indian
                    meal, with English and swale hay; neither Indian meal nor wheat shorts can be
                    substituted for the cotton-seed meal without lessening the produce of a cow by a
                    quart per diem.</p>
                <p>The best pasturage for cows is that afforded by good old grass land, in sheltered
                    inclosures of moderate size, where there is a constant supply of pure water. To
                    have dairy produce of the best quality, the grass must be so stocked as to keep
                    it always fresh grown and sweet. This is most easily secured by frequently
                    changing the cows from one field to another; and hence the advantage of having
                    small inclosures, one of which can be rested, while another is keeping the
                    stock. When soiling is resorted to, Italian rye-grass is at once the cheapest
                    and best forage that can be used; but it can be varied, as circumstances
                    dictate, with clover, sainfoin, vetches, or green rape. When cows are kept
                    entirely at pasture during the summer, from 1| to 2 acres of grass land is
                    required for each animal; and if hay alone is given in winter (as is the
                    practice in Gloucestershire), the produce of another acre of meadow is required
                    to supply their winter keep. As from 1 to 1| cwt. of green forage is an ample
                    daily allowance for a cow, and as two cuttings of clover or Italian rye-grass,
                    averaging 8 tons each per acre, can with suitable manuring be easily obtained,
                    it is obvious that by soiling in summer and feeding on roots and cooked food in
                    winter, half as much land will suffice to maintain a cow on the latter system as
                    on the former. And, above all, the produce in milk, besides being of richer
                    quality, is greater in quantity by fully one-fourth. The average yield per annum
                    of milk of a cow in Gloucestershire is estimated at 525 gallons, and in Ayrshire
                    at about 425 gallons. Under a generous house-feeding system an average of 680
                    gallons may be obtained. Salt ought always to be a constituent of the food of
                    the dairy cow; to cows at grass it should be given daily, and in May and June it
                    may be advantageously supplied twice per diem. Withholding it for five days has
                    been found to occasion a loss of 2 per cent, in the quantity and 7 per cent, in
                    the quality of the milk. All changes of diet must be made with caution. The
                    utmost vigilance must also be used to insure regularity in the times of feeding
                    and milking, in seeing that the latter process is thoroughly performed, and in
                    guarding the cows from exposure to extremes of heat or cold. Through inattention
                    to these particulars the flow of milk may easily be so diminished as to render
                    the keeping of a dairy a profitless business.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Buildings.—</hi> The accompanying plan shows the general
                    arrangement and dimensions of the different portions of a modern dairy farm
                    steading for fifty cows. It has been drawn by Mr James Cowie, of Sundridge Hall,
                    after the model introduced by him and approved of by the Highland and
                    Agricultural Society of Scotland, an engraving of which was given in the last
                    edition of this work. The interior of the steading is intended to have two
                    roofs, and is so constructed as to facilitate with the least possible labour the
                    supplying of the cattle with straw and roots, which latter are wheeled on a
                    tramway. The dung, which is also removed by tramway, is deposited in an adjacent
                    covered yard, where, if need be, cattle and pigs can be kept for treading down
                    the dung. Sufficient ventilation can be obtained by very simple methods, and
                    must be provided for in the course of erection. It is necessary only to add,
                    that the principle on which the steading is constructed can be applied to either
                    larger or smaller establishments as required.</p>
                <p>Dairies are of three kinds, viz.—new-milk, butter, and cheese dairies.</p>

                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">New-Milk Dairies.—</hi> These, in or near towns, or amidst
                    the dense population of mining and manufacturing districts, are to a large
                    extent kept by persons who, with the aid of their families, undertake the
                    management of from one to a dozen cows, and the delivery of the milk to
                    customers. In our large towns there are also to be found gigantic
                    establishments, in some of which as many as a thousand cows may be seen at one
                    time. In these town dairies the cows are usually purchased when they have newly
                    calved, or are at the point of calving, and they are retained till they cease to
                    give a remunerative quantity of milk. The cows are commonly milked twice a-day,
                    but sometimes thrice, as in the case of those owned by Harvey’s Dairy Company,
                    Glasgow. To ensure successful milking, quietness, comfort, and kindly treatment
                    are essential to the animals. The udders and teats should be thoroughly cleansed
                    before the commencement of the operation. The more expeditious the milker, the
                    better the result. The left arm should be kept firmly pressed against the cow’s
                    right leg, in order to protect the pail. Towards the close of the process the
                    hand should reach a little above the teat, and pull down gently upon it at each
                    delivery of the milk, so as completely to empty the udder. The milk is conveyed
                    at once to the milk-room, where it is strained, measured, and delivered •over to
                    retailers, or to servants of the establishment, by whom it is distributed to the
                    customers. A portion, in some cases half, of the new milk is, however, retained
                    in the dairy for twelve hours. It is then skimmed, and the cream either retailed
                    or made into butter. This business requires the employment of a large capital,
                    and is attended with much risk; but when well managed, is a remunerative one to
                    those engaged in it.</p>
                <p>Railways have occasioned the introduction of important changes in this branch of
                    dairy business. Instead of the cows being kept in or near cities, where housing,
                    food, and litter are costly, it has become a common practice to keep them on
                    farms near railway stations, and to forward the new milk in suitable vessels
                    twice a-day to retail tradesmen. It is obviously easier to carry the milk to the
                    place where it is consumed, than first to convey thither the cows and their
                    litter and food, and then to remove to the country the manure which they
                    produce. There can be no doubt, also, that the air and pasturage of the country
                    are of advantage to the cows.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Butter Dairies.—</hi> Wherever cows are kept some portion of
                    the milk is used for the production of butter. The dairies, however, of
                    extensive districts both in England and Scotland, on account of the attention
                    given to this particular product, are appropriately spoken of as “butter
                    dairies.” In the midland and western counties of England, where the breeding of
                    cattle is extensively carried on, the calves, two or three weeks after birth,
                    are fed upon skimmed milk and a gruel of bruised linseed and oatmeal, so that
                    the greater part of the new milk can be converted into butter. When the calves
                    are all weaned, the skim milk is employed in fattening pigs. In many parts of
                    the country buttermilk is much relished by the labouring classes. Wherever
                    churned milk can be readily disposed of, dairy farmers direct their attention
                    chiefly to the production of butter.</p>
                <p>When new milk is allowed to settle, the fat globules, being lighter than the
                    general mass, gradually rise to the surface in the form of cream. In the process
                    of churning, these globules are broken by the mechanical agitation, aided by the
                    action of the lactic acid which is formed from the sugar of the milk, and the
                    contents cohere to form butter. The usual practice is to allow the cream,
                    whether separated from the milk or not, to stand until it begins to become
                    acid.</p>
                <p>Butter is made either from cream onlv or from milk and cream together. The best
                    butter is obtained from the cream which rises during the first twelve hours
                    after milking, and the next best by churning the whole milk. In the former case
                    the new milk, after being carefully strained, is poured jnto shallow vessels of
                    glazed earthenware, glass, tinned iron, wood, lead, or zinc, of which the three
                    first-named sorts are the best. Wooden vessels are objectionable from the
                    difficulty of cleaning them thoroughly, and lead and zinc on account of the
                    noxious salts produced by the action of the acid of the milk on the metal. Pans
                    of about 10 quarts capacity, made, without seams, of well-tinned sheet iron, are
                    in common use. Where milk is cooled by means of water the pails are made round,
                    and about 18 inches in depth, or shallow and rectangular, with an exterior pan
                    for containing the water. The deeper vessels are found to be most suitable in a
                    cold, the shallower in a warm atmosphere. To obtain as much butter from the milk
                    as possible, the first skimming takes place at the end of twenty-four hours, and
                    one or more skimmings are made at further intervals. The cream is stored in
                    jars, which should be kept in a place separate from the milk-room, that the milk
                    in the coolers may not be too early acidulated by the proximity of the sour
                    cream. The latter is either stirred repeatedly, or poured from one vessel to
                    another, to prevent the formation of a tough coat upon it before enough is
                    accumulated for a churning. In large dairies it is usual to churn daily. Three
                    days is as long as the cream can ordinarily be kept for butter of good quality.
                    In the New York butter factories the milk rooms are thoroughly ventilated, and
                    are provided with tanks sunk in the ground, and having a depth of 18 inches of
                    flowing water for cooling the milk whilst it is throwing up its cream. The
                    temperature of the water should be between the limits of 48° and 56 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> n</hi> Fahr. The uniform temperature of the cream is said to
                    have a favourable effect on the churning. When a cow has recently calved, her
                    milk is comparatively rich in butter and poor in curd; but by and by the
                    relative proportions of these constituents are reversed, the cream diminishing
                    and the milk becoming thicker. A very sensible change in the quality usually
                    takes place when a cow becomes pregnant, so that in not a few cases double or
                    treble the ordinary length of time is required to churn the cream, and the
                    butter produced is of inferior quality. If cows are flurried and heated, either
                    by gadding in the pasture, or by being overdriven in bringing them home for
                    milking, their milk becomes peculiarly liable to corrupt, the yield of butter is
                    sensibly lessened, and its quality is impaired. The success of the process of
                    churning depends much on the temperature of the cream being nicely regulated.
                    Experiments have shown that a temperature of from 54° to 59° Fahr., both of the
                    air and of the cream, is the best for churning. The temperature of the cream
                    usually rises about 10° during this process. Advantage is derived from rinsing
                    the churn with cold water in summer and with warm water in winter. The addition
                    to the cream of small quantities of cold or hot water, as the case requires, is
                    also found beneficial. Box or barrel churns are preferred when the cream only is
                    churned, the former being best adapted for small dairies, and the latter for
                    large ones. When the whole milk and cream are churned together, it is
                    indispensable that acidulation and coagulation should first take place, and the
                    churnings should not be at longer intervals than every second day. When the milk
                    is gathered for more than two days some of it is past the proper stage of
                    acidulation at the time of churning, or part of it has not reached that stage.
                    The time required to produce butter from whole milk is much longer than with
                    cream alone, three hours being an average period. The plunge churn is most
                    appreciated for this practice: and in large dairies it is usually worked by
                    steam, <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n806/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0806-0771"/> water, or horse-power. Forty strokes of the
                    piston per minute has been found a good rate of working, but, according to a
                    report on American butter factories, the best rate is fifty strokes per minute.
                    The most suitable dasher for the barrel churn is either circular or cross-shaped
                    with broad wings, and should have a diameter equal to about three-fourths of
                    that of the central portion of the churn. The speed of working is kept slow
                    until the cream is thoroughly mixed; it may then be increased to the normal
                    rate. When the butter begins to come, the speed, if rapid, should be slackened.
                    The residual buttermilk is removed from the butter by kneading either with or
                    without water. The water should be entirely free from sediment, and not very
                    hard. Generally brine is preferable to water alone for washing. The method of
                    churning introduced into America by Mr John Higgins of Speedsville, New York,
                    consists in adding cold water twice or thrice at short intervals to the contents
                    of the churn, so as to lower the temperature to about <hi rend="italic">55°</hi>
                    Fahr. The dasher, which now does not rise above the surface of the cream, is
                    worked at half speed, and the butter is produced quite pure, in large-sized,
                    hard, and compact granules; the adherent buttermilk can be readily separate d by
                    rinsing a couple of times in water, and the butter is then ready for
                    salting.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Clotted Cream.—</hi> In Devonshire a method of treating the
                    milk has long been in use for the production of what is called clotted or
                    “clouted” cream. The new milk is strained into shallow earthenware pans, in each
                    of which half a pint of water has previously been placed to prevent the milk
                    from adhering to the pan in the subsequent process of scalding; after twelve
                    hours the pans are placed over a charcoal fire, or on a hot plate, or are
                    immersed in cold water in a shallow boiler, which is then heated until the
                    temperature of the milk rises to 180°, after which they are again replaced in
                    the milk-room (great care being taken to preserve the surface of cream
                    unbroken), and allowed to stand the usual time. The scalding effects the
                    separation of the whole of the cream from the milk, and greatly facilitates its
                    conversion into butter. This is readily accomplished by placing the cream in a
                    small tub, and working it with the hand or a piece of flat wood. The butter made
                    from it is said by some persons to be altogether superior to that made without
                    scalding, and also to keep better; whereas others assert, and with good show of
                    truth, that it contains an undue proportion of cheesy matter, and in consequence
                    is more liable to rancidity than other butter.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Lancashire Method.—</hi> A mode of procedure in use in some
                    Lancashire dairies has been much commended. The first drawn and larger portion
                    of the new milk is set aside, and the cream obtained from it is mixed, at the
                    time of churning, with the strippings or afterings, which contain the greater
                    part of the butter obtained at milking. The labour of churning the whole of the
                    milk is thus obviated, and a larger yield of butter is said to be obtained than
                    when the cream only is churned.</p>
                <p>The separation of the butter from the milk is not so complete as to secure the
                    absence of some oily matter in the whey, and, on the other hand, of a portion of
                    caseous matter in the butter. Cheese, being a nitrogenous substance, is
                    peculiarly susceptible of putrefaction, and hence even the smallest portion of
                    it present in butter is sure in a very short time tocorrupt the whole mass and
                    to impart to it a rancid flavour. Besides this liability to taint, butter, like
                    other fatty substances, readily absorbs odours of all kinds; and if cream or
                    butter is kept in the same apartment with tainted meat, or other decaying
                    matter, or is stored in vessels that have previously contained any rancid
                    substance, or is exposed to the exhalations of dung-heaps and stables, it is
                    sure to become contaminated. By washing the newly-churned butter repeatedly in
                    cold water, and at the same time working a little salt into it, not only the
                    whey, but the greater part of the caseous matter above referred to, can be
                    removed, and the tendency to rancidity is overcome. If the butter is to be used
                    fresh, it is immediately made into rolls or pats; but if it is to be cured, half
                    an ounce of fine salt is added for each pound of the butter, and thoroughly
                    incorporated with it; and the mass, after lying a day, is again worked over, and
                    then packed into a perfectly clean air-tight vessel. In domestic use the most
                    convenient vessels are jars of glazed earthenware. Market butter is put into
                    casks called half-firkins, firkins, and tubs, containing respectively 28 ft), 56
                    lb, and 84 lb. These should be of well-seasoned oak, and made perfectly tight,
                    as otherwise the butter is sure to become tainted. Large quantities of butter
                    are also now disposed of in sealed tins. From the facilities which railways
                    afford for cheap and rapid carriage, a very great proportion of our home-made
                    butteT is sent to market in a fresh or only slightly salt state.</p>
                <p>The average yearly product of butter per cow in the butter dairies is usually
                    estimated at from 170 to 200 ft). This is in addition to the new milk used in
                    rearing the heifer calves required to keep up the stock, and to the butter
                    consumed in the farmer’s family.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Cheese Dairies.—</hi> Cheese-making is by far the most
                    difficult department of dairy management. Although the art is universally
                    practised, and the raw material is everywhere substantially the same, there is
                    perhaps no equally common product which varies so much in its quality and market
                    value, from mere diversity in the skill with which it is made. The difficulty of
                    producing really good cheese arises from the peculiar susceptibility of milk to
                    be influenced by a great variety of external causes, and the extreme facility
                    with which its component parts undergo chemical changes.</p>
                <p>Casein, the chief ingredient of cheese, is held in solution in milk by means of
                    an alkali. The effect of neutralizing this alkali is to produce insoluble
                    casein, which when dried forms cheese. When milk is allowed to stand,
                    coagulation takes place on account of the formation of lactic acid. There are
                    various substances which, when added to new milk, promote speedy coagulation.
                    The preparation which is invariably used for this purpose in British dairies is
                    rennet, provincially called <hi rend="italic">steep</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >yearning.,</hi> which is made from the stomachs of sucking calves. To cure
                    them, the stomachs, usually termed bags or veils, as soon as taken from the
                    animal, are turned inside out, carefully freed from all impurities, and salted.
                    They are then packed one upor another, with layers of salt between, into a deep
                    earthen ware vessel, and are covered over with salt, the air being excluded by a
                    close-fitting lid. In the best English dairies the skins are invariably kept for
                    a year previous to use. About a month before the rennet is needed, a sufficient
                    number of the skins are taken out of the jar, and when the brine has drained
                    from them, they are spread out upon a table, powdered on both sides with fine
                    salt, rolled with a paste roller, distended with a splint of wood, and hung up
                    to dry. The rennet is made the day before use by putting into a cup with half a
                    pint of lukewarm water and a tea-spoonful of salt a square inch of the bag for
                    each 10 gallons of milk to be curdled. The power of effecting coagulation is
                    attributed to the minute globular germs existing in prodigious quantities in the
                    steep. The production of these appears to be connected with a kind of decay in
                    the skin, which, however, if it goes too far, causes the cheese made to corrupt
                    prematurely, and renders it unwholesome. In some dairies as much of the rennet
                    is infused at one time as serves for several weeks, or even months; but the
                    practice of the best dairies is in favour of its daily or at most weekly
                    preparation. To produce cheese of the best quality it is indispensable that the
                    rennet be sweet am <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n807/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0807-0772"/> good, that only so much of it be used as will
                    suffice to effect perfect coagulation, and that this take place at a proper
                    temperature. Too much rennet makes a tough curd and a poor ill-flavoured cheese.
                    The time the milk takes to coagulate varies with different modes of
                    churning.</p>
                <p>The cheese dairy comprises a milk-room, working-room, salting and drying room,
                    and cheese-room. The workingroom is provided with two boilers—a smaller one for
                    heating water, and a larger one for heating whey. There are also lead tanks for
                    containing the fresh whey, and a cistern in which, after being scalded, it is
                    stored for the pigs. The cheese-tub is of wood or tinned iron—the latter being
                    best, as it admits of being thoroughly washed, whereas a wooden vessel, being
                    porous, is exceedingly apt to retain minute particles of milk or whey, which,
                    souring in the wood, become a source of mischief to the future contents. The
                    other utensils are lever presses, cheese vats of elm, turned out of the solid
                    and hooped with wood, pans of tinned iron or brass for heating milk by immersion
                    in hot water, a cheese ladder, a curd-breaker, a curd mill, and a
                    thermometer.</p>
                <p>In England the cows are milked twice a-day, at 5 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.m.</hi>
                    and 5 <hi rend="smallcaps">p.m.</hi> The whole available hands are engaged at
                    this work, that it may be accomplished speedily. Usually each person has seven
                    or eight cows to his share, and occupies about ten minutes in the milking of
                    each of them. The milk is carried to the dairy as fast as it is drawn from the
                    cows, and is there consigned to the care of the dairy-maid, who proceeds in her
                    treatment of it according to the variety of cheese to be produced. The kinds of
                    cheese in best estimation and of greatest market value are Stilton, Cheddar,
                    Cheshire, and Gloucester. The first variety is made in Leicestershire, and
                    contains the cream of one milking, added to the new milk of the next. The
                    Cheddar and Cheshire cheeses are made from new milk, or rather from milk in
                    which all its own cream is retained. Gloucester cheese is usually deprived of a
                    small portion of its cream. Double and single Gloucester differ only in the
                    former being twice the thickness and weight of the latter, and consequently
                    taking longer to ripen. The Scotch variety called Dunlop and the Gouda of
                    Holland are full-milk cheeses. Cheddar cheese is now generally made in Ayrshire
                    and the other cheesemaking counties in Scotland. The following is an abstract of
                    a report presented by Mr Drennan to the Ayrshire Agricultural Association in
                    1854, describing the method followed in Mrs Harding’s dairy in Somersetshire
                    :—</p>
                <p>Immediately after the morning milking, the milk is mixed with that of the
                    preceding evening, the whole being brought to the temperature of from 80° to 82°
                    Fahr, by heating a small quantity of the evening milk. In spring and towards
                    winter a small quantity of arnotto is used to improve the colour of the cheese.
                    It is put into the milk along with the rennet at 7 o’clock. After the rennet is
                    added, an hour is requisite for coagulation. At 8 o’clock the curd is partially
                    broken and allowed to subside a few minutes, in order that a small quantity of
                    whey may be drawn off to be heated. This whey is put into a tin vessel and
                    placed on a boiler in a separate apartment, to be heated in hot water. The curd
                    is then most carefully and minutely broken with utensils called shovel breakers,
                    and as much of the heated whey is mixed with it as suffices to raise it to the
                    temperature at which the rennet was added. Soon after 9 o’clock the work is
                    resumed. A few pailfuls of whey are drawn off and heated to a higher temperature
                    than at 8 o’clock. The curd is then broken as minutely as before; and after this
                    several pailfuls of heated whey are poured into the mass. During the pouring in
                    of the whey the stirring with the breakers is actively continued, in order to
                    mix the whole regularly, and not to allow any portion of the curd to become
                    overheated. The temperature at this time is raised to 100°, as ascertained by
                    the thermometer, and the . stirring is continued until, at length, the minutely
                    broken pieces of curd acquire a certain degree of consistency. The curd is then
                    left half an hour to subside. At the expiry of the half hour it has settled at
                    the bottom of the tub. Drawing off the whey is the next operation. The greater
                    proportion of the whey is lifted in a large tin bowl, and poured through a hair
                    sieve into the adjoining coolers. When the whey above the mass of curd is
                    removed, a spigot is turned at the bottom of the tub, and the remainder is
                    allowed to drain off without the application of pressure. To facilitate this
                    part of the work the tub is made with a convex bottom, and the curd is cut from
                    the sides of the tub and heaped up on the elevated centre, and left for an hour
                    with no other pressure than its own weight. It is then cut across in large
                    slices, turned over once on the centre of the tub, and left in a heap as before
                    for half an hour. The whey drips away toward the sides of the tub, and runs off
                    at the spigot; and, no pressure being applied, it continues to come away
                    comparatively pure. After undergoing this treatment the curd is ripe for the
                    application of pressure. If, as is usual, it be wanner than 60°, it is broken a
                    little by the hand and thrown upon a lead cooler to bring it down to the desired
                    temperature. It is then put into vats, and subjected to moderate pressure for
                    about an hour; aft.er which it is broken finely in a simple curd mill, mixed
                    with salt, and made up into cheeses. From 2 to 2| lb of salt may be given to one
                    cwt. of curd. The cheese is put into the lever-press at from two to three
                    o’clock of the day on which it is made; next morning it is reversed in the vat,
                    with a calico cloth upon it to give it a smooth surface; on the following
                    morning another fine cloth is put upon it; and after another day of the press it
                    is laid upou the shelf.</p>
                <p>Skilful management during the ripening of the cheese is now regarded as
                    indispensable to complete success. To enable a cheesemaker to come to the front
                    rank, he must have a good cheese-room, with means of regulating heat and
                    ventilation. Great attention is now paid to this important matter in many of the
                    Scotch dairies, and still more in the cheese factories of America.</p>
                <p>New-milk cheese, when skilfully made, consists not of the casein only, but
                    includes nearly all the butter of the milk. A portion of the latter is, however,
                    carried off in the whey, from which it is recovered by a simple process. The
                    whey is heated in a boiler to 180°, at which point a small quantity of sour
                    buttermilk is stirred into it, which has the instantaneous effect of causing all
                    the buttery matter to rise to the surface, from which it is skimmed off and put
                    into a jar. As soon as the buttermilk is put in, the fire is withdrawn to
                    prevent the whey from reaching the boiling point. The whey thus deprived of its
                    cream is run into a cistern, whence it is dealt out to the pigs. The whey-cream
                    is kept for three or four days until it thickens, and is then churned like
                    ordinary cream. About half a pound of this whey butter is obtained weekly from
                    each cow. Its value is about three-fourths of that of cream butter.</p>
                <p>According to the reports of 43 New York factories in 1869, from 9'14 to 10*11 lb
                    of milk is requisite to make 1 ft) of cured American cheese.</p>
                <p>In the province of Parma, in Italy, the annual quantity of milk used in
                    cheese-dairy farms was about the year 1872 estimated, in round numbers, at
                    1,540,700 gallons, yielding 855,400 ft) of “grana” or Parmesan cheese, 253,530
                    lb of butter, and 524,700 ft) of “ricotta,” a fresh common cheese made after the
                    butter and cream have been for the most part removed from the milk. In the hill
                    district 1000 litres of milk will produce 18 kilogrammes more butter, cheese,
                    and ricotta than in the plain. In the majority of the dairy farms work is
                    carried on during only six or eight months in the year.</p>
                <p>The following is an estimate of the amount, description, and cost of the year’s
                    food of an average Ayrshire milch cow on a good farm in the cheese and butter
                    producing districts, and the value of the produce :—</p>
