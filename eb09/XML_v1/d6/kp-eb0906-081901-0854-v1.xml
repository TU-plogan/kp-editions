                    traversing the southern part of Germany, Austria, Hungary, and the northern part
                    of Turkey, and falling into the Black Sea after a course of about 1750 (or,
                    including its windings, 2000) miles. Its basin, which comprises a territory of
                    nearly 300,000 square miles, is bounded by the Black Forest, some of the minor
                    Alpine ranges, the Bohemian Forest, and the Carpathian mountains on the north,

                    generally considered to be formed by the union, at Donaueschingen, of the
                    Brigach and the Brege, two mountain streams from the Black Forest; though a
                    third stream, originating in a spring in the palace garden of Donaueschingen, at
                    a height of about 2850 feet above the sea, is by some held to be the true
                    source. It seems probable, according to the investigations of Professor Knop of
                    Carlsruhe, that at Immardingen the infant river loses a good part of its waters
                    in the fissures of the soil, and thus gives rise to the Aach, which flows south
                    and joins the Rhine. After passing N.E. through the kingdom of Wiirtemberg and
                    part of Bavaria to Ratisbon, it turns to the S-E., and maintains that direction
                    till it approaches Lintz in Austria. From this town its course is in the main
                    easterly to Hungary, which it enters a little above Presburg. From Presburg it
                    flows S.E. through the lesser Hungarian plain to its confluence with the Raab,
                    whence it runs E. to Waitzen. At Waitzen it turns S., and flows with a slow
                    current and numerous windings through the greater plain of Hungary for nearly 2|
                    degrees of latitude. After its junction with the Drave it again takes a general
                    S.E. direction to Orsova, where it leaves the Austrian territories by the famous
                    pass of the Iron Gate, with once formidable rapids. From Orsova, its course is
                    generally S. by E. to Kalafat, thence mostly E. by S. to Sistova; it there takes
                    an E, by N. direction to Rassova, then turns N. to Galatz, and finally eastward
                    to the Black Sea. Among its 400 tributaries, of which upwards of 100 are
                    navigable, the principal are—on the right, the Iller, Lech, Iser, Inn, Ens,
                    Raab, Drave, Save, Morava, Timok, Isker, Vid, and Jantra; and on the left, the
                    Altmiihl, Nab, Regen, March, Waag, Gran, Theiss, Temes, Chyl, Aluta, Jalomnitza,
                    Sereth, and Pruth. The Danube communicates with the Rhine by means of the
                    Ludwigs-Canal, which unites the Altmiihl with the Main, with the Elbe by means
                    of the Moldau and other canals, and with the Theiss, its own tributary, by means
                    of the Franzens-Canal. The upper course of the river is regularly frozen over
                    all winter; and even the lower reaches are usually closed for a considerable
                    period. According to a British consular report in 1873, the river at Galatz
                    during the thirty-seven years from 1837 to 1873 remained open all winter only
                    eight times, namely, in 1839, 1846, 1852,1853, 1854, 1860, 1867, and 1873; the
                    date of the complete freezing over varied from Dec. 7 to Feb. 14; and the
                    breaking up of the ice occurred as early as Jan. 18, and as late as March 21.
                    This last event always causes great anxiety to the inhabitants; for, if the thaw
                    begins in the upper part of the stream, the waters rush down with tremendous
                    fury, and frequently do incalculable damage. When such a catastrophe is
                    apprehended, watchmen are stationed on eminences along the banks of the river,
                    to give notice by alarm guns when the ice is broken.</p>
                <p>At Ulm the Danube receives the Iller, and thus, at a height of 1400 feet above
                    the sea, becomes navigable for flat-bottomed boats of 100 tons. From Donauworth
                    to Passau it traverses the Bavarian plain, leaving which it intersects a
                    mountainous region till it reaches Vienna. At Passau it is 800 feet above the
                    level of the sea,, and at Vienna 450. From Vienna to the mouth of the Drave it
                    flows through an expanse of plain country, broken only in a few places, as at
                    Presburg, Buda, and Waitzen. At Isakcha the channel is 1700 feet broad and 50
                    feet deep. At extreme low water the total current is 70,000 cubic feet per
                    second, at ordinary low water 125,000, at ordinary high water 324,000, and
                    during extraordinary flood 1,000,000, and thus, on a general average from the
                    observations of 10 years, 207,000 feet per second. The total amount of alluvium
                    annually carried down by the river is calculated at 67,760,000 cubic feet; and,
                    according to M. Desjardins, the advance of the coast thus produced during the
                    Christian era is about 9 or 10 miles. About 15 miles below Isakcha the river
                    breaks up into two branches, of which the northern or Kilia branch forms an
                    irregular network of channels on its way to the sea, and, after reuniting into
                    one, gives rise to a secondary delta with nine or ten arms; while the southern
                    or Tultcha branch subdivides before long into the central or Sulina branch and
                    the southmost or St George’s. The delta thus formed comprises an area of about
                    1000 square miles, almost totally destitute of cultivation, and broken in all
                    directions by swamps and fresh-water lakes. Of the total burden of the river it
                    was calculated in 1857 that the Kilia branch carried down seventeen
                    twenty-sevenths, the Sulina branch two twenty-sevenths, and the St George’s
                    eight twentysevenths; but since that date the Tultcha St George’s branch has
                    grown shallower, and the volume of the Kilia has increased to about eighteen
                    twenty-sevenths, or two-thirds of the whole discharge.</p>
                <p>In the course of the present century a good deal has been done to render the
                    Danube more available as a means of communication. In 1816 Austria and Bavaria
                    made arrangements for the common utilization of the river; and since then both
                    Governments have been liberal in their outlays for its improvement. In 1830
                    steam-boats were introduced between Vienna and Pesth, under the encouragement of
                    Count Szechenyi, a steam-boat company having been started in 1828 by two
                    Englishmen, Andrews and Prichard. In 1834 the boats descended as far as Orsova,
                    and in 1835 they began to reach Galatz. About the same time the draining of the
                    Donaumoos, between Neuburg and Ingolstadt, which had been commenced in 1791, was
                    successfully prosecuted. In 1844 the Ludwigs-Canal was completed at a cost of
                    400,860,000 dollars; and in 1845 and 1853 the removal of the rocks which still,
                    in spite of the labours of Joseph II., obstructed the river below Grein was
                    finally achieved. In 1866 an imperial commission was established for the
                    rectification of the river bed in the neighbourhood of Vienna; and the proposal
                    to construct a new channel, supported by the engineers Abernethy and Sexauer,
                    was ultimately chosen as the most promising scheme. In terms of the Peace of
                    Paris, March 1856, the river not only was placed under <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n855/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0855-0820"/> the protection of international law, and declared
                    free to the ships of all nations, but a commission was constituted in November
                    of that year for the purpose of putting the deltaic portion in the best possible
                    state for navigation. It took the title of “European Commission of the Danube,”
                    and consisted of the following representatives of the seven powers who had
                    signed the treaty :—the Chevalier de Becke for Austria, Major Stokes, R.E., for
                    England, Monsieur Engelhardt for France, Herr Bitter for Prussia, Baron
                    d’Offenburg for Russia, the Marquis d’Aste for Sardinia, and Omar Fetzi Pasha
                    for Turkey. Sir Charles Hartley was appointed engineer-in-chief. The commission
                    fixed its seat at Galatz, and began its labours by establishing an engineering
                    factory and dep6t at Tultcha, and constructing a telegraph line between Sulina,
                    Tultcha, and Galatz; but, after a discussion which lasted from December 1857 to
                    April 1858, the delegates could not come to an agreement in regard to the
                    relative claims of the St George’s and the Sulina mouths, and had to refer the
                    question to their respective Governments. A technical commission appointed by
                    France, England, Prussia, and Sardinia decided unanimously in favour of St
                    George’s, but recommended, instead of the embankment of the natural channel, the
                    formation of an artificial canal closed by sluices at its junction with the
                    river, and reaching the sea at some distance from the natural embouchure. The
                    choice of St George’s made by this commission was adopted at Galatz in December
                    1858, and six of the seven representatives voted for the canalization; but,
                    owing to various political and commercial considerations, it was ultimately
                    decided to do nothing more in the meantime than render permanent and effective
                    the provisional works already commenced at the Sulina mouth. These consisted of
                    two piers, forming a seaward prolongation of the fluvial channel, and had been
                    commenced in 1858, according to Sir Charles Hartley’s plan calculated for a
                    period of six or eight years. In their permanent form they were completed on
                    31st July 1861, having required for their construction 200,000 tons of stone,
                    and 12,500 piles. The northern pier had a length of 4631 feet, the southern of
                    3000, and the depth of water in which they were built varied from 6 feet to 20
                    feet. At the commencement of the works the depth of the channel was only 9 feet,
                    but by their completion it had increased to 19 feet. Ten years afterwards it was
                    found expedient to make the total length of the piers 5332 and 3457 feet.
                    Various minor rectifications of the channel were also effected, and in 1865 a
                    lighthouse was established in 44° 51' N. lat. and 29^ 36' 32” E. long. The
                    expenses of 1857, 1858, 1859, and part of 1860 were provided by the Ottoman
                    Empire; but since that year the commission has been mainly indebted to a tax on
                    the shipping of the river. Of what value the works of Sulina have proved may be
                    shown by the fact that of 2928 vessels navigating the lower Danube in 1855, 36
                    were shipwrecked, while of 2676 in 1865 only 7 were thus unfortunate. By the
                    treaty of March 13, 1871, signed at London by the seven powers, the commission
                    is to exist for twelve years, and the works accomplished under its
                    superintendence are declared permanently neutral. It is independent of the
                    Roumanian Government, and has various sovereign powers over the Danube below
                    Isakcha, such as the control of the police, the collection of taxes, and the
                    disposal of its revenue. The same treaty authorizes the permanent commission of
                    the riparian states (Austria, Bavaria, Wiirtemberg, Turkey, Moldavia, Wallachia,
                    and Servia), which commenced its labours at Vienna in 1856, to collect a tax
                    from all the vessels navigating the river, in order to pay the expenses of the
                    proposed removal of the obstructions that still render dangerous the passage of
                    the Iron Gate.</p>
