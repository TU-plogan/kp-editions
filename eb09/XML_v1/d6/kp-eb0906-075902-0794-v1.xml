                    (1654-1720), a famous French scholar and translator from the classics, was born
                    at Saumur, probably in 1654. She was the daughter of Tanneguy Lefevre, a
                    self-educated scholar belonging to the Huguenots, who taught classics and edited
                    classical authors with a liveliness and enthusiasm which brought him some degree
                    of fame. At the age of eighteen Anne Lefevre lost her father. She then removed
                    to Paris, carrying with her part of an edition of Callimachus, which she
                    afterwards published, and which obtained for her an engagement as one of the
                    editors of the series of classical authors then being prepared <hi rend="italic"
                    >ad usum Delphini.</hi> In this series she edited Floras, Dictys Cretensis,
                    Aurelius Victor, and Eutropius. In 1681 appeared her prose version of Anacreon
                    and Sappho, which, though it was successful at the time, is wanting in the
                    delicate taste, the gaiety, and fire essential to a true translation. Within the
                    next few years she also published prose versions of Terence and some of the
                    plays of Plautus and Aristophanes, for the last of whom especially she cherished
                    the most intense admiration. In 1683 Anne Lefevre married André Dacier, once her
                    father’s favourite pupil. In the following year she accompanied her husband to
                    his native town of Castres, whither they retired with the professed object of
                    devoting themselves to theological studies. In 1685 the result was announced in
                    the conversion to Roman Catholicism of both M. and Mme. Dacier, and of many of
                    the townsfolk of Castres besides. The sincerity of this conversion, though it
                    brought with it court favour, it would be uncharitable to doubt; indeed the
                    tastes of Mme. Dacier and her husband were such as would render such a step most
                    natural. In 1711 appeared the prose translation of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Iliad</hi> (followed five years later by a similar translation of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Odyssey)</hi> which, through the spirit and enthusiasm which she
                    brought to the work, and the direct and simple strength of her sometimes homely
                    language, gained her the position she occupies in French literature. The
                    appearance of this version, which made Homer known for the first time to many
                    French men of letters, and among others to La Motte, gave rise to a famous
                    literary controversy. La Motte published a poetical version of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Iliad,</hi> which he look the liberty of greatly abridging and
                    altering to suit his own taste, together with a <hi rend="italic">Discours sur
                    Homére,</hi> stating the reasons why Homer failed to satisfy his critical taste
                    (1714). Mme. Dacier replied, in her work <hi rend="italic">Des Causes de la
                    Corruption de la Go</hi><hi rend="italic">û</hi><hi rend="italic">t</hi> (1714),
                    maintaining her opinions with a thorough enthusiasm for the ancients which
                    allowed no merit to the moderns, and with occasional flashes of not unhappy
                    banter. La Motte carried on the discussion with light gaiety and badinage, and
                    had the happiness of seeing his views supported by the indisputable erudition of
                    the Abbé Terrasson, who in 1715 produced two volumes, entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dissertation critique sur l'Iliade,</hi> in which he maintained that science
                    and philosophy, and especially the science and philosophy of Descartes, had so
                    cultured the human mind that, without doubt, the poets of the 18th century were
                    immeasurably superior to those of ancient Greece. The reply to this treatise was
                    undertaken by M. Dacier. In 1715 the dispute was settled. In that year, Pére
                    Buffier published <hi rend="italic">Homére en arbitrage</hi> (two letters to
                    Mme. Lambert, with a reply from her) in which he concludes that both parties are
                    really agreed as to the essential point that Homer was one of the greatest
                    geniuses the world has seen, and that, as a whole, no other poem can be
                    preferred to his; and, soon after, in the house of M. de Valincourt, Mme. Dacier
                    and La Motte met at supper, and drank together to the health of Homer. Nothing
                    of importance marks the rest of Mme. Dacier’s life. She assisted her husband,
                    for whom she seems to have cherished a high admiration, in his editions and
                    translations, and spent part of her latter years in writing notes on the
                    Scriptures, which were never published. She died at the Louvre, where her
                    husband was keeper of the library, on the 17th August 1720.</p>
