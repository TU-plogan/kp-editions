                    Princess</hi></label> (1744-1810), was the third daughter of Count Roman
                    Woronzoff, a member of the Russian senate, distinguished for his intellectual
                    gifts. She received an exceptionally good education, having displayed from a
                    very early age the masculine ability and masculine tastes which made her whole
                    career so singular. She was well versed in mathematics which she studied at the
                    university of Moscow and in general literature her favourite authors were Bayle,
                    Montesquieu, Boileau, Voltaire, and Helvetius. While still a girl she was
                    connected with the Russian court, and became one of the leaders of the party
                    that attached itself to the Grand Duchess (afterwards Empress) Catherine. Before
                    she was sixteen she married Prince Dashkoff, a prominent Russian nobleman, and
                    went to reside with him <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0866-0831"/> at Moscow. In 1762 she was at St Petersburg and
                    took a leading part, according to her own account <hi rend="italic">the.</hi>
                    leading part, in the <hi rend="italic">coup d'etat</hi> by which Catherine was
                    raised to the throne. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Catherine</hi> II., vol v. p.
                    233). Another course of events would probably have resulted in the elevation of
                    the Princess Dashkoff’s elder sister, Elizabeth, who was the imbecile and
                    unfortunate emperor’s mistress, and in whose favour he made no secret of his
                    intention to depose Catherine; but this fact, by inflaming the princess’s
                    jealousy, rather impelled her to the action she took than deterred her from it.
                    Her relations with the new empress were not of a cordial nature, though she
                    continued devotedly loyal. Her blunt manners, her unconcealed scorn of the male
                    favourites that disgraced the court, and perhaps also her sense of unrequited
                    merit, produced an estrangement between her and the empress, which ended in her
                    asking permission to travel abroad. The cause of the final breach was said to
                    have been the refusal of her request to be appointed colonel of the imperial
                    guards. Her husband having meanwhile died, she set out in 1768 on an extended
                    tour through Europe. She was received with great consideration at foreign
                    courts, and her literary and scientific reputation procured her the <hi
                    rend="italic">entree</hi> to the society of the learned in most of the capitals
                    of Europe. In Paris she secured the warm friendship and admiration of Diderot
                    and Voltaire. She showed in various ways a strong liking for England and the
                    English. She corresponded with Garrick, Dr Blair, and Principal Robertson; and
                    when in Edinburgh, where she was very well received, she arranged to intrust the
                    education of her son to Principal Robertson. In 1782 she returned to the Russian
                    capital, and was at once taken into favour by the empress, who strongly
                    sympathized with her in her literary tastes, and specially in her desire to
                    elevate Russ to a place among the literary languages of Europe. Immediately
                    after her return the princess was appointed “directeur” of the St Petersburg
                    Academy of Arts and Sciences; and in 1784 she was named the first president of
                    the Russian Academy, which had been founded at her suggestion. In both positions
                    she acquitted herself with marked ability. She projected the Russian dictionary
                    of the Academy, arranged its plan, and executed a part of the work herself. She
                    edited a monthly magazine; and wrote at least two dramatic works, <hi
                    rend="italic">The Marriage of Fabian,</hi> and a comedy entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Toissiokoff.</hi> Shortly before Catherine’s death the friends
                    quarrelled over a tragedy which the princess had allowed to find a place in the
                    publications of the Academy, though it contained revolutionary principles,
                    according to the empress. A partial reconciliation was effected, but the
                    princess soon afterwards retired from court. On the accession of the Emperor
                    Paul in 1796 she was deprived of all her offices, and ordered to retire to a
                    miserable village in the government of Novgorod, “to meditate on the events of
                    1762.” After a time the sentence was partially recalled on the petition of her
                    friends, and she was permitted to pass the closing years of her life on her own
                    estate near Moscow, where she died on the 4th January 1810.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the Princess DashJcoff written by herself</hi>
                    were published in 1840 in London in two volumes. They were edited by Mrs W.
                    Bradford, who, as Miss Wilmot, had resided with the Princess between 1803 and
                    1808, and had suggested their preparation.</p>
