                    Christian</hi></label> (1785-1860), a distinguished German historian and
                    politician, was born on the 13th May 1785, at Wismar. He studied philology at
                    the universities of Copenhagen and Halle, and at the age of twenty-five took his
                    doctor’s degree in that subject. He had already delivered lectures at Dresden;
                    and in 1812 he was appointed professor of history at Kiel. His devotion to
                    historical study had been caused by his wish to take a useful and intelligent
                    part in contemporary politics. In 1815 he was made secretary to the permanent
                    deputation of the prelates and nobles of Schleswig Holstein, in which position
                    his influence was exerted against the policy of the Danish Government, and he
                    henceforth took a prominent place among moderate liberals. In 1829 he was chosen
                    professor of the science of politics in the university of Gottingen. Two or
                    three years later he was engaged in drawing up the Hanoverian constitution of
                    1833. In 1837, when that constitution was abolished by Ernest Augustus, Dahlmann
                    so strongly opposed the king’s policy that he was banished from Hanover. He
                    retired to Leipsic, and then to Jena, where he gave his time to the study of
                    history and the production of his most important works. In 1842 Dahlmann became
                    professor of history and the science of politics at Bonn. In 1848 he was chosen
                    a member of the committee of seventeen which was appointed to draw up a new
                    German constitution; and he was elected member of the National Assembly of
                    Frankfort. He distinguished himself as an advocate of the election of the king
                    of Prussia as emperor of Germany. He was indeed so much regarded as a leader
                    that he was requested to form a ministry; but his attempt was unsuccessful. In
                    March 1849, when the Parliament rejected the constitution, Dahlmann, who had
                    been opposed to the armistice of Malmoe, retired, with many of his followers,
                    from the Parliament, and joined the assembly of Gotha, in which he still
                    advocated the unification of Germany under the king of Prussia. He also worked
                    in the same cause in the assembly of Erfurt and <pb break="no"

                    hopeless, he retired from politics; and the rest of his life was spent in study,
