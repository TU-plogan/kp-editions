                    (1605-1668), poet and dramatist, was bom in February 1605, at the Crown Inn,
                    Oxford, where his father was a wealthy vintner. It was stated that Shakespeare
                    always stopped at this house in passing through the city of Oxford, and out of
                    his known or rumoured admiration of the hostess, a very fine woman, there sprang
                    a scandalous story which attributed Davenant’s paternity to the greatest of
                    poets, a legend which there is reason to believe Davenant himself encouraged,
                    but which later criticism has cast aside as spurious. In 1621 the vintner was
                    made mayor of Oxford, and in the same year his son left the grammar-school of
                    All Saints, where his master had been Edward Sylvester, and was entered an
                    undergraduate of Lincoln College. He did not stay at the university, however,
                    long enough to take a degree, but was hurried away to appear at court as a page,
                    in the retinue of the gorgeous duchess of Richmond. From her service he passed
                    into that of Fulke Greville, Lord Brooke, in whose house he remained until the
                    murder of that eminent man in 1628. This blow threw him upon the world, not
                    altogether without private means, but greatly in need of a profitable
                    employment. He turned to the stage for subsistence, and in 1629 produced his
                    first play, the tragedy of <hi rend="italic">Albovine.</hi> It was not a very
                    brilliant performance, but it pleased the town, and decided the poet to pursue a
                    dramatic career. The next year saw the publication of <hi rend="italic">The
                    Cruel Brother,</hi> a tragedy, and <hi rend="italic">The Just Italian,</hi> a
                    tragi-comedy. Inigo Jones, the court architect, for whom Ben Jonson had long
                    supplied the words of masques and complimentary pieces, quarrelled with his
                    great colleague in the year 1634, and applied to William Davenant for verses.
                    The result was <hi rend="italic">The Temple of Love,</hi> performed by the queen
                    and her ladies at Whitehall on Shrove Tuesday, 1634, and printed in that year.
                    Another masque, <hi rend="italic">The Triumphs of the Prince B’Amour,</hi>
                    followed in 1635. The poet returned to the legitimate drama by the publication
                    of three of his cleverest and most successful pieces, the. tragi-comedy of <hi
                    rend="italic">Love and Honour,</hi> in 1635, and the tragicomedy of <hi
                    rend="italic">The Platonic Lovers,</hi> and the famous comedy of <hi
                    rend="italic">The Wits,</hi> in 1636. The masque of <hi rend="italic">Britannia
                    Triumphant</hi> brought him into some trouble, for it was suppressed, as a
                    punishment for its first performance having .been arranged for a Sunday. By thia
                    time Davenant had, however, thoroughly ingratiated himself with the court; and
                    on the death of Ben Jonson in 1637 he was rewarded with the office of
                    poet-laureate, to the exclusion of May, who con sidered himself entitled to the
                    honour. It was shortly after this event that Davenant collected his minor
                    lyrical pieces into a volume entitled <hi rend="italic">Madagascar and other
                    Poems,</hi> 1638: and in 1639 he became manager of the new theatre <pb

                    check upon thi3 prosperous career; and he was among the most active partisans of
                    royalty through the whole of that struggle for supremacy. As early as May 1642,
                    Davenant was accused before the Long Parliament of being mainly concerned in a
                    scheme to seduce the army to overthrow the Commons. He was accordingly
                    apprehended at Faversham, and imprisoned for two months in London; he then
                    attempted to escape to France, and succeeded in reaching Canterbury, where he
                    was re-captured. Escaping a second time, he made good his way to the queen, with
                    whom he remained in France until he volunteered to carry over to England some
                    military stores for the army of his old friend the earl of Newcastle, by whom he
                    was induced to enter the service as lieutenant-general of ordnance. He acquitted
                    himself with so much bravery and skill that, after the siege of Gloucester, in
                    1643, he was knighted by the king. After the battle of Naseby, he retired to
                    Paris, where he became a Roman Catholic, and spent some months in the
                    composition of his epic poem of <hi rend="italic">Gondibert.</hi> In 1650 he
                    took the command of a colonizing expedition that set" sail from France to
                    Virginia, but was captured in the Channel by a Parliamentary man-of-war, which
                    took him back to the Isle of Wight. Imprisoned in Cowes Castle until 1651, he
                    tempered the discomfort and suspense of his condition by continuing the
                    composition of <hi rend="italic">Gondibert.</hi> He was sent up to the Tower to
                    await his trial for high treason, but just as the storm was about to break over
                    his head, all cleared away. It is believed that the personal intercession of
                    Milton led to this result. Davenant, released from prison, immediately published
                    <hi rend="italic">Gondibert,</hi> the work on which his fame mainly rests, a
                    chivalric epic in the stanza of <hi rend="italic">Nosce Teipsum,</hi> the
                    influence of which poem i3 strongly marked in its philosophical passages. It is
                    a cumbrous, dull poem, but is relieved with a multitude of fine and felicitous
                    passages, and lends itself most happily to quotation. During the civil war one
                    of his plays had been printed, th© tragedy of <hi rend="italic">The Unfortunate
                    Lovers,</hi> in 1643. He found that there were many who desired him to
                    recommence his theatrical career. Such a step, however, was absolutely forbidden
                    by Puritan law. Davenant, therefore, by the help of some influential friends,
                    obtained permission to open a sort of theatre at Rutland House, in Charterhouse
                    Yard, where, on the 21st of May 1656, he began a series of representations,
                    which he called <hi rend="italic">operas,</hi> as an inoffensive term. This word
                    was then first introduced into our language. The opening piece was his own <hi
                    rend="italic">Siege of Rhodes,</hi> printed the same year, which was performed
                    with stage-decorations and machinery of a kind hitherto quite unthought of in
                    England. He continued until the Restoration to produce ephemeral works of this
                    kind, only one of which, <hi rend="italic">The Cruelty of the Spaniards in
                    Peru,</hi> in 1658, was of sufficient literary merit to survive. In 1660 he had
                    the infinite satisfaction of being able to preserve the life of that glorious
                    poet who had, nine years before, saved his own from a not less imminent danger.
                    The mutual relations of Milton and Davenant do honour to the generosity of two
                    men who, sincerely opposed in politics, knew how to forget their personal anger
                    in their common love of letters. Under Charles II., Davenant flourished in the
                    dramatic world; he opened a new theatre in Lincoln’s Inn Fields, which he called
                    the Duke’s j and he introduced a luxury and polish into the theatrical life
                    which it had never before known in England. Under his management, the great
                    actors of the Restoration, Betterton and his coevals, took their peculiar French
                    style and appearance; and the ancient simplicity of the English stage was
                    completely buried under the tinsel of decoration and splendid scenery. Davenant
                    brought out six new plays in the Duke’s Theatre, <hi rend="italic">The Rivals,
                    The Man’s the Master,</hi> comedies translated from Scarron, <hi rend="italic"
                    >News from Plymouth, The Distresses, The Siege, The Fair Favourite,</hi>
                    tragicomedies, all of which were printed after his death, and not one of which
                    survived their author on the stage. He died on the 17th of April 1668, and two
                    days afterwards was buried in Poet’s Corner, Westminster Abbey, with the
                    inscription “0 rare Sir William Davenant 1” In 1672 his writings were collected
                    in folio. His last work had been to travesty Shakespeare’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tempest,</hi> in company with Dryden.</p>
                <p>The personal character, adventures, and fame of Davenant, and more especially his
                    position as a leading reformer, or rather debaser, of the stage, have always
                    given him a prominence in the history of literature which his writings hardly
                    justify. His plays are utterly unreadable, and his poems are usually stilted and
                    unnatural. With Cowley, he marks the process of transition from the poetry of
                    the imagination to the poetry of the intelligence; but he had far less genius
                    than Cowley, and his influence on our drama must be condemned as wholly
                    deplorable. <hi rend="smallcaps">(e.w.g.)</hi></p>
