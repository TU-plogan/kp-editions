                    (1791-1860), was born 25th August 1791, at Corbach, an old town in Waldeck, one
                    of the the smallest of German principalities. He was of honourable but humble
                    origin. His father, to eke out the scanty subsistence provided by his few acres
                    of land, had entered a regiment “granted” to Holland by the prince. Without
                    promotion or encouragement, he attended conscientiously to the drudgery of his
                    post during twenty-nine long years, to return at last, in 1789, a widower, with
                    broken health and a miserable pension. Brighter days were in store for him
                    through the affections of his second wife and the birth of Christian. It is on
                    record, how joyous were the evenings in that old-fashioned Corbach home, when,
                    after reading a chapter from the family Bible, and devoutly praying with his
                    household, the kindly old man loved to prune, by pithy remarks and snatches of
                    proverbial lore, the redundant enthusiasm and all-embracing fervour of his son.
                    To the latter, success and a host of fond admirers seem from the first never, to
                    have been wanting. Nor did humility of demeanour, exquisite sympathy with all
                    men, and an almost unexampled power of work ever fail him. The Corbach grammar
                    school was brilliantly passed, and after it a first year of university studies,
                    at Marburg, devoted to divinity. But Göttingen in those days attracted all
                    superior minds, and the youth of eighteen found himself on his way thither with
                    the last savings from his father’s purse, intent upon appeasing his desire for
                    those wider regions of philological and historical learning in which he knew his
                    strength must lie. Again all avenues of outward success opened to the
                    unpretending student; although so young he was entrusted with lessons at the
                    Latin school, and soon after with the office of private tutor to W. C. Astor,
                    only son of the well-known merchant king of New York.<note anchored="true"

                    an hour of genuine enthusiasm they one and all vowed to aspire. “Right royal in
                    all his ways,” as a poet has fitly described him, he sympathized with the
                    favourite pursuits of each, wrestled with all, made them to love each other, and
                    held high among them the ideals of youth and of science. It was quite a day of
                    rejoicing in Göttingen when Bunsen had won the university prize essay of the
                    year 1812 by a treatise on the <hi rend="italic">Athenian Law of
                    Inheritance,</hi> and again a few months later when the university of Jena
                    grauted him, unsolicited, the honorary degree of doctor of philosophy.</p>
                <p>The time had now come for Mr Astor to travel. Bunsen had seen little of the world
                    before then. Only one journey had he made, but that one was to Weimar, and in
                    company with Arthur Schopenhauer, one of his Göttingen acquaintances, a man of
                    genius, whose fate it has been to live unknown and to become after death not
                    famous only, but the founder of a numerous and turbulent school of
                    metaphysicians. Bunsen was introduced to Goethe, and bore away the impress of
                    the society that assembled around the great poet. In 1813, a journey was
                    undertaken to South Germany, during which Mr Astor was well pleased to see his
                    friend revelling in the company of choice spirits at each centre of intellect,
                    and shared in his exultation over the crushing blow that had fallen upon
                    Napoleon at Leipsic. Some months later they separated at Göttingen, Astor to
                    return to New York, with an understanding that they would meet for further
                    travel two years later, and Bunsen to resume his studies which had lost nothing
                    of their vast range. It seemed to Bunsen a purpose not exceeding the limits of a
                    man’s life to comprehend the history of all Teutonic races in religion, laws,
                    language, and literature. That was the heroic age of comparative philology; and
                    thus we see Bunsen, who had read Hebrew when a boy, plunging into Arabic at
                    Munich, Persian at Leyden, and Norse at Copenhagen, as opportunities offered for
                    each.</p>
                <p>At the close of 1815 Bunsen found bis way to Berlin, to lay before Niebuhr the
                    historian what was then already a many years’ plan of learned inquiry. This step
                    led to important consequences in the life of Bunsen. Niebuhr not only approved
                    of the Titanic scheme, and hoped that Prussia, in which all the hope of Germans
                    then began to be centred, would in time find money for assisting it, but so
                    powerful an impression did he receive on that occasion, that when they met again
                    two years later, Niebuhr, having meanwhile become Prussian envoy to the Papal
                    court, exerted all his influence to draw Bunsen into official life. Of the two
                    intervening years it will suffice to relate that they had been spent by Bunsen
                    in assiduous labour among the libraries and collections of Paris and Florence,
                    whither the hope of meeting his former pupil, Mr Astor, had led him; and that he
                    contracted during his stay in the capital of France a love for the peculiar
                    graces of French genius which never left him through life.</p>
                <p>Fascinated by the condescending friendship of Niebuhr, by the glories of Rome,
                    and also by the charms of English society, Bunsen continued his stay in that
                    city. In July 1817 he married Miss Waddington, eldest daughter and co-heiress of
                    Mr B. Waddington of Llanover, Monmouthshire. Even then his purposes in life
                    remained purely scientific. Little did he dream that the Eternal City was to
                    become his home for twenty-one years, or that one of the most difficult problems
                    of European diplomacy would there be entrusted to his hands.</p>
                <p>When Niebuhr obtained the consent of his Government for the appointment of Bunsen
                    as secretary of the Roman embassy, negotiations were being actively carried on
                    between Berlin and Rome for a new establishment of the Papal Church in the
                    Prussian dominions. This had become necessary, since 1815, by the addition of
                    several millions of Catholics to the population of that mainly Protestant
                    country, of which they now formed no less than two-fifths. An agreement was the
                    fruit of these labours, by which the king of Prussia allowed the publication
                    within his dominions of a Papal bull (called <hi rend="italic">De salute
                    animarum),</hi> circumscribing the Catholic dioceses, and determining the
                    position of the Romanist hierarchy. During this period of initiation into the
                    mysteries of Papal statecraft, Bunsen had occasion to learn that the Vatican
                    began, under the fostering care of the Jesuit order, to revive from the
                    inanition into which the French Revolution and its effects had thrown it. So
                    universal and so strong was the wave of reaction in those days throughout
                    Europe, that Protestant and Catholic rulers agreed in the conviction that of all
                    conservatism the apex and supreme exponent must be the Pope, as representing
                    “the most ancient succession of sovereigns,” as “upholder of things as they
                    are.” Considering themselves the Pope’s born allies, they closed their eyes to
                    that stealthy encroachment of absolute Romish power into the dioceses within
                    their territory with which the present generation is becoming, acquainted in
                    America as well as in Europe. Bunsen was among those who first discerned the
                    coming danger. To direct official attention towards it, to ward it off by
                    fairness and impartiality towards his Catholic fellowsubjects, to preserve
                    religious peace in his country, thenceforward became the main object of his
                    official labours.</p>
                <p>At first his success was great. In Berlin the king and his minister, and at Rome
                    each successive Pope and his cardinal secretary, bestowed upon him every mark of
                    confidence and even of affection. King Frederick William III, had made his
                    acquaintance as early as 1822 during a brief stay at Rome, and had taken
                    unwonted pleasure not only in his conversation generally, but even in the
                    outspoken but elegant frankness with which Bunsen defended his views when at
                    variance with one or two of his sovereign’s favourite theories. He evinced his
                    appreciation of the youthful diplomatist by desiring him to undertake the
                    legation after Niebuhr’s retirement from his office.</p>
                <p>In the Papal Government, also, Bunsen’s honest endeavours to preserve a good
                    understanding were readily acknowledged, and formed the basis for one of the
                    rarest life friendships, and yet a most real one, with Monsignor Capaccini, the
                    confidential adviser of successive Popes in foreign affairs, who never swerved
                    from his principle of both receiving and meeting every communication of the
                    Prussian envoy with equal trust and truthfulness.</p>
                <p>A few words will explain the causes which eventually led to a failure of Bunsen’s
                    pacific efforts. Marriages between Romanists and Protestants (or so-called mixed
                    marriages) had formerly been of rare occurrence in Prussia. Before the iron will
                    of Frederick the Great, the naïve demands of the hierarchy of Silesia—the chief
                    of which is a promise on oath that all children shall be brought up as
                    Catholics—had dwindled into a passive attitude on their part. After the
                    accession of Rhineland and Westphalia to the Prussian monarchy had added to the
                    frequency of such marriages, it was truly fortunate that a prelate of moderate
                    views in matters ecclesiastical and a good patriot—Count Spiegel—held the
                    archiépiscopal see of Cologne (1825). With him, who forbade processions of his
                    own accord as leading to immorality, and who favoured a more enlightened
                    education of candidates for holy orders, an arrangement which would leave the
                    consciences of spouses and priests unviolated was practicable. It was easily
                    obtained by Bunsen’s personal negotiation with the archbishop. The other
                    Prussian bishops also consented; but such was the slothfulness of the absolute
                    king’s Government, that the death of that wise archbishop (1835) occurred before
                    its ratification, and such their blindness to reality that they <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n584/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0584-0523"/> offered to promote a narrow-minded ascetic, Baron
                    Droste, to the vacant post. “Is your king mad ?” bluntly exclaimed the
                    cardinal-secretary whilst hastening to accept, on the part of the Vatican, the
                    proffered tool of Papal aggression! Before two years had passed the religious
                    strife was in a blaze everywhere,—Jesuit advisers more eagerly listened to at
                    Rome, Prussian bishops all but unanimous in their opposition against moderate
                    counsels, and (so the Government was informed) the leadership of these
                    machinations against the internal peace of Prussia entrusted to members of that
                    uniformly Ultramontane body, the Belgian bishops. In this extremity Bunsen was
                    again summoned to Berlin from his post. It is difficult at this distance of time
                    to discern how far the advice he may have given was founded upon too sanguine a
                    view both of the power of an absolute king, unaided by an emancipated public
                    opinion, a free press, or a parliament, and of the intensity of the agitation
                    raging in Catholic districts. But this much is known that, when the seizure of
                    the chief offender in his archiépiscopal palace at Cologne was resolved upon,
                    Bunsen understood that the archbishop would forthwith be placed before the
                    ordinary judges of the country for disobedience to its laws. This was never
                    done, and the seizure was so mismanaged that the incriminating documents are
                    said to have been destroyed before the judicial authorities had set foot in the
                    palace. Thus a complete failure was the result of this very unsafe step. The
                    Government thought it easier to leave Bunsen unsupported when, after his return
                    to Rome, he courageously attempted to convince the Vatican of the archbishop’s
                    guilt, and, in the hope of burying the matter in oblivion, they accepted
                    Bunsen’s offer of resignation, in April 1838. It may not be irrelevant to
                    mention here that the king’s successor, Frederick William IV., on his elevation
                    to the throne in 1840, released Baron Droste from prison. This romantic king
                    established his policy towards the Vatican on the principle of granting liberty
                    of action to the Papal power,—a liberty so well employed both before and since
                    the revolution of 1848, that at this moment (1876) all the energies of a
                    powerful chancellor and a united Germany are taxed to the utmost to find a basis
                    for harmonious coexistence between modern states and the hierarchy of Rome.</p>
                <p>When Bunsen left the Eternal City a politically disappointed man, he was able,
                    nevertheless, to look back upon a term of years filled with everything that
                    could adorn life— intense domestic contentment, intimacy with distinguished men
                    of every nation who had sojourned in Rome during his twenty-one years’ residence
                    there, success in establishing institutions which, like the Archaeological
                    Institute, the German Hospital, and the Protestant chapel, have outlived his
                    stay, experience in public affairs, and a deepening of his religious
                    convictions. Religion had become the centre of his most tender emotions, of his
                    intellectual activity, of his practical aspirations. To restore to the Bible
                    that place in the households of his country which it had possessed in the first
                    generations after the Reformation, to revive the knowledge and the love of the
                    German reformers’ hymns, to give his people such a Book of Common Prayer,
                    resting upon the liturgies of all Christian ages, as would help congregations
                    in“presenting themselves a living sacrifice,” to rekindle the fervour of other
                    days for works of self-devotion and charity, to work out a Christian philosophy
                    of history,—such were the purposes to which he devoted his happiest and best
                    hours in each succeeding year. Whilst he was at Rome a book of ancient hymns and
                    a liturgy were printed.</p>
                <p>Bunsen always looked back in later years upon his Roman time as men are apt to
                    remember their college days. Right joyous had been his intercourse with artists
                    such as Thorwaldsen, Rauch, Wolff, Cornelius, Schnorr, Overbeck, Schinkel, Felix
                    Mendelssohn. He had become one of the best-informed men among art-collections,
                    and was so attracted by the charms of Roman topography as to surrender to the
                    temptation of contributing volumes to the German <hi rend="italic">Description
                    of Rome.</hi></p>
                <p>Few strangers have ever lived on terms of greater intimacy with Italians, or
                    possessed a more entire command of their language than Bunsen. He was a believer
                    in their national revival and political future at a time when Italy was “a
                    geographical expression” only and when her art treasures and her blue sky were
                    her only acknowledged qualities. Among Americans Mr Ticknor; among Russians
                    Italinsky, Joukovsky, and Al. Tourgenieffj; among Frenchmen the Due de Blacas,
                    Comte de St Aulaire, Chateaubriand, Champollion, Ampère, and others became his
                    friends. But his most cherished intercourse was with English visitors and
                    residents,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>One of these,
                    and a very valued correspondent of Bunsen, was Lord Clifford, well known as a
                    devout Roman Catholic. He had made the struggle between Berlin and the Vatican
                    the subject of earnest study, and was enabled by his high social position to
                    obtain from documents a more dispassionate view of it than, perhaps, any
                    contemporary witness of the events. His testimony, therefore, expressed in a
                    letter to Bunsen of 31st March 1838, may claim a place in this sketch. Lord
                    Clifford writes,—“Your public career here has been of benefit to the peace of
                    Europe.”</p></note> to which he owed an acquaintance with British life such as
                    has rarely been possessed by any foreigner who never had set foot in this
                    country.</p>
                <p>Towards England, then, did he turn his face in 1838 to enjoy the leisure
                    occasioned by his removal from the Capitol, and in England, except when he held
                    a brief diplomatic appointment as Prussian ambassador to Switzerland from 1839
                    to 1841, the remainder of his official life was spent.</p>
                <p>Between the Crown Prince of Prussia and Bunsen a very close intimacy had sprung
                    up ever since they met at Berlin in 1828. They were attracted to each other by
                    similarity of literary tastes, of poetic temperament, and of religious
                    aspiration. In their enthusiasm for each other, the prince as well as the public
                    servant fondly hoped, year after year, that diversity of character and of
                    self-grown conviction, however marked, would tend rather to compensate defects
                    than to disturb harmonious action. Their correspondence lately published (in
                    part) by Ranke, the historian, shows the truthfulness and the durability of this
                    remarkable friendship, and helps to explain why its results were, not
                    commensurate to the moral worth and intellectual capacity of the men who were
                    united by it.</p>
                <p>The new king had no sooner ascended the throne under the name of Frederick
                    William IV. than he contemplated the erection of an Anglo-Prussian bishopric at
                    Jerusalem, intended to represent European Protestantism as a united power, and
                    to give a rallying point to Protestant missions in Syria and Palestine. The time
                    seemed propitious for this fantastic scheme. The four allied powers, under the
                    leadership of Great‘Britain, had reinstated the sultan in the possession of
                    Syria. The Turkish Government would therefore readily grant a similar
                    representation to Protestant churches to that possessed by Orthodox Greeks and
                    Roman Catholics. · King Frederick William summoned Bunsen to his capital, and
                    instructed him to negotiate in London the establishment of such a bishopric on
                    Mount Zion. In an incredibly short time (June to November 1841) Bunsen succeeded
                    in bringing it about, with the English Government’s courteous assent, and the
                    energetic furtherance of the archbishop of Canterbury and the bishop of London,
                    Prussia paying in a capital which secured one-half of its endowment, whilst the
                    other half was to be raised in England. Much suspicion was felt and opposition
                    raised against any association of the Church of England with German
                    Protestantism, in both countries alike, though from <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0585-0524"/> opposite motives. To Bunsen this “special
                    mission” brought in a rich harvest of friendly feeling among the leaders of both
                    parliamentary parties, so that when Queen Victoria selected his name out of
                    three proposed by the chivalrous courtesy of the Prussian king for the post of
                    Prussian ambassador, he found himself well received by all classes of English
                    society The king’s visit to England in February 1842, as sponsor to the Prince
                    of Wales, helped to prove the earnest desire of Prussia to seek the friendship
                    of Great Britain. An event, however, which directed the eyes of the British
                    public even more to Bunsen than royal favour was the publication of Arthur
                    Stanley’s <hi rend="italic">Life of Dr Arnold,</hi> in whose private letters an
                    admiration amounting almost to enthusiasm for his German friend was expressed
                    with a fervour unusual to Arnold’s stately reserve. Although not palatable to
                    the growing ritualistic school, and not always considered a safe theologian by
                    the partizan leaders of the Low Church, Bunsen retained to the last the
                    affection of the British nation, among whom he spent thirteen eventful
                    years.</p>
                <p>In the year 1844 his advice was asked by the king on the constitutional
                    changes,—from absolutism to a representative government,—upon which Prussia,
                    although in a first-rate financial military and administrative condition, fouud
                    herself irresistibly constrained to enter. His advice, though studiously
                    conservative, was considered of too sweeping a nature, and the king contented
                    himself in 1847 with convoking an assembly composed of all members of the eight
                    provincial diets of the monarchy, and clothed with scarcely any constitutional
                    powers</p>
                <p>On the question of church organization, also, the king and his friend were fated
                    to disagree more strongly than they had expected. Bunsen’s views had developed
                    into a system essentially Presbyterian, though with an Episcopal headship. He
                    held up the constitution of the Episcopal Church of America as, perhaps, the
                    best type to follow, because it contained personal rule organically allied to
                    the free power of the laity. He recommended these ideas to his countrymen as
                    well as to his sovereign in a book entitled <hi rend="italic">The Church of the
                    Future,</hi> which has not been without influence in the church constitution now
                    (1876) about to become law in Prussia.</p>
                <p>The king’s expectations of a quiet time for maturing his work of reconstruction
                    in church and state were rudely broken in upon by the French Revolution of
                    February 1848. Bunsen’s warning voice had been raised in vain; the discontent of
                    the educated classes helped to weaken the distracted councils of Frederick
                    William IV., and, though a constitution was eventually promulgated, Prussian
                    politics succumbed under the tutelage of the Austrian premier, Prince
                    Schwarzenberg, in 1849 Bunsen’s diplomatic labours were mainly directed to
                    settle, as German commissioner, the dispute with Denmark about the duchies of
                    Holstein and Schleswig, Great Britain having offered her mediation. In these
                    duchies a strong agitation of several years’ standing had roused the German
                    population, which occupies the whole of the former and part of the latter, to
                    oppose the centralizing tendencies of the Danish Government. During the troubles
                    of March 1848 they had taken up arms against Denmark and found assistance in
                    Germany, then for the first time aspiring again to the position of a national
                    power. This disturbance of the public peace of Europe was, however, regarded
                    with so much disfavour by all powers, and secretly also by the sovereigns of
                    Prussia and Austria, that the Danes obtained, in 1852, a European protocol,
                    which reversed the political autonomy of the two duchies, and settled the crown
                    of Denmark, after the death of the king and his son, upon Prince Christian of
                    Glücksburg. It was the fate of Bunsen to be obliged to add his signature to this
                    protocol, although it contained an abrogation of those “constitutional rights of
                    Schleswig and Holstein,” upon which he had dilated in a <hi rend="italic">Letter
                    to Viscount Palmerston,</hi> printed in April 1848.</p>
                <p>The unity of Germany was another of those wishes in which Bunsen and his royal
                    patron had been one ever since the beginning of their acquaintance, and yet
                    found themselves widely apart when the question came to be practically tested.
                    The king sincerely aimed at the resuscitation of the venerable German empire,
                    fancying that the leadership within the federation of sovereigns might be
                    divided between Austria and Prussia, yet so as to leave a kind of ceremonial
                    primacy to the former. Enlightened Germans, on the contrary, had then already
                    arrived at the conviction that the leadership must be in Prussian hands.
                    Austria, hampered as she is by the numerical preponderance of nonGerman
                    populations, and the divergence of her interests from those of Germany, should,
                    they thought, take her place within a wider federation. Gradually and almost
                    imperceptibly did this truth work its way through time-honoured tradition.
                    Bunsen was one of its most eloquent apostles, in his official correspondence as
                    well as in pamphlets published in 1848. Several times he was sanguine enough to
                    believe such a policy to be permanently grasped in Berlin, but the king’s
                    vacillating temper and his adherence to tradition refused to be wrought upon
                    beyond the approval of half-measures. Thus the opportunity was lost, the
                    potentiality of the Prussian military power neglected, and a gnawing
                    disappointment left in the minds of the best patriots throughout Germany.</p>
                <p>With small hopes, and with no other wish but to serve as long as possible a
                    sovereign whose friendship and confidence had outlived their former agreement on
                    matters of religion and policy, Bunsen continued in the thankless task of
                    representing Prussia after the downfall of those proud hopes that had pictured
                    forth a revival of the German nationality under Prussian leadership. His main
                    object, pursued under every difficulty, and seized with energy on every
                    favourable opportunity, was to dissociate the policy of Berlin from that of St
                    Petersburg and Vienna, and to draw closer whatever bonds of common sentiment or
                    interest existed between the English and German communities. He was not tardy,
                    therefore, in advising his royal master in an anti-Russian sense when the
                    Crimean war began. As had so often been the case, the king’s understanding went
                    along with much that Bunsen wrote, and hopes were entertained that a Prussian
                    participation in the war, containing the threat of an invasion of the
                    northwestern frontier of Russia, would force that country into compliance with
                    the demands of the Western powers. But traditional policy again prevailed, mixed
                    with the king’s unconquerable aversion to Napoleon III., and his growing
                    mistrust of Lord Palmerston’s political principles. The alliance of the Western
                    potvers was declined, Prussia preserved towards her Eastern neighbour what is
                    technically called a “benevolent neutrality,” and the king accepted Bunsen’s
                    proffered resignation of his post as minister in London in April 1854.</p>
                <p>The remaining years of Bunsen’s life were spent in almost unbroken literary
                    labours, first at a villa on the banks of the Neckar, near Heidelberg, and at
                    the last in Bonn. In the politics of the day his interest was as keen as ever,
                    and readily did he give his advice when advice was asked, as happened frequently
                    on the part of the prince and princess of Prussia then residing at Coblentz, who
                    have since risen to the exalted position of emperor and empress of Germany. But
                    declining health determined him not to enter the Prussian Lower House, in which
                    a seat was offered him by the liberal majority in the city of Magdeburg. His <hi
                    rend="italic">Signs of the Times,</hi> however, an elaborate pamphlet, published
                    in 1856, acted like a first trumpet-call <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0586-0525"/> against the aggressive demeanour of the
                    reactionary clique, who were utilizing, in the interests of despotism and
                    obscurantism, the horror of revolutionary outbreaks then felt by the quiet
                    middle classes of Germany. Its publication prepared the way, more perhaps than
                    any other event, for that rise of liberal opinion in Prussia which showed its
                    power in the next reign.</p>
                <p>Twice only was Bunsen tempted away from his Heidelberg retreat to show himself at
                    Berlin,—once, at the king’s desire and as his guest, in September 1857, to
                    attend the meeting of the Evangelical Alliance, in the main objects of which he
                    sympathized as warmly as King Frederick William IV. On that occasion, and after
                    much confidential intercourse, the two friends parted never to meet again on
                    this side of the grave. One of the last papers signed by the king before his
                    mind gave way in October of that year was that which raised Bunsen to the rank
                    of baron, and conferred upon him a life peerage. In 1858 the Regent (now
                    Emperor) William having addressed a special request to Baron Bunsen not to fail
                    him at the opening of his first parliament, he took his seat in the Upper House,
                    and supported actively during a brief autumn session, but without ever making a
                    speech, the regent’s new cabinet, of which several of Bunsen’s political and
                    personal friends were members.</p>
                <p>Literary work was, however, the centre of his life throughout that time. Two
                    discoveries of ancient MSS. which occurred during his stay in London,
                    containing, the one a shorter text of the <hi rend="italic">Epistles of St
                    Ignatius,</hi> and the other an unknown work <hi rend="italic">On all the
                    Heresies,</hi> by Bishop Hippolytus, had already given him an opportunity for
                    enlarging upon the history of the first centuries of the Christian Church. He
                    now concentrated all his efforts upon producing a Bible translation with
                    commentaries that would open the sacred volumes afresh to the understanding and
                    the hearts of a generation gradually estranged from them. Whilst this “<hi
                    rend="italic">Bible-workf</hi> was in preparation, and to pave the way for its
                    reception, he printed a book considered by many to contain his most matured
                    thoughts, under the title of <hi rend="italic">God in History.</hi> The progress
                    of mankind, he contends, marches parallel to the conception of God formed within
                    each nation by the highest exponents of its thought. At the same time he carried
                    through the press, ably assisted by Mr Birch the Egyptologist, the concluding
                    volumes of his work (published in English as well as in German) <hi
                    rend="italic">Egypt's Place in Universal History—</hi> containing a
                    reconstruction of Egyptian chronology, together with an attempt to determine the
                    relation in which the language and the religion of that country stands to the
                    development of each among the more ancient non-Aryan and Aryan races, between
                    which its curious civilization seems to have formed a kind of connecting link.
                    Those who desire to know Bunsen’s ideas on this subject may find them most fully
                    developed in two volumes published in London before he quitted England— <hi
                    rend="italic">Outlines of the Philosophy of Universal History as applied to
                    Language and Religion.</hi> It will be seen even from this brief outline that
                    his “first love” had never lost its hold upon him, and that the desire “to trace
                    the firm path of God through the stream of ages” continued his purpose for
                    life.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It may be

                <p>But asthma and all other concomitants of a malady that had announced itself for
                    years now began to disturb, not the mental alacrity or the spirits of Bunsen
                    himself, but the hopes of his family and those among his friends who had
                    imagined that he would be allowed to complete the works undertaken. Ordered to
                    spend his winters in a more genial climate, he repaired to Cannes in 1858
                    and</p>
                <p>1859, not without a lengthened visit to Paris, where he revelled, as in younger
                    days, in the contact with men of learning. In May 1860 he purchased a house in
                    Bonn, hoping against hope, pushing forward the publication of his <hi
                    rend="italic">BibelWerk,</hi> and even preparing lectures for students upon
                    those subjects which he had most at heart. But the hand of death was upon him.
                    He thanked God daily for teaching him how to support pain at the close of a life
                    so eminently exempt from bodily suffering. And whenever, in the closing weeks of
                    his existence on earth, a relaxation of asthma ensued, fervent prayer flowed
                    from his lips, powerful attestation of his religious belief, loving exhortation
                    to those from whom he was soon to be removed. Baron Bunsen died on November 28,
                    1860, and lies buried in the churchyard of Bonn, not far from the grave of his
                    early friend and benefactor Niebuhr.</p>
                <p>“Let us walk in the light of the Lord” (Isa. ii. 5) is the text which Baroness
                    Bunsen placed on his tomb. One of his last requests having been that she "would
                    write dow n recollections of their common life, she published his <hi
                    rend="italic">Memoirs</hi> in 1868, which contain much of his private
                    correspondence. The German translation of these <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi>
                    has added extracts from unpublished documents, throwing a new light upon the
                    political events in which he played a part. Baron Humboldt’s letters to Bunsen
                    were printed in 1869, and Ranke published in 1873 a large portion of the
                    correspondence that passed between King Frederick William IV. and Bunsen. <hi
