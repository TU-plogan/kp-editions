                <p><label type="entry">BORKU, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Borgu</hi></label>, a country
                    in the interior of Africa, situated between the 17th and 20th parallels of N.
                    lat., and between 18° and 21° E. long., and forming part of the great Soudan
                    region. It is bounded northwards by the Tibesti Mountains, and is in great
                    measure occupied by lesser elevations belonging to the same system; to the south
                    or rather south-west lies the Bodele basin, from which it is separated by a
                    narrow stretch of higher ground. The climate is much better than that of the
                    neighbouring countries to the south and east; but the eastern trade-winds blow
                    persistently with great violence, being strongest from early morning till about
                    three <hi rend="smallcaps">p.m.</hi> The light sand that covers a large part of
                    the country is drifted by it into countless heaps, that change their shape and
                    position from day to day. It is plain, from the fish-skeletons still strewing
                    the ground, that a considerable portion of the south of Borku has at no very
                    distant day been like Bodele and other districts under water. At present the
                    irrigated and fertile portions consist mainly of a number of valleys separated
                    from each other by low and irregular limestone rocks. Of these the most
                    important are Jin, Nguro, Elleboë, and Kirdi in the south, and Bodo, Tiggi, and
                    Jarda in the north. They furnish excellent dates, of about twelve different
                    sorts. The northern valleys and Jin are inhabited by a settled population of
                    about 5000 people, known as the Donosa or Dosa; the others are mainly visited by
                    nomadic tribes. The Uelad Sliman, a powerful Arab tribe, claim the lordship of
                    the land, but have to share their authority with another tribe known as Mgharba
                    which immigrated from Barca about 1860. They do not inhabit the country of
                    Borku, but give proof of their claim to possession by plundering the valleys
                    every three or four years. In the end of 1851 Dr Barth and Dr Oberweg joined an
                    army despatched by the sultan of Bornu for the conquest of the region east of
                    Lake Chad; but the army was defeated and put to flight, and the travellers were
                    disappointed in their expectation of reaching Borku. Dr Nachtigal spent some
