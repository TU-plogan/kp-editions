                    contemporary of St Augustine, who dedicated to him some of his works.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Boniface</hi> II., 530-532, was by birth a Goth, and owed
                    his election to the influence of the Gothic king. He had for some time an
                    anti-pope, Dioscurus.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Boniface</hi> III., 15th February to 12th November 606,
                    obtained from Phocas recognition of the headship of the Church at Rome.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Boniface</hi> IV., 608-615, received from Phocas the
                    Pantheon at Rome, which was converted into a Christian church.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Boniface</hi> V., 619-625, did much for the Christianizing
                    of England.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Boniface</hi> VI. was elected in April 897, and died fifteen
                    days afterwards.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Boniface</hi> VII., who attained the Papal chair in 974, is
                    sometimes styled an anti-pope. He is supposed to have put his predecessor,
                    Benedict VI., to death. A popular tumult compelled him to flee to
                    Constantinople; but he carried with him vast treasure, and in 984 he returned
                    and removed, by murder, John XIV., who had been elected in his room. He died in
                    985 or 986.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Boniface</hi> VIII., Benedict Cajetan, a man of great
                    ability, was elected in 1294, Celestine V. having been persuaded to resign. He
                    meddled incessantly in foreign affairs, and put forward the strongest claims to
                    temporal as well as spiritual supremacy. His bitterest quarrels were with the
                    emperor, with the powerful family of the Colonnas, and with Philip the Fair of
                    France, whom he excommunicated in 1303. He was about to lay all France under an
                    interdict when he was seized at Agnani by a party of horsemen under Nogaret, an
                    agent of Philip, and Sciarra Colonna. After three days’ captivity he was rescued
                    by the town’s people, but the agitation he had undergone caused his death soon
                    after, on the 11th October 1303. In 1300 Boniface instituted the <hi

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Boniface</hi> IX. was elected in 1390 and died in 1404.
                    During his time the so-called Clement V. continued to hold state as pope in
                    Aviguon.</p>
