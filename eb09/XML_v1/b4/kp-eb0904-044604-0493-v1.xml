                <p><label type="entry">BUHL-WORK</label>, otherwise Bool, Boule, or Boulle-work, is
                    a kind of inlaying and ornamentation of cabinet-work, so named after the
                    inventor André Charles Boule, a celebrated French cabinetmaker (1642-1732) By a
                    happy selection of different woods from India and Brazil, arranged with great
                    taste, and the use of brass, ivory, gold, tortoiseshell, &amp;c., Boule produced
                    upon his furniture arabesques and pictures, representinga variety of animals,
                    flowers, and fruits; and he finally succeeded in producing historical scenes, as
                    battles and hunts, landscapes, and other artistic effects. Louis XIV.
                    appreciated his abilities, gave him lodgings in the Louvre, and, in 1672,
                    appointed him engraver in ordinary of the royal seals. In the patent authorizing
                    this he received also the designations of “architect, painter, carver in mosaic,
                    artist in cabinet-work, chaser, inlayer, and designer of figures.” His skill was
                    great in all these branches, and he carried them to a high degree of artistic
                    perfection in timepieces, screens, furniture, and other articles. He worked for
                    the royal residences and for foreign princes, and attained fortune and
                    position.</p>
                <p>The beginnings of art in carving are found amongst the relics of prehistoric
                    races, and when it arrived at the degree of perfection it afterwards attained in
                    the East, inlaying was a natural result. We find this to have been practised by
                    the ancient Egyptain and other Asiatic races. Its attendant, veneering, was also
                    employed by them, workmen applying the veneer with glue being represented on the
                    Egyptian monuments. As civilization advanced westward, the Greeks and Romans
                    followed in the art, the latter race inlaying their furniture with marquetry or
                    tarsia-work, using ivory, ebony, box, palm, bird’s-eye maple, beech, and other
                    woods. Their bronze articles they damascened with ornaments of the precious
                    metals and metallic amalgams. The spirit of the Middle Ages was adverse to the
                    development of this art, and but few traces of it are found. In the South
                    Kensington Museum is a coffer of cypress, with flat surface imagery filled in
                    with coloured wax composition, that dates from the 14th century. The Venetians
                    derived their marquetry from Persia and India, as is indicated by the geometric
                    patterns inlaid with ivory, metal, and woods, stained of various colours.
                    Florence took a prominent place in this manufacture in the 15th century.
                    Certosina·work was the result; it was so called from the great Certosa,
                    Charterhouse, or Carthusian monastery, between Milan and Pavia, in the
                    choir-fittings of which this kind of ornament, ivory inlaid into solid cypress
                    and walnut wood, is employed. Work in the Persian style, with its geometric
                    figures, still reaches us from Bombay, the present great seat of the
                    Parsees.</p>
                <p>The Renaissance artists chiefly employed wood in making furniture, ornamenting it
                    with gilding and painting, and inlaying it with agate, carnelian, lapis-lazuli,
                    marble of various tints, ivory, tortoise-shell, mother-of-pearl, and various
                    woods. Boule improved upon this by inlaying brass devices into wood or
                    tortoise-shell, which last he greatly used according to the design he had
                    immediately in view, whether flowers, scenes, scrolls, &amp;c. to these he
                    sometimes added enamelled metal. In this process the brass is thin, and, like
                    the ornamental wood or tortoise-shell, forms a veneer. In the first instance the
                    production of his work was costly, owing to the quantity of valuable material
                    that was cut away and wasted, and, in addition, the labour lost in separately
                    cutting for each article or copy of a pattern. By a subsequent improvement Boule
                    effected an economy by gluing together various sheets of material and sawing
                    through the whole, so that an equal number of figures and matrices were produced
                    at one operation. Boule adopted from time to time various plans for the
                    improvement of his designs. He placed gold-leaf or other suitable material under
                    the tortoise-shell to produce such effect as he required; he chased the
                    brass-work with a graver for a like purpose, and, when the metal required to be
                    fastened down with brass pins or nails, these were hammered flat and disguised
                    by ornamental chasing. He also adopted, in relief or in the round, brass feet,
                    brackets, edgings, and other ornaments of appropriate design, partly to protect
                    the corners and edges of his work, and partly for decoration. He subsequently
                    used other brass mountings, such as claw-feet to altars and pedestals, or
                    figures in high or low relief, according to the effect he desired to produce.
                    Boule’s contemporary, Reisner, a German, used a variety of woods, tulip-wood
                    more especially, in the production of flowers and other ornamental designs,
                    contrasting the dark with the light kinds, crossing the grain, and employing
                    other ingenious devices. After him this particular style was called
                    Reisner-work. The Spaniards of the 16th century used silver for inlaying.</p>
