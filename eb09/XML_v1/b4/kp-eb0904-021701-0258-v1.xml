                <p><label type="entry">BRASS</label>, an alloy of copper and zinc, the composition
                    of which will be discussed under the heading <hi rend="smallcaps">Copper.</hi>
                    In this place we have to do simply with its history, and the various
                    applications of the alloy in the arts. Although the term brass frequently occurs
                    in Scripture from the era of Job downwards, there is no indication that brass,
                    as known in modern times, was in use previous to the period of the Roman empire.
                    By the Romans a compound was used under the name <hi rend="italic"
                    >oricalchum</hi> or <hi rend="italic">auricalchum,</hi> which appears to have
                    possessed the composition and properties of brass. With their conquests they
                    carried a knowledge of the arts they cultivated into the countries they subdued,
                    and from these the art of preparing the alloy extended with civilization
                    throughout Europe. The earliest traces of brass in Great Britain are found in
                    the mediaeval monumental “brasses,” found commonly over the tombs of civil and
                    ecclesiastical dignitaries (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Brasses).</hi> That the
                    alloy was manufactured in England during the reign of Henry VIII., however, is
                    indicated from the passing of an Act of Parliament prohibiting, under severe
                    penalties, the export of brass, a prohibition which was not withdrawn till so
                    recent a date as 1799, During the reign of Queen Elizabeth the manufacture was
                    systematically developed and extended, and a patent for working calamine stone
                    (the principal ore of zinc) and making brass was granted by the queen to William
                    Humfrey and Christopher Schutz, securing to them the exclusive right of
                    manufacturing brass. The patent rights granted to these persons were gradually
                    extended and merged into a company under the name of the “Governors, Assistants,
                    and Societies of the City of London of and for the Mineral and Battery Works,”
                    which continued to exercise its functions down to the year 1710. In the year
                    1721 it was estimated that about 30,000 persons found employment in the brass
                    industries. From a very early date brassfounding was prosecuted in Birmingham,
                    and by degrees it there assumed more important proportions till it has become
                    the most distinguishing industrial feature of the town. The late Mr W. Aitken,
                    in his valuable report on brass and brass manufactures, to which source of
                    practical information we have to express our obligation, says :—“What Manchester
                    is in cotton, Bradford in wool, and Sheffield in steel, Birmingham is in brass;
                    its articles of cabinet and general brassfoundry are to be found in every part
                    of the world; its gas-fittings in every city and town into which gas has been
                    introduced from Indus to the poles.”— <hi rend="italic">(^Birmingham and the
                    Midland Hardware Districts,</hi> London, 1865.)</p>
                <p>The brass trade of the present day is, according to Mr Aitken, conducted under
                    nine different heads :—(1), brasscasting; (2), cabinet, bell, and general
                    brassfoundry; (3), cock-making and plumbers’ brassfoundry; (4), stamped
                    brassfoundry; (5), rolled brass, wire, and sheathing; (6), tube-making; (7),
                    lamp-making; (8), gas-fittings; and (9), naval brassfoundry. It frequently
                    happens that several of these departments are carried on in the same
                    establishment; but numerous as are these divisions, they by no means exhaust the
                    industries in which brass plays a principal part. Thus the pin manufacture,
                    button-making, and the gilt jewellery trade, are eminently characteristic of
                    Birmingham, and in these brass is the principal metallic substance employed.
                    According to the different forms under which brass is to be employed it is
                    fashioned by the various processes of—1st, casting; 2d, rolling and drawing; 3d,
                    stamping; and 4th, tube-drawing and casing; and to these, with 5th,
                    brass-finishing, we shall briefly allude.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Casting.—</hi> The first operation necessary in connection with
                    casting is the preparation of patterns of the object to be cast. Castings, of
                    course, vary in all degrees in intricacy and elaboration of details, and the
                    getting up of the more ornamental patterns necessitates the employment of
                    persons of artistic ability to prepare the design, and superior artisans to
                    finish the pattern blocks. Three classes of castings are recognized in the
                    trade—1st, common castings, made from any plain pattern, an impression of which
                    can be formed and the pattern taken out without breaking the mould; 2d, cored
                    castings, such as plumbers’ cocks and other tubular work, where the metal must
                    be poured round a central core; and 3d, false-cored castings, where the pattern
                    is so undercut that the mould must be built up of such a number of separable
                    sections as the intricacies of the pattern may require. When the mould is formed
                    each of these sections is lifted off, the pattern is taken out, and they are
                    then built together in their original position. This description of moulding
                    requires much skill and dexterity. Moulds are made in sand of a free,
                    fine-grained, and uniform character; and moulding-boxes of wood or cast-iron
                    which fit together in two or more parts, with moulding-boards of wood and clamps
                    to hold the parts together, are employed in casting. In the forming of common
                    castings, the lower division of the moulding-box is packed with sand, and the
                    pattern, if deep, is driven half its depth into it, parting sand is dusted over
                    the surface, and the upper part of the box is fitted on and similarly packed
                    with sand. When the box is filled, a moulding-board, forming a top or bottom to
                    it, is laid on, the two halves of the box are separated, the pattern withdrawn,
                    and “gates” or channels formed between the mould and the aperture by which the
                    metal is poured in. The surfaces are then dusted over with flour or powdered
                    charcoal, and the mould placed· in an oven to dry. On their withdrawal from the
                    oven the two parts of the moulding-box are clamped together, the molten metal is
                    poured in, and a perfect copy of the pattern produced. In making common castings
                    as many patterns as the superficial area of the moulding-box will accommodate
                    are cast at once, “gates” leading to the entire series; and for many plumbers’
                    castings, &amp;c., a series of half patterns, with moulded gates, are fixed on
                    two sides of a plate by which the whole may be moulded and finished at one
                    operation. The cores for tubular work are separately made, and are supported on
                    bearings in the mould. When the casting is cold the hardened core is picked out,
                    and the article is then ready for finishing. Fine ornamental castings which
                    contain minute details are moulded with special care in very fine sand, faced
                    with charcoal powder, which faithfully reproduces the most delicate lines. The
                    metal is poured direct from the crucible in which it is prepared, by the aid of
                    strong tongs, and all spilt metal is carefully swept up, cleaned, and
                    remelted.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sheet Rolling and Wire Drawing.—</hi> The raw material of a
                    large proportion of the brass trade consists of sheet-brass, as from it stamped
                    work of all kinds is prepared, and jointed tubing and sheathing are made; and,
                    generally, the processes of rolling must be adopted when sheets of large
                    dimensions or of great, thinness are required. For tho purpose of rolling the
                    metal is melted and cast in broad flat moulds of cast-iron; and in cases where a
                    large quantity is dealt with, the moulds are hewn out in granite. These moulds
                    are rubbed with oil and powdered with charcoal before being used. The ingots for
                    rolling, termed “strips,” are in the cold state passed successively between
                    rolls (pairs of chilled-iron cylinders) of large size which squeeze them out and
                    extend them lengthwise. As often as necessary in the process the sheet is
                    annealed in a muffle or reverberatory furnace, being allowed to cool down after
                    each annealing. The sheet is finished, after “pickling” in acid, by passing it
                    through a pair of highly polished rolls. Muntz’s sheathing metal is a form of
                    brass containing a large proportion of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n259/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0259-0218"/> zinc, and as this alloy can be rolled out hot it
                    is much more cheaply and expeditiously prepared than ordinary sheet brass.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Wire Drawing.—</hi> Brass wire is consumed in enormous
                    quantities, first and chiefly for pin-making, next for shoerivets, then for
                    brush-making, for paper-makers’ wire web, and many other purposes. The metal for
                    wire drawing is rolled into long strips of a suitable thickness and cut into
                    “strands” by means of slitting rolls. The strands, which are square in section,
                    are drawn through a succession of circular holes in a steel draw-plate, till the
                    desired degree of fineness is reached, and are wound upon a rotating drum or
                    block. The wire has to be repeatedly annealed as it passes through the plates of
                    ever-diminishing gauge.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Stamping.—</hi> A large number of useful articles, as well as
                    many ornamental details, which were formerly produced by the process of casting,
                    are now cheaply and expeditiously made by stamping out of sheets of rolled
                    brass. In this way the ornamentation applied to the cheaper kinds of gasaliers,
                    balance-weights, chain-links, &amp;c., are formed, and cornice-pole ornaments
                    and curtain-rings made; and the process is also applied to the making of door
                    and shutter knobs, finger plates, and lamp-burners, and to the striking up of
                    many useful articles, such as basins and other vessels. In the process of
                    stamping, a die, in which the pattern to be formed is sunk, is prepared by the
                    ordinary process of die sinking, and securely fixed to a heavy iron block sunk
                    into the ground. From each side of this block rise two cast-iron guide pillars,
                    which act as guides to the heavy hammer or ram arranged to slide up and down
                    between them. Into this hammer a “force,” or exact counterpart of the Bunk die,
                    is fitted, so that on the fall of the hammer the force exactly fits into the
                    die. The work of the stamper in raising his hammer is much lightened by passing
                    the lifting belt over a pulley attached to a shaft moved by steam-power. By this
                    arrangement the workman has only to hold his cord sufficiently tight to create
                    the friction between the belt and pulley necessary to raise the weight, and by
                    letting go his hold, the stamp is allowed to fall with its full momentum against
                    the die. In a compound of such hardness and brittleness as brass it is necessary
                    to raise any pattern by repeated strokes, annealing the metal between each
                    separate blow. The number of blows necessary to bring up any pattern depends on
                    the depth and convexity of the die. The “forces,” or counterparts of the die,
                    are made of lead, tin, or other soft metal, while for finishing the stamping
                    when the die contains fine details a “force” made of brass is employed. A
                    modification of the steam-hammer has been adapted for use in the process of
                    stamping. Stamped work as compared with castings is deficient in depth and
                    richness, as it is not practicable to attain any great boldness and sharpness of
                    outline, and the “force” having to fit into every portion of the die, no
                    undercutting is possible. Globular articles, such as balance weights, are
                    stamped in two (or if necessary more) parts and the pieces joined by soldering.
                    Mr James Atkins of Birmingham has patented an ingenious method of filling
                    stamped shells, such as balance-weights, with molten iron by simply keeping the
                    shell in water while it is being filled.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Tube-making.—</hi> Brass tubes are of three principal kinds:
                    —1st, ordinary soldered; 2d, cased; and'3d, solid tubing. Blain soldered tubes
                    are made from sheet-brass by cutting off, with circular shears, strips of the
                    breadth necessary for the gauge of the tube to be made. These strips are passed
                    through “cupping-rolls,” by which they are partially bent round. The end of the
                    strip is then formed into a tang, caught and drawn through a tool called a
                    conductor, which folds over the strip into a circular form, bringing the two
                    edges into close contact. The tube so formed is tightly tied up with wire at
                    short intervals to keep the edges together in the process of soldering; a
                    mixture of granulated brass and borax is filled into the seam, and the tube is
                    passed slowly through a strong heat in the soldering stove, which melts the
                    granulated brass and so unites the edges. The vires are then cut away, and the
                    superfluous solder filed off, the tube is pickled in sulphuric acid, and again
                    passed through the steel conductor. In the case of tubes which require great
                    accuracy of internal gauge, a mandril or solid cylinder of steel is placed
                    inside the tube before it is finally passed through the tool. The external
                    pressure causes the tube to fit closely to its internal support, and while the
                    outside takes the outline of the steel conductor, the inside is made true to the
                    shape of the mandril. Tubes of any given section are thus formed by the use of
                    mandrils having the outline required. Ornamental patterns are impressed on plain
                    tubes by fitting them on mandrils and passing them through a tool, which
                    consists of a strong iron frame carrying three or more rollers so mounted that
                    the open space between their external edges has the sectional form of the tube
                    to be ornamented. On the external face of these rollers is sunk the design which
                    is to be impressed on the tube, and as it is drawn through them the powerful
                    squeeze they give is sufficient to impress ornaments of considerable depth and
                    boldness. Cased-tubes or rods, that is, tubes or rods of iron cased in brass,
                    were invented in 1803 by Sir Edward Thomason, who thus described his invention
                    :—“In watching the operation of drawing brass and copper tubes upon the mandril,
                    I found it required as much power to slide off the hollow tube from the mandril
                    as was required to draw it on. Reasoning from the adhesion of the brass tube to
                    the steel mandril, I found by experiment that the union of copper and iron or
                    brass and iron could be firmly attached by pressure, and conceived that such an
                    application would be useful for making copper bolts for shipping, solid brass
                    rods for stair carpets, solid brass to go round the top of a room to suspend
                    pictures, as curtain rods for drawing-rooms, and as balustrades for staircases.”
                    Wood is cased in brass by a similar process, and used for such purposes as brass
                    cornice-poles. Solid or seamless brass tubes, which are in very extensive demand
                    for locomotive and other steam boilers, are made by drawing down short thick
                    cast cylinders of brass till they reach the desired gauge and thinness. The
                    instrument in which this drawing is accomplished is similar to the apparatus for
                    impressing ornamental patterns on plain brass tubes. Four steel rollers are
                    mounted in a strong frame, the sectional outline of the outer surfaces of which
                    have the size and form to which the tube is to be drawn, and through a series of
                    such tools the cast cylinders are passed, after annealing at each operation. Mr
                    G. F. Muntz in 1852 patented a method of drawing tubes cast in an oval form in
                    the heated state.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Brass Finishing.—</hi> The operations in brass finishing
                    comprise “dipping,” “burnishing,” and “lacquering,” and in some cases brass-work
                    is finished by “bronzing.” After the article to be finished has been cleaned by
                    pickling in acid, it is passed for dipping into an earthenware jar containing a
                    solution of aquafortis (nitric acid). For bright dipping the acid is used
                    strong, and the brass is immediately withdrawn from the bath, but for “dead”
                    dipping, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> for producing a bitten, frosted
                    appearance, the bath is made weaker and the metal left in it till a creamy
                    appearance is seen on the surface. Burnishing is accomplished by rubbing with
                    polished steel tools, called burnishers, the parts of dead dipped work which are
                    to be brightened. The work is then passed through water soured with acid,
                    rinsed, and dried in boxwood sawdust. For lacquering, the work is heated over
                    stoves, and while it is hot, a coating of varnish, made of seed-lac dissolved in
                    spirit, is carefully <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n260/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0260-0219"/> and uniformly spread over the surface. Bronzing
                    consists in applying to the surface of the metal an opaque pigment, which alters
                    its colour. Ordinary brassfounders’ bronze consists of a solution of
                    hydrochloric acid and salammoniac, or of the same acid, arsenic, and smithy
                    scales. It is chiefly to cabinet brassfoundry and stamped work that such
                    finishing processes are applied.</p>
                <p>Vessels of brass for cooking and other domestic purposes are very extensively
                    employed in the East Indies, and the alloy is there also a favourite material
                    for the bangles and other personal ornaments of the lower orders. A large trade
                    is carried on in brass wire, for ornamental purposes, between Birmingham and
                    various African stations; a species of currency called Guinea rods, made from
                    thick brass wire, is made and exported to the Guinea coast; and a kind of
                    cast-brass coin, called a manilia, current in the equatorial regions of Old
                    Calabar, is frequently supplied by Birmingham manufacturers. <hi
