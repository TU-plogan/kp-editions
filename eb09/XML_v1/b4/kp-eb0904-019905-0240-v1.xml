                <p><label type="entry">BRAHAM, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label>, a celebrated
                    English vocalist, was born in London in 1774, of Jewish parentage, his family
                    name being Abraham. He received his first lessons in singing from Leoni, a
                    well-known Italian artist, and made his appearance on the stage of the Covent
                    Garden Theatre so early as 1787, when he sang bravura airs composed for Madame
                    Mara. On the breaking of his voice his public career was interrupted for a time,
                    and he had to support himself by teaching the pianoforte. In a few years,
                    however, he recovered his voice, wdιich proved to be a tenor of exceptionally
                    pure and rich quality. His second <hi rend="italic">début</hi> was made in 1794
                    at the Bath concerts, to the conductor of which, Rauzzini, he was indebted for
                    careful training, extending over a period of more than two years. In 1796 he
                    reappeared in London at Drury Lane, the opera being Storace’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mahmoud.</hi> With the view of perfecting himself in his art he set out for
                    Italy in the autumn of the following year. On the way he gave some concerts at
                    Paris, which proved so successful that he was induced to remain, contrary to his
                    original intention, for eight months in that city. His career in Italy was one
                    of continuous triumph; he appeared in all the principal opera-houses, <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n241/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0241-0200"/> and was universally recognized as being without a
                    rival even in that land of song. In 1801 he returned to his native country, and
                    appeared once more at Covent Garden in the opera <hi rend="italic">Chains of the
                    lieart</hi> by Mazzinghi and Reeve. So great was his popularity that an
                    engagement he had made when abroad to return after a year to Vienna was
                    renounced, and he remained henceforward in England. For nearly forty years from
                    this date his powers continued unimpaired, and he sang occasionally in public
                    till within a year or two of his death, which occurred on the 17th February
                    1856. There is, perhap3, no other case upon record in which a vocalist of the
                    first rank enjoyed the use of his organ so long; between his first and last
                    public appearances considerably more than sixty years intervened, during forty
                    of which he held the undisputed supremacy alike in opera, oratorio, and the
                    concert-room. Braham was the composer of a number of vocal pieces, which being
                    sung by himself had great temporary popularity, though they had little intrinsic
                    merit, and are now deservedly forgotten. A partial exception must be made in
                    favour of <hi rend="italic">The Death of Nelson,</hi> which still keeps its
                    place as a standard popular English song.</p>
