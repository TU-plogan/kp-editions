                    admiral, was born August 19, 1711. He was the third son of Hugh, Lord Viscount
                    Falmouth. He early entered the navy, and in 1740 distinguished himself at the
                    taking of Porto Bello. At the siege of Carthagena, in March 1741, at the head of
                    a party of seamen, he took a battery of fifteen 24-pounders, while exposed to
                    the fire of another fort. On his return to England in the following year he
                    married, and entered parliament as member for Truro. In 1744 he captured the
                    “Medea,” a French man-of-war, commanded by Μ. de Hocquart, the first ship taken
                    in the war. In May 1747 he signalized himself in the engagement off Cape
                    Finisterre, and was wounded in the shoulder with a musket-ball. Hocquart again
                    became his prisoner, and the French ships, ten in number, were taken. On the
                    15th July, he was made rear-admiral and commander-in-chief of the expedition to
                    the East Indies. On the 29th July 1748 he arrived off Fort St David’s, and soon
                    after laid siege to Pondicherry; but the sickness of his men and the approach of
                    the monsoons led to the raising of the siege. Soon afterwards he received news
                    of the peace, and Madras was delivered up to him by the French. In April 1750

                    one of the lords of the Admiralty, and chosen an elder brother of the Trinity
                    House. In February 1755 he was appointed vice-admiral, and in April he
                    intercepted the French squadron bound to North America, and took the “Alcide”
                    and “Lys” of sixty-four guns each. Hocquart became his prisoner for the third
                    time, and Boscawen returned to Spithead with his prizes and 1500 prisoners. For
                    this exploit he received the thanks of Parliament. In 1758 he was appointed
                    admiral of the blue and commander-in chief of the expedition to Cape Breton,
                    when, in conjunction with General Amherst, he took the fortress of Louisbourg,
                    and the island of Cape Breton,—services for which he again received the thanks
                    of the House of Commons. In 1759, being appointed to command in the
                    Mediterranean, he pursued the French fleet, and after a sharp engagement in
                    Lagos Bay, took three large ships and burnt two, returning to Spithead with his
                    prizes and 2000 prisoners. In December 1760 he was appointed general of the
                    marines, with a salary of £3000 per annum, and was also sworn a member of the
                    privy council. He died at his seat near Guildford, January 10, 1761, in the 50th
                    year of his age.</p>
