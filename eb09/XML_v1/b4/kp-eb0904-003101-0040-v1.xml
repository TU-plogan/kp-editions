                <p><label type="entry">BONDU</label>, a kingdom of Western Africa lying to the W. of
                    Bambouk, from which it is separated by the River Falerne, between 14° and 15° N.
                    lat., and 12° and 13° W. long. The country is an elevated plateau, with hills in
                    the southern and central parts. These are generally unproduc tive, and covered
                    with stunted wood; but the lower country is fertile, and finely clothed with the
                    baobab, the tamarind, and various valuable fruit-trees. It is traversed by beds
                    of torrents, which flow rapidly during the rains, but are empty in the dry
                    season. Cultivation, though it extends over only a comparatively small
                    proportion of the whole surface, is carried on with a measure of activity. The
                    products consist of grain (four species), rice, cotton, indigo, water-melons,
                    cucumbers, tobacco, and fruits. The workmen in the different parts display
                    considerable dexterity, though they employ very rude and defective tools. The
                    people consist chiefly of Foulahs, though the country is much frequented by
                    Mandingoes and Sera woollies for purposes of trade. The exports consist of
                    provisions and cotton cloth manufactured in the country, and slaves and salt are
                    imported. The caravans, bringing the former from the interior to the coast, pass
                    usually through Bondu. The religion and laws of this country are Mahometan,
                    though the precepts of that faith are not very rigorously observed. There are
                    schools, however, in every town, where the Koran and the reading and writing of
                    Arabic are taught; but the scholar is treated as the menial servant of the
                    teacher. The king is nearly absolute, and commands a considerable body of
                    troops, who are much employed in predatory expeditions, chiefly for the purpose
                    of collecting slaves. His revenues are derived from a tenth part of the produce
                    of the land, and of the salt imported, as also from duties on goods passing
                    through his territories, with numerous presents expected or extorted. Park, who
                    was the first European traveller to visit the country, experienced to his cost
                    the rapacity of the reigning prince, being obliged to give up even the coat
                    which he wore. The royal residence was then at Fatteconda; but when Major Gray
                    visited Bondu it had been removed to Bulibani, a small town, with about 3000 of
                    a population, surrounded by a strong clay wall. The population of the whole
                    country is estimated at 1,500,000.</p>
