                    an eminent mineralogist aud metallurgist, was born of a noble family, at
                    Karlsburg in Transylvania, in 1742 He was educated in a Jesuit college at
                    Vienna, and entered that order, which, however, after sixteen months, he
                    quitted. After studying law at Prague he travelled into Germany, Holland, and
                    France. On his return to Prague he engaged in the Study of mineralogy. Austria
                    produces various metals in considerable abundance, and the administration of the
                    revenue arising to Government from this source is conducted by local boards,
                    under the control of the chamber of mines at Vienna. This administration offers
                    a field of some preferment; and Von Born was received into the department of the
                    mines and mint at Prague in 1770. About this time he met with an accident which
                    nearly proved fatal, in the course of a journey through Transylvania Having
                    entered a mine at Felso-Banya, whilst the air was charged with arsenical vapour,
                    he was stupified for fifteen hours, and long afterwards suffered from a cough
                    and general pain. Some time after this accident he was affected with violent
                    colics, and in the latter part of his life was deprived of the use of both legs.
                    These calamities, however, did not repress the activity of his mind. He had to
                    give up his assessorship of the mining council, but continued to produce works
                    on mineralogy which won him a European reputation. He met with much opposition
                    in attempting to introduce amalgamation in Hungary, in place of smelting and
                    cupellation, for extracting silver from the ores. His opponents endeavoured to
                    prove his process inferior to that already in use; and, after it had been tried
                    successfully, pronounced it to be merely the old Spanish process of
                    amalgamation. The emperor, however, ordered that his method should be employed
                    in mines belonging to Government, and that he should receive a third part of the
                    savings arising from the improvement during the first ten years, and 4 per cent,
                    of this third part for the next twenty years. In 1766 he was appointed by Maria
                    Theresa to arrange the imperial museum at Vienna, where he was made councillor
                    of state, and continued to reside until his death. Von Born attempted satire
                    with no great success. The <hi rend="italic">Staats Perücke,</hi> a tale
                    published without his knowledge in 1772, and an attack on Father Hell, the
                    Jesuit, and king’s astronomer at Vienna, are two of his satirical works. Part of
                    a satire, entitled <hi rend="italic">Monachologia,</hi> in which the monks are
                    described in the technical language of natural history, is also ascribed to him.
                    Von Born was well acquainted with Latin and the principal modern, languages of
                    Europe, and with many branches of science not immediately connected with
                    metallurgy and mineralogy. He took an active part in the political changes in
                    Hungary. After the death of Joseph, the diet of the states of Hungary rescinded
                    many innovations of that scheming ruler, and conferred the rights of denizen on
                    several persons who had been favourable to the cause of the Hungarians, and,
                    amongst others, on Von Born At the time of his death in 1791, he was employed in
                    writing a work entitled <hi rend="italic">Fasti Leopoldini,</hi> probably
                    relating to the prudent conduct of Leopold II., the successor of Joseph, towards
                    the Hungarians.</p>
