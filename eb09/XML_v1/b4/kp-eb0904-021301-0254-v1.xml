                <p><label type="entry">BRAMAH, <hi rend="smallcaps">Joseph</hi></label>, a practical
                    engineer and machinist, was born at Stainborough, in Yorkshire, on the 13th of
                    April 1749. He exhibited at a very early age an unusual talent for the
                    mechanical arts, and having been incapacitated, when he was about sixteen, by an
                    accidental lameness in his ankle, for the pursuit of agricultural labour, he was
                    apprenticed to a carpenter and joiner. When the term of his engagement had
                    expired he obtained employment for some time in the workshop of a cabinetmaker
                    in London, and soon after established himself as a principal in that business.
                    His first patent for some improvements in the mechanism of water-closets was
                    taken out in 1783. In the following year he took out a patent for‘the peculiar
                    locks which have long been named after him. His fertile invention led him to
                    devise new arrangements for pumps, fire-engines, steam-boilers, and paper
                    machinery, for all of which he obtained patents. The invention which has proved
                    of most practical service, the hydraulic press, was first brought forward in
                    1796. Its principle is that of the hydrostatic paradox, and it has been found of
                    very great use in all operations requiring the application of immense mechanical
                    force. In 1806 Bramah patented a very ingenious printing-machine, specially
                    adapted for bank notes, which was adopted in the following year by the Bank of
                    England. During the latter years of his life Bramah erected some large machines
                    at the Thames bank for sawing stones and timber, began to devise some
                    improvements in bridges and in locks for canals, and was at one time actually
                    employed in the execution of some water-works belonging to the department of the
                    civil engineer, which he completed with ability and success. His great and
                    various exertions appear in some measure to have exhausted the strength of his
                    constitution; and his last illness was immediately occasioned by a severe cold,
                    taken in the prosecution of his experiments in Holt Forest on the tearing up of
                    trees. He died in his sixty-sixth year, on the 9th December 1814. (See notice of
                    his life and works by Dr Cullen Brown in Al·w <hi rend="italic">Monthly
                    Magazine,</hi> 1815.)</p>
