                <p><label type="entry">BRIBERY</label>, as a public offence, may be defined as the
                    administration of a bribe or reward, that it may be a motive in the performance
                    of functions for which the proper motive ought to be a conscientious sense of
                    duty. When this is superseded by the sordid impulses created by the bribe, a
                    person is said to be corrupted, and thus corruption is a term sometimes held
                    equivalent to bribery. The offence maybe divided into two great classes,—the one
                    characteristic of despotisms, where a person invested with power is induced by
                    payment to use it unjustly; the other, which is an unfortunate characteristic of
                    constitutional governments, where power is obtained by purchasing the suffrages
                    of those who can impart it. The former offence is in every sense the more odious
                    and formidable, and indeed it may be said, that until a country has outgrown it,
                    there is no room for the existence of elective bribery, since the nations among
                    which justice is habitually sold appear to be far below the capacity of
                    possessing constitutional rights.</p>
                <p>When Samuel in his old age challenges a rigid scrutiny of his conduct, he says,
                    “Whose ox have I taken, or whose ass have I taken? or whom have I defrauded?
                    whom have I oppressed? or of whose hands have I received any bribe to blind mine
                    eyes therewith.” And Amos, when denouncing the condition of the Israelites under
                    Jeroboam, says, “They afflict the just, they take a bribe, and they turn aside
                    the poor in the gate from their right.” It is a natural propensity, removable
                    only by civilization or some powerful counteracting influence, to feel that
                    every element of power is to be employed as much as possible for the owner’s own
                    behoof, and that its benefits should be conferred not on those who best deserve
                    them, but on those who will pay most for them. Hence judicial corruption is an
                    inveterate vice of imperfect civilization. It is so deeply seated among Oriental
                    races, that the attempts by controlling authority to eradicate it have been
                    often futile. It has been the main impediment to the employment of natives in
                    the British Eastern empire, since no external appearance of respectability, or
                    apparent systematic routine of business, can be relied on as securities that the
                    whole organization is not contaminated by systematic bribery. It is difficult to
                    get the Oriental mind to understand how it is reasonable to expect the
                    temptation of a bribe to be resisted. In the Russian empire this Oriental
                    characteristic has had another conflict with the demands of a higher
                    civilization. The organization of the Government requires that the empire should
                    be honestly served by its official men, but their morality is of the humblest
                    Oriental standard, and force will not change it. In no country, perhaps, has the
                    offence been visited with more dire chastisement where it' has been discovered,
                    yet by the concurring testimony of all who are acquainted with Russian society,
                    not only the official departments, but the courts of law are still influenced by
                    systematic bribery. There is, perhaps, no other crime on which the force of law,
                    if unaided by public opinion and morals, can have so little influence; for in
                    other crimes, such as violence or fraud, there is generally some person
                    immediately injured by the act, who can give his aid in the detection of the
                    offender, but in the perpetration of the offence of bribery all the immediate
                    parties obtain what they desire, and are satisfied.</p>
                <p>The purification of the bench from judicial bribery has been gradual in most of
                    the European countries. In France it received an impulse in the 16th century
                    from the high-minded chancellor L’Hôpital. In England judicial corruption
                    acquired a painful, but perhaps a wholesome renown, from the fate of the
                    illustrious Bacon. In Scotland for some years after the Revolution the bench was
                    not without a suspicion of interested partiality; but during the present
                    century, at least, there has been in all parts of the empire a perfect reliance
                    on its purity. The same may be said of the higher class of ministerial officers.
                    There is no doubt that in the period from the Revolution to the end of Queen
                    Anne’s reign, when a speaker of the House of Commons was expelled for bribery,
                    and the great Marlborough could not clear his character from pecuniary
                    dishonesty, there was much corruption in the highest official quarters. The
                    level of the offence of official bribery has gradually descended, until it has
                    become an extremely rare thing for the humbler officers connected with the
                    revenue to be charged with it. It has had a more lingering existence with those
                    who, because their power is more of a constitutional than an official character,
                    have been deemed less responsible to the public. During Walpole’s administration
                    there is no doubt that members of Parliament were paid in cash for votes; and
                    the memorable saying, that every man has his price, has been preserved as a
                    characteristic indication of his method of government.</p>
                <p>One of the forms in which administrative corruption is most difficult of
                    eradication is the appointment to office. It is sometimes maintained that the
                    purity which characterizes the administration of justice is here unattainable,
                    because in giving a judgment there is but one form in which it can be justly
                    given, but when an office has to be filled many people may be equally fitted for
                    it, and personal motives must influence a choice. It very rarely happens,
                    however, that direct bribery is supposed to influence such appointments.</p>
                <p>It does not appear that bribery was conspicuous in England until, in the early
                    part of the 18th century, constituencies had thrown off the feudal dependence
                    which lingered among them; and, indeed, it is often said, that bribery is
                    essentially the defect of a free people, since it is the sale of that which is
                    taken from others without payment. It is alluded to by Fielding and Smollett,
                    and had become conspicuous in the days of Hogarth, who represents it in its
                    double shape of demoralization; one picture shows a reckless expenditure of
                    money among profligate expectants, whose demoralization is a systematic source
                    of profit to them, while another presents us with the impoverished father of a
                    family urged against his conscience to relieve the misery of his wife and
                    children by the sale of his vote.</p>
                <p>In England electoral bribery has been the subject of much legislation, which
                    culminated in the Corrupt Practices Prevention Act of 1854 (17 and 18 Vict. c.
                    102). By this Act the following persons shall be deemed guilty of bribery, and
                    shall be punishable accordingly :—</p>
                <p>1. Every person who shall directly or indirectly, by himself or by any other
                    person on his behalf, give, lend, &amp;c., or offer, promise, or promise to
                    procure, &amp;c., any money or valuable consideration to or for any voter or any
                    other person in order to induce any voter to vote or refrain from voting, or
                    shall corruptly do any such act on account of such voter having voted or
                    refrained from voting at any election.</p>
                <p>2. Every person who shall similarly give or procure or promise, &amp;c., any
                    office, place, or employment to or for any voter or other person in order to
                    induce him to vote, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>3. Every person who shall make any gift, loan, promise, &amp;c., as aforesaid to
                    any person to induce such person to procure the return of any person to serve in
                    Parliament or the vote of any voter.</p>
                <p>4. Every person who shall, in consequence of such gift, procure or engage,
                    promise or endeavour to procure the return of any person or the vote of any
                    voter.</p>
                <p>5. Every person who shall pay any money with the <pb break="no"

                    shall pay money in repayment of any money wholly or in part expended in
                    bribery.</p>
                <p>Persons so offending are guilty of a misdemeanour (in Scotland, of an offence
                    punishable by fine and imprisonment), and shall be liable to forfeit the sum of
                    £100 to any person who will sue for the same, together with costs. Sect. 3
                    extends the offence (1) to persons who before or during an election shall
                    receive or contract for any money, &amp;c., for voting, or refraining, or
                    agreeing to vote or to refrain from voting; and (2) to persons who, after the
                    election, receive money, &amp;c., on account of any person having voted or
                    refrained, &amp;c. Such persons shall be guilty of a misdemeanour and forfeit
                    £10.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Treating</hi> is defined in Sect. 4. Every candidate who gives,
                    procures, or pays for any expenses incurred for meat, drink, or entertainment,
                    or provision to or for any person in order to be elected, or for being elected,
                    or for the purpose of corruptly influencing such person to give or refrain from
                    giving his vote at an election, &amp;c., shall be deemed guilty of treating, and
                    forfeit £50 to any person who shall sue for the same; and every person corruptly
                    accepting such meat, drink, &amp;c., shall be incapable of voting at such
                    election. Persons found guilty of bribery, &amp;c., or from whom penalties as
                    above mentioned have been recovered, shall be struck off the list of voters by
                    the revising barrister. Prosecutions and actions under the Act must be begun
                    within one year. Other sections of the Act prohibit giving cockades to voters at
                    elections, or supplying them with refreshments on account of their having polled
                    or being about to poll. Any candidate for a county, city, or borough found
                    guilty by an election committee of bribery, treating, or undue influence by
                    himself or his agents shall be incapable of being elected or sitting in
                    Parliament for such county, city, or borough, during the Parliament then in
                    existence. Up to 1868 disputed elections were dealt with by committees of the
                    House of Commons, but the Parliamentary Elections Act (31 and 32 Vict. c. 125)
                    has transferred the jurisdiction to Her Majesty’s judges (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Elections).</hi> The report of the judge is to have the same
                    effect as the report of an election committee under the old law; and if he
                    reports that corrupt practices have extensively prevailed, a commission of
                    inquiry may be issued under 15 and 16 Vict. c. 57. Candidates reputed by the
                    judge to be guilty of bribery shall be incapable of being elected to the House
                    of Commons for seven years, and during the same period may not (1) be registered
                    as voters; or (2) hold office under 5 and 6 Will. IV. c. 76, or 3 and 4 Vict. c.
                    108, or any municipal office; or (3) hold any judicial office, or act as justice
                    of the peace. Other persons found guilty of bribery after having had an
                    opportunity of being heard suffer the same disqualifications. Similar provisions
                    against bribery, &lt;fcc.,at municipal elections are contained in the Act 35 and
                    36 Vict. c. 60.</p>
                <p>If the election commissioners, appointed under 15 and 16 Vict. c. 57, report the
                    extensive prevalence of corrupt practices, bills may be brought in for the
                    disfranchisement of the constituency. Bridgewater, Beverley, Sligo, and Cashel
                    were so disfranchised in 1870. Four boroughs—Totnes, Reigate, Great Yarmouth,
                    and Lancaster—were disfranchised by the Representation of the People Act, 1867,
                    for corrupt practices. In the case of a vacancy in a constituency where corrupt
                    practices have prevailed at last election, the House may disfranchise it
                    indefinitely, either by a resolution to that effect or by negativing the motion
                    for a new writ.</p>
                <p>The judges manifested great repugnance to the new jurisdiction conferred on them
                    by the Elections Act, aud vigorously remonstrated against it during the passage
                    of the measure through Parliament. It was feared that the purity of the bench
                    might be sullied by being brought into close connection with political contests.
                    Public opinion, however, had distinctly condemned the House of Commons Election
                    Committees, which where necessarily anything but judicial in character, and
                    were, besides, tainted with the suspicion of being frequently actuated by
                    political motives. Many petitions have now been tried by the judges, and in a
                    manner which has given great satisfaction to the country. One consequence of the
                    new system which might have been anticipated is the introduction of more precise
                    definitions into the phraseology of election law. “Agency,” for example, and
                    “valuable consideration,” have been treated by the judges according to the
                    ordinary meaning of the words in courts of law, and candidates have been
                    unseated for the acts of persons, technically their “agents,” but personally
                    unknown to them, and for gifts, generally reputed laudable, but legally falling
                    within the definition of bribes. Bribery flourishes most vigorously in the
                    English borough constituencies; and the secret voting introduced by the Ballot
                    Act seems to have had very little effect on the practice, on account of the
                    fidelity with which the corrupt voters keep their promises. In a recent election
                    inquiry before commissioners, witnesses declared their belief that a quarter, or
                    even more, of the constituency was permanently corrupt, and held the balance
                    between the two political parties. Extensive bribery under the guise of
                    charitable distributions of coal, provisions, &amp;c., seems to prevail in many
                    constituencies, and a still more indirect form is the payment of large
                    subscriptions to public purposes. Recently, it has been observed, constituencies
                    have shown a marked preference for wealthy candidates with some local
                    connection.</p>
