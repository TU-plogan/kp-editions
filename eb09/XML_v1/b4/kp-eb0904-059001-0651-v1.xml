                    (1814-1848), a brilliant writer on theology and the history of philosophy, was
                    born at Annerville, near Clonmel, probably in 1814. His father was a Protestant,
                    his mother a Roman Catholic, and he was brought up in the Romish faith. At the
                    age of nine he was sent to Clonmel school, where he distinguished himself not so
                    much by rigid attention to his class work as by general brilliancy and power.
                    Even when a boy he was strongly drawn towards the imaginative and poetical, and
                    some of his early verses show an astonishing precocity. After leaving Clonmel
                    school he entered Trinity College, Dublin. Two years before he had joined the
                    Protestant church. His career at college was remarkably brilliant. The studies
                    to which he specially devoted himself were the literary and metaphysical; and he
                    was particularly noted for the extreme beauty of his style, both in speaking and
                    in written exercises. In 1834 he gained the ethical moderatorship, newly
                    instituted by Provost Lloyd, and continued in residence at college, pursuing his
                    favourite studies. Many papers were about this time contributed by him to the
                    <hi rend="italic">Dublin University Magazine;</hi> it is to be regretted that
                    these have not been collected. In 1837 he made up his mind to enter the church,
                    and in the same year he was elected to the professorship of moral philosophy,
                    specially founded for him through the exertions of Provost Lloyd. About the same
                    time he was presented to the prebend of Clondehorka, in Donegal, and resided
                    there when not called by his professorial duties to Dublin. In 1842 he was
                    promoted to the rectory of Raymoghy. His lectures and his sermons were equally
                    admired for their strength of thought and richly imaginative style. In 1845
                    appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Irish Ecclesiastical Journal</hi> his <hi
                    rend="italic">Letters on Development,</hi> written under a great press of
                    business, but in every way worthy of the author, and the best reply made to the
                    famous essay of Newman which had called them forth. Butler’s life was but short.
                    He caught cold when returning one day from public service; the cold terminated
                    in fever, which proved fatal in a few days. He died on the 5th July 1848. His
                    <hi rend="italic">Sermons,</hi> published in two vols, by Woodward and Jeremie,
                    have been universally recognized as among the most important recent
                    contributions to theology. They are remarkable not only for rare brilliancy of
                    style, but for subtilty and force of thought. The diction is at times too ornate
                    and rhetorical, but it is not to be forgotten that the sermons were hurriedly
                    written, were never revised, and were all the work of a young man. Their
                    uncommon excellence deepens the regret at the early death of the author. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Lectures on the History of Ancient Philosophy,</hi> edited in a
                    masterly manner by W. HepworthThompson(2 vols. 1856; 2d ed.,lvol. 1875), have
                    taken their place as the best among the few British works on the history of
                    philosophy. The introductory lectures, and those on the early Greek thinkers,
                    are not of the highest value, and though they evidence wide reading, do not show
                    the complete mastery over the material that is found in Schwegler or Zeller. The
                    lectures on Plato, however, are of great value, and furnish a most admirable and
                    enthusiastically conceived exposition of the Platonic system. Butler was
                    evidently attracted by the lofty spirit of Platonism, and sets forth its main
                    features with the warmest admiration. In details he is not altogether to be
                    trusted, but any defects in his scholarship are amply supplied in the valuable
                    notes of his editor.</p>
