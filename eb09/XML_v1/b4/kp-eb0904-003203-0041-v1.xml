                <p><label type="entry">BONGO</label>, a people of Central Africa, who inhabit the
                    country lying between 6° and 8° N. lat., and 27° and 29° E. long., which is
                    watered by five important tributaries of the Bahr-el-Ghazel. The Bongo are a
                    brachyceρhalous race of medium height, with a red-brown complexion and black
                    hair. The grain most largely cultivated by them is sorghum; but they obtain a
                    considerable part of their food from the fruits, tubers, and fungi with which
                    the country naturally abounds. They also eat every living creature—bird, beast,
                    and reptile—except the dog. Tobacco is universally cultivated and smoked. They
                    have no cotton or flax, and go for the most part with no more clothing than an
                    ornamental girdle about the loins. The domestic animals are goats, dogs, and
                    poultry; sheep and cattle are rare. Iron is abundant, and the people smelt and
                    work it with great skill; it forms the only currency of the country, and is
                    extensively employed for all kinds of useful and ornamental purposes. Their
                    spears, knives, rings, and other articles are frequently fashioned with great
                    artistic elaboration. They have a variety of musical instruments,— drums,
                    stringed instruments, and horns,—in the practice of which they take great
                    delight; and they indulge in a vocal recitative which seems intended to imitate
                    a succession of natural sounds. Marriage is generally by purchase; and a man is
                    allowed to acquire three wives, but not more. After marriage the women extend
                    the under lip by the insertion of a peg of wood or bone, which is gradually
                    increased. Tattooing is partially practised. Their method of sepulture resembles
                    that of the Peruvians, the corpse being bound in a crouching position with the
                    knees drawn up to the chin; and their tombs are frequently ornamented with rough
                    wooden figures intended to represent the deceased. Of the immortality of the
                    soul they have no notion; and their only approach to a knowledge of a deity
                    consists in a vague idea of luck. On the other hand they have a most intense
                    belief in a great variety of petty goblins and witches, which are identified
                    with bats, owls, and other ominous animals. Their language is musical, and
                    abounds in the vowels <hi rend="italic">0</hi> and <hi rend="italic">a;</hi> its
                    vocabulary of concrete terms is very rich, but the same word has often great
                    variety of meanings. The grammatical structure is simple. The Bongo are now
                    subject to the people of Khartoom, who have treated them with great injustice,
