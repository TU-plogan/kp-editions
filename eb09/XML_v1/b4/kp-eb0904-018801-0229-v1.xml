                <p><label type="entry">BRACHIOPODA</label></p>
                <p>THE <hi rend="smallcaps">Bracπiopoda</hi> constitute an important and
                    well-defined class of Invertebrates, but the exact position the group should
                    occupy in that division of the animal kingdom is still a matter upon which
                    anatomists have not entirely agreed. For many years the species composing the
                    class were referred to the genus <hi rend="italic">Anomia</hi> of the
                    Lamellibranchiata, but, as was judiciously observed by Edward Forbes, “a close
                    examination shows that there is no relationship between them, but only a
                    resemblance through formal analogy.” Milne-Edwards separated the Mollusca into
                    two great divisions, Mollusca and Molluscoida, and in the last he placed the
                    Brachiopoda, Polyzoa, and Tunicata, an arrangement that has been followed by
                    many naturalists. Although the greater number of zoologists have admitted the
                    close connection existing between the Polyzoa and Brachiopoda, considerable
                    doubt has been expressed with respect to the affinities and position of the
                    latter in relation to the Tunicata; moreover, a strenuous effort has been made
                    within the last few years by Steenstrup, Morse, Kowalevsky, A. Agassiz, and
                    others, to demonstrate that the affinities of the Brachiopoda and Polyzoa are
                    with the Worms, and that they should form classes of Annulosa, and be placed
                    close to the Annelids.</p>
                <p>According to Agassiz, the transition between such types as Pedicellina to
                    Membranipora and other incrusting Polyzoa is readily explained from the
                    embryology of <hi rend="italic">Thecidium,</hi> and, in fact, all incrusting
                    Polyzoa are only communities of Brachiopods, the valves of which are continuous
                    and soldered together, the flat valve forming a united floor, while the convex
                    valve does not cover the ventral one, but leaves an opening more or less
                    ornamented for the extension of the lophore. Both Gratiolet and Hancock have
                    expressed the opinion that the Tunicata are in no way related to the
                    Brachiopoda, and that we cannot place these last and'the Polyzoa along-with the
                    Tunicata in the same division. Gratiolet and some others have considered the
                    Brachiopoda to be allied to the Crustacea, while even the asteridian affinities
                    of the class have been hinted at by King.* <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi></p>
                <p>No doubt can be entertained, after perusing the admirable memoirs by Morse and
                    Kowalevsky on the embryology of <hi rend="italic">Terebratula, Terebratulina,
                    Argiope,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Thecidium,</hi> that the genera composing
                    the class and <hi rend="italic">Amphetrite</hi> possess many important features
                    in common, but almost any Invertebrate groups might be annelidilized by
                    overrating certain points in their affinities. Mr Dall thinks that the general
                    conclusion with reference to the affinities of the Brachiopoda will be something
                    like this. There is much reason for supposing that all the Molluscs and
                    Molluscoids came from the stock out of which the Worms have developed. Indeed,
                    as Huxley has said, they are only isomerous Worms with many special
                    modifications. It is natural, therefore, that the oldest and lowest forms should
                    retain many of the characteristics of the oldest and most simple Worms,
                    especially those which have been modified by a tubular habit. But, on the whole,
                    the modifications are so important that we may continue to consider (if in the
                    specializing tendency of present study we can retain any general divisions of
                    Invertebrates) that the Molluscoids and Molluscs do form two groups somewhat
                    aside from others, and somewhat more nearly related to each other than to the
                    divisions external to them. Therefore, although it may turn out that the
                    Brachiopoda constitute a class close to the Annelids, it cannot be denied that
                    they possess many molluscan characters that cannot be overlooked, and are, under
                    any circumstances, entitled by their importance and numerous distinctive
                    features to constitute a well-defined and separate class.</p>
                <p>The name <hi rend="smallcaps">Brachiopod</hi> (βpαχiωv, an arm, τroυs, πoδ&lt;k,
                    a foot) was proposed for the class by Cuvier in 1805, and by Dumeril in 1809,
                    and has since been very extensively adopted. Blainville in 1824 proposed as a
                    substitute for the Cuvierian name that of Palliobran-chiata <hi rend="italic"
                    >(pallium,</hi> a mantle <hi rend="italic">; branchice,</hi> gills), on account
                    of the respiratory system being combined with.the mantle on which the vascular
                    ramifications are distributed. Prof. King has always adopted the latter name,
                    and perhaps rightly objects to Cuvier’s on the ground that it is a misnomer, for
                    the two variously curved and cirratcd brachial or labial appendages, improperly
                    designated as arms or feet, were subsequently found not to subserve the function
                    of locomotive organs.</p>
                <p>Before describing the various parts of the animal and its shell, it may be as
                    well to mention that it had been many times suggested by Owen, Bronn, Huxley,
                    Gill, and others, that the class could be advantageously divided into two
                    primary groups. Thus, for the first division, including <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lingula, Discina,</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> &amp;lc.,</hi> the names
                    Lyopomata (Owen, 1858),</p>
                <p>Pieuropygia (Bronn, 1862), Inarticulata (Huxley, 1869), Lyopomata (Gill, 1871),
                    have been made use of; while for the second division, comprising <hi
                    rend="italic">Terebratula, llhyn-chonella,</hi> &amp;c., the names Athropomata
                    (Owen, 1858), Apygia (Bronn, 1862), Articulata (Huxley, 1869), Arthro-pomata<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n230/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0230-0189"/> (Gill, 1871) have been proposed. Prof. King,
                    considering these names to be objectionable, and in some cases inadmissible on
                    certain grounds, in 1873 substituted the name <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tretenterata</hi> for the first group, the intestine being provided with an
                    anal aperture, while the second group, to which he gives the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Clistenterata,</hi> would embrace animals that are destitute of
                    that organ; but it must also be remembered that the presence or absence of an
                    anal aperture has been ascertained in only three or four recent genera, and that
                    we are compelled, in a measure, to take for granted that what we find to be the
                    case in <hi rend="italic">Lingula</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Terebratula</hi> is
                    also so in the many extinct families and genera of which the animal cannot be
                    examined.</p>
                <p>With the character above enounced, we generally find structural modifications of
                    the hinge and other differences in the animal, and especially so in what relates
                    to the muscular system. In the opinion of Prof. King the absence of an anal vent
                    in the Clistenterata makes them inferior to the aniferous Tretenterates.</p>
                <p>The animal of the Brachiopod is in all cases protected by a shell composed of two
                    distinct valves; these valves are always, except in cases of malformation,
                    equal-sided, but not equivalved. The valves are, consequently, essentially
                    symmetrical, which is not the case with the Lamellibranchiata or Conchifera,—so
                    much so, that certain Brachiopod shells received the name <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lampades,</hi> or lamp shells, by some early naturalists; but while such may
                    bear a kind of resemblance to an antique Etruscan lamp, by far the larger number
                    in no way resemble one. The shell is likewise most beautiful in its endless
                    shapes and variations. In some species it is thin, semi-transparent, and glassy,
                    in others massive. Generally the shell is from a quarter of an inch to about
                    four inches in size, but in certain species it attains nearly a foot in breadth
                    by something less in length, as is the case with <hi rend="italic"
                    >Productus</hi><hi rend="italic">giganteus.</hi> The valves are also in some
                    species very unequal in their respective thickness, as may be seen in <hi
                    rend="italic">Productus</hi><hi rend="italic">Llangol-lensis, Daυidsonia
                    Verneuιlii,</hi> φc., and while the space allotted to the animal is very great
                    in many species, as in <hi rend="italic">Terebratula spliceroidalis,</hi> it is
                    very small in others belonging to <hi rend="italic">Strophomena, Leptcena,
                    Chonetes,</hi> &amp;c. The ventral valve is usually the thickest, and in some
                    forms is six or seven times as great as the opposite one. The outer surface of
                    many of the species presents likewise the most exquisite sculpture, heightened
                    by brilliant shades, or spots of green, red, yellow, and bluish black. Traces of
                    the original colour have also been preserved in some of the fossil forms;
                    radiating bands of a reddish tint have been often seen in well-preserved
                    examples of <hi rend="italic">Terebratula</hi><hi rend="italic">hastata,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">T. saculus, T. communis, T. biplicata,</hi> and of several others.
                    Some specimens of <hi rend="italic">T. carnea</hi> are of a beautiful pale pink
                    colour when first removed from their matrix, and E. Deslongchamps has described
                    the tint of several Jurassic species.</p>
                <p>The valves have been distinguished by various names, but those of <hi
                    rend="italic">dorsal</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ventral</hi> are in most general
                    use. The ventral valve is usually the largest, and in many genera, such as <hi
                    rend="italic">Terebratula</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Phynchonella,</hi> has a
                    prominent beak, with a circular or otherwise shaped perforation or foramen at or
                    near its extremity, partly completed by one or two plates, termed a deltidiuιn.
                    Through the foramen passes a bundle of muscular fibres, termed a peduncle, by
                    which the animal -is in many species attached to submarine objects during at
                    least a portion of its existence. Other forms show no indication of ever having
                    been attached, while some that had been moored by means of a peduncle during the
                    early portion of their existence have become detached at a more advanced stage
                    of life, the opening becoming gradually cicatrized, as is so often seen in <hi
                    rend="italic">Strophomena</hi><hi rend="italic">rhomboidalis,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Orthesina anomala,</hi> &lt;fcc. Lastly, some species have adhered
                    to submarine objects by a larger or smaller portion of their ventral valve, as
                    is the case with many forms of <hi rend="italic">Crania, Thecidium,
                    Davidsonia,</hi> &lt;fcc. Some <hi rend="italic">Cranias</hi> are always
                    attached by the whole surface of their lower or ventral valve, which models
                    itself and fills up all the projections or depressions existing either on the
                    rock, shell, or coral to which it adhered. These irregularities are likewise, at
                    times, reproduced on the upper or dorsal valve. Some species of <hi
                    rend="italic">Strophalosia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Productus</hi> seem also
                    to have been moored during life to the sandy or muddy bottoms on which they
                    lived, by the means of tubular spines of greater or lesser length. The interior
                    of the shell varies very much according to families and genera. On the inner
                    surface of both valves several well-defined muscular vascular and ovarian
                    impressions are observable; they form either indentations of greater or lesser
                    size and depth, or occur as variously shaped projections. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Trimerellidoe,</hi> for example, some of the muscles are attached
                    to a massive or vaulted platform situated in the medio-longitudinal region of
                    the posterior half or umbonal portion of both valves. In addition to these,
                    there exists in the interior of the <hi rend="italic">dorsal</hi> valve of some
                    genera a variously modified, thin, calcified, ribbon-shaped lamina or skeleton
                    for the support of the labial or brachial appendages; and so varied, yet
                    constant in shape to certain species is this laminal apophysis, that it has
                    served as one of the chief characters in the creation <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n231/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0231-0190"/> of both recent and extinct genera. The apophysis
                    is more or less developed in some genera than in others. In certain forms, as in
                    <hi rend="italic">Terebratula,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Terebratulina,</hi> it
                    is short and simple, and attached to a small divided hingeplate, the two
                    riband-shaped lamina being bent upwards in the middle (fig. 15). The cardinal
                    process is prominent, and on each side of the hinge-plate are situated the
                    dental sockets; the loop in <hi rend="italic">Terebratulina</hi> becomes annular
                    in the adult by the union of the oral processes or crura (fig. 16). In <hi
                    rend="italic">Waldheimia</hi> it is elongated and reflected; the hingeplate
                    large, with four depressions, under which originates a mesial septum, which
                    extends more or less into the interior of the shell (figs. 13 and 14). In <hi
                    rend="italic">Terebratella</hi> the loop is attached to the hinge-plate and to
                    the septum (fig. 17). In <hi rend="italic">Megerlia</hi> it is three times
                    attached, first to the hingeplate, and then to the septum by processes from the
                    diverging and reflected positions of the loop. In <hi rend="italic">Magas</hi>
                    the apophysary system is composed of an elevated longitudinal septum reaching
                    from one valve to the other, to which are affixed two pairs of calcareous
                    lamellae, the lower ones riband-shaped; attached first to the hinge-plate, they
                    afterwards proceed by a gentle curve near to the anterior portion of the septum,
                    to the sides of which they are affixed; the second pair originate on both sides
                    of the upper edge of the septum, extending in the form of two triangular
                    anchorshaped lamellae (fig. 18). In <hi rend="italic">Bouchardia</hi> the septum
                    only is furnished with two short anchor-shaped lamellae. Many more modifications
                    are observable in different groups of which the great family <hi rend="italic"
                    >Terebratulïdae</hi> is composed, and which will be found fully described in
                    Davidson’s and other authors’ works on the Brachiopoda. In <hi rend="italic"
                    >Thecidium,</hi> (figs. 3, 4) the interior of the dorsal valve is variously
                    furrowed to receive a testaceous ridge folded in two or more lobes. In the
                    family <hi rend="italic">Spiriferidae</hi> there are two conical spires directed
                    outwards, and nearly filling the cavity of the shell (fig. 5); while in <hi
                    rend="italic">Atrypa</hi> the broad spirally coiled lamellae are vertical, and
                    directed towards the centre of the valve. In the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bhynchonellidae</hi> there are two short slender curved laminae, while in many
                    genera and even families, such as the <hi rend="italic">Productidoe,
                    Stropkomenidoe, Lingulidoe, Disdnidoe,</hi> &lt;fcc., there exists no calcified
                    support for the labial appendages. The ventral valve in many of the genera is
                    provided with two curved hinge-teeth, which fit into corresponding sockets in
                    the opposite valve, so that the valves cannot be separated without breaking one
                    of the teeth. Nearly all the genera composing the division Clistenterata have
                    their valves articulated, while those forming the Tretenterata have theirs kept
                    in position by the means of muscles especially adapted to that purpose; but in
                    one of the most natural groups, viz., that of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Productidoe,</hi> we find genera presenting both conditions.</p>
                <p>The intimate structure of the shell has been minutely investigated by Dr
                    Carpenter, Prof. King, Dr Gratiolet, and several others, and been found to be
                    distinct from that of the Lamellibranchiata and Gasteropoda. Dr Carpenter
                    informs us that there is not in the shell of the Brachiopoda that distinction
                    between <hi rend="italic">outer</hi> and <hi rend="italic">inner</hi> layers,
                    either in structure or mode of growth, which prevails among the ordinary
                    bivalves; that it seems obvious, both from the nature of the shell substance and
                    from the mode in which it is extended, that the whole thickness of the
                    Brachiopod shell corresponds with the outer layer only of the Lamellibranchiata;
                    and that he has occasionally met with a second layer in recent <hi rend="italic"
                    >Terebratuloe,</hi> within the earlier portion of the shell, but confined to
                    only a part of the surface instead of extending beyond it. In some families
                    composing the Clistenterata it consists, according to Prof. King, of three
                    divisions, the innermost and middle ones, which constitute the entire thickness
                    of the valve, being calcareous with a prismatic or fibrous structure, while the
                    outer divisions would consist of a very thin mcanbrane. The innermost and
                    intermediate divisions are in some families traversed by minute tubular canals,
                    which pass from one surface to the other, for the most part in a vertical
                    direction, and at tolerably regular intervals, but just before terminating near
                    the outer surface of the epidermis their orifices suddenly become dilated, the
                    lower half of the canals being often considerably smaller in diameter than the
                    upper half. The canals are occupied by caecal processes proceeding from the
                    mantle or the fleshy covering of the animal. Their function is, according to Dr
                    Carpenter, branchial or subservient to respiration; but if there exists an outer
                    epidermis, as described by King, which covers their expanded terminations, there
                    would be no communication between the surrounding sea water and the mantle. In
                    the <hi rend="italic">Bhynchonellidae</hi> and in some other families the shell
                    structure would, according to Dr Carpenter, consist of flattened prisms of
                    considerable length, arranged parallel to each other with great regularity, and
                    obliquely to the surface of the shell, the interior of which is imbricated by
                    their outcrop. In certain genera, such as <hi rend="italic">Lingtιla</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Discina,</hi> no canals traverse the shell from the inner to
                    the outer surface. The shell structure, according to Dr Gratiolet, would consist
                    of two distinct elements, that is to say, a corneous or horny animal substance,
                    and a testaceous one; these occur in alternate layers of unequal thickness. The
                    testaceous layers recall the structure observable in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Terebratulïdae,</hi> being traversed by numerous canals of extreme or
                    microscopic minuteness. As Mr Woodward observes in his excellent manual of the
                    Mollusca, Prof. Huxley has suggested that the caeca are analogous to the
                    vascular processes by which in many Ascidians the <hi rend="italic">tunic</hi>
                    adheres to the <hi rend="italic">test,</hi> the extent of which adhesion varies
                    in closely allied genera. It seems, however, strange that these tubular
                    perforations should not have been essential to the species of every family
                    composing the class if they are really subservient to respiration. The subject
                    will therefore demand further consideration.</p>
                <p>The anatomy of the Brachiopoda has been the subject of elaborate investigations
                    by Cuvier, Vogt, Huxley, Hancock, Gratiolet, Woodward, Deslongchamps, King, and
                    others, while of late years much light bas been likewise thrown on the
                    embryology and early stages of the groups by Steenstrup, Lacaze-Duthiers, Morse,
                    F. Müller, Oscar Schmidt, M <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> Crady, Kowalevsky,
                    and others. Some differences in opinion, it is true, have been and still are
                    entertained with respect to the exact function to be attributed to certain parts
                    of the animal, but on all essential questions there is a pretty general
                    agreement.</p>
                <p>According to Morse the Brachiopoda are reproduced by eggs, generally
                    kidney-shaped and irregular, which are discharged from the anterior margin of
                    the shell, and drop just beyond the palliai membrane, hanging in clusters from
                    the setae. Some uncertainty has prevailed as to whether there is a male and
                    female individual. Lacaze-Duthiers and Morse state that the sexes are separate,
                    and describe them as such in <hi rend="italic">Thecidium</hi> and 7ereδraiWwια,
                    and the French zoologist goes so far as to suggest that a difference is even
                    observable in the shell, but the statement requires verification. Prof. Morse
                    describes the embryo of <hi rend="italic">Terebral·ulina</hi> with great
                    minuteness during its six stages of development. It is divided into two, three,
                    or four lobes clothed with vibratile cilia, and before becoming attached swims
                    or whirls head foremost by means of vibratile cilia which cover the body. The
                    same distinguished American zoologist describes with equal care the formation of
                    the shell from its first stage of development to the adult condition.
                    Lacaze-Duthiers alludes to two and four eye spots in the embryo of <hi
                    rend="italic">Thecidium,</hi> and states that the animal appears to be in some
                    measure sensible to light.</p>

                <p>The mouth conducts by a narrow oesophagus to a simple stomach which is surrounded
                    by a large granulated liver. Owen’s “hearts” have been found to be oviducts,
                    while the true heart consists of a pyriform vesicle appended to the dorsal
                    surface of the stomach. The digestive organs and viscera, as well as the
                    muscles, which take up only a small place in the neighbourhood of the beak, are
                    separated from the great anterior cavity, and protected by a strong membrane in
                    the centre of which the mouth is situated. The nervous system consists of a
                    principal ganglion of no great size.</p>
                <p>Both valves are lined by a delicate membrane termed the pallium or mantle; it
                    secretes the shell, and is generally fringed with horny bristles or set®. It is
                    composed of an outer and inner layer, between which are situated the blood
                    channels or lacunes; in fact, all the internal parts of the shell are lined by
                    the inner layer of the mantle, with the exception of the spots where the muscles
                    attach themselve3 to the shell. The outer layer lines closely the inner surface
                    of the valves to which it adheres, and in those species in which the shell is
                    traversed by canals there exist, on the surface of the mantle facing the inner
                    surface of the valves, corresponding short cylindrical membranous projections or
                    lacunes, which insert themselves into the small tubular orifices that traverse
                    the shell. The csecal prolongations do not exist in those genera, such as <hi
                    rend="italic">Rhynchonella,</hi> where the shell is deprived of tubular
                    perforations. The inner layer is rather thicker than the opposite one, and is
                    covered with vιbratile cilia. As stated by Nicholson and other anatomists, the
                    blood channels form a remarkable system of more or less branched tubes,
                    anastomosing with one another, and ending in the caec.al extremities. This,
                    which has been termed by Huxley the arterial system, communicates with the
                    perivisceral cavity by means of two or four organs, which are called
                    pseudo-hearts, and which were at one time supposed to be true hearts. Each
                    pseudoheart is divided into a narrow, elongated external portion (the so-called
                    “ventricle”), which communicates, as Hancock has proved, by a small apicial
                    aperture with the palliai cavity; and a broad, funnel-shaped so-called
                    “auricle,” communicating on the one hand by a constricted neck with the
                    so-called “ventricle,” and on the other by a wide patent mouth with a chamber
                    which occupies most of the cavity of the body proper, and sends more or less
                    branched diverticula into the palliai lobes (Huxley). The channels vary in their
                    dispositions and details in different genera, and as they project to some small
                    extent, leave corresponding indentations on the inner surface of the shell, so
                    that their shape and directions can very often be traced on fossil and extinct
                    genera as well as if the animal was still in life; this may be seen in the
                    numerous illustrations appended to Davidson’s and other authors’ works treating
                    of fossil Brachiopoda. There are usually four principal arterial trunks in each
                    lobe of the mantle; the two central ones run direct to the front, near to which
                    they bifurcate, while the outer ones give off at intervals on the side facing
                    the lateral margin of the valves a series of branches which bifurcate several
                    times. It has been observed by Hancock that the inner lamina of the mantle, and
                    more particularly that portion of it forming the floor of the great palliai
                    sinuses, will undoubtedly assist in purifying the blood. In 1854, in his review
                    of Davidson’s great work on British fossil Brachiopoda, Oscar Schmidt called
                    attention to an important anatomical omission, namely, the existence of a vast
                    number of microscopic, flattened, calcareous, denticulated plates or spiculae on
                    certain parts of the surface of the mantle, and destined, no doubt, to stiffen
                    and protect the portions that contain them; and it was, moreover, observed by
                    Hancock, and afterwards by Deslongchamps, that these calcareous plates are not
                    to be found equally distributed over all the surface of the mantle, but only in
                    those portions in connection with the great lacunes or veins, the labial
                    appendages, and the perivisceral cavity. These spiculae do not appear to bo
                    present in every species, and are totally absent in <hi rend="italic">Lingula,
                    Rhynchonella,</hi> and others. Deslongchamps observes that if we examine the
                    genera <hi rend="italic">Kraussina, Terebratula, Terebratulina, Megerlia,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Platydia,</hi> we have a series wherein the number and
                    consistence uf the calcareous portions increase in a very rapid manner, and that
                    the spicules lie over each other several times, leading the observers by
                    insensible degrees to <hi rend="italic">Thecidium,</hi> in which the spiculae
                    arc soldered together, and incrust the mantle to such an extent that it is no
                    longer distinct from the shell itself.</p>
                <p>The brachial appendages are a pair of singular organs eminently characteristic of
                    the Brachiopoda; they often are more correctly termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >labial</hi> appendages on account of each member being a prolongation of the
                    lateral portion of the lips or margin of the mouth. The Lamellibranchs or
                    Conchifera have analogous appendages, but very much less developed. They assume
                    different shapes in different genera, and are supported, or otherwise, by the
                    more or less complicated skeleton already described. The labial appendages,
                    whatever may be the shape and convolutions they may assume, fill the larger
                    portion of the cavity of the shell in front of the visceral chamber; they are
                    formed of a membranous tube, fringed on one side with long flexible cirri, and
                    occupy almost the whole of the palliai cavity, but were not capable of being
                    protruded in those families in which they were folded back upon themselves and
                    supported by a calcareous skeleton, as in <hi rend="italic">Waldkeimia,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Terebrat</hi><hi rend="italic">ella, Megerlia,</hi> &lt;fcc.
                    Barrett, who has examined the animal of <hi rend="italic">Terebratui</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ina caput</hi><hi rend="italic">serpentis</hi> in life, states
                    that it showed more of itself than <hi rend="italic">Waldheimia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">cranium,</hi> which might be supposed from the labial appendages
                    being in the first very slightly supported by a small loop. Barrett observed,
                    likewise, that it protrudes its cirri further, that the cirri on the reflected
                    part of the brachial appendage are shorter than on the first part, and were <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n233/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0233-0192"/> almost constantly in motion, and often seen to
                    convey small particles to the channel at their base, and that the cirri are bent
                    up when the brachial appendages are retracted, but are generallyuncoiled and
                    straightened when the shell is opened, before which the animal has often been
                    observed to protrude a few of its cirri, and move them about to ascertain if any
                    danger threatened. In <hi rend="italic">Illιynclιonella,</hi> where the
                    elongated spiral labial appendages are slightly supported only at their origin
                    by two short calcareous processes, they can at the will of the animal, according
                    to Owen and Morse, be unrolled and protruded to some distance beyond the margins
                    of the valves, and when forcibly stretched out they are said to be more than
                    four times the length of theshell,and tosupport some 3000 cirri. We may mention,
                    likewise, that Otto Frederick Müller, having dredged from the Lake of Droe-back,
                    in Norway, a number of <hi rend="italic">Terebratui</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >oe</hi> (probably belonging to <hi rend="italic">lihynchonella psittaced),</hi>
                    and placed them in a glass of water, he observed that they gracefully extended
                    their spirally coiled brachial appendages. It must, however, remain for ever
                    uncertain whether, in the extinct genera <hi rend="italic">Spirifera,
                    Atrypa,</hi> and others, in which the spirally coiled fleshy labial appendages
                    were supported throughout their entire length by a calcified skeleton, the
                    animal could protrude them beyond the margin of the valves. In some families—
                    <hi rend="italic">Rhynchonellidoe, Productidoe,</hi> and others—these organs are
                    spiral and separate; in many the separation is only at their extremities. There
                    can be very little doubt that these elegant organs, provided as they are with
                    cirri and cilia, are not only instrumental in conveying microscopic organisms to
                    the mouth, which, as seen in fig. 19, is situated between the appendages at
                    their origin, but are likewise subservient to the functions of respiration.
                    Hancock observes that to prove that the brachial organs subserve the function of
                    gills, as well as that of sustentation, it is only necessary to refer to the
                    manner in which the blood circles round the labial appendages and is carried to
                    the cirri, but more particularly to its circulating through these latter organs,
                    and returning direct from them to the heart.</p>
                <p>As the number and position of the muscles differ materially in the two great
                    divisions into which the Brachiop∩da have been grouped, and to some extent also
                    in the different genera of which each division is composed, it may be desirable
                    to treat this subject under two separate heads. Unfortunately almost every
                    anatomist who has written on the muscles of the Brachiopoda has proposed
                    different names for each muscle, and the confusion thence arising is much to be
                    regretted. In the Clistenterata, of which the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Terebratula</hi> may be taken as an example, five or six pairs of muscles are
                    stated by Hancock, Gratiolet, and others, to be connected with the opening and
                    closing of the valves, or with their attachment to or movements upon the
                    peduncle. First of all, the adductors or occlusors consist of two muscles,
                    which, bifurcating near the centre of the shell cavity, produce a large
                    quadruple impression on the internal surface of the small valve (fig. 13, <hi
                    rend="italic">a, a),</hi> and a single divided one towards the centre of the
                    large or ventral valve (fig. 12, a). The function of this pair of muscles is the
                    closing of the valves. Gratiolet, who has likewise described with great
                    minuteness the muscles of the Brachiopoda, informs us that those which close and
                    open the valves were the only ones known to Pallas, but that he defined their
                    position and functions clearly. The same was done by Blainville and Quenstedt,
                    but the absence of good figures caused much uncertainty to prevail. This
                    deficiency was subsequently supplied by Hancock and Gratiolet’s admirable
                    illustrations. Two other pairs have been termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >divaricators</hi> by Hancock, or <hi rend="italic">cardinal muscles</hi>
                    (“muscles diducteurs” of Gratiolet), and have for function the opening of the
                    valves. The divaricators proper aro stated by Hancock to arise from the ventral
                    valve, one on each side, a little in advance of and close to the adductors, and
                    after rapidly diminishing in size become attached to the cardinal process, a
                    space or prominence between tho sockets in the dorsal valve. The <hi
                    rend="italic">accessory divaricators</hi> are, according to the same authority,
                    a pair of small muscles which have their ends attached to the ventral valve, one
                    on each side of the median line, a little behind the united basis of the
                    adductors, and again to the extreme point of the cardinal process. Two pairs of
                    muscles, apparently connected with the peduncle and its limited movements, have
                    been minutely described by Hancock as having one of their extremities attached
                    to this organ. The <hi rend="italic">dorsal adjustors</hi> are fixed to the
                    ventral surface of the peduncle, and arc again inserted into the hinge-plate in
                    the smaller valve. The <hi rend="italic">ventral adjτιstors</hi> are considered
                    to pass from the inner extremity of the peduncle, and to become attached by one
                    pair of their extremities to the ventral valve, one on each side of and a little
                    behind the expanded base of the divaricators. The function of these muscles,
                    according to the same authority, is not only that of erecting the shell, they
                    serve also to attach the peduncle to the shell, and thus effect the steadying of
                    it upon the peduncle. Gratiolet describes the peduncle with great care, and
                    states it to be composed of two portions—1st, of a horny sheath formed of
                    concentric epidermic layers, very analogous to that which Vogt has described in
                    <hi rend="italic">Lingula;</hi> and 2d, a fibrous stem enveloped by the sheath.
                    This stem, composed of tendinous fibres, is fixed by its free extremity to
                    different submarine objects; the other extremity passes through the foramen, and
                    is ended by a bulbous projection.</p>
                <p>Such is the general arrangement of the shell muscles in the division composing
                    the articulated Brachiopoda, making allowance for certain unimportant
                    modifications observable in the animals composing the different families and
                    genera thereof. Owing to the strong and tight interlocking of the valves by the
                    means of curved teeth and sockets, many species of Brachiopoda could open their
                    valves but slightly. In some species, such as <hi rend="italic">Thecιdium,</hi>
                    the animal could raise its dorsal valve at right angles to the plane of the
                    ventral one (fig. 4).</p>
                <p>In the Tretenterata, of which <hi rend="italic">Lingula</hi> and <hi

                    complicated, and anatomists have differed considerably in their respective views
                    concerning the function of some of the muscles. They have been carefully
                    described by Owen, Vogt, Hancock, Gratiolet Woodward, and others, and more
                    recently by King, whose views seem to carry with them a greater degree of
                    plausibility. Of the shell or valvular muscles he makes out five pairs and an
                    odd one, and individualizes their respective functions as follows :—Three pairs
                    are <hi rend="italic">lateral,</hi> having their members limited to the sides of
                    the shell; one pair are <hi rend="italic">transmedians,</hi> each member passing
                    across the middle of the reverse side of the shell, while the odd muscle
                    occupies the umbonal cavity. The cfn- <hi rend="italic">tral</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">umbonal</hi> muscles effect the direct opening and closing of the
                    shell, the <hi rend="italic">laterals</hi> enable the valves to move forward and
                    backward on each other, and the <hi rend="italic">transmedians</hi> allow the
                    similar extremities (the rostral) of the valves to turn from each other to the
                    right or the left on au axis subcentrically situated, that is, the
                    medio-transverse region of the dorsal valve. It was long a matter in discussion
                    whether the animal could displace its valves sideways when about to open its
                    shell, but this has been actually observed by Professors Semper and Morse, who
                    saw the animal perform the operation. They mention that it is never done
                    suddenly or by jerks, as the valves at are first always pushed to one side
                    several times and back again on each other, at the same time opening gradually
                    in the transverse direction till they rest opposite to one another and widely
                    apart. Those who have not seen the animal in life, or who did not believe in the
                    possibility of the valves crossing each other with a slight obliquity, would not
                    consent to appropriating any of its muscles to that purpose, and consequently
                    attributed to all the lateral muscles the simple function of keeping the valves
                    in an opposite position, or holding them adjusted. We have not only the
                    observations of Semper and Morse, but the anatomical investigations of King, to
                    confirm the sliding action or lateral divarication of the valves of <hi
                    rend="italic">Lingιda.</hi></p>
                <p>In the Clistenterata, where no such sliding action of the valves was necessary or
                    possible, no muscles for such an object were required, consequently none took
                    rise from the lateral portions of the valves as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lingula;</hi> but in an extinct group, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Trimerellidoe,</hi> which seem to be somewhat intermediate in character between
                    the Tretenterata and Clistenterata, have been found certain scars, which appear
                    to have been produced by rudimentary lateral muscles, but it is doubtful
                    (considering the shells are furnished with teeth, though but rudely developed),
                    whether such muscles enabled the valves, as in <hi rend="italic">Lingula,</hi>
                    to move forward and backward upon each other. We do not yet possess any reliable
                    observations as to the manner in which <hi rend="italic">Discina</hi> opens its
                    valves, but Mr Barrett·, who observed <hi rend="italic">Crania</hi> in life,
                    informs us that the valve opens by moving upon the straight hinge, without
                    sliding the valve. There are muscles connected with other portions of the animal
                    in both groups, such as the <hi rend="italic">parietal</hi> muscles, strongly
                    defined in the Tretenterata, and distinctive peculiarities of the peduncle, but
                    the limited space at our disposal will not admit of entering upon further
                    anatomical details.</p>
                <p>The Brachiopoda all inhabit the sea, and are supposed to have attained their full
                    growth in a single season. A vast amount of important and accurate information
                    has been collected during the past ten years with respect to the geographical
                    distribution of recent species, as well as to the marine depths they inhabit or
                    prefer. This important knowledge is mainly due to the numerous well conducted
                    and equipped dredging expeditions carried on by private individuals and by the
                    Governments of the leading maritime states. It would not be possible to give
                    here the names of all those naturalists who have contributed to this portion of
                    our information, but we cannot pass over those of Edward Eorbes, J. G. Jeffreys,
                    W. B. Carpenter, W. H. Dall, W. Thomson, E. Suess, A. Adams, H. Cuming, &amp;c.
                    Previous to these investigations the data we possessed with respect to the
                    habitat and ranges of depth were in most cases vague and unsatisfactory. It has
                    been ascertained that the Brachiopoda are much localized, and usually occur in
                    great numbers in their favourite haunts. Jeffreys does not believe that the
                    habitat of any Invertebrate animal is affected by bathymetrical conditions, and
                    that the same species will occur at various depths. We can say nothing certain
                    with respect to the ranges of depth at which the extinct species lived, but some
                    idea as to their probable depths can be surmised from a study of the recent
                    species. As far as our present information will carry us the Tretenterata do not
                    appear to have been found at a greater depth than 1360 to 2000 fathoms. <hi
                    rend="italic">Lingula</hi> abounds in particular haunts at about half the
                    tide-mark, and partly buried in mud, or at depths varying from three or four
                    inches from the surface of the sea to seventeen fathoms. Prof. Morse describes a
                    species which he found in vast numbers in a sand shoal at low water; the
                    peduncle, six times the length of the shell, was partly encased in a sand tube
                    (fig. 9). He observed likewise that this species <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Lingalu</hi><hi rend="italic">pyramidata)</hi> had the power of moving over
                    the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n235/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0235-0194"/> sand by the sliding motion of the two valves,
                    using at the same time the fringes of setae, which swing promptly back and forth
                    like a galley of oars, leaving a peculiar tract in the sand. In the motion of
                    the setae he noticed the impulse commencing from behind and running forward. <hi
                    rend="italic">Discina</hi> has been found attached to stones at low water mark,
                    and dredged from depths ranging from <hi rend="italic">5 to</hi> nearly 2000
                    fathoms. They are very often clustered together in vast numbers, each adhering
                    by its peduncle to the surface of the shell of its neighbour, one above the
                    other, till they form a living mass of considerable breadth and thickness. <hi
                    rend="italic">Crania</hi> is found in great numbers adhering to stones and
                    shells at depths of from 18 to 530 fathoms. The genera and species of the
                    Clistenterata live at depths ranging from about half tide mark to that of 2600
                    fathoms. <hi rend="italic">Terebratulina caput</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >serpentis</hi> was found by the late R. T. Loweliviry attached to rocks at low
                    water mark on a part of the Scottish coast, where the tide falls only a few
                    feet, but the same species has been dredged alive from depths varying from 3 to
                    upwards of 150 fathoms. Prof. Jukes got immense numbers of specimens of <hi
                    rend="italic">Waldheimia</hi><hi rend="italic">flavescens</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Australis</hi> while boating in Australia among the reefs. They
                    were merely washed by the tide, and he gathered them with his hand like limpets
                    on the shore. Μ. Vélain picked up a small species of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kraussina</hi> in vast numbers on the shore in the interior crater of the
                    island of St Paul, the shell being alternately covered with water and left dry
                    at every tide. <hi rend="italic">Kraussina rubra,</hi> from the coast of Natal
                    in South Africa, was described by Dr Gray as having been found attached in great
                    numbers to ascidia and stems of sea-weeds, and Mr Jeffreys had also previously
                    noticed a small European species similarly fixed to sea-weeds. In general,
                    however, it may be said that the larger number of species inhabit depths varying
                    from 5 to 300 or 400 fathoms. Several species live attached to coral reefs. <hi
                    rend="italic">Waldheimia cranium</hi> has been obtained from depths varying from
                    160 to 228 fathoms. Barrett and Jeffreys state that <hi rend="italic"
                    >Terebratulina caput</hi><hi rend="italic">serpentis</hi> manifested a
                    remarkable power and disposition to move on its peduncle, and that it was
                    incessantly opening and folding its brachial appendages, and drawing in and
                    sucking in, by means of the whirlpool thus caused, every animalcula within its
                    influence.</p>
                <p>It is now necessary to say a few words with reference to the classification of
                    the Brachiopoda, and in drawing up any scheme of arrangement due regard must be
                    paid to the extinct forms, which vastly outnumber those of the present seas. The
                    first species belonging to the class were imperfectly and quaintly described as
                    well as figured by Fabio Columna as far back as 1606. Since then so many
                    palaeontologists have contributed to the elucidation of the fossil species that
                    it would not be possible to give all their names; we must not, however, omit to
                    record those of Linnaeus, Defrance, Von Buch, Alcide DOrbigny, De Blainville,
                    Sowerby, Barrande, De Verneuil, Deslongchamps (father and son), De Koninck, E.
                    Suess, W. King, F. M‘Coy, J. Hall, Billings, Dalman, Dall, Fischer, Pander, C.
                    Moore, Eichwald, Kutorga, Keyserling, Sandberger, Sequenza, Salter, Morris,
                    Meek, and Davidson.</p>
                <p>Various schemes of classification have been proposed, but none as yet can be said
                    to be more than provisionally satisfactory, because before one can classify it
                    is necessary to understand all the characters of the species one has to arrange
                    in their more or less natural groups, and we are not yet in possession of all
                    that necessary information.</p>
                <p>In 1853 Davidson divided the Brachiopoda into eight families, comprising
                    twenty-four genera and about as many sub-genera, but during the years that have
                    elapsed from that to the present time, about seventy more genera and sub-genera
                    have been described, so that as many as one hundred and twenty-three so-termed
                    genera have now to be classed into their respective families, a task which has
                    not yet been satisfactorily accomplished. It is, however, very probable that the
                    number above given has been exaggerated, aud that when our knowledge has
                    increased, some of them will have to be placed among the synonyms.</p>
                <p>It will be necessary in every scheme of classification to admit the two great
                    divisions Tretenterata and Clistenterata.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Tretenterata</hi> would comprise the families <hi
                    rend="italic">Lin-</hi><hi rend="italic">gididoe, Discinidoe, Craniadoe,
                    Trimer</hi><hi rend="italic">ellidoe,</hi> and perhaps one or two others.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Clistenterata</hi> would include the families <hi
                    rend="italic">Tere-</hi><hi rend="italic">bratulidoe, Thecidoedoe, Spiriferidoe,
                    Rhynchonellidoe, Pentameridoe, Strophomeridoe, Orthidoe, Productidoe,</hi> and
                    perhaps two or three others that will have to be characterized. By far the
                    larger number of described genera and species would find their place in this
                    last great division and the above-named families. We will now very briefly
                    notice some of the characters of the families above indicated.</p>

                    calcified supports for the labial appendages; the fleshy spiral ceils directed

                <p>Family 6. <hi rend="italic">Thecidaedoe.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Shells
                    small, thick, varied in shape, attached by a larger or smaller portion of the
                    shell substance of their ventral valve; area flat; deltidium indistinct; valves
                    articulated; loop in the dorsal valve folded into two or more lobes lying in
                    hollows of corresponding shape excavated in the substance of the valve (tigs. 3,
                    4). This loop, or apophysary ridge, supports the brachial membrane, whose
                    thickened cirrated margin is apparently attached to the inner sides of the
                    grooves; shell structure punctated. Only one genus, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Thecidium.</hi> It appeared in the Trias, and has continued to be represented

                    at times straight and extended into wing-shaped expansions; valves articulated,
                    with or without a flattened area in ventral valve; animal free or attached
                    during at least a portion of its existence by the means of a peduncle, or by
                    muscular fibres issuing from an angular or circular foramen in the beak or area
                    of the ventral valve; dorsal valve internally furnished with two calcareous
                    spiral processes, connected in different manners, and directed outwards towards
                    the sides of the shell (fig. 5). These processes afforded support to the
                    brachial appendages. This family composes the following impunctate or punctate

                    articulated, very variable in shape, more or less trigonal, often trilobed or
                    ovate, smooth or plicated (fig. 2); foramen beneath a usually produced and
                    pointed beak, completed by a deltidium at times concealed; brachial appendages
                    fleshy and spirally rolled, flexible, and supported only at their origin by a
                    pair of short-curved shelly processes, or throughout by two broad

                <p>Family 9. <hi rend="italic">Pentameridoe.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Shells
                    ovate, somewhat pentagonal; valves articulated, without hinge-area; foramen
                    angular; no deltidium; inside of ventral valve two contiguous vertical septa of
                    greater or lesser length, which coalesce into one median plate, and then diverge
                    to form the dental plates, enclosing a triangular trough-like chamber. In the
                    interior of dorsal valve are two longitudinal septa of variable dimensions, to
                    which the socket walls converge and which they join, forming two more or less
                    developed and inclined plates, to the produced extremities of which were no

                <p>Family 10. <hi rend="italic">Strophomenidoe</hi> (figs. 6, 7).—Shells
                    semicircular, transverse, or elongated; valves usually concavo-convex, regularly
                    arched, geniculated or depressed, so that the valve which is convex in some
                    species is concave in others, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa;</hi> hinge-line
                    long, straight; area in ventral valve flat, with a fissure partly arched over by
                    a pseudo-deltidium, while the extremity of the beak is either entire or
                    perforated by a small circular foramen. In the dorsal valve the projecting bifid
                    cardinal process fills up almost the entire cavity of the fissure that may not
                    have been arched over by the pseudo-deltidium of the opposite valve. Valves
                    sometimes uniformly convex, the dorsal one sometimes depressed with an area
                    divided by a triangular foramen. In the interior of the dorsal valve a small,
                    simple, projecting cardinal process is situated between prominent socket walls,
                    to the inner extremities of which were (probably) attached the brachial

                    provisionally placed in the <hi rend="italic">Strophomenidoe</hi> into one or
                    two families or sub-families. A family <hi rend="italic">Orthidoe</hi> might be

                    >Orthis</hi> in having a closed fissure, and the cardinal process bifid or

                    piece. In <hi rend="italic">Strophomena</hi> it is situated directly between the
                    dental sockets, or has between them and it a small prominent ridge, or brachial
                    process; for this last is scarcely developed, where it exists, and forms a

                    >Orthis.</hi> There are also four more or less distinctly defined adductor
                    depressions, which are longitudinally parallel to each other, and separated by
                    ridges, while in <hi rend="italic">Orthis</hi> these four divisions are placed

                    more or less concavo-convex, oval, semi-oval, or angular and generally
                    auriculated; the hinge-line straight, with or without teeth and sockets for the
                    articulation of the valves (fig. 8); surface of ventral valve or hinge-line more
                    or less furnished with tubular spines, sometimes of considerable length; no
                    calcareous processes for the support of the brachial appendages; shell structure
                    perforated by canals; cardinal process prominent, bilobed or trilobed. Under
                    this a narrow longitudinal ridge generally extends to about half (or more) of
                    the length of. the valve, and on each side are seen the ramified dendritic
                    impressions, which may be attributable to the adductor muscle. Outside, and in
                    front of these, are the two reniform impressions so characteristic of the

                <p>Assuming that the reader is acquainted with the geological divisions into which
                    the earth’s crust has been grouped, it may be observed that the Brachiopoda,
                    after the Trilobites, occupy the most important place in the Cambrian or
                    Primordial fauna. Thus, in 1871, out of 241 species known to Barrande as
                    composing the animal kingdom of that period, 179 are referable to the Trilobites
                    and other Crustaceans, 28 to the Brachiopoda, while 34 species would be divided
                    between the Annelids, Pteropodes, Gasteropoda, Bryozoa, Cystidians, and
                    Spongida. Subsequently to these researches several additional species of <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n237/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0237-0196"/> Trilobites and Brachiopoda have been added to the
                    list through the indefatigable exertions of Prof. Linnarsson, Mr Hicks, and
                    others. The Brachiopoda, along with the groups mentioned by Barrande, are in all
                    probability the earliest representatives of life at present known; for Mr Hicks
                    has obtained undoubted examples of <hi rend="italic">Lingula</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Lingulella (L.</hi><hi rend="italic">primoeva)</hi> from the very
                    base of the whole Cambrian series of St David’s in Wales. It is impossible for
                    the present to offer more than an approximate comparison, based on numbers, of
                    the genera and species that have existed during the various geological more or
                    less extended periods; and many years will have to pass away before some master
                    mind will be able to grapple with the accumulated observations of a century or
                    more, and reduce the number of genera and species within reasonable limits, from
                    which something like reliable data may be formed. Lyell has stated that nothing
                    is more remarkable in the Silurian strata generally of all countries than the
                    preponderance of the Brachiopoda over other forms of Mollusca. Their
                    proportional numbers can by no means be explained by supposing them to have
                    inhabited seas of great depth, for the contrast between the Palaeozoic and the
                    present state of things has not been essentially altered by the late discoveries
                    made in oυr deep-sea dredgings. We find the living Brachiopoda so rare as to
                    form about one forty-fourth of the whole bivalve fauna, whereas In the Lower
                    Silurian rocks, and where the Brachiopoda reach their maximum, they are
                    represented by more thau twice as many species as the Lamellibranchiate
                    bivalves. There may indeed be said to be a continuous decrease of the
                    proportional number of this lower tribe of Mollusca as we proceed from the older
                    to the newer rocks. Owing to the great number of synonyms it would not be
                    possible at present to offer even an approximate statement with reference to the
                    number of known species. Bigsby states that some 1754 species of Cambrian,
                    Silurian, Devonian, aud Carboniferous species of Brachiopoda have been found in
                    America; 1905 in Europe. It is probable that as many as between four or five
                    thousand species of Brachiopoda have been described, and it is noteworthy that
                    the species, so immensely abundant during the Cambrian, Silurian, Devonian, and
                    Carboniferous periods, became much less numerous during the Permian and
                    Triassic, while they again became abundant, although comparatively reduced in
                    number, during the Jurassic aud Cretaceous periods. In the Tertiaries they had
                    materially decreased in number, and they are represented at the present time by
                    about 100 species. It has also been clearly ascertained that a certain number of
                    genera and species passed from one system or formation into the one that
                    followed it. Thus, approximately, it may be said that nine genera appeared for
                    the first time in the Cambrian system, fifty-two in the Silurian, twenty-one in
                    the Devonian, seven in the Carboniferous, two in the Permian, three in the
                    Triassic, eleven in the Jurassic, five in the Cretaceous, three in the Tertiary,
                    and nine in the recent periods. But what wonderful changes have been operating
                    during the incalculable number of ages in which the creation and extinction of a
                    large number of genera and thousands of species have taken place,—some few only
                    of the primordial or first created genera, such as <hi rend="italic">Lingula,
                    Discina,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Crania,</hi> having fought their way and
                    struggled for existence through the entire sequence of geological time. Many
                    were ' destined to comparatively ephemeral duration,while others had a greater
                    or lesser prolongation of existence.</p>
                <p>The importance of the study of the Brachiopoda must be obvious to all. They are,
                    as already stated, among the first well-known indications of life in this world,
                    and they have continued to be very extensively represented up to the present
                    time. They are also very characteristic fossils by which rocks at great
                    distances, whether in New Zealand or Spitzbergen, in the Himalayas or the Andes,
                    can be identified, without its being even necessary for the Palaeontologist to
                    visit the district whence the fossils are derived; they are, as Manteli would
                    bave termed them, sure medals of creation, the date of their appearance firmly
                    stamped upon them, and their distinctive characters so legibly impressed as to
                    defy misinterpretation. (τ. <hi rend="smallcaps">d.)</hi></p>
