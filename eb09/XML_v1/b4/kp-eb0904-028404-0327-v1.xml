                <p>§ 1. <hi rend="italic">JΓ∖efinitions and General Considerations,—</hi> Bridges
                    are structures designed to carry roads across streams, gullies, or roads. A
                    viaduct may be distinguished from a bridge, inasmuch as the object of the former
                    is to carry a road at a considerable elevation above the surrounding country, by
                    means of structures, similar indeed to bridges, but in which the object of the
                    open spans is to save expense rather than to cross some obstacle which could not
                    be passed by a level road or embankment. The aqueduct is a structure similar to
                    the viaduct, but employed to convey or support water. A culvert may be
                    distinguished from a bridge as an opening, the primary object of which is to let
                    water flow past a road or other obstacle, the object being similar to that of a
                    large drain. A large culvert might be called a small bridge, and a bridge having
                    long approaches with many spans might be called a viaduct. The present article
                    will treat only of Bridges.</p>
                <p>Every bridge may be divided into two parts, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >substructure</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">superstructure.</hi> The
                    substructure of a bridge consists of foundations, abutments, and piers. The end
                    supports of the bridge are the abutments, and the intermediate supports are
                    called piers. Piers and abutments rest on foundations in the ground. A bridge of
                    one span has no piers. The superstructure of a bridge consists of the roadway
                    and the beam, arch, or chain used to carry the roadway from support to
                    support</p>
                <p>The dimensions and design of a bridge depend on the nature of the obstacle to be
                    crossed and on the traffic to which the road over the bridge is subject. The
                    engineer is usually bound to design the cheapest structure which will perform
                    the required duties; he has, therefore, in each case to consider whether a small
                    number of large spans or a large number of small spans will be cheaper. Large
                    spans will be desirable where foundations cannot be easily obtained, or where
                    the height of the structure is great. The engineer has also to determine
                    whether, considering the prices of materials, labour, and transport, one or
                    other form of superstructure is to be preferred. The traffic to be accommodated
                    will determine the width of the bridge and the load which the superstructure
                    must bear. In many cases it will also be the duty of the designer to endeavour
                    to combine beauty with utility. Beauty does not require ornament or expense, but
                    demands, what may be more difficult to supply, correct taste in the
                    designer.</p>
                <p>In Great Britain law prescribes the following minim umdimensions for the over and
                    under bridges of railways. (An <hi rend="italic">over bridge</hi> is one in
                    which the road goes over the railway; an <hi rend="italic">under bridge</hi> one
                    in which the road goes under the railway.) <hi rend="italic">Over bridges.—</hi>

                    >;</hi><hi rend="italic">for</hi> exceptions the Acts must be consulted. In
                    designing a bridge to cross a stream care must be taken to insure that the
                    openings are suitable for the maximum floods.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">load</hi> which the superstructure of a bridge has to carry
                    in addition to its own mass may be estimated as follows :—</p>
                <p>1. For a <hi rend="italic">public road;</hi> one hundredweight per square foot
                    will represent the weight of a very dense crowd. This is greater than any load
                    which ordinary carts or vans will bring on the bridge, but of late years
                    traction engines and road rollers have been introduced, and a weight of perhaps
                    10 tons on each wheel on one line across the bridge ought in future designs to
                    be provided for. The bridge must be strong enough to bear this maximum weight
                    applied at any point, and also to bear all possible distributions of the crowd.
                    A bridge might be fit to carry the crowd uniformly distributed over its surface,
                    and yet fail when the crowd covered one-half of its length or width.</p>
                <p>2. For a <hi rend="italic">railway</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the maximum
                    passing load on each line of rails may be taken as the weight of a train
                    composed exclusively of locomotives. The bridge must be fit to bear this load
                    distributed in all possible ways along the line. For spans above 60 feet on the
                    usual 4 feet 8⅜ inches gauge this load may generally be taken as equivalent to 1
                    ton for each foot in length of each line of way, or in engineering language,
                    “one ton per foot run.” Where a very heavy class of locomotives is in use 11
                    tons per foot run must be provided for. For small spans the distribution of the
                    load as a locomotive passes is such that the above allowance is barely
                    sufficient. For very small spans of 8 or 10 feet the maximum passing load is a
                    little more than the weight on the driving axle of the locomotive, or say 14
                    tons.</p>
                <p>§ 2. <hi rend="italic">Classification.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Bridges are
                    classed, according to the design of their superstructure, as <hi rend="italic"
                    >girders, arches,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">suspension bridges.</hi> A beam of
                    wood crossing a stream, a brick arch, and a platform hung to a flexible wire
                    rope are common examples of the three types. The essential distinction between
                    the three types may be said to be, that in all forms of the suspension bridge
                    the supporting structure <hi rend="italic">(f.e.,</hi> the wire rope in the
                    above example) is <hi rend="italic">extended</hi> by the stress due to the load;
                    in all forms of the arch the supporting structure <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi>
                    the ring of bricks in the above example) is <hi rend="italic">compressed</hi> by
                    the stress due to the load; and in all forms of the beam or girder the material
                    is partly extended and partly compressed by the flexure which it undergoes as it
                    bends under the load,—thus when a beam of wood carrying a load bends, the upper
                    side of the beam is thereby shortened and the fibres compressed, while the lower
                    side of the beam is lengthened and the fibres extended.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Beams</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Girders</hi> may be of various
                    materials,—wrought iron, cast-iron, and wood being chiefly employed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Arches</hi> may be of masonry, or they may be of wrought or
                    cast iron or steel, in which case the compressed sector of a ring is usually a
                    continuous and stiff structure.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Suspension bridges</hi> are made of wire ropes or of separate
                    links of wrought iron or steel pinned together so as to form a chain. The metal
                    beam, arch, or suspension bridge may be a continuous structure or an open frame;
                    we shall also find that in some designs the several simple types are combined so
                    as almost to defy classification.</p>
                <p>Whatever design be adopted, the strength or efficiency to carry a given load
                    depends on similar considerations. The designer selects that form of
                    superstructure which the principles of statics show to be most desirable; he
                    calculates the maximum stress which the load can produce on each part, and then
                    so distributes his material that the maximum intensity of stress on every part
                    shall be a definite fraction of the ultimate strength of the material. In metal
                    structures, where the above principle can be very perfectly carried out, this
                    fraction varies from one-sixth to one» third, according to tlιe certainty with
                    which the stresses and strength of the materials are known. In stone structures
                    the engineer has greater difficulty in calculating the stresses on each part,
                    and relies more on empirical rules based on long experience.</p>

                <p>§ 3. <hi rend="italic">Classes of Stress.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> There are
                    three kinds of stress, due to tension, compression, and shearing. Tension tends
                    to cause failure by the extension or lengthening of the part strained;
                    compression tends to cause failure by the crushing of the part strained; and
                    shearing stress tends to cause failure by the sliding of one part of the piece
                    across the other from which it is shorn off.</p>

                    rend="italic">—</hi> When tension is applied to a rod or link of any material so
                    as to be resisted equally by each element of any imaginary section in a plane
                    normal to the direction of the pull, this section, which is called a <hi

                    equal to the quotient of the whole pull P divided by the area S of the cross

                <p>The ultimate strength of a rod subject to uniform stress is proportional to the
                    section S, and the ultimate strength of the material is measured by the maximum

                    the unit area of cross section can bear; for example, if the unit of force
                    employed be the weight of a ton, and the unit of area the square inch, the
                    strength of materials will be measured in tons per square inch, or by the number
                    of tons which will just tear asunder a rod one inch square, great care being
                    taken that the load is so hung on the rod as to bear equally on all parts of the

                    material ever give exactly similar results. The various brands of iron differ
                    much; different specimens of steel differ still more; the strength is greater
                    when the stress is applied along than when it is applied across the fibres. Iron
                    or steel forged or drawn down to a small cross section is stronger than when in
                    large masses; the material in small castings is stronger than in large castings
                    run from the same batch of metal; the skin is stronger than the rest of a

                    crushing may also be measured in tons per square inch. Thus the ultimate

                    subject to a uniform stress, is given in terms of ∕ <hi rend="subscript"> β</hi>
                    the strength of the material per unit of section by the expression—</p>

                <p>This equation is not applicable to blocks or struts of iron in which the ratio of
                    the shortest side of the cross section to the length is less than about 1 to 5,
                    nor to struts of timber in which this ratio is less than about 1 to 10. When

                    inside of the curve assumed by the strut or pillar, and diminishes it on the
                    outside; but the strut will fail as soon as <hi rend="italic">any part</hi> of

                <p>§ 6. <hi rend="italic">Strength to resist Shearing.</hi> —Let a bar AD of any
                    material be firmly supported on C, as shown in fig 1, and let a strong tool B,
                    say of steel, descend upon it in the direction of the arrow, with force
                    sufficient to sever the part D from the part A, so that the surface dividing the
                    two parts is in the plane of the face of C. This tool is said to <hi
                    rend="italic">shear</hi> the bar, and the resistance which the bar opposes to
                    this stress is called its strength to resist shearing. The tools practically
                    used to shear are not quite square at the edge, and therefore <hi rend="italic"
                    >cut</hi> slightly, but for true shearing the lower face ought to be square, and
                    the tool should come down close to the support, so that the inner face of the
                    tool slides on the outer face of the support.</p>
                <p>Fig 2. represents two iron links joined by an iron pin. If the links are pulled
                    asunder the pin will be shorn at two places, A and B, and the whole section
                    shorn will be twice the cross section of the pin.</p>
                <p>Fig 3 shows a joint where the pin would be shorn in four places—A, B, C, and
                    D.</p>
                <p>The strength of a piece of any material to resist shearing is usually assumed by
                    engineers to be proportional to the cross section to be shorn through, and each
                    material may consequently be said to have a certain shearing strength per square
                    inch; in other words, the ultimate shearing strength of the material is the <hi
                    rend="italic">intensity</hi> of stress required to shear it asunder. If,
                    therefore, Pi be the ultimate strength of a bar of cross section S to resist
                    shearing in <hi rend="italic">n</hi> places, and if <hi rend="italic">f</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> t</hi> be the ultimate strength of the material, we
                    have the expression—</p>
                <p>1 P <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> =nS∕,.</p>
                <p>The assumption on which this equation is founded is not strictly correct; indeed,
                    the actual shearing described does not correspond with any simple homogeneous
                    stress, and the form of the cross section shorn through must exercise
                    considerable influence on the strength of the piece to resist shearing. In a
                    round pin the maximum intensity of shearing stress is 4 of the mean intensity,
                    and in a rectangular<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n330/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0330-0287"/> pin -∣ of the mean intensity. See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Strength of Materials.</hi></p>
                <p>The pins which join the links of suspension bridges, and the rivets which join
                    the wrought iron plates of girder bridges, are subject to shearing stress, and
                    the area to be shorn through must be made sufficient to bear the total shearing
                    stress on that part of the structure. Wood is strong to resist tension, and
                    would be much employed for ties but for the difficulty of taking hold of the
                    ends of the tie in such a way that these ends shall not fail by being shorn.</p>
                <p>Fig 4 shows the end of a balk of wood with a strap bolted to it. This strap would
                    be torn off by the shearing of the wood along the dotted lines <hi rend="italic"
                    >ab</hi> and <hi rend="italic">cd,</hi> with a stress which would be much less
                    than that required to overcome the tenacity of the wood; for if the dimensions
                    of the balk of pine are 6 in. by 2 in. with an inch hole, its tensile strength
                    will be 10 × 5 or 50 tons, while if the bolt be 1 inch diameter, and be placed 4
                    inches from one end, it could be torn out by shearing 16 inches of the wood; now
                    each inch will only resist a shearing stress of say 600 B⅛, so that the bolt
                    would be torn out with only 4 3 tons. Thus at least eleven such bolts, each 4
                    inches from its neighbour, and occupying 3 feet 8 inches in length of this balk,
                    with an iron strap of corresponding length, would be required to render the full
                    strength of the balk as a tie available. A similar difficulty is met with when
                    timber is joined, as in fig. 5, where shearing would take place along the dotted
                    lines AB or CD.</p>

                    tearing in the ratio of three to four approximately. Rivets employed to joint
                    steel plates require, therefore, to be larger or more numerous than those

                    tension or compression, it is lengthened or shortened by the stress, and the
                    amount of extension or compression for the same length and stress varies with
                    different materials. Approximately correct results are obtained by assuming that
                    the extension or compression of a given piece of the material of uniform cross
                    section, under a uniformly distributed stress constant throughout its length, is
                    proportional to the length of the piece and to the intensity of the stress.</p>

                    constant ratio E has received the name of modulus of elasticity, and is

                <p>The modulus of elasticity is very generally assumed as equal for extension and
                    compression, which is nearly true for wrought iron and steel under any stress to
                    which these materials can be safely subjected. The principle of continuity shows
                    that there can be no difference in the value of E for positive and negative
                    stresses so long as these are small. The law according to which E varies as <hi
                    rend="italic">p</hi> changes is not accurately known for any material. When the
                    stress is small the value of E appears to be more nearly constant in wrought
                    iron than in cast-iron, but the change in the value of E corresponding to a
                    change from a small stress to the ultimate stress is greater in wrought iron
                    than in cast-iron. The values in the table cannot be depended upon to give very
                    exact results, as the elasticity of different specimens of the same material
                    varies considerably; the theory is wholly inapplicable when the breaking strain
                    is approached; the engineer, however, seldom requires to calculate the
                    extensions or compressions when the stress is even so great as one-third of the
                    ultimate strength. For the same reason the engineer need seldom take account of
                    the permanent set caused by stresses exceeding those within which the material
                    may be considered perfectly elastic. B. D. Stoney, in his work on the theory of
                    strains on girders, gives an excellent summary of what is known experimentally
                    concerning <hi rend="italic">set</hi> and the modulus of elasticity.</p>
                <p>§ 8. <hi rend="italic">Strength to resist Tension or Crushing when the Stress is
                    not Axial.—</hi> When the resultant of a stress passes through the centre of
                    surface of the cross section of the piece of a structure, and is normal to the
                    cross section, the stress is called <hi rend="italic">axial,</hi> and it is
                    usually assumed that this stress will be borne uniformly by all the elements
                    into which the surface of the cross section may be conceived as divided. This is
                    not necessarily true, but it is approximately true for the forms usually
                    employed by engineers. When the stress is not axial it cannot be considered,
                    even approximately, as uniformly distributed; the greatest intensity of stress
                    will occur towards that edge of the cross section which is neatest <pb

                    of the cross section. The following considerations allow the maximum intensity
                    of stress to be approximately calculated in most of the cases which are
                    practically met with. 1. Let the cross section (fig. 6) have an axis of symmetry

                    must be borne in mind that the ultimate strength of any member of a structure is

                    when the part most strained yields the structure is weakened thereby, and this

                <p>When the distribution of the loads is known, equation 2 gives the weight borne by

                <p>These equations express the fact that the beam, as used in a bridge, is as a

                    so soon as the distribution of load and the span are given.</p>
                <p>§ 13. <hi rend="italic">Internal Farces.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The
                    external forces call into play certain internal forces. A beam of given design
                    will be properly <hi rend="italic">proportioned</hi> if each part has just those
                    dimensions which are suitable to bear the maximum <hi rend="italic"

                    and the beam will be properly <hi rend="italic">designed</hi> if its form is
                    such as to enable it to bear the load with the least possible quantity of
                    material. A complete analysis of the internal forces in a loaded beam would in
                    any case be exceedingly difficult and with most designs impossible, but it is
                    found by experiment that a beam will bear a given load if we provide strength
                    enough to resist the <hi rend="italic">horizontal</hi> components of those
                    internal forces which tend to extend or compress the beam in the direction of
                    its length, and if we also provide against the <hi rend="italic">vertical</hi>
                    components which tend to shear the beam across in planes perpendicular to the
                    longitudinal axis of the beam. The nature of the horizontal and vertical forces
                    due to the elastic reaction of the material will be understood by reference to
                    figs. 9, 10, 11.</p>

                    cylinders must be so attached to the frames as to be capable of resisting both
                    extension and compression. The whole structure will now have somewhat the
                    appearance of a beam, but if it is placed between two supports Q, N, it will be
                    found unsuited to carry even its own weight, because the middle frames will tend
                    to slip down between the two others.</p>
                <p>This tendency will be still better seen when a load is placed on the imperfect
                    beam. Fig. 10 shows the tendency to shear off the loaded from the unloaded part

                    be counteracted by tongues, T, T <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, T <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, projecting from one frame and working in a groove in
                    the neighbouring frame <hi rend="italic">(vide</hi> § 19). Each tongue should be
                    made so that it does not abut against the bottom of the groove, and is thus
                    incapable of resisting any horizontal force—it must neither prevent the whole
                    beam nor any part of it from being extended or compressed longitudinally.</p>
                <p>The structure will now be found capable of carrying weights as a beam. It
                    deflects or bends as in fig. 11 under the action of a load on A <hi

                    the sections between the frames the horizontal internal forces are wholly met by
                    the elastic reaction due to these horizontal extensions and compressions.</p>

                    these forces consequently constitute a couple, and the moment of this couple
                    must be equal to the moment of the couple tending to bend the beam at this
                    section, or to what is called the <hi rend="italic">bending moment;</hi> now the
                    <hi rend="italic">bending moment</hi> in this simple case is due to the upward
                    vertical reaction P <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> at N and the equal downward
                    force with which the frame A <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> bears on the tongue T
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>; for it is clear that, neglecting the weight of the
                    frame, if a weight W on frame A <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> is borne by two
                    forces P and P <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> at the two piers, the tongue next N
                    must also bear a vertical force P <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and the tongue
                    next Q a vertical force P. The stresses borne by the india-rubber pieces are
                    exactly the same as if the frame A <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> were firmly
                    held, and a vertical force P <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> applied to pull up the
                    right hand part of the beam, while the tongue T <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>
                    acted as a hinge; the moment tending to turn the right hand part round in a
                    left-handed direction would be P <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> (L — ar <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi>). This moment is resisted by the elasticity of the

                <p>Thus if the dimensions of the beam be those given above and it be supported so

                    (two cylinders side by side, each with a section of 1 inch) we shall have as the
                    numerical values in the above equation, neglecting the weight of the frame

                    >p</hi> = 8 × 2 ’ 64 = 2142 lb; the stress on each of the inner rows will be
                    half this amount; the same equations give the load which (so far as that
                    particular section is concerned) can safely be placed on the frame A <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> consistently with a given stress per square inch on the
                    rubber. The strength required in the tongue T <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> is
                    still more easily found, the stress tending to shear it off is P <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, and it must have a sufficient cross section to bear
                    that shearing stress. Similar reasoning would allow us to calculate the strength
                    of our beam at either of the two other sections where the indiarubber pieces and
                    tongues are placed. The general relation between the external and internal
                    forces in any beam is similar to that illustrated by the model; at any section
                    the moment due to the elastic forces must balance the moment due to the external
                    forces tending to bend the beam at that section. The problem, therefore, of
                    determining the strength of a beam at any section resolves itself, so far as the
                    horizontal forces are concerned, into finding expressions for these two moments
                    and equating them. The equation thus stated will give the maximum horizontal
                    stress thrown on the material of a given girder by a given load, or it will give
                    the maximum load on a given girder consistent with a safe stress on the
                    material, or if, as is generally the case in bridges, the load and maximum safe
                    stress on the material are given, the equation will allow us to fix the
                    dimensions required for the cross section of the beam so far as the horizontal
                    forces are concerned. The provision to be made for resisting the shearing stress
                    for which the tongues are required in the model will be explained in § 19.</p>
                <p>In any solid beam the stresses do not divide themselves into horizontal and
                    vertical components. This division .is made by the engineer to simplify his
                    calculations. In the beam the actual stress at any point will be the resultant
                    of the horizontal stress (borne by the india-rubber in the model) and the
                    vertical stress (borne by the tongue in the model). The diagram, fig. 12, shows
                    the direction of the resultant stress at each point of a beam of rectangular
                    cross section. The curves are called the lines of principal stress.</p>

                <p>Experiments on the modulus of rupture have generally been made by hanging weights
                    at the centre of a rectangular bar, supported at both ends, and increasing the
                    weights till the bar breaks. Then let <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi> and <hi rend="italic">l</hi> be the breadth, depth, and
                    length of the bar in inches, and W the breaking weight. M is a maximum at the
                    centre, and, neglecting the weight of the bar, is equal to ⅛WZj substituting the
                    value of I for a rectangle in equation 3, we get and equating M and <hi
                    rend="italic">y.</hi> we have—</p>

                <p>Hence the modulus of rupture is stated by Rankine to be “eighteen times the load

                    and loaded in the middle between the points of support.”</p>
                <p>The use of a modulus of rupture determined by experiment on a special form of
                    beam is not based on any satisfactory principle. The employment of this modulus
                    is an imperfect means of correcting a defective theory. A different value is
                    found for <hi rend="italic">f</hi> when bars of different sizes or cross
                    sections are tested. Even the same bar broken in different ways will give a
                    sensibly different value for ∕. The use of this modulus is, however, convenient
                    when great accuracy is not required.</p>

                <p>When a uniform passing load, such as is approximately represented by a train of
                    locomotives, of length at least equal to the span of the bridge, comes on to a
                    bridge at one end and passes over to the other, gradually covering the whole
                    span, the bending moment reaches a maximum for all sections when the bridge is
                    wholly covered. The bending moment at any section for a combination of loads is
                    the sum of the moments at that section due to each load taken separately. When
                    many different distributions of load have to be provided for engineers are in
                    the habit of representing the bending moment for each load by a line, the
                    ordinates of which are the bending moments at the sections, and the abscissae
                    the distances of the several sections from one point of support. The lines
                    having been drawn for the several loads, it is easy by superposition to find the
                    bending moment due to the combination, and thus to pick out for each section of
                    the girder the maximum bending moment which any combination gives. Figs. 15,
                    15α, 15δ, and 15c show diagrams giving the curve of bending moments for some
                    simple distributions.</p>

                    the centre of a span of 50 feet. The vertical ordinates measured on the vertical
                    scale give the bending moments at each section. Fig. 15α shows the curve of

                    upper curve in fig. 155 shows the curve of bending moments when the loads of
                    case 1 and 2 both occur at once. This curve is obtained by adding the ordinates
                    in case 1 to those in case 2. Fig. 15c shows the four separate lines of bending
                    moment for four separate weights, and the broken upper line is the line of
                    bending moments for the case when the four loads all rest at once on the beam;
                    it is got by simply adding at each point of the span the four ordinates due to
                    the four loads considered separately. The curve in fig. 15α and the curve ABCD
                    in fig. 15c are parabolas.</p>
                <p>The bending moment at any section is reckoned as <hi rend="italic">positive</hi>
                    when the external forces on the beam tend to turn the right hand side of the

                <p>Substituting the modulus of rupture <hi rend="italic">f</hi> (Table VIII.), for
                    ι∖ in equation 3, § 14, we can from the above values 21</p>

                    >cL</hi> section to resist any given bending moment. Thus, if we wish to know
                    what breadth we must give a bar of wrought iron 3 inches deep, supported at
                    points 3 feet apart, so that it may break with 2000 ft) at the centre, we find
                    the maximum bending moment from equation 2, § 16; and we find the value of <hi
                    rend="italic">μ</hi> from equation 3, § 14, by the help of table IX. Then
                    equating M and <hi rend="italic">μ,</hi> we have—</p>
                <p>1 iWL = ⅜∕M≡, from which δ= 4^-= <hi rend="subscript"> 4 x 8 x 42000</hi> ≈
                    286.</p>
                <p>Since the strength of the beam is directly proportional to 21</p>
                <p>the values of -y, table IX. shows us how to dispose of the tv material in the
                    cross section so as to obtain the maximum strength. The expression for a
                    rectangle shows that the strength is proportional to the breadth of a beam, but
                    to the square of its depth; and therefore, as appears in the second column, for
                    the same quantity of material the strength of a rectangular beam increases
                    simply as the depth, so that a deep narrow beam is preferable to a square or to
                    a broad and flat one. The circular cross section is weak compared even with the
                    square (the ratio for the same quantity of material is ’ 846 to 1). The hollow
                    tube is stronger than the thin rectangular plate of the same depth and cross
                    section, but clearly the material is much best applied when whollyused in the
                    form of two thin flat plate3, separated from one another by a web of the maximum
                    depth <hi rend="italic">d</hi> which can be practically allowed. Thus the hollow
                    rectangle is the form preferred for large girders, the material intended to
                    resist the bending moment being placed in the top and bottom members of the
                    girder, and kept apart by vertical webs, which add somewhat to the moment <hi
                    rend="italic">μ,</hi> but which are chiefly employed to resist shearing stress,
                    as will be presently shown.</p>
                <p>The I section, fig. 16, is that employed for small girders; the moment of its
                    elastic forces is exactly the same as that of a hollow rectangle, having the
                    same values for <hi rend="italic">b, d,</hi> and d <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>,
                    and having a value for <hi rend="italic">b</hi><hi rend="italic subscript">
                    1</hi> equal to 2δ <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> in fig. 16 It is usual to
                    neglect the strength to resist bending moment given by the vertical web, and to
                    design the girder so that the top and bottom plates are alone sufficient to meet
                    this stress. The model, fig. 10, shows at once that to obtain the full
                    resistance from the material employed to resist tension or compression
                    consistently with a given depth, it must all be placed in two horizontal plates
                    at the extreme top and bottom of the beam; moreover, if ∣S is the sectional area
                    of the top or bottom member, and <hi rend="italic">f</hi> is the stress it will
                    bear (assumed equal for tension and compression), the maximum moment which the
                    elastic forces can exert is the sum of the moments due to the top and bottom
                    members about the axis or tongue, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> 2(∣∕S×∣cZ) or
                    |/SiZ; or dismissing the idea of an axis through the centre of gravity of the
                    section, we may (to refer again to the illustrative model) take the moment of
                    the elastic forces round the line running through the top row of india-rubber
                    pieces looked upon as a fulcrum, and then the moment of the bottom row will be
                    as before ⅜∕ <hi rend="subscript"> t</hi> S&lt;∕, and will be the <hi
                    rend="italic">whole moment</hi> of the elastic forces. Similarly, by taking the
                    bottom row as the fulcrum, we see that the moment due to the top row will be the
                    same. This moment calculated in either way is the <hi rend="italic">whole</hi>
                    moment of the elastic forces. This latter mode of considering the moment in the
                    simple case of an I or hollow rectangle, enables us to find the value of the
                    moment of elastic forces for those cases in which the ultimate strength may not
                    be the same for tension and compression. Thus, assume that the strength of
                    wrought iron to resist tension, or <hi rend="italic">f</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> l</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> is 25 tons, and its strength to
                    resist compression, or <hi rend="italic">f</hi><hi rend="italic subscript">
                    c</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> is 20 tons, then calling S, the area of the
                    bottom member at the section considered, and S <hi rend="subscript"> c</hi> the
                    area of the top member, we have for <hi rend="italic">μ</hi> the two values 25 S
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> cZ and 20 S <hi rend="subscript"> c</hi> cZ;
                    whichever happens to be the smaller will represent the available value of the
                    moment of the elastic forces. Consequently we must, in order not to waste
                    material, design the beam so that the ratio of the material in the upper member
                    to that in the lower member shall be 5 to 4. That this ratio ought to be adopted
                    is evident from the fact that the strength of the beam will be limited by that
                    of the weaker member. No structure is perfectly designed unless it will when
                    overstrained give way simultaneously in every part. The foregoing theory, the
                    soundness of which is borne out by experiment, tacitly assumes that, although
                    the strength differs, the modulus of elasticity is constant for tension and
                    compression. For example, if the flanges are made with sections bearing to one
                    another the proportion of 4 to 5, the neutral axis (neglecting the web) will,
                    assuming E constant, be at a distance from the top or larger flange equal to
                    ⅜ths of the depth; then the intensity of stress varying directly as the distance
                    from the neutral axis will for the two flanges be in the desired ratio of 4 to
                    5. Thus we see not only that the I, or hollow rectangle, has the advantage of
                    being the best form for a girder, but that it allows us easily to arrange the
                    material to the best advantage, even when its strengths to resist tension and
                    compression are dissimilar. Values of the modulus of rupture given above are
                    therefore not to be applied to this design of beam, but the values of <hi
                    rend="italic">f</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> t</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >f</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> c</hi> are to be taken from Tables I. and
                    II. In the case of cast-iron the member under tension is made with six times the
                    cross section of the member under compression, the reason being the same as that
                    for making the ratio of the upper and lower members of the wrought iron beam 5
                    to 4. When a cast-iron beam is thus designed, the moment which any section can
                    exert will for a given depth be proportional to the area S <hi rend="subscript">
                    t</hi> of the lower flange. Pro fessor Hodgkinson verified this theory experi
                    mentally, and found that the ultimate value of the moment due to elastic forces
                    expressed in lbs and inches for beams thus designed was <hi rend="italic">μ</hi>
                    = 16500 S <hi rend="subscript"> (</hi> c?. The value of the constant agrees
                    closely with the tensile strength of cast-iron. The experiments by Professor
                    Hodgkinson are there fore consistent with the assumption, that although the
                    strength of cast-iron is very different in resisting tension and compression,

                    1</hi>, fig. 14, perpendicular to the plane in which a beam is bent, and passing
                    through the centre of gravity of any given cross section, is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">neutral axis of</hi> the beam at that point. The surface
                    containing all the neutral axes is the <hi rend="italic">neutral surface.</hi>
                    Practical engineers sometimes apply the term neutral axis to the longitudinal
                    line showing the neutral surface on a side elevation, but in this article, as in
                    Rankine’s works, the words will be used as defined above.</p>
                <p>When the assumption is made that the modulus of elasticity is the same for any
                    given material whether under tension or compression, notwithstanding any
                    difference in the ultimate strength to resist tension or compression, then it
                    follows, as has been shown, that the neutral surface of a bent beam will
                    separate it into two parts, one of which is compressed while the other is
                    extended. The neutral axis in any cross section then contains the only part of
                    the material which is neither extended nor compressed.</p>
                <p>If, however, the average value of E for stresses varying between zero and the
                    maximum intensity of compression to which the beam is subjected be different
                    from the average value between zero and the maximum intensity of tension, then
                    the neutral axis as above defined will not be the <hi rend="italic"
                    >unstrained</hi> axis; the neutral axis is determined as soon as the cross
                    section of the beam is known, being independent of the material used; the
                    unstrained axis may differ in beams of the same cross section but made of
                    different materials; for if the average of E be greater say for compression than
                    for tension, this will raise the unstrained axis above the neutral axis. It is
                    not improbable that the position of the unstrained axis may vary in the same
                    beam with loads similarly distributed, but of different magnitude, and also with
                    different distributions of load. Until experiments shall have accurately
                    determined the relation of E to the intensity of stress we have no means of
                    determining accurately the position of the unstrained axis. Even when E is
                    constant the neutral axis, as above defined, will not always in practice
                    correspond with the unstrained axis; for instance, in a beam which was not only
                    bent across, but also compressed endways, the unstrained surface would no longer
                    contain the neutral axis as above defined. The unstrained surface might be near
                    one edge of the beam, or, indeed, if the general compression were large and the
                    bending'small, the whole beam might be under compression, so that no part was
                    unstrained. By restricting the use of the words neutral axis to the above
                    definition, and using the words unstrained axis, or unstrained surface, for the
                    second idea all ambiguity will be avoided.</p>
                <p>The actual position of the unstrained axis in any beam of 'any material subject
                    to a bending moment depends on the relative values of the modulus of elasticity
                    for the material under all stresses positive and negative, great and small; but
                    as the simple hypothesis of a constant modulus is borne out by experiment in the
                    most important materials, it is unnecessary to pursue this subject further.</p>
                <p>§ 19. <hi rend="italic">Shearing Stress.—</hi> The theory hitherto given shows
                    the relation between longitudinal stresses (such as are resisted by the
                    india-rubber in the model) and the load on the girder; but in designing a girder
                    we have also to provide for the shearing stress or transverse force tending at
                    each imaginary cross section to make the more heavily loaded of the two parts
                    into which it divides the bridge slide down past the other. This shearing stress
                    was resisted by the tongues. of the model. The total shearing stress at any
                    section is the sum of all the vertical forces acting on the beam on one side of
                    the section. The shearing stress at any section will be called positive if the
                    sum of the external forces on the right hand part of the beam tends to lift that
                    portion up. Diagrams may be conveniently used to show shearing stresses, and, as
                    in the case of bending moments, the shearing stress at any section due to two or
                    more loads is simply the algebraic sum of the shearing stresses due to each
                    load.</p>
                <p>Example 1. Load W at centre between supports (fig. 18); weight of beam neglected.
                    The shearing stress is equal to ∣W all along the beam, being the reaction at one
                    pier; the stress is positive to the right of the load, negative to the left.</p>
                <p>Example 2. Uniformly distributed load <hi rend="italic">v&gt;</hi> per foot run
                    (fig. 18α). The shearing stress is <hi rend="italic">⅛tvL</hi> at the points of
                    support, and zero at the centre of the span; at any section distant <hi
                    rend="italic">c</hi> from the centre of the beam it is <hi rend="italic"
                    >wc.</hi></p>
                <p>Example 3. A single load rolling from right to left of a beam of span L (fig.
                    186). When the load is at the distance <hi rend="italic">X</hi> from the right
                    hand support the shearing stress to the right T. 7* wT</p>
                <p>of the load is W—≡—, and to the left it is =-. The</p>
                <p>Ju JL∣</p>
                <p>maximum stress for each section occurs when the load reaches that section; it is
                    positive for the right half, and negative for the left half of the beam.</p>
                <p>Example 4. Uniform advancing load of <hi rend="italic">w</hi> perunit of length
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n339/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0339-0296"/> (fig. 18c). When the load covers a length <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> measured from the right hand pier, the shearing stress at
                    all points beyond <hi rend="italic">x</hi> towards the left is - —; when <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> is greater than 4L</p>
                <p>the above expression gives the maximum stress which can occur on that section
                    with any distribution of the given uniform load. Thus the maximum shearing
                    stress at the left end occurs when the whole bridge is loaded, and is - ∣wL; the
                    maximum stress at the centre occurs when the bridge is half loaded, and is equal
                    to - ∣wL. The maximum shearing stresses on the other half of the beam occur when
                    the load comes on from the left side, and covers more than half of the beam;
                    these stresses are equal in amount to the stresses in the left half, but are
                    positive in sign.</p>
                <p>The scales in figures 18,18«, correspond to the shearing stresses in examples 1
                    and 2 for a span of 50 feet and loads of 10 tons and 1 ton per foot run
                    respectively. The scale in fig. 185 corresponds to the shearing stresses in ex
                    ample 3 with a single passing load of 14 tons. The scale in fig. 18c, example 4,
                    gives the maximum shearing stress which the advancing load of one ton per foot
                    run can produce at each section. As a train leaves a bridge it produces the same
                    shearing stresses as when it comes on to the bridge from the opposite end, the
                    same portions being similarly loaded. The maximum shearing stress due to a
                    passing load of this kind changes its sign at the centre of the span, as appears
                    by diagram 18c.</p>
                <p>In I girders with solid vertical webs the shearing stress is practically all
                    borne by the web unassisted by the top or bottom members, it being clear that
                    these would fold down at the sides under a small fraction of the total stress.
                    Sufficient material is therefore employed in the web or upright plates to reduce
                    the intensity of the stress to the desired amount. The shearing stress may,
                    however, when ths web is a thin iron plate, cause failure by crumpling the web,
                    or causing it to buckle, instead of by shearing it across. This tendency is
                    prevented by stiffening the web with angle or T irons rivetted to the sides.
                    Mathematical analysis has not yet been very successfully applied to the
                    determination of the amount of stiffening required; experience has given a
                    sufficient number of examples to guide the practical designer. In cast-iron
                    girders the web is generally much in excess of the strength required to resist
                    shearing.</p>
                <p>§ 20. <hi rend="italic">Factor of Safety.·</hi> —In designing a girder the load
                    which it will have to carry is multiplied by a number called the factor of
                    safety, varying from 3 to 6, and the girder is so designed that it shall not
                    yield at any point with less than the load thus multiplied. If, for instance,
                    the girder is practically to carry 1 ton per foot run, it is designed so that at
                    no place shall it <hi rend="italic">break or yield injuriously with</hi> less
                    than say 5 tons per foot run. The multiplier is called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >factor of safety.</hi> The factor of safety is required to allow for
                    imperfections in the material as compared with picked specimens, for the wear
                    and tear by which the strength of a structure is gradually reduced, for
                    unforeseen loads, for jars and vibrations, for imperfection of theory, and for
                    the sake of obtaining stiffness. This last property might be the subject of
                    calculation, and in some cases must be separately examined. The particular
                    factor employed depends on the judgment of the engineer. A larger factor of
                    safety is required for a passing or moving load than for a permanent load, there
                    being a greater uncertainty as to the stress which may be caused by vibrations
                    or impulses due to what is sometimes called a live load. Moreover, the mere
                    presence of a large permanent load tends by its inertia to diminish the
                    dangerous effect of the impulses or stresses due to the passing load, so that
                    the factor of safety should be chosen with reference to the ratio being larger
                    as this ratio increases. Rankine recommends that the factor of safety should for
                    the moving load be double that employed for the permanent load. Sometimes the
                    factor is more conveniently employed as a divisor to deduce the safe stress ∕
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> from the ultimate strength/ of the material, rather
                    than as a multiplier for the load. Thus the same number of square inches will be
                    obtained in the tension member of a wrought iron girder to bear 1 ton per foot
                    run, whether we use in the calculations 25 tons as the value of ∕, the; ultimate
                    strength of the material, and a load w of 5 tons per foot run, or if we use 5
                    tons as∕ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, the safe stress on the material, and a
                    load <hi rend="italic">w</hi> of 1 ton per foot run; in short, if we call the
                    factor of safety K, we may in equation 5, § 14, 2/Ί <hi rend="italic">f</hi> use
                    KM = -j-, or making∕ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> = , we may write</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">d</hi></p>
                <p>The same remark applies, of course, to equation 6, § 14.</p>
                <p>§ 21. <hi rend="italic">Weight of Girders and Roadway.—</hi> When two girders are
                    employed for each line of way on a railway, the weight of the iron girders per
                    foot run will, with the usual proportions, probably lie between 0O017L tons and
                    0O025L tons, L being the span in feet. It follows from the theory given above,
                    that for similar beams the quantity of material in the whole girder will be
                    proportional to the square of the length, and, therefore, the quantity per foot
                    run will be proportional to the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0340-0297"/> simple length. The constants given above are
                    derived from practice. The weight of girders for a common road, if placed from 7
                    to 8 feet apart, will be nearly the same as for railway girders of the same
                    span. The weight of a castiron railway girder (two girders per way) will be
                    about 0O05L tons per foot run. The weight of the <hi rend="italic">roadway</hi>
                    in a railway bridge will probably be from 0 ’ 14 to 0 ’ 22 tons per girder, or
                    double this for each line. For a turnpike road with metalling the weight will
                    much exceed this, and should in each case be computed.</p>
                <p>§ 22. <hi rend="italic">Design of a Girder.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> (1.)
                    From the span and load to be carried the engineer will determine the material
                    and form to be employed. Cast-iron may in some districts be the cheapest
                    material for girders under 30 feet span. Wrought iron I girders are very
                    generally employed for spans of from 30 feet to 100 feet; beyond that span
                    lattice or framed girders are more usually employed. For extreme spans
                    exceeding, say, 300 feet, a hollow rectangle or tubular bridge may be used,
                    carrying the road on its top or inside the tube. The depth of the cross section
                    is limited by the consideration that the web must be sufficiently stiff not to
                    buckle; but for this consideration the deeper a girder could be made the better.
                    In practice the depth is made from ∣th to <hi rend="subscript"> f</hi><hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi>- <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi>-th of the span. The
                    engineer will also determine whether he will keep the depth of the girder
                    constant throughout or diminish the depth at the ends. It is impossible to
                    graduate the material so as to give absolutely uniform strength at all sections,
                    but by diminishing the depth towards the ends, some material may be saved
                    without attenuating the top and bottom members to such an extent as to be
                    inconvenient. When the general character of the design has thus been settled,
                    the engineer will compute the probable weight of the girders and roadway or
                    total permanent load; he will next determine the passing load for which he
                    intends to provide.</p>
                <p>(2.) The value of M, the bending moment, must next be computed for a sufficient
                    number of cross sections of the beam, and for various distributions of load. For
                    a small castiron girder of uniform cross section a single value of M will be
                    sufficient, computed for the section at the centre when the girder is wholly
                    covered with the greatest uniform load and also supports the greatest single
                    load at the centre of the span. When, as in larger girders, the design is
                    intended to give a structure of approximately equal strength throughout, the
                    maximum value of M should be found for eight or ten sections; this maximum value
                    will be that obtained when the bridge is wholly loaded with its maximum uniform
                    load and has the maximum single load resting just over the section in
                    question.</p>
                <p>(3.) The maximum shearing stress must next be calculated for each of the above
                    sections. The designer will bear in mind that the maximum stress occurs at the
                    points of support, and that at the centre it is greatest when the bridge is half
                    covered with the passing load.</p>
                <p>(4.) The engineer can now compute the number of square inches S <hi
                    rend="subscript"> e</hi> and S, required at each section in the upper and lower
                    members consistently with the factor of safety he chooses to employ; this he
                    obtains from the expressions—</p>
                <p>L . . . S, = -⅜, <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> ∙ ∙ ∙ ∙ ¾≡⅛∙</p>
                <p>It is here assumed that the best and strongest form of girder is employed, but if
                    a mere square or circular beam is to be used, the cross section will be obtained
                    by equating the values of M and <hi rend="italic">μ.,</hi> using a safe modulus
                    of rupture ∕ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>.</p>
                <p>(5.) The web will next be designed by giving it such a thickness as will, with
                    the depth already fixed, supply the number of square inches required to reduce
                    the stress per square inch to the <hi rend="italic">safe</hi> or <hi

                    required by the shearing stress, but the exigencies of the foundry generally
                    require a design resulting in a great excess of strength in this part of the
                    beam, except in beams which are tapered towards the ends, as in fig. 19. With
                    these beams care must be taken that the taper is not carried to excess so as to
                    leave insufficient metal to resist the shearing stress at M and N.</p>
                <p>§ 23. <hi rend="italic">Practical Details.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The
                    designer must be practically acquainted with the forms in which his materials
                    can be best procured. He must know the sizes in which iron or steel plates can
                    be produced, and the forms best adapted for castings. Thus, in cast-iron beams
                    the thickness of the web is at the bottom made equal to the thickness of the
                    lower flange, and at the top to the thickness of the upper flange, in order to
                    avoid permanent internal strains, which would result from unequal rates of
                    cooling after being cast, if sudden changes of thickness in the metal were
                    allowed. The engineer must also be familiar with the methods adopted of joining
                    the several parts, as with the rivetting of wrought iron, the bolting together
                    of large castings, the jointing of wood-work. He should also be acquainted with
                    the various methods in which roadways are constructed and supported on existing
                    bridges, and the manner in which the girders are braced one to another, so as to
                    prevent vibration and lateral deflection due to the pressure of the wind. The
                    examples of bridges described hereafter will give some information on these
                    points. In long girders provision must be made by rollers, sliding plates, or
                    suspension links for the expansion and contraction due to changes of
                    temperature. The range in Great Britain may be taken as about 45° C. If the ends
                    of the girder could be firmly secured at a constant distance apart this change
                    of temperature would produce a stress of about 6 tons per square inch in wrought
                    iron, and 3 tons per square inch in cast-iron. The result in practice would be
                    that any attempted fastening of stone or iron work would be torn loose.</p>
                <p>§ 24. <hi rend="italic">Deflection.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> When ä bridge
                    has been erected its deflection at the centre under a known passing load is
                    generally observed with the object of ascertaining whether the work has been
                    properly done, for it is assumed that any defective material or bad jointing
                    would increase the deflection beyond that calculated on the assumption of sound
                    material and perfect workmanship. Sometimes the practical test applied is a
                    rough one, a certain fraction of an inch being allowed per foot of span as a
                    safe deflection. If an inspector of bridges, having authority, chooses to limit
                    the deflection to a constant fraction of the span, the ratio of the depth to the
                    span must be made sufficiently great to give the desired stiffness and
                    maintained constant for all spans; equation 5 below shows that when <hi
                    rend="italic">p</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> λ</hi> is kept constant and <hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi> is a given fraction of L, the deflection <hi rend="italic"
                    >v</hi> will be proportional to the span. For the proof or maximum possible
                    load, Rankine gives as the result of practice a value for the deflection of from

                    rend="subscript"> s</hi> ⅛th of the span is certain to give sufficient
                    stiffness, and the usual method is to assume the depth and then to observe
                    whether experiment gives a deflection agreeing with that found by calculation.
                    The calculation is made by finding the radius of curvature of the beam at a
                    series of sections, and then determining the curve assumed by the whole beam
                    either by integration or by an approximate graphic method. When the curve is
                    known the deflection or versed sine is found either from the equations of the
                    curve, or by actual measurement on the diagram to be presently described. Let R
                    be the radius of curvature of the neutral surface of a beam at a given section,

                <p>We will first consider the special case in which the beam under consideration is
                    of <hi rend="italic">equal depth and uniform strength</hi> at all cross
                    sections, and which we will call a beam of class 1; these conditions can only be
                    fulfilled by any one beam for a given constant distribution of load; the beam of
                    uniform strength for a load at the centre, for instance, will clearly not be the
                    beam of uniform strength for a uniformly distributed load. In beams of class 1
                    for a given load, both <hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi rend="italic

                    1</hi> are constant, and therefore R, by equation 1, will also be constant
                    throughout the whole length of the beam, or, in other words, the beam will bend
                    into a circular arc. Tlιe approximate expression for the versed sine of an arc
                    having a chord L and radius R will therefore give the deflection, and we

                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi>; we observe, then, that the safe deflection for a beam
                    of this class will be proportional to the square of the span, and inversely
                    proportional to the depth of the beam.</p>
                <p>In beams of class 1, the deflections which different loads produce will be simply

                    load, the deflection will be simply proportional to the load; if we change the
                    distribution of the load, keeping the total load constant, the same rule will
                    give the solution; for instance, since a load uniformly distributed produces
                    only half the stress p <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> which would be produced by
                    the same load at the centre of a beam of the same span and cross section, we see
                    that the uniformly distributed load will produce only half the deflection that
                    would be produced by the same load at the centre of a beam of the same span and
                    same <hi rend="italic">section at the centre</hi> (both beams belonging to class
                    1 ). It would not be correct to say that a load uniformly distributed would

                <p>We may compare the deflections produced by the same load on various beams of
                    similar cross section as follows: —By equation 4, § 14, we see that for a given

                    measured deflection of this curve from the straight line, and V the actual
                    deflection of the bridge; <hi rend="italic">CLV</hi> we have V = y,
                    approximately. This method distorts the curve, so that vertical ordinates of the

                    the horizontal ordinates. Thus if the horizontal scale be one-tenth of an inch
                    to the foot, <hi rend="italic">a</hi> = 120, and a beam 100 feet in length would
                    be drawn equal to 10 inches; then if the true radius at the centre were 10,000
                    feet, this radius, if the curve were undistorted, would be on paper 1000 inches,
                    but making <hi rend="italic">b =</hi> 50 we can draw the curve with a radius of
                    20 inches. If we now measure the versed sine of an arc drawn with a length 10
                    inches and a radius 20 inches, we shall approximately find it equal to 0 ’ 64

                <p>the curve must not be so great that there is any very sensible difference between
                    the length of the arc and its chord. This can be regulated by altering the value
                    of <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> In fig. 21 distortion is carried much too far; this

                <p>§ 26. When a girder has more than two supports it is called a <hi rend="italic"
                    >continuous girder.</hi> The distribution of the stresses in a continuous girder
                    differs very materially from that in a simple girder, as will be at once
                    apparent by the inspection of fig. 22, which shows the way in which a continuous
                    girder of two spans and two simple girders bend when employed to carry equal
                    weights across equal openings. The continuous girder when both spans are loaded
                    is bent upwards at C over the centre pier; in other words, the bending moment at
                    this and neighbouring points is negative. The direction of the flexure changes
                    at certain sections, as at A. and A <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the bending moment is positive on one side of these
                    sections, negative on the other side; and at the section where the direction of
                    flexure changes the bending moment is <hi rend="italic">nü.</hi> Again, when
                    only one of two simple girders is loaded, the girder over the second span is not
                    bent in either direction, but with the continuous girder there may be a negative
                    bending moment produced throughout the whole unloaded span as shown in fig. 23.
                    Continuous<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n343/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0343-0300"/> girders require less material for the same depth,
                    span, and permanent load than simple girders; but the difference is hardly worth
                    consideration, except in large spans where the weight of the structure is great
                    as compared with the weight of the passing load. The necessity of allowing the
                    girder to expand and contract freely with changes of temperature limits the
                    general use of large continuous girders to two spans.</p>
                <p>Consider a continuous girder having an indefinite number of supports equally
                    spaced; let tlιc girder be of constant depth, uniformly loaded, and so
                    proportioned as to be of uniform strength at all sections. The method of
                    designing such a girder has not yet been shown, but it may be admitted that the
                    . design is possible. Then, as we have already seen (§ 24), the curvature
                    assumed by the girder will everywhere be constant, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> the curves will be circular arcs
                    of constant radius. The points of inversion of flexure A and B (fig. 24) must
                    therefore in this case be at a distance from C and C <hi rend="subscript">
                    u</hi>, equal to one quarter of the span <hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">for</hi> AA <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> = AB = A <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> B <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> &amp;c., and C bisects
                    AA <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>. At B and B <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> there
                    is no moment of flexure. The girder might here be cut through, and if the ends B
                    and B <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> were pinned on to the rest of the girder by
                    pins capable of bearing the shearing stress, nothing would be changed in the
                    curvature of the girder nor in the distribution of stress.</p>
                <p>Quite similarly, we may suppose the ends B and B <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> of
                    the portion BACA <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> B <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> to
                    rest directly on supports or piers introduced for the purpose, the rest of the
                    imaginary girder being wholly removed. We shall then have (fig. 25) the curve
                    assumed by a continuous girder of two spans of constant depth and uniform
                    strength. The points AA <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> of inversion of flexure
                    will be at a distance CA from the middle pier equal to one-third of the span.
                    The top and bottom members at A and A <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> might vanish
                    (if only one distribution of load were to be carried), for at this point there
                    is only a shearing stress and no bending moment. The girder is, as it were, made
                    up of three girders: BA and A <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> B <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> hang on to AA <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, which is
                    supported in the middle; half the weight of AB is borne by the pier B; half the
                    weight of A <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> B <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> is borne
                    by the pier B <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>; the rest of the weight between B and
                    B <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> is borne by the middle pier. Thus let L be the
                    length of one span in feet, <hi rend="italic">w</hi> the load per foot run, P
                    the load borne by each of the end piers, and P <hi rend="subscript"> c</hi> the
                    load borne by the centre pier, then we have—</p>
                <p>1 P = JwL,</p>
                <p>2 P <hi rend="subscript"> c</hi> = ⅛ι&gt;L.</p>
                <p>The curve of bending moments can now be calculated for each girder precisely as
                    for a simple girder; the moment at any section is equal to the sum of the
                    moments of all the external forces on one side of the section; the beam between
                    A and B will be subject to bending moments equal to those produced by a uniform
                    load on a simple girder if the span BA be similarly loaded. Between A and A <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> the moments will be negative, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> the left-handed moment produced by the downward action of all the
                    weights to the left will exceed the right-handed moment produced by tlιe upward
                    reaction of the pier at B (or of the two piers B and C if the section considered
                    lies to the right of C). The full black line in fig. 25α shows a curve of
                    bending moments for this case.</p>
                <p>The maximum moment is negative and occurs over the centre pier; let it be called
                    M <hi rend="subscript"> c</hi>, The maximum positive moment occurs at a distance

                <p>When the beam is of uniform depth and uniform cross section, the curves in which

                <p>In any actual bridge uniformly loaded the values of the moments and shearing
                    stresses will be intermediate between those given for a beam of uniform strength
                    and those for a beam of uniform cross section. It must be observed that the
                    above theory assumes that the girder is unstrained when being built as a whole;
                    if, as is often the case, the separate spans are separately built and lifted
                    into position, and then joined on the piers, special provision must be made to
                    bring the desired bending moment over the piers into existence; it is obvious
                    that m.erely joining the two independent beams in the upper part of fig. 22 will
                    not make these into a continuous girder, such as is shown in the lower
                    figure,—to do this, besides joining the upper and lower flangee, we must pull
                    the top flanges together over the piers and put the lower flanges under
                    compression. This may be done practically by tilting one end, or both ends,
                    before the junction at the centre is made, and afterwards allowing the ends to
                    sink until the curve assumed by the girder shows that the required distribution
                    of stress lias been attained. The complete analysis of the problem of continuous
                    girders of any number of spans equal or unequal with any number of loads has

                    the weight of the beam is a considerable and uncertain part of the whole load,
                    it can be allowed for as follows. Design a beam of the desired depth and span,
                    fit to carry a total load equal to the external or passing load W <hi

                    Let δ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> be the area of any cross section of this

                    of weight B actually necessary to carry a total load W. Then since the strength
                    of the properly proportioned girder of constant depth and span is simply
                    proportional to the quantity of metal employed, and therefore to the area of
                    cross section, we have the proportion <hi rend="italic">b</hi>: δ <hi

                    design which for the span L weighs B, and carries a gross load W, then the ratio
                    of B to W can be shown to increase in direct proportion to the length of the

                <p>§ 28. <hi rend="italic">Varieties of Suspension Bridges.—λ</hi> very simple form
                    of suspension bridge has long been used in Peru and Thibet. Two ropes are hung
                    side by side across the gorge to be passed, a rude platform is laid on the
                    ropes, and the dip of these is sufficiently small to allow the bridge to bo
                    crossed by men or beasts passing down from the one side to the centre and up to
                    the opposite bank. The modem suspension bridge consists of two or more <hi
                    rend="italic">chains,</hi> from which a level <hi rend="italic">platform</hi> is
                    hung by suspension <hi rend="italic">rods.</hi> The chains may in some cases be
                    secured directly to the sides of the chasm to be crossed, but the configuration
                    of the ground seldom allows this to be done. The chains, therefore, usually pass
                    over <hi rend="italic">piers,</hi> a3 in fig. 2, Plate XIX., and are led down on
                    either side to an <hi rend="italic">anchorage</hi> at a considerable distance
                    from the piers. The chains between the piers and the anchorage are generally
                    used to support part of the platform. The chains where they pass over the piers
                    rest on <hi rend="italic">saddles,</hi> which are made of two different types.
                    One construction, shown in fig. 27, allows the chain to slip backwards and
                    forwards over it with comparatively little friction, so that the stress on the
                    rope may be taken as equal on both sides of the saddle. In the second type, as
                    shown in fig. 28, the chain is secured to the saddle, which, however, is free to
                    move horizontally on the top of the pier. With the first form of saddle the
                    resultant pressure on the pier will not be vertical unless the chain leaves the
                    pier with an equal inclination on each side, and even when the bridge is
                    designed with an equal slope of chain on both sides of the pier, a change in the
                    distribution of weight due to any passing load will cause some departure from
                    the equal slope of the chains, and therefore from the truly vertical pressure on
                    the piers. This departure is easily allowed for in the design of the pier. The
                    friction on the saddle renders the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n345/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0345-0302"/> assumption of equal stresses on each side
                    slightly incorrect, and with this type of saddle care must be taken to provide
                    against the weaι∙ produced by the motion of the chain. With the second type the
                    use of rollers under the solid saddle leaves the motion of the saddle very free;
                    the resultant pressure on the pier is always sensibly vertical, and the chains
                    may leave the pier at any angle, equal or unequal. The chain must in no case be
                    rigidly attached to the pier unless the support itself is free to rock on its
                    base, as in fig. 29, where the place of the pier is taken by cast-iron struts,
                    working on a horizontal axis.</p>
                <p>Suspension bridges are chiefly used for very large spans, because, as we shall
                    find, they can be constructed to carry the same load with a less weight of
                    material than a beam or girder, subject, however, to the disadvantage of
                    flexibility or deformation under a passing load,—a disadvantage which is very
                    serious where, as in small bridges, the passing load is a large proportion of
                    the whole load, but which is of less importance where the chief load to be
                    carried is the weight of the structure itself. We will first consider the usual
                    or simple suspension bridge, as shown in fig. 2, Plate XIX., and will then pass
                    to the various modifications introduced to remedy its defects.</p>
                <p>§ 29. <hi rend="italic">Form of Chain with given Load.—</hi> Let the platform be
                    hung from the chain by equidistant vertical rods; then the load may be treated
                    as hanging from each joint where the rods are attached, and will consist at each
                    joint of the weight of one subdivision of the chain and of one subdivision of
                    the platform and its load. If the position of the vertical tie-rods be assumed
                    as definite relatively to the points of suspension, so that the assumed loads on
                    the joints act at known distances from the points of support, a form of chain,
                    which will remain in equilibrium (or undisturbed) under these loads, can easily
                    be found by the following graphic method :—</p>
                <p>Let the vertical line QN (fig.</p>
                <p>30) represent the whole load to be carried, and the subdivisions QA, AB, BC, CD,
                    &amp;c., the loads referred to each joint of the chain (QA and NK will be the
                    portion of the load referred directly to the saddle or point of support, and
                    will be simply half the weight of the piece of chain between the saddle and the
                    joint pin). Let QP and NP be the weights carried by each pier,— equal if the
                    distribution of load is symmetrical, otherwise to be determined as for a girder.
                    Let a horizontal line, PO, represent the horizontal component of the tension to
                    be allowed on the chain, or the whole tension on that part of the chain the
                    tangent to which is horizontal; join 0 with Q, with A, B, &amp;c.; then the
                    lines OA, OB, &amp;c., give the slopes of each successive link as shown in fig.
                    31, where the line parallel to OA in fig. 30 lies between the two spaces
                    containing the letters 0 and A in fig. 31, similarly the line parallel to OB in
                    fig. 30 is represented by the link between the two spaces lettered 0 and B in
                    fig. 31, and so forth. The line in fig. 31 lying between 0 and Q parallel to OQ
                    in fig. 30, represents the direction of the force on the point of support <hi
                    rend="italic">a,</hi> being equal and opposite to the resultant of the tension
                    on the first link and the weight carried directly by the support. The triangle
                    QOA (fig. 30) is the polygon of forces in equilibrium at the point of support
                    <hi rend="italic">a</hi> (fig. 31). The tιiangle OAB is the polygon of forces in
                    equilibrium at the first joint, and similarly each component triangle of fig. 30
                    represents the equilibrated forces at one joint of the chain in fig. 31. This
                    theorem is one example of the general theory of reciprocal figures, which will
                    be treated hereafter under the general head of “Frames,” § 53.</p>
                <p>When the maximum dip is given instead of the horizontal component of the stι∙ess,
                    it is easy to find the latter from the former by the method of moments when the
                    point is known where the chain will be horizontal; for then, let the link <hi
                    rend="italic">cd,</hi> fig. 32, be horizontal; let the dip be called <hi

                    horizontal tension represented by PO in fig. 30 be called H. Then taking moments
                    round the point <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> we have—</p>
                <p>1 Hy = <hi rend="italic">⅛wx,</hi> from which H can always be found.</p>
                <p>When the length is given of each link (or portion of the chain between the joints
                    where the platform is suspended), and consequently the length of the whole
                    chain, the problem of determining the form assumed under any distribution of
                    load is difficult, for the proportion of the load carried by each pier and the
                    position of each load relatively to the piers vary when the form of the chain
                    varies. The problem may be solved tentatively, but it is seldom attempted.</p>
                <p>The converse problem of finding the load which will keep a chain in equilibrium
                    when the dimensions and curve are given is perfectly easy.</p>
                <p>From a point O, fig. 30, draw a series of lines parallel to the given links. At
                    any convenient distance, OP, draw a vertical line cutting the lines diverging
                    from 0 at the points Q, A, B, C, D, &amp;c. The vertical loads required to keep
                    the chain in equilibrium are proportional to the lengths QA, AB, BC, &amp;c.</p>

                    is that assumed by a chain of uniform weight per unit of length, but the form
                    generally adopted for suspension bridges is that assumed by a chain under a
                    weight unifoιmly distributed relatively to a horizontal line. This curve is a

                    the foundations, or for other reasons. Th%stresses on the loaded and unloaded
                    portion of the chains between the piers and the anchorage are easily determined
                    by methods similar to those which have been given for the stresses on each part
                    of the main span. The same methods also give the direction of each successive

                    chains of suspension bridges are either long wire ropes or true chains made of
                    links pinned together. Wire ropes allow the strongest known material to be
                    adopted, namely, steel wire, which <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n347/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0347-0304"/> can be bought in large quantities of a quality
                    which does not break with less than a stress of from <hi rend="italic">55</hi>
                    to 60 tons per square inch of section; charcoal iron wire of the sizes used will
                    bear 40 tons per square inch; common sizes of wire for the purpose are from 016
                    to 0 ’ 14 inches, or say, No. 9 or 10 Birmingham wire gauge. Three or four
                    thousand wires are not unfrequently used in one cable, and it is very essential
                    that each wire shall take an equal part of the whole stress. It used to be
                    thought necessary to ensure this by straining each wire separately either over
                    the actual piers, or piers similarly placed, and binding them together when
                    hanging, strained by their own weight with the dip proposed for the bridge. It
                    was also thought essential that each rope should be an aggregate of parallel
                    wires, not spun as in a hempen rope. Experiment has shown, however, that wire
                    ropes spun with machines which do not put a twist into each wire, but lay it
                    helically and untwisted, and with no straight central wire, are as strong as
                    wire ropes of equal weight made with straight wires, They are, however, much
                    more easily made. A number of ropes of this kind may, therefore, with more
                    convenience and economy be bound together into one cable iu the manner
                    previously practised for single wires. Care should be taken to fill every
                    interstice of the ropes with a bituminous compound.</p>
                <p>When the chains are made of links of iron their ultimate strength cannot be taken
                    as more than 30 tons per square inch, even if the very best material is secured.
                    It is doubtful if this ultimate strength can at present be surpassed by steel
                    links, for although many steel links of greater strength could certainly be
                    obtained, occasionally a comparatively weak link will be produced even by the
                    best manufacturers. In designing the links care must be taken to provide
                    sufficient cross section at the eye, AB + CD, fig. 36, as well as at EF. The
                    diameter of the pin BC must be such as will allow it to resist the shearing
                    stress on it, and the surface of the pin and eye from B to C must be sufficient
                    to bear the crushing stress. Otherwise, although the pin may not be shorn it may
                    be squeezed flat, and the head of the link may bulge out and be much distorted
                    under the stress. To obtain the necessary surface, without unduly increasing the
                    diameter of the pin, the link may be rolled with a head broader than the body of
                    the link. The section at GH and IJ must also be sufficient to resist shearing.
                    When two or more parallel chains are used, care must be taken that the rods
                    suspending the platform bear equally on the several chains. Fig. 37 shows a plan
                    of securing this. Chains of unequal dip should not be used to support one
                    platform, for the strain cannot be equally divided between them, inasmuch as
                    they must deflect unequally with any passing load, or with any increase of
                    temperature.</p>
                <p>§ 33. <hi rend="italic">Merits and Defects of Suspension Bridges.—</hi> The great
                    merit of a suspension bridge is its cheapness, arising from the comparatively
                    small quantity of material required to carry a given passing load across a given
                    span. This merit may be easily seen by considering an elementary example. A man
                    might cross a chasm of 100 feet hanging to a steel wire 0 <hi rend="superscript"
                    > ,</hi> 21 inches in diameter, dipping 10 feet; the weight of the wire would be
                    12 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 75 lb. A wrought iron beam of rectangular
                    section, three times as deep as it is broad, would have to be about 27 inches
                    deep and 9 inches broad to carry him <hi rend="italic">and its own weight.</hi>
                    It would weigh 87,500 lb. An iron I beam of the best construction, 10 feet deep,
                    would weigh about 120 tt&gt;, without allowing anything for the stiffening of
                    the centre web which would in practice be required. In each case four feet in
                    length have been allowed for bearings at the ends of the span. The enormous
                    difference would not exist if the beam and. wire had only to carry the man,
                    although even then there would be a great difference in favour of the wire; the
                    main difference arises from the fact that the bridge has to carry <hi
                    rend="italic">its own weight.</hi> The chief merit of the suspension bridge does
                    not, therefore, come into play until the weight of the rope or beam is
                    considerable when compared with the platform and rolling load; for although the
                    chain will for any given load be lighter than a beam, the saving in this respect
                    will for small spans be more than compensated by the expense of the anchorages.
                    In large spans the advantage of the suspension bridge is so great that we find
                    bridges on this principle of 800 or 900 feet span constructed at much less cost
                    per foot run than girder bridges of half the span. The disadvantages of the
                    suspension bridge are, however, very great. A change in the distribution of the
                    load causes a very sensible deformation of the structure; for the chain of the
                    suspension bridge must adapt its form to the new position of the load, whereas
                    in the beam the deformation is hardly sensible, equilibrium being attained by a
                    new distribution of the stresses through the material. This flexibility of the
                    suspension bridge renders it unsuitable for the passage of a railway train at
                    any considerable speed. The platform rises up as a wave in front of any rapidly
                    advancing load, and the masses in motion produce stresses much greater than
                    those which could result from the same weights when at rest; moreover, the
                    kinetic effect of the oscillations produced by bodies of men marching, or even
                    by impulses due to wind, may give rise to strains which cannot be foreseen, and
                    which have actually caused the failure of some suspension bridges. On the 16th
                    of April 1850 a suspension bridge at Angers gave way when 487 soldiers were
                    passing, and of these 226 were killed by the accident. Another danger peculiar
                    to suspension bridges is that the platform may be lifted by the wind, when its
                    oscillation will produce most dangerous strains. This accident may be prevented
                    by tying the platform down to the piers or abutments. Lateral oscillation
                    produced by the wind is also dangerous, and even gathered ice and snow may be a
                    serious increment to the load on these bridges, forming a much more considerable
                    fraction of the whole weight than where the supporting structure is itself
                    massive. Suspension bridges must be well cross-braced to resist the action of
                    the wind. They can be much stiffened laterally by placing the chains in inclined
                    planes, converging downwards to the platform.</p>
                <p>§ 34. <hi rend="italic">Modifications of the Simple Suspension Bridge.—</hi> Many
                    efforts have been made to design a bridge which <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0348-0305"/> shall combine the lightness of the true
                    suspension bridge with the stiffness of the girder. Mr Dredge’s design with
                    sloping rods (fig. 38) gives a somewhat stiffer structure than the bridge with
                    vertical suspension rods; the inclined rods throw a strain on the platform,
                    which must be resisted either by ties along the central portion, or by struts
                    abutting against the piers. The stresses on each part will be shown under the
                    heading “Compound Structures” (§ 62).</p>
                <p>The design fig. 39 has been proposed by many, but is worthless. The object of the
                    proposers is to support each part of the platform by rods which are quite
                    independent of other parts of the structure, and which, being originally
                    straight, do not alter their form under stress. The unequal stretching of the
                    long and short rods under a stress, or with a rise of temperature, is a radical
                    defect. Mr Ordish has proposed a plan in which the road is supported by sloping
                    tie rods, arranged like the struts in fig. 87, inverted. Flexible chains, like
                    that of an ordinary suspension bridge, carry the weight of these tie rods by
                    vertical rods, which keep the sloping rods straight. The chain in this form is
                    not subjected to unequal loading. Various forms of bridge have been proposed, in
                    which, as in figs. 76 and 78, two chains are braced together. These may be made
                    thoroughly stiff bridges, with a moderate increase in the amount of metal
                    required for the flexible bridge. They will be described under the head of
                    “Frames.” Stiffness has also been obtained in some structures by using an
                    auxiliary girder to stiffen the platform. This is best effected by the use for
                    each chain of two girders, each half the length of the platform. These girders
                    are placed as in fig. 40, being hinged together by a strong pin at B, and held
                    down by pins at A and A <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, which should, however, be
                    left free to move horizontally. These girders are not sensibly strained by the
                    rise and fall of the chains due to a fall or rise of temperature; they can also
                    deflect freely as a whole when the chain is deflected under strain;
                    nevertheless, they serve to distribute the weight of a passing load over the
                    chain, so that it cannot be sensibly distorted. Rankine has given the following
                    rule for designing these stiffening girders. Let <hi rend="italic">w</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> 1</hi> be the greatest rolling load per foot run; let
                    <hi rend="italic">x</hi> be the half span of the chain; let Μ be the greatest
                    bending moment which the auxiliary girders will have to resist <hi rend="italic"
                    >{i.e.,</hi> at the centre of each); let F be the greatest shearing force (at
                    the end and central pins), then</p>
                <p>1. ∙ . . ∙ . AI — , and</p>
                <p>2 F = <hi rend="italic">½w</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 1</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">x.</hi></p>
                <p>Each auxiliary half girder is in fact to be designed as a beam of half the span
                    of the bridge, and capable of carrying half the passing load per foot run (but
                    not its own weight). This plan of stiffening is quite effective, but adds
                    considerably to the weight and cost of the whole structure; for not only have we
                    to provide these extra girders, but extra material in the chains to carry this
                    extra dead load.</p>

                    over a span of about one mile, and would not break till the span exceeded 4
                    miles. With a dip of ‡th of the span a steel wire rope of the best quality would
                    not break until the span exceeded 7 miles. These lengths are not given as

                <p>§ 36. <hi rend="italic">General Description.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> An arch
                    may be of stone, brick, wood, or metal. The oldest arches are of stone or brick.
                    They differ from metal or wooden arches, inasmuch as the compressed arc of
                    materials called the <hi rend="italic">ring</hi> (fig. 41, London Bridge), is
                    built of a number of separate pieces having little or no cohesion. Each separate
                    stone used in building the <hi rend="italic">ring</hi> has received the name of
                    <hi rend="italic">voussoir,</hi> or archstone. The lower surface of the ring is
                    called the <hi rend="italic">soffit</hi> of the arch. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >joints,</hi> or bed-joints, are the surfaces separating the voussoirs, and are
                    normal to the soffit. A brick arch is usually built in numerous rings, so that
                    it cannot be conceived as built of voussoirs with plane joints passing straight
                    through the ring. The bed-joints of a brick arch may be considered as stepped
                    and interlocked. This interlocking will affect the stability of the arch only in
                    those cases where one voussoir tends to slip along its neighbour. The ring
                    springs from a course of stones in the abutments, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >quoins.</hi> The plane of demarcation between the ring and the abutment is
                    called the <hi rend="italic">springing</hi> of the arch. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >crown</hi> of the arch is the summit of the ring. The voussoirs at the crown
                    are called <hi rend="italic">keystones.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">haunches</hi>
                    of the arch are the parts midway between the springing and the crown. The upper
                    surface of the ring is sometimes improperly called the extrados, and the lower
                    surface is more properly called the intrados. These terms, when properly
                    employed, have reference to a mathematical theory of the arch little used by
                    engineers. The walls which rest upon the ring along the arch, and rise either to
                    the parapet or roadway, are called <hi rend="italic">spandrils.</hi> There are
                    necessarily two outer spandrils forming the faces of the bridge; there may be
                    one or more inner spandrils. The <hi rend="italic">backing</hi> of an arch is
                    the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n349/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0349-0306"/> masonry above the haunches of the ring; it is
                    carried back between the spandrils to the pier or abutment. If the backing is
                    not carried up to the roadway, as is seldom the case, the rough material
                    employed between the backing and the roadway is called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >filling.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">parapet</hi> rests on the outer spandrils.
                    The abutments and piers have the same signification as in other bridges. The
                    masonry arch differs from the superstructure of other bridges in the following
                    respect: it depends for its stability on the presence of a permanent load
                    specially arranged, and so considerable in amount that the changes produced in
                    the direction and magnitude of the stresses by the passing load are
                    insignificant. The theories of the masonry arch often neglect the passing load
                    entirely, and simply teach the student how to distribute the permanent load, so
                    that the voussoirs may be in equilibrium. The permanent load consists of the
                    ring, the backing, the filling, the spandrils, and the roadway. Inasmuch as the
                    ring is that part of the structure which by its special strength and arrangement
                    carries the superstructure in the same sense as a beam or chain carries it, the
                    arch in this article will be treated simply as a ring of voussoirs springing
                    from two abutments and loaded with weights, some permanent and some passing.
                    Where the backing strengthens the arch, it becomes virtually part of the
                    ring.</p>
                <p>§ 37. <hi rend="italic">Equilibrium, of a Single Voussoir.—</hi> A block, such as
                    a voussoir, ABCD, fig. 42, resting on one of its surfaces, such as the joint AB
                    separating it from the next voussoir, is in equilibrium when the resultant of
                    all the forces acting upon it (including its own weight) falls within the
                    supporting surface, while the direction of this resultant makes an angle <hi
                    rend="italic">φ</hi> with the normal to the surface less than the angle of
                    repose; (the tangent of the angle of repose is the coefficient of friction). If
                    the resultant, as R <hi rend="subscript"> z</hi>, falls without the surface, the
                    block will heel over, pivoting on the edge A. If the resultant, as <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">R</hi><hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> λ</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">,</hi> although falling within the surface of which AB is the
                    trace, is yet much inclined to the normal, the block ABOD will slide. up on the
                    joint AB without heeling over. The block, if used as the voussoir of a bridge,
                    must not only be in equilibrium under the forces applied to it, but must also be
                    of sufficient strength to resist these forces. The intensity of crushing stress
                    due to the external forces must nowhere exceed the safe crushing strength of the
                    material. This latter condition would in most arches be fulfilled by an
                    extremely thin ring of stones or brick if the resultant passed through the
                    geometrical centre of the joint AB in a direction normal to it. In that case the
                    stress on the joint would be a uniformly distributed stress; if, however, the
                    resultant stress passes near one edge, the intensity of stress at that edge will
                    be much greater than elsewhere, and would indeed be infinite if the resultant
                    passed exactly through the edge at A or B; while, therefore, the condition of
                    equilibrium is satisfied if the resultant passes within either edge of the
                    voussoir at no great inclination, the condition of strength requires that this
                    resultant shall not cut the joint very near the edge, and the common practical
                    rule is that it shall always fall within the middle third of the joint. This
                    rule is based on the condition that the pressure on a joint shall nowhere be
                    negative; in other words, that no tension shall occur at any part of any joint.
                    The principles explained in § 8 show that the minimum <hi rend="italic">y</hi>
                    stress on any joint∕&gt; <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="italic">=

                    theory practically in use, indeterminate within certain limits; it is therefore
                    useless to attempt to calculate the exact maximum stress on any one stone. In
                    the rest of this article the <hi rend="italic">ring</hi> is to be held to mean
                    the <hi rend="italic">middle third</hi> of the actual masonry, or brick ring,
                    wherever the theory requires that the blocks are to resist practical loads. As
                    bridges are subject to a sensibly equal load on all parts of their breadth
                    between the parapets, it is usual to consider a portion of the ring one foot in
                    width, each other strip being under precisely similar conditions. Similarly the
                    joint may be spoken of for convenience as the line which is its trace, and the
                    edge as the point which is its trace.</p>
                <p>The external forces which act on any voussoir are—1st, the vertical force, being
                    the resultant of its own weight and the load which is directly over it; 2d, the
                    thrust from the voussoir above it; and 3d, the reaction from the voussoir on
                    which it rests (fig. 43). It is sometimes difficult to determine exactly what
                    portion of the superincumbent load a voussoir may properly be said to carry, but
                    a sufficient approximation is obtained for practical purposes by assuming that
                    the mass vertically above any voussoir is carried by the voussoir when the back
                    of the voussoir is not much inclined. If the materials had little cohesion, the
                    direction of the force produced by the load would not be vertical, but inclined
                    at an angle depending on the coefficient of friction; in practice, the direction
                    of the force is uncertain and even variable with changes in the condition of the
                    superincumbent filling. If, however, the stability of the arch is calculated
                    with a reasonable margin or coefficient of safety, on the hypothesis that the
                    force produced by the load is vertical, there is every probability that the arch
                    will be stable under any actual stress which may arise in practice.</p>
                <p>§ 38. <hi rend="italic">Equilibrium of any three Voussoirs; Equilibrated
                    Polygon.—</hi> The simplest arch would be an arch of three voussoirs resting on
                    two abutments, and any actual arch consisting of many voussoirs maybe considered
                    as composed of successive triplets, the voussoirs on each side of which act as
                    abutments. If, therefore, we can show the conditions of equilibrium for three
                    voussoirs we shall have determined the conditions for the whole ring.</p>
                <p>Let three voussoirs be taken from any part of the ring (fig. 44), and let the
                    lines 1, 2, and 3 represent the position of the resultants of the three known

                    one side. Let A be the point where the prolongation of the line NA cuts the line

                    of the equilibrating force i,, which must act at A to balance them. Let the

                    rend="italic subscript"> 1</hi> be found by the ordinary parallelogram of
                    forces, as in fig. 44«, and let B be the point of intersection of the direction
                    of this force with the line 2; then the direction and the magnitude of the
                    equilibrating force <hi rend="italic">t</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi>
                    can be found as for; similarly the direction of this force gives the point C by
                    its intersection with the line 3, and finally we obtain, by the resolution of
                    forces, the direction, magnitude, and position of the force <hi rend="italic"
                    >t</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 3</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> by means of
                    which the reaction of the second abutment will keep the system in equilibrium.
                    When the position and magnitude of <hi rend="italic">t</hi> are known, the
                    position and magnitude of all the other forces are determinate; the conditions
                    of equilibrium are that the lines NA, AB, BC, and CQ, shall not cut the joints
                    above or below the edges <hi rend="italic">a</hi> or <hi rend="italic">b,</hi>
                    for in that case the blocks would heel oyer on the edge beyond which the
                    resultant passed; also, the direction of the lines NA, AB, &amp;c., must be such
                    as not to exceed the angle of repose with the normal to the joints, otherwise
                    one stone will slip on the other. The abutment producing by its reaction the
                    force <hi rend="italic">t</hi><hi rend="italic                     subscript">

                    forward so as to produce a greater force than ⅛. The line NABCQ, if inverted, is
                    in form identical with that which a cord would assume, loaded at the points A,
                    B, and C, with the loads 1, 2, and 3, and having the direction of NA determined.
                    This line will, in the rest of this article, be called an <hi rend="italic"
                    >equilibrated polygon.</hi></p>
                <p>When the joints are supposed indefinitely near, or the voussoirs thin sheets, the
                    equilibrated polygon becomes a curve called a <hi rend="italic">linear
                    arch.</hi></p>
                <p>The reasoning applied to three blocks is clearly applicable to any number, and we
                    may therefore say that any series of loaded voussoirs will be in equilibrium
                    when a reaction of known magnitude and direction is applied at one abutment,
                    provided the equilibrated polygon required by this reaction and the given loads
                    can be drawn so that its sides cut all the joints within the ring (or within the
                    middle tnird, where strength is an element of the question; at an angle greater
                    than the complement of the angle of repose for the material used. An
                    equilibrated polygon, ABC Q, for a complete arch is shown in fig. 45 Fig.</p>
                <p>45α is the diagram giving the slopes KJ, JI, &amp;c., as for the loaded chain

                <p>§ 39. It will be shown in next paragraph that the arch will be in equilibrium if
                    with any value of the horizontal thrust <hi rend="italic">h</hi> an equilibrated
                    polygon can be drawn fulfilling the conditions required. In most arches
                    equilibrated polygons fulfilling these conditions can be drawn with values of
                    <hi rend="italic">h</hi> varying between two limits differing by a considerable
                    amount. In that case the smallest value of ∕i will be the true value, and give
                    the true stresses; for the abutments being inert will not give back a greater
                    thrust than is just required to balance the structure. This would render the
                    thrust <hi rend="italic">h</hi> determinate if the equilibrated polygon might
                    actually approach the true edge of the ring, but as this would require
                    infinitely strong materials, we are still left in uncertainty as to the true
                    value of <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> but may feel sure that it .will be the
                    smallest value consistent with a safe stress on the material. If we provide
                    abutments capable of reacting with a force <hi rend="italic">h</hi> sufficient
                    to keep the equilibrated polygon (where it cuts the joints) within the middle
                    third, our abutment will certainly be amply strong enough, and this is the value
                    of <hi rend="italic">h</hi> to be adopted in all practical calculations of the
                    stability of an arch.</p>
                <p>In the example with the three voussoirs it is clear that equilibrium would be
                    obtained with very widely different reactions <hi rend="italic">t</hi> at the
                    one abutment. And this fact is also true for a bridge of many voussoirs. The
                    vertical component (which may be called <hi rend="italic">v)</hi> of this total
                    thrust <hi rend="italic">t</hi> is indeed determinate if we suppose the point
                    where <hi rend="italic">t</hi> cuts the joint to be known, being the same as the
                    vertical reaction from a beam carrying the same weights and supported at the
                    points where <hi rend="italic">t</hi> and <hi rend="italic">v</hi> cut the
                    abutments; but the horizontal component or horizontal thrust, which has been
                    called <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> cannot be determined by any considerations
                    hitherto mentioned.</p>
                <p>§ 40. <hi rend="italic">Experimental Demonstration that the Equilibrium of a
                    series of Voussoirs is stable if any Equilibrated Polygon can be drawn
                    fulfilling the conditions stated above.—</hi> Let us suppose an arch, fig. 48,
                    to be constructed, the bed-joints of which are not plane but curved, so that
                    each stone touches its neighbour only along a horizontal line, the trace of
                    which in a drawing may be called the <hi rend="italic">point of contact.</hi>
                    Such an arch will differ from an ordinary arch in this respect, that the centre
                    of pressure at joints will be shown by the points of contact, while the stones
                    will be able by rolling to alter the points of contact if not in equilibrium. In
                    such an arch the voussoirs in the first place may be put together so as to touch
                    at any desired series of points, but the forces called into play when external
                    support is withdrawn will rearrange the voussoirs so as to bring them into
                    equilibrium, if any equilibrated arch consistent with the loads can be drawn so
                    that the lines forming it cut the joints inside the ring, and a model will show
                    the points of contact, or, in other words, the places where these lines cut the
                    joints. (It is assumed that the obliquity of the sides of the polygon to the
                    joints which they cut is insufficient to produce slipping.)</p>
                <p>An actual model shows the action very prettily, but the following considerations
                    will easily allow the student to see how it is that the voussoirs always arrange
                    themselves so as to build a true arch.</p>
                <p>Suppose, first, that the arch consisted merely of three stones, fig. 46, and that
                    the weight on the centre one was so great that the linear arch, or equilibrated
                    polygon, became sensibly two inclined straight lines like rafters. As soon as
                    the voussoirs are left to themselves, the pressure at the surface <hi

                    o∏e straight line, which, meeting a similar straight line from the other
                    abutment, will give one equilibrated polygon, satisfying the required
                    conditions; but if the horizontal force required for this polygon is not
                    supplied by the abutments, the two forces at joints 1 and 2 will, as shown by
                    the small straight arrows, constitute a couple tending to turn the stone A
                    round, so that the point of contact at joint 1 will be lower, and the point of
                    contact in joint 2 will be higher than before. The same action will occur in
                    stone C, and the result will be that the weight may be balanced with a smaller
                    horizontal force. At the <pb break="no"

                    coupled with the descent of B, tends to push back the abutments N and Q, and
                    therefore to increase their horizontal reaction supposing them to be stable. If
                    the abutments N, Q continue to yield, the stones A</p>
                <p>aud B will continue to turn until the points of contact reach α <hi
                    rend="subscript"> j</hi> and α <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, or δ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and δ <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>. The horizontal
                    thrust which the abutments require to meet will therefore diminish as the stones
                    turn, and the little structure will only fail to support the weight in case the
                    abutments N and Q are insufficiently strong or stable to supply the minimum
                    thrust consistent with an equilibrated polygon cutting the joints inside the
                    ring (or in case the polygon cut the joints at such an angle that the stones
                    slip). If, on the other hand, the abutments were so made as to press in upon A
                    and C with a greater horizontal force than is consistent with two lines of
                    pressure passing through the actual points of contact, then, as in fig. 47, the
                    direction of the couples on the stones A and B would be reversed, and they will
                    roll round so as to bring the points of contact more nearly into the position
                    required to meet an excessive horizontal thrust, and at the same time the
                    changed position of the stones, by allowing N and Q to come forward, will tend
                    to relieve or diminish the original excessive horizontal thrust, where this is
                    due to the elasticity of the stones N and Q, or of the stones supporting these
                    abutments. The structure will not fail unless the points of contact reach α <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and <hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> i</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">b</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> 2</hi> and δ <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, when the
                    structure would fail by the sidee being squeezed in, and the stone B being
                    lifted up out of the arch. This could not happen with stones of the proportions
                    shown in fig. 47, as before the limiting position was reached, the points of
                    contact would lie on a straight line corresponding to an infinite horizontal
                    thrust. In conclusion we see that, whether the horizontal force supplied by the
                    reaction of the abutting stones be too small or too great, the three voussoirs
                    tend to move so as to adapt the centre of pressure and the actual horizontal
                    force to one another. The equilibrium produced is stable, that is to say, if by
                    some external force the arrangement of the blocks is slightly disturbed, when
                    the force is removed the blocke return to their original position. In the above
                    demonstration it is assumed that the blocks when first put together touch at
                    some point not far from the centre of the bed,—a condition corresponding to
                    reasonably good fitting in the case of the plane joints of a stone arch before
                    the centring is removed.</p>
                <p>If a model be prepared (fig. 48), having a number of voussoirs of wood with their
                    bed-joints slightly curved and roughened, the result of the above theory will be
                    very clearly and beautifully seen. The action explained in the case of three
                    blocks holds good for any three, and therefore for the whole series. If an
                    additional weight is placed at the crown, as in fig. 48, the crown is a little
                    lowered, but the curve passing through the lines of contact rises at the crown
                    and is lowered at the haunch by the rotation of the blocks, until the lines of
                    contact at the joints arrange themselves, so that the resultant pressures
                    forming the imaginary polygon pass through these lines of contact. If the extra
                    load be placed at the haunches the crown rises, but the points or lines of
                    contact between the voussoirs are lowered at the crown and raised at the
                    haunches, as in fig. 48α. If one haunch only is weighted, the curve passing
                    through the lines of contact rises at that haunch and is lowered at the other,
                    as in fig. 48δ; if the model be distorted by the hand it oscillates up and down
                    on each side of the position of equilibrium, as a string similarly loaded would
                    do. Figures 48, 48α, and 48δ are taken from photographs of a model. (It should
                    be remarked that the abut ments were screwed to the supporting board; it is
                    obvious that otherwise they would not have been in equilibrium.) The general
                    character of the curve passing through the points of contact may be easily
                    conceived by thinking of a string similarly loaded and inverted. The
                    equilibrated arch will be one of those forms which a string might take when
                    similarly loaded, but when the load is changed, the length of the curve will not
                    be constant in the arch, whereas it must be constant with any given ehain. The
                    curve pass ing through the points of <hi rend="italic">contact</hi> corresponds
                    with what Moseley called the line of resistance. The direction of the pressure
                    is not necessarily tangent to this curve, but in the ordinary form of bridge it
                    is nearly so.</p>
                <p>In the model each voussoir is free to roll, because the bed-joints are curved. In
                    an actual bridge the bed-joints are plane, nevertheless, the stones do turn
                    round to adapt themselves to the pressure, but the result of this rotation is to
                    render the compression along the upper and lower halves of the stone unequal.
                    One edge is more compressed than the other; the couple tending to turn the
                    voussoir, and actually allowed to do so in the model, is met by an equal and
                    opposite couple, due to the unequal compression of the stone.</p>
                <p>This couple is the necessary result of a pressure which is not axial, <hi
                    rend="italic">vide</hi> § 8; an equilibrated polygon cutting the joints at
                    various distances from the centre is therefore as correct an indication of the
                    actual forces present in a practical arch with flat joints as in the model with
                    curved joints; but we must remember that where the joints are flat, the pressure
                    will be unequally distributed wherever the line of the equilibrated polygon does
                    not cut the centre of the <pb break="no"

                    stone corresponds to greater or less curvature in the surface of the joint. A
                    small distortion of the arch will restore equilibrium when the curvature is
                    great, or when the stone has a high modulus of elasticity. The ring with plane
                    bed-joints is in stable equilibrium, and adapts itself to new distributions of
                    load for precisely the same reasons as the model with curved joints, but in the
                    one case the couple called into play to move the voussoir is actually cancelled
                    by the new position which the points of contact assume; in the other case it is
                    balanced by the equal and opposite couple resulting from the resistance to
                    motion due to the hardness of the stone.</p>
                <p>The preceding paragraph showed how to determine whether an arch was in
                    equilibrium when a known reaction was applied at one abutment; the experiment
                    and reasoning now given show that the incipient yielding of an arch under loads
                    will produce a reaction at the abutments suited to keep the whole ring in
                    equilibrium, provided only an equilibrated polygon can be drawn, cutting the
                    joints within the ring at suitable angles.</p>
                <p>§ 41. <hi rend="italic">Practical Investigation of the Stability of a given Arch
                    under a given Load—Joint of Rupture.—</hi> This investigation resolves itself
                    into finding that equilibrated polygon or linear arch which can be drawn within
                    the (middle third of the) ring from the crown to the <hi rend="italic">lowest
                    possible joint</hi> of the ring (or to the springing if this be possible). This
                    lowest possible joint must in any case be treated as the springing of the arch,
                    and if the linear arch goes out of the (middle third of the) ring above the
                    actual springing, as will be the case in all semicircular or elliptical rings,
                    masonry must be provided in the backing capable of taking the actual thrust into
                    the abutment and constituting the real arch, which often differs widely from the
                    form indicated by the ring of stones in the face. The linear arch in a circular
                    or segmental bridge loaded simply by its own weight generally has a smaller
                    radius of curvature than the ring at the crown, and a much larger radius towards
                    the haunches. Consequently, the longest linear arch which can be drawn within
                    the ring will approach the upper surface of the ring at the crown and the soffit
                    towards the haunches.</p>
                <p>Fig. 49 shows a series of linear arches, all drawn for the same load, and all
                    tangent to the upper surface of the crown of the arch, differing only in being
                    the result of different horizontal thrusts. The curve drawn with a thick black
                    line, tangent to the soffit, is clearly the longest linear arch which can be
                    drawn within the ring. Any smaller value of the horizontal thrust <hi
                    rend="italic">h</hi> would give a linear arch like curve 3, and any larger value
                    of Λ would give a linear arch like curve 1, and both these values of Λ are
                    incompatible with equilibrium for the whole arch down to joint C; if, therefore,
                    the arch fails by the yielding of the abutment, or of the lower portion of the
                    ring, the failure will first be apparent at the joints A and B, where this black
                    line is tangent to the ring, and at joint C, where the linear arch cuts the back
                    of the ring. Smaller values of <hi rend="italic">h</hi> will keep the stones in
                    equilibrium above and below joint B, but unless the arch below the joint B, as
                    well as the abutment, can resist the tendency of the arch to spread, or, in
                    other words, supply <hi rend="italic">at least</hi> the horizontal reaction <hi
                    rend="italic">h</hi> required for this linear arch, the joint B will open at the
                    top, the centre joint A will open at the bottom, the joint C will open at the
                    back, and the crown fall in as shown in fig. 49«. The joint B, where the longest
                    linear arch is tangent to the soffit, is called the <hi rend="italic">joint of
                    rupture.</hi> The value of <hi rend="italic">lι</hi> required to make a linear
                    arch tangent to the back of the ring at the crown pass through the edge of the

                    down to B and from B to C. In circular arches the joint of rupture generally
                    makes an angle of about 30° with the horizontal plane; in elliptical arches the

                    >h</hi> for a series of joints B, we shall find that one joint gives a maximum
                    value. This value corresponds with that of the linear arch tangent to the soffit
                    (of the middle third) at the joint of rupture; for this arch has the maximum
                    thrust of any passing through the points B <hi rend="subscript"> n</hi> B <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, &amp;c., as appears by simple inspection of fig. 49.
                    The joint of rupture can thus be tentatively found, and the value of <hi
                    rend="italic">h,</hi> or the thrust which the abutment must resist, is obtained
                    at the same time. If the backing is carried well up above C, a larger value of
                    <hi rend="italic">ħ</hi> than that obtained by this methed would be consistent
                    with the stability of the arch, and might actually occur; but we need not
                    provide for this larger value, since the yielding of the abutment under it would
                    diminish the thrust till it fell to the value as above determined. If the
                    abutments could resist this thrust, the bridge would then remain in equilibrium.
                    If the arch is flat there may be no joint of rupture, and in that case the value
                    of Λ is to be taken as that given by a linear arch passing through the bottom of
                    the (middle third of the) springing and tangent to the crown of the arch, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> to the summit of the middle third of the ring.</p>
                <p>When the apparent springing lies much below the joint of rupture, we find that
                    the linear arch leaves the ring on the upper surface at a joint (C) lower down,
                    where failure must result by the opening of the joint at the lower surface,
                    unless the pressure is taken by masonry outside the ring. It is for this purpose
                    that the <hi rend="italic">backing</hi> is required. Obviously the best mode of
                    supplying backing is to thicken <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n353/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0353-0310"/> thø ring itself, keeping the masonry joints
                    radial. The portion of the arch below the joint of rupture B is often considered
                    as part of the abutment.</p>
                <p>If the load at the crown of an arch were very light, and the load at the haunches
                    comparatively very heavy, the series of tentative curves drawn with various
                    values of <hi rend="italic">It</hi> would assume the character shown in fig. 51.
                    The longest curve which can now be fitted into the ring (drawn with a thick
                    black line in the figure) will probably approach the soffit at the crown and be
                    tangent to the upper surface of the ring at the haunch. In fig. 51 the longest
                    linear arch is shown as tangent to the soffit at C. This condition could seldom
                    be secured; with most loads the linear arch tangent to the back of the ring at B
                    will <hi rend="italic">cut</hi> the soffit at C. Nevertheless, the value of <hi
                    rend="italic">h</hi> to be provided for will be that given by the linear arch
                    tangent to the soffit. If this arch leaves the middle third at B, the ring must
                    be thickened or efficient backing provided at this point. If the abutment yield
                    an arch thus loaded would fail, as in fig. 51α, but the case veιy seldom arises
                    in practice. If the arch were not pointed at A, but curved so as to contain the
                    linear arch near the crown, the piece BAB would be lifted up as a whole without
                    breaking at A.</p>
                <p>The joints of rupture can be found for unsymmetrical loads as well as for
                    symmetrical loads, but these joints will then not be at equal distances from the
                    crown.</p>
                <p>If the middle third of the ring be alone treated as effective, the designer,
                    after finding the joint of rupture for a bridge of the usual form and with usual
                    loads, need make no further calculation as to the arch <hi rend="italic"
                    >above</hi> that joint. A linear arch which is tangent to the soffit at the
                    joint of rupture, and to the upper surface of the ring at the crown, will
                    probably lie within the ring at intermediate joints, and will cut them at an
                    angle not differing much from a right angle; but the linear arch must be carried
                    on below the joint of rupture, through the backing and the abutments, to see
                    that it is nowhere too much inclined to the bedding joints, and never comes too
                    near the edge of the effective masonry. The horizontal thrust determined by
                    finding the joint of rupture on the hypothesis that the middle third of the ring
                    is the only effective part will be a safe value; but the actual value may be
                    considerably less, since the actual linear arch called into play may lie outside
                    the middle third. Since we do not know the actual position of the resultant
                    pressures on each voussoir, any refinement in calculating the maximum intensity
                    of stress due to these resultants would be useless. If the actual horizontal
                    thrust were known, it would be easy to determine the couple acting on each joint
                    and due to the distance between the resultant pressure and the centre of
                    resistance of the joints; then knowing this couple and the total thrust it would
                    be equally easy by the principles in § 8 to determine the maximum intensity of
                    stress. Practically the thickness of the arch ring is determined by rules
                    derived from experience, and the chief use of the above theory is to determine
                    the dimensions of the abutments; if, however, with a given load the joint of
                    rupture were found much nearer the crown than the positions indicated above, it
                    would be well to rearrange the permanent loads or to alter the form of the
                    ring.</p>
                <p>§ 42. Professor George Fuller of Belfast has communicated the following novel and
                    very neat method of finding the linear arch of maximum rise (and therefore of
                    minimum thrust) which can be drawn within the middle third of a given ring.</p>
                <p>In fig. 52 let the dotted curves GI and HK bound the middle third of the ring.
                    Let the span be divided into any convenient number of parts at <hi rend="italic"
                    >a, b, c . .</hi>. &amp;c. Let the load on the half arch be subdivided into a
                    corresponding number of parts, and each partial load referred to the vertical
                    line passing through <hi rend="italic">a,</hi><hi rend="italic">b,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">c . .</hi>. &amp;c. Let the curve D 1 2 3 . . . A be a curve of
                    bending moments for these loads, drawn to any convenient scale. This curve will
                    also (§ 30) be a linear arch for the given loads. Draw the straight line AB at
                    any convenient inclination, cutting the horizontal line DB at B. Raise the
                    verticals <hi rend="italic">al, b2,</hi> c3, . . . &amp;c., from the points 1,
                    2, 3, &amp;c. Where these cut the curve DA draw horizontal lines, cutting AB at
                    1', 2', 3', . . . &amp;c. Since the ordinates of all possible linear arches are
                    merely multiples or submultiples of the curve of bending moments, it follows
                    that any other straight line from B to the vertical through A will have
                    ordinates, which, if measured from DB along the verticals passing through 1',
                    2', 3', &amp;c., will be the ordinates of a linear arch, set off on the
                    corresponding verticals passing through 1 and <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> 2 and
                    <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> 3 and c, &amp;c. AB might be called the development of
                    the linear arch DA. Now let the curves CI and HK be developed in a similar way,
                    so that, for instance, the ordinates measured from <hi rend="italic">a to</hi>
                    these curves are equal to the ordinates measured on the vertical passing through
                    1 ’ from DB to the developments I <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> G <hi

                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi>; then it is clear that for the given loads any linear
                    arch which lies within the middle third of the ring must, when developed, be
                    represented by a straight line lying within the area I <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi> G <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> IL K <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, and
                    consequently that the straight line BC, which starts from the lowest point B in
                    this area, and is tancent to the curve G, L. will be the development of the
                    curve of <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n354/mode/1up"

                    drawn within the given middle third with the given loads. The line BC determines
                    the point C, and the ordinates of BC give the ordinates of the curve DC, the
                    ordinates being measured on corresponding verticals.</p>

                <p>Let D be this depth in feet, and <hi rend="italic">τ</hi> the radius of the arch

                <p>According to Rankine, C may be taken as ’ 346 for a single arch, and ’ 413 for
                    one of a series of arches. The reason for making one of a series thicker than a
                    single arch is, that the former has, when not loaded itself, to bear part of the
                    thrust from its neighbours when these are loaded; this thrust tends to throw the
                    linear arch in the unloaded span low down in the keystone. The following is
                    another series of values of C in practical use :—</p>

                <p>Brickwork arches of 24 feet span and less are made 1 foot 6 inches deep at the

                    flat arch of these dimensions has its ring increased by two rings of' bricks
                    towards the haunches. These do not show on the face being concealed by the
                    spandrils. Rubble arches are made a little thicker.</p>
                <p>§ 44. <hi rend="italic">Practical Details.—</hi> The strongest and simplest form
                    of arch is a flat circular arc, having a rise of about one quarter of the span.
                    In these arches the springing is above the place where the joint of rupture
                    would occur if the ring were prolonged. Those parts of an elliptical or
                    semcircular arch which lie below the joint C, fig. 49, are of use chiefly to
                    improve the appearance of the arch. They are virtually part of the abutment,
                    which is sometimes even considered as extending to the joint B. In a very flat
                    arch the linear arch may be brought to coincide more truly with the axis of the
                    ring by lightening the haunch, with which object the roadway is sometimes
                    carried on small flat arches turned at right angles to the main arch, and having
                    the spandrils of the main arch as abutments.</p>
                <p>The joints between the voussoirs should be very evenly worked, so that the
                    pressure may be evenly distributed. In brick joints the layers of mortar should
                    be thin. Great care should be taken to provide for the drainage of the roadway
                    above the arch. With this object the masonry should be covered with a sheet of
                    asphalt sloping down to the piers or abutments, and suitable drains must be
                    provided to collect the water and discharge it through the pier or abutment.</p>

                    attained by adopting one of the three following plans ^Rankine):—!. Direct

                    afforded by the truss used in the erection of London Bridge, fig. 55.</p>

                    >wedges</hi> by which the centre is lowered after the completion of the arch.
                    The upper and lower plates A and B are strong beams suitably notched, and are
                    separated by the compound wedge C; this wedge is kept in its place by cross
                    wedges shown in section in the figure. When the centre is to be lowered these
                    cross wedges are knocked out, and the main wedge C driven back. Owing to
                    defective centering some large French arches sank much during construction, and
                    owing partly to this cause, and partly, as it would appear, to defective
                    mason-work, the total deformation after the centres had been struck was most
                    extraordinary. In Perronet’s bridge at Neuilly <hi rend="italic">(vide</hi>
                    Table XVII., § 84) the sinking, while the centre was in its place, amounted to
                    13 inches, and after the centre was struck a further sinking took place of 9⅜
                    inches. The crown of the centering had a radius of 150 feet, but the sinking of
                    the arch was such that for 60 feet it assumed the form of an arc of a circle
                    with a radius of 244 feet. It is remarkable that the bridge, built in 1774, of
                    very bold design and so imperfectly executed, still stands. When the centres of
                    Waterloo Bridge were removed no arch sank more than 1∣ inches. Centres have

                    arched ribs may be used instead of rings of masonry to support a platform and
                    roadway. These arched ribs constitute true arches whenever, as is generally the
                    case, all parts of the rib are compressed. The principles by which the stress on
                    each part may be computed do not differ from those already explained for arches
                    of masonry, but it is possible to calculate the stresses with much greater
                    exactitude for continuous metal ribs than for voussoirs. With voussoirs we have
                    seen that the resultant thrust at the springing is indeterminate both in
                    magnitude and position, but we shall see hereafter that the resultant thrust,
                    which will be called <hi rend="italic">t,</hi> at the springing of a metal arch
                    is easily rendered determinate. Supposing <hi rend="italic">t</hi> and i <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, the thrusts due to a given load (fiσ. 56), to be
                    known, then if the form of rib be made to correspond with any linear arch for
                    the given distribution the compression at any section of the rib will be axial
                    and uniformly distributed; the arch will then be strained as a chain of the same
                    length would be strained under the same distribution of loads, extension being
                    substituted for compression and dip for rise. Fig. 56 shows a rib of this kind
                    with the approximate linear arch drawn as an equilibrated polygon by the method
                    explained in § 38.</p>
                <p>If the distribution of the load is altered the linear arch will also change, and
                    the stress on each part of the rib will no longer be axial. The change in the
                    form of the linear arch will generally be much greater for a metal than for a
                    masonry arch, because most metal arches have light open spandrils and a light
                    roadway, so that the passing load is considerable in comparison with the
                    permanent load. Not improbably the linear arch, when only one haunch of a metal
                    rib is loaded, may pass quite outside the rib for a portion of its length if
                    this rib is made, as is usually the case, of a form containing the linear arch
                    for a symmetrically distributed load. On the other hand, it does not follow, as
                    with masonry, that because the linear arch passes outside the rib the bridge
                    will fail. The bending couple then produced can be resisted by the moment of the
                    elastic forces of the cross section of the rib if the rib is made strong enough.
                    In masonry the joints open so soon as the resultant pressure passes outside the
                    middle third of the ring; the couple required to produce equilibrium would then
                    require a negative force or tension at the opposite edge, and masonry cannot
                    supply this tension, but in a metal rib the couple or bending moment produced by
                    the excentricity of the stress may be resisted by the stiffness of the rib
                    acting as a beam subject to a bending moment. Thus the strength of an arch to
                    resist flexure is a more important element in the metal rib than in the masonry
                    structure. It would be false to say that the ring of voussoirs had <hi
                    rend="italic">no strength</hi> to resist flexure, for we have on the contrary
                    seen that the moment of the elastic forces at any section of a stone ring does
                    resist any distorting action produced by the load; but in masonry this moment
                    should never exceed the comparatively small value consistent with the absence of
                    tension on any part of any joint. The metal rib may with safety be subjected to
                    considerable tension in parts, and its strength to resist flexure can be easily
                    increased and can be calculated with certainty. Moreover, by hinging the rib at
                    one or both springings, as can be done with metal, the problem of determining
                    the horizontal thrust (or total thrust) is simplified, the position of the
                    thrust being thereby rendered certainly axial at this point, and then by taking
                    into account the actual deformation of each part of the rib a complete solution
                    of the problem of its strength can be obtained.</p>
                <p>§ 46. <hi rend="italic">Horizontal Thrust of a Metal Arch or Rib hinged at the
                    Abutments.—</hi> By supporting a rib on pins or in cylindrical bearings <hi
                    rend="italic">(vide</hi> fig. 62) at the abutments we determine two points
                    traversed by the thrust. The effect of allowing free rotation is necessarily to
                    render the bending moment <hi rend="italic">nil</hi> round the centre of
                    rotation. Hence the resultant thrust must traverse the centre of the pin, or the
                    centre of curvature of the bearing. Knowing the point of application of the
                    thrust we have now to determine its magnitude. The vertical component <hi
                    rend="italic">v</hi> is the same as the load on the pier of a girder of the same
                    span equally and similarly loaded, so that the problem reduces itself to the
                    determination of <hi rend="italic">h</hi> the horizontal component.</p>
                <p>Let us first consider a semicircular rib (fig. 57), bearing a load uniformly
                    distributed along the horizontal platform of the bridge (neglecting the weight
                    of the rib). The linear arch will pass through the centre of the bearings N and
                    Q, and will be a parabola. Moreover, it will be that parabola which requires the
                    rib to exert no internal forces due to its own elasticity, and tending either to
                    push out or draw in the springings; in other words, the rib, being supposed in
                    equilibrium before the application of the weights, will not tend to act as a
                    spring to increase or diminish the opening between N and Q. Nevertheless, as the
                    semicircle cannot coincide with the parabola, most parts of the rib must be
                    subject to bending moments, against which it will react as a bent spring. When
                    the linear arch, as shown in fig. 57, passes above the axis of the rib at the
                    crown, and below it at the haunches, the upper portion of the bent rib will act
                    as a spring, tending by its reaction to diminish the distance between the ends N
                    and Q, while the portions near the springing will be so bent as by their
                    reaction to tend to increase that distance; now, if, as is necessarily the case,
                    the whole rib is not to act as a spring, tending either to close or open the
                    ends N and Q, then the effect of the bending near the haunches must exactly
                    neutralize the effect of the bending near the crown. We have now to find what
                    direction of thrust at the springing will give a linear arch such that the above
                    condition may be fulfilled.</p>

                <p>But if, as above stated, the rib does not act as a spring in either direction,
                    the span will remain constant, and the sum of all the changes in span produced

                <p>as a necessary condition for the equilibrium of a loaded rib, hinged at the

                    the form or load of the rib, the reasoning by which it was obtained being
                    independent of the form either of the rib or linear arch. When the cross section

                <p>We shall now proceed to show how the linear arch satisfying this condition can be

                    If this pressure be resolved into its vertical and horizontal components, the

                <p>This force applied at C <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> will be equivalent to an

                    constant, is proportional to the vertical distance OC between the curves at any
                    point. Equation 3 requires that the sum of all the values of My shall be equal
                    to zero, and we now see that this condition results when the sum of all the
                    products of OC into <hi rend="italic">y</hi> is equal to zero, or when—</p>
                <p>4 2y.OC=0j when the cross section is not constant the value of must be

                <p>The problem of discovering the actual linear arch which will be called into play
                    with a given rib is now reduced to that of finding the linear arch fulfilling
                    the condition in equation 4. We might proceed tentatively, drawing numerous
                    linear arches, and selecting by trial that which most nearly fulfils the

                    magnitude of the thrust at any other point is easily computed graphically or by
                    moments round the springing; then the resultant thrust at a given point being
                    known, the intensity of the stress on any part of a section at that point is to
                    be computed by first resolving the thrust into two components, one normal to the
                    section and one in the plane of the section; the latter gives rise to a shearing
                    stress (analogous to the force which causes one stone to slip on another in the
                    masonry arch), while the component normal to the section will (if not axial)
                    give rise to a uniformly varying stress, the magnitude of which at each distance
                    from the axis can be computed by the formulae given in § 8.</p>
                <p>The value of <hi rend="italic">h</hi> is determinate, if the direction of the rib
                    be supposed fixed at the springing, but this cannot be ensured in large

                <p>When the rib (as is generally the case in existing bridges) abuts against a flat
                    springing the exact value of <hi rend="italic">h</hi> is indeterminate. When the

                    within limits depending on the possible bending moment at the springing due to
                    the friction.</p>
                <p>§ 47. <hi rend="italic">Process of Designing a Rib.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi>
                    In future designs of ribbed arches it is to be hoped that the practice will be
                    adopted of allowing the rib freedom to turn at the springing. This can be done
                    by ending the rib in a bearing, curved as in fig. 62; the resultant thrust will
                    then be approximately axial, and the stress on every part of the rib can be
                    determined with as much accuracy as on the several parts of a girder. When the
                    span is large a cast-iron metal arch can be made lighter than a wrought iron
                    girder for the same load, but the imperfection of the theory of the stresses on
                    the ribs has hitherto led to great waste of metal in their construction. In what
                    follows it is assumed that the resultant at the springing passes through the
                    geometrical centre of the cross section of the rib.</p>
                <p>If the rib were to carry a load distributed only in one way we ought clearly to
                    make the form of the axis of the rib coincide with a linear arch for that load.
                    There would then be no bending moment on any part of the rib. As in practice we
                    must provido for all the possible combinations of passing load, we need take
                    little pains in designing the curvature of the rib—a flat arc of a circle with a
                    rise of say {th will answer well. The semicircular or elliptical forms are not
                    good, for no linear arch with any practical distribution of load can even
                    approximately coincide with a form in which the rib springs vertically from the
                    abutments.</p>
                <p>The general character of the cross section should be similar to that for a
                    girder, inasmuch as the rib will have to resist bending moments as well as
                    direct compression. The depth need not, however, be nearly so great as the depth
                    of a girder. Let a cross section be chosen in which the area is assumed as
                    approximately say <hi rend="italic">5</hi> per cent, more than that which would
                    be sufficient to sustain the thrust resulting from a linear arch suitable for
                    the maximum load and coinciding approximately with the axis of the rib. (If the
                    load be nearly uniform per foot run of platform we may for this first
                    approximation take <hi rend="italic">h =</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">,</hi> where <hi rend="italic">d</hi> is the rise of the 8α</p>
                <p>linear arch above the springings.) With the rib thus designed determine by the
                    method given in § 46 the actual linear arches resulting from the following
                    arrangements of passing load (combined with the permanent load) :— (1), Bridge
                    half covered from one end; (2), three-quarters covered from one end; (3), wholly
                    covered; (4), covered by the passing load over the middle half of the bridge,
                    the haunches being unloaded. Draw these linear arches on the rib by the method
                    given in § 38, and choosing at each one of some eight or ten selected sections
                    the two curves which most nearly approach the top and bottom flanges
                    respectively, compute the maximum intensity of stress on the top and bottom
                    flanges at each section from the two thrusts corresponding to these two linear
                    arches; where the stress is excessive add metal; remove it where the maximum
                    stress is less than the safe stress for the material. If no great change is made
                    in the design this process will be sufficient, but if the cross section is
                    seriously modified by the alteration we must make a second approximation by
                    recalculating the linear arches for the new form of rib, and thus proceed by
                    trial and error until the stresses corresponding to the actual linear arches are
                    met by sufficient metal at all points. The rib need not be of uniform depth
                    throughout, and may be increased in depth at the places where the stress due to
                    bending moment has been found excessive.</p>
                <p>In large spans the effect of a change of temperature must be taken into account.
                    This can be done by finding the linear arch given by the expression—</p>
                <p>ι <hi rend="superscript"> ΜΔί</hi> Λ</p>
                <p>l 2yy = ∆s, where ∆s is the alteration in span which would result from the
                    expansion or contraction of the span if free to expand or contract with the
                    change of temperature.</p>
                <p>In a series of arches abutting against comparatively slender piers, account must
                    be taken of the thrust transmitted from the neighbouring arch. This thrust will
                    only be due to the passing load, and a part may be considered as taken by the
                    pier; the remainder which the <pb break="no"

                    with the reaction due to the linear arch calculated for the permanent load of
                    the unloaded span. With the reaction thus computed the linear arch resulting in
                    the unloaded span must be constructed, and the stresses examined on the top and
                    bottom flanges of the rib.</p>
                <p>The theory now given for a stiff rib used as an arch is equally applicable to a
                    stiff rib hung as a suspension bridge.</p>
                <p>§ 48. <hi rend="italic">Wooden Arches.—</hi> Arches have occasionally been built
                    of wood with ribs elaborately constructed of bent timber, scarfed and bolted
                    together; the strength of such a rib could be calculated in the way indicated
                    for metal ribs, but the mode of construction is not to be recommended. When wood
                    is employed it should be used in simple straight balks built into a framed
                    arch.</p>
                <p>§ 49. <hi rend="italic">Practical Details of Metal Arches.—</hi> The common form
                    of metal arch is a cast-iron rib of I section and of small depth. This rib is
                    intended to be sufficient, unaided, to bear the whole weight of the
                    superstructure. The spandrils, made of some kind of lattice work (or
                    occasionally a mere arcade), bear the roadway, and to some extent stiffen the
                    rib beneath. The rib may with advantage be made much deeper than has been the
                    practice, and may consist of tubes framed as in the St Louis Bridge, fig. 5,
                    Plate XVIII., so as to form a single stiff rib. Where, to gain headway, a rib of
                    small depth at the crown is desirable, the rib might with advantage be deepened
                    at the haunches. Wrought iron is a very suitable material for small arches,
                    where the permanent load is insufficient to prevent tension from occurring in
                    some parts of the rib. Cast-iron and cast-steel are better materials for large
                    spans <hi rend="italic">; for</hi> moderate spans a good form of metal arch will
                    be shown under the head of “Frames” (fig. 77), being that in which a lower
                    member is braced to the upper member carrying the roadway so as to form a true
                    frame; for very large spans a single deep rib, or a frame with parallel members
                    arranged as an arch, may be adopted. This design has the advantage over that
                    shown in fig. 77 of avoiding very long bracing at the abutments.</p>
                <p>V. <hi rend="smallcaps">Frames.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 50. <hi rend="italic">Preliminary.—</hi> A frame is a rigid structure composed
                    of straight struts and ties. The struts and ties are called the members or
                    pieces of the frame. The frame as a whole may be subject to a bending moment,
                    but each bar, pillar, rod, or cord in the structure is thereby simply extended
                    or compressed so that the total stress on a given member is the same at all its
                    cross sections, while the intensity of stress is uniform for all the parts of
                    any one cross section. This result must follow in any frame, the members of
                    which are so connected that the joints offer little or no resistance to change
                    in the relative angular position of the members. Thus if the members are pinned
                    together, the joint consisting of a single circular pin, the centre of which
                    lies in the axis of the piece, it is clear that the direction of the only stress
                    λvhich can be transmitted from pin to pin will coincide with this axis. The axis
                    becomes, therefore, a line of resistance, and in reasoning of the stresses on
                    frames we may treat the frame as consisting of simple straight lines from joint
                    to joint. When the members ∙of a frame consist of iron rods as ties, combined
                    with struts formed by angle iron or T iron of the usual sizes, or by pieces of
                    timber of the ordinary dimensions, it is found by experiment that the stresses
                    on the several members do not differ sensibly whether these members are pinned
                    together with a single pin or rigidly jointed by several bolts or rivets. Frames
                    are much used as girders, and they also give useful designs for suspension and
                    arched bridges. A frame used to support a weight is often called a <hi
                    rend="italic">truss;</hi> the stresses on the various members of a truss can be
                    computed for any given load with greater accuracy than the intensity of stress
                    on the various parts of a continuous structure such as a tubular girder, or the
                    rib of an arch. Many assumptions are made in treating of the flexure of a
                    continuous structure which are not strictly true; no assumption is made in
                    determining the stresses on a frame, except that the joints are flexible, and
                    that the frame shall be so stiff as not sensibly to alter in form under the
                    load. Both assumptions are consistent with the facts in the case of any bridge
                    truss.</p>
                <p>§ 51. <hi rend="italic">Classes of Frames used as Trusses.—</hi> Frames used as
                    bridge trusses should never be designed so that the elongation or compression of
                    one member can elongate or compress any other member. An example will serve to
                    make the meaning of this limitation clearer. Let a frame consist of the five
                    members AB, BD, DC, CA, CB (fig. 63), jointed at the points A, B, C, and D, and
                    all capable of resisting tension and compression. This frame will be <hi
                    rend="italic">rigid, i.e.,</hi> it cannot be distorted without causing an
                    alteration in the length of one or more of the members; but if from a change of
                    temperature or any other cause one or all of the members change their length,
                    this will not produce a stress on any member, but will merely cause a change in
                    the form of the frame. Such a frame as this cannot be <hi rend="italic"
                    >self-strained.</hi> A workman, for instance, cannot produce a stress on one
                    member by making some other member of a wrong length. Any error of this kind
                    will merely affect the form of the frame; if, however, another member be
                    introduced between A and D, then if BC be shortened AD will be strained so as to
                    extend it, and the four other members will be compressed; if CB is lengthened AD
                    will thereby be compressed, and the four other members extended; if the workman
                    does not make CB and AD of exactly the right length they and all the members
                    will be permanently strained. These stresses will be unknown quantities, which
                    the designer cannot take into account, and such a combination ought therefore
                    never to be adopted. A frame of this second type is said to have one <hi
                    rend="italic">redundant member.</hi></p>
                <p>If the members AD and CB were flexible cords there would be no redundant members;
                    for the tightening of one diagonal would throw no sensible stress on the other
                    diagonal, since it is supposed incapable of resisting a thrust. Both diagonals,
                    if flexible, are required to prevent the quadrilateral from getting out of
                    shape. Members capable of bearing only one kind of strain might receive the name
                    of <hi rend="italic">semi-members.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 52. <hi rend="italic">External Forces on Frame.—</hi> Frames used as bridge
                    trusses are in equilibrium under the external forces applied to them. These
                    forces are—(1) the loads, (2) the reactions at the points of support. The loads
                    are to be referred to the joints as follows:—(1) find the resultant of the load
                    carried by any two joints; (2) resolve that load into two vertical components
                    acting through the two joints; (3) compound the several components acting at
                    each joint into one resultant. This process gives a frame with external forces
                    equivalent to the actual loads, but acting only at the joints. The frames are
                    always supported at a joint, and the reactions of the supports are therefore
                    also forces acting at joints. The load between any two joints is directly
                    supported by the member of the frame joining them; the stresses due to the
                    direct action of this partial load must, where great accuracy is wanted, be
                    added to the stresses computed on the assumption that the loads have been
                    applied directly to the joints. Generally the stresses due to the direct action
                    of the load between two joints may <pb break="no"

                    the load carried between the two lower joints next the piers on either side is
                    directly carried by the abutments. The sum of the two upward vertical reactions
                    must clearly be equal to the sum of the loads. The lines in the diagram
                    represent the directions of a series of forces which must all be in equilibrium;

                    by the method usually employed in geometry. Thus we shall call the first
                    inclined line on the left hand the line AG, the line representing the first
                    force on the top left hand joint AB, the first horizontal member at the top left
                    hand the line BH, &amp;c.; similarly each point requires at least three letters
                    to denote it; the top first left hand joint may be called ABHG, being the point
                    where these four spaces meet. In this method of lettering, every enclosed space
                    must be designated by a letter; all external forces must be represented by lines
                    <hi rend="italic">outside</hi> the frame, and each space between any two forces
                    must receive a distinctive letter; this method of lettering was first proposed
                    by Mr R. H. Bow <hi rend="italic">(Economics of Construction),</hi> and is
                    convenient in applying the theory of reciprocal figures to the computation of
                    stresses on frames.</p>
                <p>When the weight of the truss is small it is usual to refer the weights of the
                    parts of the truss itself to the same joints as carry the roadway, and to treat
                    all other joints as unloaded.</p>
                <p>The reactions at the points of supports of a framed arch or suspension bridge are
                    inclined, as in fig. 65; the manner of computing the stresses on these frames
                    when the direction of these reactions is known will be first explained, and
                    subsequently the manner of finding this direction will be given.</p>
                <p>§ 53. <hi rend="italic">Reciprocal Figures.—</hi> Prof. Clerk Maxwell has given
                    <hi rend="italic">(Phil. Mag.</hi> 1864), the following definition of reciprocal
                    figures :—“Two plane figures are reciprocal when they consist of an equal number
                    of lines so that corresponding lines in the two figures are parallel, and
                    corresponding lines which converge to a point in one figure form a closed
                    polygon in the other.”</p>
                <p>Let a frame (without redundant members), and the external forces which keep it in
                    equilibrium, be represented by a diagram constituting one of these two plane
                    figures, then the lines in the other plane figure or the reciprocal will
                    represent in direction and magnitude the forces between the joints of the frame,
                    and, consequently, the stress on each member as will now be explained.</p>
                <p>Reciprocal figures are easily drawn by following definite rules, and afford
                    therefore a simple method of computing the stresses on members of a frame.</p>
                <p>The external forces on a frame or bridge in equilibrium under those forces may,
                    by a well-known proposition in statics, be represented by a closed polygon, each
                    side of which is parallel to one force, and represents the force in magnitude as
                    well as in direction. The sides of the polygon may be arranged in any order,
                    provided care is taken so to draw them that in passing round the polygon in one
                    direction this direction may for each side correspond to the direction of the
                    force whieh it represents.</p>
                <p>This polygon of forces may, by a slight extension of the above definition, be
                    called the <hi rend="italic">reciprocal figure</hi> of the external forces, if
                    the sides are arranged in the same order as that of the joints on which they
                    act, so that if the joints and forces be numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, &amp;c., passing
                    round the outside of the frame in one direction, and returning at last to joint
                    1, then in the polygon the side representing the force 2 will be next the side
                    representing the force 1, and will be followed by the side representing the
                    force 3, and so forth. This polygon falls under the definition of a reciprocal
                    figure given by Clerk Maxw ell, if we consider the frame as a point in
                    equilibrium under the external forces.</p>
                <p>Fig. 66 shows a frame supported at the two end joints, and loaded at each top
                    joint. The loads and the supporting forces are indicated by arrows. Fig. 66α
                    shows the reciprocal figure or polygon for the external forces on the assumption
                    that the reactions are slightly inclined. The lines in fig. 66α, lettered in the
                    usual manner, correspond to the forces indicated by arrows in fig. 66, and
                    lettered according to Mr Bow’s method. When all the forces are vertical, as will
                    be the case in girders, the polygon of external forces will be reduced to two
                    straight lines, fig. 666, superimposed and divided so that the length AX
                    represents the load AX, the length AB the load AB, the length YX the reaction
                    YX, and so forth. The line XZ consists of a series of lengths, as XA, AB DZ,
                    representing the loads taken in their order. In subsequent diagrams the two
                    reaction lines will, for the sake of clearness, be drawn as if slightly inclined
                    to the vertical (as practised by Mr Bow).</p>
                <p>If there are no redundant members in the frame, there will be only two members
                    abutting at the point of support, for these two members will be sufficient to
                    balance the reaction, whatever its direction may be; we can therefore draw two
                    triangles, each having as one side the reaction YX, and having the two other
                    sides parallel to these two members; each of these triangles will represent a
                    polygon of forces in equilibrium at the point of support. Of these two
                    triangles, shown in fig. 66c, select that in which the letters X and Y are so
                    placed that (naming the apex of the triangle E) the lines XE and YE are the
                    lines parallel to the two members of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n360/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0360-0317"/> same name in the frame (fig. 66). ThιU the
                    triangle YXE is the reciprocal figure of the three lines YX, XE, EY in the
                    frame, and represents the three forces in equilibrium at the point YXE of the
                    frame. The direction of YX, being a thrust upλvards, shows the direction in
                    which we must go round the triangle YXE to find the direction of the two other
                    forces; doing this we find that the force XE must act down towards the point
                    YXE, and the force EY away from the same point. Putting arrows on the frame
                    diagram to indicate the direction of the forces, we see that the member E Y must
                    pull and therefore act as a tie, and that the member XE must push and act as a
                    stmt. Passing to the point XEFAwe find two known forces, the load XA acting
                    downwards, and a push from the stmt XE, which, being in compression, must push
                    at Doth ends, as indicated by the arrow, fig. 66. The directions and magnitudes
                    of these two forces are already drawn (fig. 66α) in a fitting position to
                    represent part of the polygon of forces at XEFA; beginning with the upward
                    thrust EX, continuing down XA, and drawing A F parallel to AF in the frame we
                    complete the polygon by drawing EF parallel to EF in the frame. The point F is
                    determined by the intersection of the two lines, one beginning at A, and the
                    other at E. We then have the polygon of forces EXAF, the reciprocal figure of
                    the lines meeting at that point in the frame, and representing the forces at the
                    point EXAF; the direction of the forces on EX and XA being known determines the
                    direction of the forces due to the elastic reaction of the members AF and EF,
                    showing AF to push as a stι <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> ut, while EF is a
                    tie. We have been guided in the selection of the particular quadrilateral
                    adopted by the rule of arranging the order of the sides so that the same letters
                    indicate corresponding sides in the diagram of the frame and its reciprocal.
                    Continuing the construction of the diagram in the same way, we arrive at fig.
                    66d as the complete reciprocal figure of the frame and forces upon it, and we
                    see that each line in the reciprocal figure measures the stress on the
                    corresponding member in the frame, and that the polygon of forces acting at any
                    point, as IJKY, in the frame is represented by a polygon of the same name in the
                    reciprocal figure. The direction of the force in each member is easily
                    ascertained by proceeding in the manner above described. A single known force in
                    a polygon determines the direction of all the others, as these must all
                    correspond with arrows pointing the same way round the polygon. Let the arrows
                    be placed on the frame round each joint, and so as to indicate the direction of
                    each force on that joint; then when two arrows point to one another on the same_
                    piece, that piece is a tie; when they point from one another the piece is a
                    strut. It is hardly necessary to say that the forces exerted by the two ends of
                    any one member must be equal and opposite. This method is universally applicable
                    where there are no redundant members. The reciprocal figure for any loaded frame
                    is a complete formula for the stress on every member of a frame of that
                    particular class with loads on given joints. Some examples of these figures will
                    be given, and the reader will easily construct others for himself.</p>

                    Stresses by Method of Sections.</hi></p>
                <p>Case 1. The Warren girder leaded at each top joint, figs. 67 and 67α. This
                    diagram differs very slightly from that shown in fig. 66. The top and bottom
                    members are in straight lines, and consequently the lines indicating the
                    stresses on the bottom member are superimposed one on the other instead of
                    radiating from Y; the loads XA and FZ are shown as directly borne by the piers.
                    It is clear that if the road is supported by a platform reaching from the end
                    joints to the piers, half of the load on these parts of the platform will be
                    directly supported on the piers. These end loads are shown also in the subse
                    quent diagrams. The truss is generally built of equilateral triangles, and the
                    inclination of the bracing to the horizon should never be less than 45°.</p>
                <p>Case 2. Warren girder loaded on top and bottom, fig. 68. 685 shows the polygon of
                    external forces, and 68c shows half the reciprocal figure. These figures have
                    been added to facilitate the comprehension of the complete reciprocal shown by
                    68α</p>
                <p>Case 3. Warren girder with one load, not central, 6g.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0361-0318"/>
                <p>Case 4. Warren girder; load on half the top joints, fig. 70.</p>
                <p>In designing a Warren girder it is necessary to provide for the advancing load.
                    With a uniformly distributed load the diagonal bracing consists of alternate
                    struts and ties beginning, if supported at the bottom, with a strut at each end,
                    or with the tie at each end if the truss is hung from the top. At the centre
                    there will be either two ties or two struts in juxtaposition; or, as in the case
                    where there are an even number of loaded joints at the top, the central pair of
                    diagonal members will be unstrained; but an advancing load (neglecting the
                    permanent load) will convert each diagonal member (except the end ones)
                    alternately into a strut and a tie. It is necessary to provide for the maximum
                    extension and maximum compression on each, taking into account the combined
                    effects of the permanent and passing load; the latter has generally sufficient
                    effect to reverse the direction of the stress on the bracing near the centre,
                    but not (in large bridges) towards the ends. Each member of the bracing towards
                    the centre must, therefore, be so designed as to be capable of acting
                    alternately as a strut and as a tie. The maximum stress on the top and bottom
                    members occurs when the bridge is fully loaded.</p>
                <p>This stress is easily calculated by the method of sections; assume the girder cut
                    by a vertical plane at the joint or pin opposite the member in question, or in
                    other words, by a vertical plane passing through the vertex of the triangle of
                    which the member in question is the base; let <hi rend="italic">d</hi> be the
                    perpendicular distance between the member and the pin, <hi rend="italic">t</hi>
                    the thrust or tension on the member, and M the bending moment for the section
                    calculated as for a girder loaded at the points corresponding to the joints.
                    Then ÏI = <hi rend="italic">td.</hi> The stress on the diagonals corresponds to
                    the shearing stress in the solid girder, and may consequently be calculated from
                    the shearing diagrams, examples of which were given in § 19. The loads may be
                    referred to the joints before drawing the diagram, and the continuous curves of
                    figures 18 to 18c will be replaced by lines consisting of a series of steps such
                    as are shown in fig. 18a. We may then proceed to calculate the stress on any
                    diagonal as follows Take the shearing stress for the section at the joint where
                    the diagonal in question abuts; if there is a load on this joint, take the
                    shearing stress for a section close to the joint, and on that side of it which
                    is next the diagonal in question: call the shearing force thus found F; let <hi
                    rend="italic">i</hi> be the slope of the diagonal or the angle which it makes
                    with the horizon, then the tension or compression on the diagonal is F cosec. ï;
                    thus let fig. 71 represent a Warren girder of six equal bays, in which <hi
                    rend="italic">i</hi> = 60°. Let the load on each top joint be 5 tons, the
                    compressions and tensions on the diagonals are as follows :—</p>

                    the same intensity would produce. The stresses on the two halves of the girder
                    are symmetrical.</p>
                <p>The arithmetical mode of computation is the simpler where the top and bottom
                    members are parallel and the inclination of the diagonals constant; where these
                    conditions are not fulfilled the method by reciprocal figures is preferable.</p>
                <p>In the actual design of any girder to suit various combinations of loads, care
                    must be taken to design each member to suit the <hi rend="italic">maximum</hi>
                    stress which can arise from any combination. The maximum shearing stress is most
                    easily selected by means of the diagrams § 19. Care must be taken to meet both
                    the maximum tension and maximum compression whenever the member is so placed
                    that with some loads it is extended and with some compressed. We have just shown
                    that this case arises in the diagonals near the centre of the girder. When
                    frames are used as continuous girders, it is desirable to make the points of
                    inflection coincide exactly with a joint. This may be done by cutting through or
                    omitting the member opposite the joint. This allows the reactions on each pier
                    to be easily determined by the elementary principles of statics with any load,
                    and without taking into account the form which the beam assumes when deflected.
                    Instead of a long continuous girder, we then have a series of girders, supported
                    at or near the middle of their length by the piers, while a second series hang
                    from the first by pins at determinate points. This arrangement greatly
                    simplifies all the calculations without sensibly diminishing the advantage
                    derived from the use of continuous girders.</p>
                <p>§ 55. <hi rend="italic">Various Forms of Girder.—</hi> The framed girder is
                    sometimes made of the form in fig. 72, which has the advantage of reducing the
                    length of the end diagonals where the stress is heaviest. The reciprocal figure
                    for this truss uniformly loaded on the bottom joints is shown in fig. 72α. This
                    girder is sometimes called a bowstring girder, though this name more properly
                    belongs to an obsolete form with no diagonals. Z and X are the spaces between
                    the end loads and the reactions which, for clearness, are shown as pulling up;
                    but the same reciprocal would result if the reaction were shown pushing up, and
                    the letters X and Z were placed as dotted. This form has the advantage of
                    reducing the compression on the diagonal struts to a comparatively small amount.
                    A great part of the shearing stress is taken by the curved upper boom; deeper
                    girders can be profitably used of the bowstring than of the Warren type. The
                    long and expensive struts in the latter form more than counterbalance <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n362/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0362-0319"/> the saving to be obtained by increasing the depth
                    beyond about -⅛th of the span.</p>
                <p>The diagonal bracing in the Warren and bowstring girders is sometimes arranged as
                    in fig. 73; the girder is then called a lattice-girder. It is to be treated as a
                    series of superposed Warren girders, each bearing its share of the load. This
                    form has a slight advantage inasmuch as the diagonal struts are stiffened by
                    being pinned to the ties where they cross.</p>
                <p>Fig. 74 shows a very common and useful form of girder where the uprights between
                    the top and bottom members are able to sustain both tension and compression,
                    while the diagonals are only “semimembers,” being flexible rods or bars. The
                    reciprocal for this design is shown in fig. <hi rend="italic">74a</hi> with two
                    joints more heavily loaded than the others. The members in fig.</p>
                <p>74 which have no arrows on them are idle or unused, with this particular
                    distribution of load. When the permanent load is considerable as compared with
                    the passing load, the end or two end diagonals shown dotted will not come into
                    action with any distribution of load, and may therefore be omitted. This form is
                    much used when wood is employed for the compression members. It has in every
                    case the advantage that the struts in the bracing are shorter than in the Warren
                    girder. The lettering is arranged so that only those spaces have letters which
                    are divided by members actually in use under this-particular load.</p>
                <p>Figs. 75 and 75α show a modification of this truss for small spans, and its
                    reciprocal when loaded on one joint; the lettering here also only suits the one
                    distribution of load, and the idle members have no arrows on them.</p>
                <p>§ 56. <hi rend="italic">Framed Suspension Bridges and Arclies.—</hi> These
                    frames, like the girders, consist of top and bottom members, braced together by
                    ties and struts. The bridge is a suspension bridge, if the frame is supported by
                    inclined forces pulling outwards from the bridge as in fig. 76, and an arch is
                    supported by forces pushing inwards as in fig. 77. The reciprocals of these two
                    forms with the joints at the platform uniformly loaded are annexed. These
                    reciprocals are drawn on the hypothesis that the direction of the thrust or pull
                    is known; and this has been chosen in this case so as to reduce the stress on NG
                    to zero, as would necessarily be the case if NG were omitted or cut. When this
                    is not the case the direction of the thrust or pull at the abutments must be
                    found in the manner explained below.</p>
                <p>It is easy to design the bridge so that both the top and bottom members of the
                    suspension bridge remain in tension, and both those of the arch in compression
                    under all distributions of load. This would allow wire rope to be used for both
                    members of the suspension bridge, and cast-iron or steel for both members of the
                    arch. The stresses on the bracing are very uniform and small as compared with
                    those on the diagonals of a girder.</p>
                <p>Fig. 78 shows a slight modification of the design for a suspension bridge, very
                    suitable for spans so large that the end struts in the preceding form would be
                    inconveniently long. The reciprocal annexed is drawn for the case in which a
                    double load is placed on half the bridge. The same design is suitable for an
                    arch.</p>
                <p>The resultant thrust intension at the supports of framed suspension bridges or
                    arches can only be found by a method analogous to that already explained for the
                    solid metal rib. This method was first given by Prof. Clerk Maxwell.</p>
                <p>Consider any member A, fig. 79, of length L and cross-section <hi rend="italic"
                    >a,</hi> made of a material having the modulus of elasticity E; under the action
                    of a stress F, the length L will be altered by an amount— <hi rend="superscript

                    arithmetical values of the for se and. the alteration of length; thus thrust and
                    compression may be called negative, pull and extension positive. If every other
                    mem ber of the frame were absolutely rigid, the span S of the bridge would
                    undergo an alteration ∆S. The ratio will depend merely on the geometrical form
                    of the frame; let <hi rend="italic">q</hi> be the value of this constant ratio,
                    so that—</p>
                <p>1 ∆S=}∆L=jFg^.</p>

                    velocities we have—</p>
                <p>∕: Ä = ∆S: ∆L, for we may consider the structure merely as a kind of lever, by
                    which the force <hi rend="italic">h</hi> exerts a force on A, the fulcrum being
                    the joint opposite A; then the above proportion expresses the fact that the
                    forces <hi rend="italic">h</hi> and <hi rend="italic">f</hi> are inversely
                    proportional to the spaces which the ends of the lever would move through when a
                    small displacement occurs. Thus we may write</p>
                <p>∕= <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Λ.</p>
                <p>Similarly let ∕ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> be the stress which would be
                    produced on A by a vertical force <hi rend="italic">v,</hi> applied at one
                    springing, while the other springing was held rigidly so that the whole frame

                    rend="italic">v</hi> is constant, depending merely on the form of the frame, so

                    to the whole stress produced on the given member by a unit <hi rend="italic"
                    >vertical</hi> force at the sp.ringing, and <hi rend="italic">q</hi> as the

                <p>Then any thrust i at the springing having the vertical and hori zontal components

                    the maximum stress to which any member can be subjected. If the assumed cross
                    sections are not suitable for these stresses, fresh cross sections must be

                <p>Fig. 80 shows half the frame of a bridge for which the calculations have been

                    erOwn. The load assumed is 10 tons permanently on each top joint, and 10 tons of
                    passing load. On fig. 80 are marked the stresses when the bridge is wholly
                    covered with the passing load. On fig. 80α are marked, the maximum stresses with

                    in a girder of the same span and 12 feet deep; the breadth given in the diagram
                    to each member is proportional to the cross section required. The quantity of
                    metal required for the girder exceeds tluιt for the arch in the ratio of about
                    175 to 100; a similar calculation for a bowstring lattice girder 17 feet deep at
                    the centre gives the ratio between the weights of metal required as 100 for the
                    arch and 155 for the bowstring. Even these ratios understate the great advantage
                    to be derived from the braced arch or suspension bridge for large spans, since
                    they assume that the loads to be carried are the same, whereas the permanent
                    load is in large spans much less for the lighter construction of bridge. The
                    following table shows the probable weight in tons of several different types of
                    trusses, assuming that the maximum intensity of stress on the metal in girders
                    and arches is everywhere 4 tons per square inch, that the passing load to be
                    carried is 1 <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 4 tons per foot run, and that the
                    practical weight is 25 per cent, in excess of the minimum possible weight if no
                    metal were wasted, vide <hi rend="italic">Trans. R.S.S.A.,</hi> vol. viii. p.
                    135. It must be remembered that the abutments for arches will in all cases be
                    more expensive than those for girders; in small spans this expense will often
                    outweigh the saving which could be effected in the superstructure by employing
                    the arch.</p>

                <p>The framed arch is a very suitable form for wooden bridges. The ties are few and
                    subject to insignificant strains. In designing a series of arches supported on
                    piers care must be taken to provide for the thrust from loaded to unloaded
                    arches across the pier at the springing.</p>
                <p>§ 57. <hi rend="italic">Strength of Struts.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> When a
                    strut or column is used as in framework to resist compression, it is usually so
                    long in comparison with its cross section that it will bend and yield with a
                    much less stress than would be required to crush the material. The strength of a
                    strut of this kind can be approximately computed according to the following
                    theory :—</p>
                <p>. Let a stmt with a cross section S be pinned or hinged at both ends, or let it
                    have round ends, so that if it yields under compression it bends as in fig. 83.
                    Let the cross section have two axes of symmetry, and let the section be such
                    that the column will bend in the plane of one axis; let the depth of cross

                <p>It is of great importance that the connections between the several struts and

                    short beams the formula in § 5 would give a smaller strength than equation 11.
                    This smaller value is, then, the true measure of the strength.</p>
                <p>VI. <hi rend="smallcaps">Compound Structures.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 58. Many bridges have been built with superstructures such that the stresses on
                    the several parts or members cannot be computed by the rules hitherto given.
                    These superstructures are generally constructed by superposing two or more types
                    so as to form a compound structure capable of acting at once say as an arch and
                    as a girder. These bridges may be called compound bridges. The designs are
                    usually unworthy of imitation. Mr Robert Stevenson’s original design for the
                    Britannia Bridge, in which the great girder would have been partly supported by
                    chains, is an example of this type of structure in which the two parts are
                    clearly visible. Many wooden American bridges are trusses which almost defy
                    analysis, the designs being, however, obviously suggested by an attempt to
                    combine at least two of the three main types of bridges. No advantage whatever
                    is gained by a combination of this kind; on the contrary great disadvantage is
                    almost sure to follow its adoption, namely, that it will be impossible that each
                    part of the structure should, under all circumstances, carry that portion of the
                    load which the designer entrusted to it. For suppose a bridge constructed partly
                    as a girder and partly as a suspension bridge, the girder being very stiff and
                    deep and the chain perfectly flexible with considerable dip. Let the chain and
                    girder be each fit to carry half the passing load. It is perfectly conceivable
                    that the deflections of the two should be so different that the girder would,
                    under the actual load, break before the chain was sensibly strained, or the
                    difference in the relative dip of the chain and depth of the girder might be
                    such as to cause the former to give way first. Even if the two were so designed
                    that at a given temperature each should take the designed share of the load, a
                    change of temperature would entirely alter the proportion borne by the two parts
                    of the structure. A few forms are free from this defect, and these will now be
                    described.</p>
                <p>§ 59. <hi rend="italic">Fink Truss.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> This truss (fig.
                    85) has been much employed in America. The upright struts, numbered 1 to 7,
                    divide the span into eight equal parts. If a weight <hi rend="italic">w</hi>
                    rests on the top of each strut the whole truss may be looked upon as made up of
                    seven distinct and independent trusses superposed on one another; strut 4 is
                    used seven times, and is compressed with a total force of <hi rend="italic"
                    >4w.</hi> Struts 2 and 6 are used three times, and each compressed with a total
                    force of <hi rend="italic">2w.</hi> Struts 1, 3, 5, and 7 are used once, and
                    each compressed with a force <hi rend="italic">w.</hi> The stresses on the
                    inclined ties are at once got from the compression of the strut by the
                    resolution of forces; and the stress on the upper member or boom is the sum of
                    all the pulls on the ties resolved horizontally; <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n366/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0366-0323"/> the boom is uniformly strained over its whole
                    length. This truss would not be so light as a Warren girder if both were made of
                    the same depth, and if the end struts in the Warren girder did not require to be
                    much stiffened in consequence of their great length. The Fink truss is, however,
                    generally made in practice more cheaply than the Warren girder, because the
                    depth of a girder practically depends on the greatest length of strut which is
                    admissible, and for equal lengths of strut the Fink truss gives a deeper beam
                    than the Warren girder.</p>
                <p>§ 60. <hi rend="italic">Bollman Truss</hi> (fig. 86).—This truss is the result of
                    superposing seven simple frames consisting of a top member, a strut, and two
                    ties. The stresses are easily computed. It is one form of the old false
                    suspension bridge already alluded to (§ 34), with the difference that the top
                    member replaces the horizontal resistance at the points of support. The defect
                    of this truss is that two ties supporting any strut except the central one are
                    of unequal length; expansion or extension, consequently, affects these
                    unequally. It is inferior to the Fink truss.</p>

                    Schaffhausen (fig. 87, see also § 76) is in its main parts a compound bridge,
                    composed by superposing a series of simple frames of the type shown in 1, 2, 3,
                    and 4. Nos. 1 and 2 are imperfect frames, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> if the
                    joints were flexible they would collapse in consequence of the want of the
                    diagonals across the centre parallelogram. The stiffness of the joints supplies
                    this want.</p>
                <p>§ 62. <hi rend="italic">Dredge’s Suspension Bridge.—</hi> This bridge differs
                    from the usual suspension bridge in having the suspending rods inclined, and in
                    the use of a lower member, which may be a compression member transmitting a
                    thrust to the piers, as in 88«, or a tension member, as in 886, with a maximum
                    tension at the centre. Fig. 88c and fig. 88&lt;Z show the reciprocal figures·
                    corresponding to those two cases. .This bridge is somewhat stiffer than the

                    member of each frame can be easily computed by a reciprocal figure or otherwise.
                    This form is only inferior to the true framed arch or suspension bridge inasmuch
                    as it is incapable of balancing the thrust due to the passing load on
                    neighbouring spans. It is superior to the framed arch and suspension bridge
                    inasmuch as it cannot be strained by any change of temperature.</p>
                <p>VII <hi rend="smallcaps">Substructure.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 64. <hi rend="italic">Preliminary.—</hi> The substructure of a bridge comprises
                    the piers, abutments, and foundations. These portions of the bridge usually
                    consist of masonry in some form, including under that general head stone
                    masonry, brickwork, and concrete. Occasionally metal work or woodwork is used
                    for intermediate piers.</p>
                <p>When girders form the superstructure, the resultant pressure on the piers or
                    abutments is vertical, and the dimensions of these are simply regulated by the
                    sufficiency to bear this vertical load.</p>
                <p>When arches form the superstructure, the abutment must be so designed as to
                    transmit the resultant thrust to the foundation in a safe direction, and so
                    distributed that no part may be unduly compressed. The intermediate piers should
                    also have considerable stability, so as to counterbalance the thrust arising
                    when one arch is loaded while the other is free from load.</p>
                <p>For suspension bridges the abutment forming the anchorage must be so designed as
                    to be thoroughly stable under the greatest pull which the chains cau exert. The
                    piers require to be carried above the platform, and their design must be
                    modified according to the type of suspension bridge adopted. When the resultant
                    pressure is not vertical on the piers these must be constructed to meet the
                    inclined pressure. In any stiffened suspension bridge the action of the pier
                    will be analogous to that of a pier between two arches.</p>
                <p>§ 65. <hi rend="italic">Stability.—</hi> When the magnitude and direction of the
                    thrust borne by a pier, or abutment at the springing are known, the stability of
                    any series of masonry blocks forming the pier or abutment may be studied by
                    drawing lines showing the direction and magnitude of the resultant force on each
                    joint. This may be done as for the voussoirs of an arch. The thrust on the upper
                    block may be con-pounded with the weight of that block, the resultant compounded
                    with the weight of the next, and so forth, until the direction and magnitude of
                    the thrust on the rock or earth foundation is determined.</p>
                <p>A better method of making the drawing is shown in fig. 91; find the centre of
                    gravity C <hi rend="subscript"> z</hi> of block 1, the centre of gravity <hi

                    the line C,B <hi rend="subscript"> z</hi> ∙; and let D <hi rend="subscript">
                    z</hi> be the point where the direction of this resultant cuts the first joint;
                    similarly let B <hi rend="subscript"> zz</hi> D <hi rend="subscript"> zz</hi> be
                    the direction of the resultant of <hi rend="italic">t</hi> and the weight w <hi

                    first blocks, &amp;c., &amp;c. This method of proceeding gives the direction and
                    magnitude of each force and centre of pressure D independently of the values
                    obtained for the preceding joints. For stability the line BD must not make a
                    greater angle with the normal to the joint than the angle of repose; and the
                    point D must nowhere fall beyond the edge of the joint; for strength and safety
                    the point D might be required to fall within the middle two-thirds of the joint,
                    or within the middle three-quarters. The theory by which the joints furthest
                    from the centre of pressure would open when the centre of pressure leaves the
                    middle third cannot apply to such a structure as a masonry abutment, all parts
                    of which are bonded together. Professor G. Fuller calculates the thickness of
                    abutments by the following empirical rule, deduced from many practical
                    examples:—Let c = half the span in feet; <hi rend="italic">d =</hi> versed sine
                    in feet; <hi rend="italic">t</hi> = thickness of abutment at springing; then,
                    for flat arches, in which the span does not exceed 150 feet, and the ratio of
                    the rise to the span is not less than 116, we may write <hi rend="italic"
                    >t=</hi> ’ 17 + cθ . From the springing to the base the abutment may have a
                    batter of 1 in 4. This gives an abutment the cubic capacity of which will be
                    sufficient, but it may with advantage be divided into abutment proper and
                    counterforts; in semicircular arches <hi rend="italic">t</hi> should be taken as
                    the thickness of the abutment at a height above the springing equal to
                    two-thirds of the radius. The maximum intensity of stress on the stone at the
                    edge F might be approximately found by the theory explained in § 8. This theory
                    finds a uecful application in calculating the maximum intensity of stress which
                    a given foundation might produce on the earth or rock supporting it. Thus, let
                    the section of the foundation under consideration be 1 foot in breadth, 8 feet
                    in length from F to G, as shown in plan. fig. 92; let the centre of pressure D
                    be 2 feet from FF, and let the total resultant thrust be about 16 <hi
                    rend="italic">5</hi> tons, inclined so that the horizontal component is 4 tons
                    and the vertical component 16 tons, then the mean vertical intensity of pressure
                    per square foot is ⅛ <hi rend="superscript"> n</hi> = 2, and the maximum
                    intensity along the line FF, is by equation 2, § 8—</p>
                <p>2 j l + (4×2×8)5 <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi>- <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> j =
                    5, this maximum intensity being 2⅜ times as great as the mean intensity.
                    Obviously, although for the sake of appearance the courses of masonry in the
                    abutment of an arch may be left horizontal in the face, the stability is
                    increased by inclining them at a proper angle, so that they lie normal to the
                    thrust.</p>
                <p>Thθ stability of abutments may be tested by taking moments round points in the
                    joints selected as the points beyond which the thrust must not come. The same
                    methods apply to the auchorages of suspension bridges, and to intermediate
                    piers, which are intended to take a given horizontal thrust. When metal or
                    wooden piers are adopted their weight will generally be insignificant, and such
                    as may be neglected in calculating their stability. Metal-work piers or wooden
                    piers usually consist of wrought or cast-iron frame work, and the stress on each
                    part of the frame, as well as the resultant stress on the foundations where each
                    upright member reaches it, is <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n368/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0368-0325"/> easily calculated by the method of reciprocal
                    figures or otherwise.</p>
                <p>Occasionally metal piers are continuous metal structures, such as cast-iron
                    cylinders. The maximum intensity of stress can then be calculated by resolving
                    the thrust on the upper part of the pier into a horizontal and a vertical
                    component, calculating the bending moment produced on each horizontal cross
                    section by the horizontal component, and adding the intensity of stress caused
                    by this bending moment to the mean intensity caused by direct compression. The
                    manner in which any metal-work pier is held by its foundation against a bending
                    moment will require special consideration; the resultant pressure should always
                    fall well within the base.</p>
                <p>§ 66. <hi rend="italic">Practice.—</hi> In the desigu of the usual masonry bridge
                    the thickness of the pier is generally determined by practical considerations.
                    In small arches the pier is made thick enough to allow the two rings of the two
                    abutting arches to spring from the pier without interfering with one another, a
                    clearance of about half a brick being often allowed between the two rings. In
                    larger arches the piers will generally be found to vary in thickness from ⅜th to
                    j∖jth of the span, with a slight batter (t.e., with walls spreading outward
                    towards the base). in very old bridges piers are sometimes found equal in width
                    to the opening of the arch. In large bridges, or with very high piers, care must
                    be taken that the pressure per square foot on the masonry or foundation does not
                    exceed a safe value. The brickwork in the piers of Charing Cross bridge is
                    subject to a compression of 9 tons per square foot; four or five tons is a much
                    more usual load. Eight tons per square foot may be considered a maximum for
                    rubble stone-work, and perhaps 20 tons for the best dressed ashlar. Strong
                    concrete may be trusted with 3tons; firm rock foundations with 9 tons, soft
                    sandstone with 2 tons, and firm earth with from 1 to 1⅜ tons. The depth of the
                    first course below the surface (on dry land) should not be less than 3 feet in
                    sand and 4 feet in clay.</p>
                <p>When framework, either of wood or iron, is used as a pier, care must be taken by
                    cross-bracing to provide against the effect of wind and vibration.</p>
                <p>§ 67. <hi rend="italic">Site.—</hi> The site proposed for a pier must be
                    carefully examined by borings; the ground should be uniform, for if a pier rests
                    partly on one formation and partly on another, unequal settlement will certainly
                    occur, even if the weaker formation be such as would have been amply strong
                    enough to bear the pressure had the pier been wholly founded upon it. Solid rock
                    may be considered the best foundation, but where rock is broken up by cracks or
                    other inequalities it is inferior to such formations as uniform gravel, chalk,
                    and some kiuds of sand and clay. These foundations may be described as
                    incompressible. The worst foundations are afforded by those formations which can
                    be compressed or squeezed out sideways by the imposition of weight. Muddy earth,
                    certain clays, and certain sands are of this nature. Alternate beds of stone and
                    slippery clay are very treacherous. The foundation should be dressed level so
                    that the masonry may everywhere start from the same height, and therefore settle
                    equally. Unavoidable inequalities are better filled up by concrete than by
                    masonry.</p>
                <p>For foundations in water it is very important that the ground should not be such
                    as can be scoured away by the current or wash of the water; many bridges have
                    failed by the undermining of the piers due to this cause. Special precautions,
                    to be presently described, must be taken against the effects of the scour if the
                    soil itself is not of a sufficiently resisting nature. The piers must be so
                    placed and formed that the obstruction to the flow of water may be as small as
                    possible and the effect which the piers will have in altering the level of the
                    stream above and below the bridge must be considered. Data as to the maximum
                    flood waters to be provided for must be examined; and provision must in some
                    climates be made against ice by suitable cut-waters or fenders, an example of
                    which is given in fig. 93, showing a pier of the Victoria Bridge, Montreal.</p>
                <p>§ 68. <hi rend="italic">Mode of Founding in Water.—</hi> The chief difficulty met
                    with by an engineer about to erect a large bridge over a deep stream is to
                    secure a sound foundation for the piers. The following are some of the principal
                    methods of building piers in or under water :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cofferdams.—</hi> Cofferdams are embankments or dams which
                    surround the site so as to exclude the water from it. They are formed in general
                    by driving two rows of piles round the site so as to enclose between them a
                    water-tight wall of clay puddle; in depths of less than 3 or 4 feet, where there
                    is little current, a simple clay dam may be used. In greater depths, the timber
                    walls consist of guide piles at intervals, with some form of sheet piling
                    between them; in extreme depths the timber walls may be composed of stout piles
                    driven in side by side all round. The dam must be sufficiently strong to bear
                    the pressure of the water against the outside when the space enclosed has been
                    pumped dry. Bankine states that the common rule for the thickness of a cofferdam
                    is to make it equal to the height above ground if the height does not exceed 10
                    feet, and for greater heights, to add to 10 feet one-third of the excess of the
                    height above 10 feet. The “Cours de Ponts” at the school of the Ponts et
                    Chaussées, states that a cofferdam need never be made of greater thickness than
                    from 4 to 6 feet, as the interior can always be sufficiently stayed inside. This
                    method of founding is now seldom practised; it is costly and causes great
                    obstruction in the stream.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Caissons.—</hi> Some foundations have been constructed as
                    follows :—A level or nearly level bed was prepared in the stream by digging or
                    by driving piles and sawing off the heads at a uniform depth; a huge timber box,
                    called a caisson, was then filled with masonry, and sunk on the foundation thus
                    roughly prepared. This method is now abandoned. It was peculiarly liable to
                    danger from the scour of the stream. The name caisson is also sometimes <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n369/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0369-0326"/> applied to a mere frame with wooden walls which
                    is floated to the site of the pier, and there sunk so as to form an enclosure,
                    inside which concrete can be shot and can set undisturbed by the wash of the
                    water.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Concrete in a shell</hi> is a name which might be applied to
                    all the methods of founding a pier which depend on the very valuable property
                    which strong hydraulic concrete possesses of setting into a solid mass under
                    water. The required space is enclosed by a wooden or iron shell; the soil inside
                    the shell is removed by dredging, or some form of mechanical excavator, until
                    the formation is reached which is to support the pier; the concrete is then shot
                    into the enclosed space from a height of about 10 feet, and rammed down in
                    layers about 1 foot thick; it soon consolidates into a permanent artificial
                    stone. The shell, unless of small size or very strong form, requires to be
                    braced to meet the outward pressure of the concrete. The concrete used for this
                    purpose is often called béton, to distinguish it from inferior mixtures used for
                    foundations on land. It may consist of angular stones 1½ to 2 inches diameter,
                    mixed with strong hydraulic mortar in the proportion of from one to two volumes
                    of stones with one of mortar; the final volume may be from <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 5</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 9</hi> to ⅝ of the unmixed
                    materials. Béton used at Biarritz consisted of one part Portland cement, two
                    parts sand, and three parts broken stones; at Genoa one part rich lime, two
                    parts pozzuolana, three parts broken stones.</p>
                <p>filling shows a section of foundations constructed by mg a casing of piles with
                    concrete in this manner; the shell is protected against scour by large stones
                    heaped round the outside, part of the loose earth having been removed by
                    digging. Fig. 94 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> shows the manner in which the concrete
                    foundation was finished after removal of the temporary external wall shown in
                    fig, 94.</p>
                <p>Figs. 95 and <hi rend="italic">95a</hi> show a longitudinal elevation and cross
                    section of a wooden shell, or caisson without a bottom, intended to be sunk to
                    receive concrete. Cast-iron guide piles and sheet piling are also used for this
                    class of foundation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cast-iron tubular shells</hi> are now frequently employed; the
                    tube forms a large hollow pile, which may descend into the ground by its own
                    weight, or by added weight while the soil inside is removed by some kind of
                    dredge or excavator, such as Milroy’s, worked from the surface. When the lower
                    edge of the shell has penetrated the formation to be used as a foundation, the
                    water inside may be pumped out if the soil forms a water-tight joint, or the
                    shell may simply be filled up with concrete shot into the enclosed water. The
                    piers of Charing Cross bridge (fig. 96) were constructed in this way; the
                    excavation inside the tube (14 feet diameter), was carried on by divers with
                    helmets until the shell had entered a few feet into the London clay. The water
                    was then pumped out and excavation continued; the cylinders were loaded with
                    about 150 tons to sink them to the final depth.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Compressed air</hi> is now very generally employed inside a
                    metal shell for those foundations in which the excavation requires the presence
                    of workmen at the bottom of the shell, The metal shell is open at the bottom,
                    but air-tight and water-tight at all other points; there is a chamber called an
                    <hi rend="italic">air-lock</hi> at the upper part. This “air-lock” serves for
                    the exit and entrance of the workmen and materials; the air in this
                    comparatively small space is lowered to the pressure of the atmosphere before
                    the chamber is opened for the passage of men or materials to the open air; the
                    air is again compressed in the air-lock before it is opened for communication
                    with the body of the shell in which the air is permanently kept at such a
                    pressure as will keep the water down to the required level. The shell thus acts
                    as a diving bell acts. It is found that men cannot in general be safely employed
                    under a greater pressure than two atmospheres above the ordinary atmospheric
                    pressure, corresponding to a depth in water of about 65 feet. The centre pier of
                    Saltash Bridge was, however, in 1855 by this plan carried down to a depth of 87
                    feet 6 inches below high water. Recently the foundations of St Louis bridge over
                    the Mississippi have by the same method been established at a depth of <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n370/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0370-0327"/> 110 feet from the surface of the water. Figs. 97
                    and 97 A show the pier of the bridge of Argenteuil. Excavation was carried on in
                    the lower chamber, the roof of which was very strongly built of metal, and
                    served as the foundation for masonry and concrete built up round an inner tube,
                    serving as a passage for men and materials to the upper chamber and “air lock.”
                    This lock is formed of two concentric cylinders of 3∙9 feet and 10∙8 feet
                    diameter respectively (fig. 97 <hi rend="italic">a</hi>). The annular space was
                    divided by two vertical partitions; the doors of communication (which were
                    air-tight) were 1∙8 feet wide and 2∙14 feet high. A small engine worked the
                    hoist by a stuffing-box passing through the shell. A safety-valve is of course
                    required. The upward pressure of the air requires to be counterbalanced by
                    weights. In the Argenteuil bridge this necessary weight was afforded by the
                    masonry built in the tube as the tube sank. This plan seems preferable to the
                    method of loading the shell externally with pig or railway iron. Frequently,
                    owing to the tenacious nature of the soil, the water cannot be driven out below
                    the tube, and in that case a syphon must be provided passing out at the top. The
                    Argenteuil tube was sunk at a mean rate of about 18 inches per diem. This method
                    is not confined to cylindrical tubes. Fig. 98 shows the method employed in
                    building the piers of the bridge at Kehl over the Rhine. In this case four
                    rectangular working chambers were sunk side by side and bolted together; each
                    chamber communicated with the surface by two air-passages, and one central
                    elliptical passage which remained full of water. This central passage served for
                    the exit of the excavated material. A mass of concrete was built resting on the
                    working chambers, and contained by wooden framework. The concrete was added at
                    the top above water as the foundations gradually sank. At Mantes and Chalons
                    wrought iron caissons, shaped like the usual masonry piers, have been sunk by
                    analogous methods.</p>
                <p>The method of sinking cylinders by compressed air was invented by Mr Triger in
                    1841, and was first used on a large scale by Mr Hughes at Rochester. The tubes
                    at this bridge were designed to bo sunk by having the air <hi rend="italic"
                    >exhausted</hi> inside the tube, a system invented by Dr Potts.</p>
                <p>§ 69. <hi rend="italic">Piles</hi> are used either to enclose a space or to bear
                    part of the weight of a structure; for the former purpose a wooden pile may be a
                    round or square pointed piece of timber, 6 or 9 inches in diameter and 8 or 12
                    feet long. Bearing piles may be of any dimensions which can practically be
                    procured, and several lengths of timber are often jointed so as to form one long
                    strut. The point is armed with metal, and the head protected by a metal ring,
                    which prevents it from spreading when struck by the rammer which drives the
                    pile. Bearing piles are usually placed at a distance from centre to centre not
                    less than 2 feet 6</p>
                <p>inches or more than 4 feet; 3 feet is a common distance. The diameter of bearing
                    piles varies from 9 inches to 20 inches; a pile may be considered to be driven
                    homo when, with thirty blows of a ram weighing 800 lb and falling 5 feet, it
                    does not move ⅕th of an inch (Rankine). A French rule gives as a limit ⅙ inch
                    motion with twenty-five blows from a ram weighing 6 cwt. and falling 4 feet 3
                    inches. A pile which does not move more than this will bear from 600 to 1000 lb
                    per square inch. This would give a load of 50 tons for a 13-inch pile; if, as is
                    more usual, the load be only 8 or 10 tons for a 13-inch pile, the ultimate rate
                    of descent may be three, four, or five times as much as the above.</p>
                <p>Piles are used as foundations in those grounds which are compressible, or which
                    would be squeezed out from beneath masonry under the weight to be borne. The
                    wooden bearing piles are usually sawn off so that all the heads may be level,
                    and a wooden grating or platform rests on the heads, over which the concrete or
                    masonry pier may be built; in other cases the piles come up for some distance
                    into the concrete. An external row of wooden piles is not unfrequently employed
                    as a precaution against scour, but these should always be further protected by a
                    stone bank, which will continue to protect the pier if the piles decay. A <pb

                    Guétin.</p>
                <p>Cast-iron guide piles (usually hollow tubes) are used for the same purpose as
                    wooden guide piles. They may be cast with grooves down one edge in which sheet
                    piling is held. Cast-iron and wooden piles are frequently used as part of the
                    open-work metal or wooden framing of piers. In situations where these piles are
                    not liable to injury by ice, floating timber, or barges, this construction is
                    very economical. Fig. 4, Flate XIX. shows the Crumlin viaduct, with piers of
                    this character, the construction of which will be more fully described in
                    paragraph 79</p>
                <p>Fig. 100 shows the Portage bridge (234 feet high) span ning the Genesee River, in
                    the State of New York. The piers are large wooden frames.</p>
                <p>§ 70. <hi rend="italic">Screw piles</hi> are cast-iron piles which are screwed
                    into the soil instead of being driven in. At their end is fixed a blade of
                    cast-iron from two to eight times the diameter of the shaft of the pile; the
                    pitch of the screw varies from one-half to one-fourth of the external diameter
                    of the blade. The pile is turned by levers radiating from its head. In one
                    example of their use (Rankine) the pile was screwed in by four levers, each 40
                    feet in leugth, with eight bullocks harnessed to it. The screws were 4 feet 6
                    inches in diameter, and the working load borne by them was 100 lb per square
                    inch. The piles were screwed from 20 to 45 feet deep in earth.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Disc piles</hi> have been used in sand. These piles had a flat
                    flange at the bottom, and water was pumped in at the top of the pile, which was
                    weighted to prevent it from rising. Sand was thus blown or pumped from below the
                    piles, which were thus easily lowered in ground which had baffled all attempts
                    to drive in piles by blows. In ground which is of the nature of quicksand, piles
                    will often slowly rise to their original position after each blow.</p>
                <p>§ 71. JKe‰—In some soils foundations may be obtained by the device of building a
                    masonry casing like that of a well and excavating the soil inside; the casing
                    gradually sinks and the masonry is continued at the surface. This method is
                    applicable in running sands. The interior of the well is generally filled up
                    with concrete or brick when the required depth has been reached, but in some
                    cases a mere floor or inverted arch would be preferable.</p>

                    gradual progress in the art of construction and illustrate our present practice
                    is one of much difficulty. Many very admirable and interesting structures must
                    necessarily be passed over in silence, and space will not admit of full details
                    being given even of those bridges which are noticed.</p>

                    rend="smallcaps">λ.d.</hi> —Herodotus mentions a bridge erected by Nitocris over
                    the Euphrates at Babylon. It appears to have consisted of stone piers connected
                    by planking, which was removed at night. The river was diverted to allow the
                    piers to be built. Diodorus Siculus ascribes the work to Semiramis.</p>
                <p>The first bridge constructed at Rome was called the <hi rend="italic"

                    Martius, and rebuilt by the chief priests, who from this circumstance were
                    called “Pontifices.” Fig. 101 shows the design of this bridge as restored by

                    the descriptions given in the historians. This was the bridge defended by
                    Horatius Codes.</p>
                <p>Fig. 102, also taken from the work of Colonel Emy, is intended to represent the
                    design of the bridge thrown across</p>
                <p>Danube, just below the rapids of .the Iron Gate, has been the subject of much
                    controversy. The drawing (fig. 105) was originally taken from a bas-relief on
                    the Trajan column at Rome. A description of the bridge is given by the ancient
                    historian Dion Cassius, who states that the bridge had twenty piers of hewn
                    stone, 150 feet high and 60 feet wide, with openings between them of 170 feet,
                    spanned by arches. Doubt has been thrown on the accuracy of this description,
                    because the design shown in fig. 105 is obviously unsuited to a span of 170
                    feet; nevertheless thirteen piers are still visible out of the twenty, according
                    to Murray’s <hi rend="italic">Handbook</hi> The writer has not been able to find
                    any accurate measurement of the width between these piers, but as the <hi

                    of the first bridge is supposed to remain, although it has been altered from
                    time to time. The arches vary in their opening from 51 feet to 79 feet 9 inches;
                    the waterway between the piers is 413 feet 3 inches; tire breadth of the bridge,
                    28 feet 9 inches; these dimensions are given on the authority of Cresy <hi

                    and Clement IX. The largest arch has a span of 62 feet 4 inches, and the width
                    of the bridge is 50 feet 9 inches.</p>

                    observation, in a letter to Montfaucon, gives the total length as probably 3010
                    feet, there can be no doubt that the spans were very considerable, and that the
                    representation of the design in the bas-relief is almost wholly conventional.
                    The one point as to which it gives clear information, not supplied elsewhere, is
                    that the superstructure was of wood. The piers seem to have been founded by
                    sinking caissons. Murray’s <hi rend="italic">Handbook</hi> gives the depth of
                    the river as 18 feet. Apollodorus of Damascus was the architect of this
                    remarkable bridge. The bridge at Rimini, built during the reign of Augustus, was
                    especially admired by Palladio (Rondelet, <hi rend="italic">L’Art de
                    bâtir).</hi> The bridge at Narni, on the road from Loretto to Rome, also built
                    by Augustus (Montfaucon), and the bridge of Alcantara over the Tagus, built in
                    the reign of the Emperor Trajan, are often cited as remarkable works.</p>
                <p>The Romans frequently adorned their bridges with a triumphal arch. A small
                    example of this kind of bridge at St Chamas, in France, is shown in fig. 106
                    (Cresy’s An- <hi rend="italic">cyclopaedia of Civil Engineering).</hi> The span
                    of the arch is 42 feet, and the voussoirs are 3 feet 5 inches deep. Fig. 107
                    shows the bridge of Narses, built in the 6th century, and which carried the Via

                    panic caused by the approach of Garibaldi to Rome in 1867.</p>
                <p>We see here, perhaps, one of the earliest examples of the castle built to protect
                    the bridge against an enemy or to enforce payment of a toll,—the bridge and

                <p>§ 74. 1000 to 1300 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> —A very bold arch over the
                    Serchio near Lucca is shown in plate 58 of Hann and Hosking’s treatise, with the
                    approximate date of 1000 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> but the authority for
                    this date is not given. The span of the arch is 120 feet, and the roadway, which
                    stands at a height of more than 60 feet above the water level, is only 9 feet
                    wide: in fact the arch is little more than a broad present London Bridge, but it
                    seems quite uncertain when the first bridge over the Thames was built. There is
                    little doubt, however, that it was of timber, and had frequently to be
                    reconstructed. Stow, in his <hi rend="italic">Survey of the Cities of London and
                    Westminster,</hi> gives a description of the building of the first stone
                    structure, commonly called Old London Bridge, Plate XVIII. fig. 1.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“About the year 1176 the
                    stone bridge over the river Thames at London was begun to be founded, by the
                    foresaid Peter of Colechurch (called priest and chaplain before), “near unto the
                    bridge of timber, but more towards the west, for I read that Botolph’s wharf was
                    in the Conqueror’s time at the head of London Bridge. The king assisted this
                    work, a cardinal then being legate here; and Richard, archbishop of Canterbury,
                    gave one thousand marks towards the foundation. The course of the river for the
                    time was turned another way about by a trench cast for that purpose beginning,
                    as is supposed, east about Rotherhithe, and ending in the west about
                    Patrick-sey, now termed Battersea. This work, to wit the arches, chapel, and
                    stone bridge over the Thames at London, having been thirty-three years in
                    building, was, in the year 1209, finished by the worthy merchants of
                    London—Serie Mercer, William Almaine, and Benedick Botewrite, principal masters
                    of work; for Peter of Colechurch deceased four years before the work was
                    finished, and was buried in the chapel builded on the same bridge in the year
                    1205.”</p></note></p>
                <p>Heavy repairs were frequently necessary, and the timber houses built on the
                    bridge were often burnt down; yet the main structure appears to have remained
                    unaltered until wall. Owing chiefly to the excellence of the mortar employed,
                    this arch withstood a flood which rose nearly 30 feet above the springing of the
                    arch. This structure is one of the many “Devil’s Bridges.”</p>
                <p>In the year 1178 a famous bridge was begun over the</p>
                <p>Rhone at Avignon by Saint Benezet, the head of one of certain religious
                    confraternities, which undertook the building or repair of bridges during the
                    Middle Ages, and were called Fratres Pontis or Hospitalarii Pontifices. The
                    bridge was finished in 1188. Four arches still remain, and are remarkable in
                    having an elliptical outline with the radius of curvature smaller at the crown
                    than at the haunch, a form which accords more truly with the linear equilibrated
                    arch than the modern flat ellipse with the largest radius at the crown. A
                    description and drawing of this remarkable bridge will be found in the <hi

                <p>A religious confraternity, founded in the first instance by a certain Mary, the
                    maiden daughter of a ferryman, is said to have built a timber bridge near the
                    site of the the beginning of this century. It does not seem improbable that
                    Peter of Colechurch and Saint Benezet may have been in communication with one
                    another, both being heads of religious bodies engaged in similar works at the
                    same time. Their letters to one another would interest engineers. A French

                    stately platforms leaded with rails and ballasters about them, very commodious
                    and pleasant for walking and enjoying so fine a prospect up and down the river,
                    and soιrte had pretty little gardens with arbours.”</p>
                <p>The passage between the houses was made 20 feet; previously it had been but 14
                    feet, and in some parts 12 feet. These beautiful houses were burned in 1066,
                    when they were replaced by a still finer pile of buildings, with a uniform
                    roadway of 20 feet in width. Fig. 108 shows the bridge as it appeared in
                    1700.</p>
                <p>The piers varied in thickness from 25 to 34 feet, and were raised on strong elm
                    piles, covered with thick planks bolted together. The openings in the arches
                    varied from 10 feet to 32 feet 9 inches. The whole waterway was 33G feet 9
                    inches, two-thirds of the stream being occupied by piers.</p>

                    at Croyland (fig. 109) is another example of a bridge probably built for or by a
                    religious body. This structure stands at the confluence of the Welland, the
                    Nyne, and the Catwater drain; three pointed arches, having their abutments at
                    the angles of an equilateral triangle, meet in the middle, giving three
                    watercourses and three roadways. Each arch has three stone ribs, and the nine
                    meet in the centre. Croyland “triangular bridge” is alluded to in a charter of
                    the year 943; from the character of the masonry the present structure is
                    supposed to have been built in the beginning of the 14th century. A bridge over
                    the Trent at Burton, 1534 feet in length, and consisting of 34 arches, was also
                    built by a religious community under Abbot Bernard.</p>
                <p>Fig. 110 shows the old bridge at Saintes as Μ. Viollet-le-Duc considers that it
                    appeared towards the end of the 14th century. The following description is

                <p>“The first gate appeared on the right shore of the river, on the side of the
                    Faubourg des Dames; next came the Roman arch, the upper part of which was
                    crenelated during the Middle Ages; next on the side of the town stood a tower of
                    oval plan, through which the road lay; the town gates with flanking towers
                    closed the end of the bridge. From the first gate to the Roman arch the bridge
                    was of wood, as was also the case between the great tower and the town gates, so
                    that by the removal of this part of the roadway all communication could be cut
                    off between the town and the tower as well as between the bridge and the
                    Faubourg; moreover, the parapets were crenelated, so that the garrison of the
                    town coιild at will stop all navigation.”</p>
                <p>Clearly it was quite as important in those days to be able to arrest as to
                    facilitate communication between the two sides of the river.</p>
                <p>The architects of the Renaissance showed great boldness and originality in their
                    designs. The largest arch known to have been built spanned the Adda at Trezzo,

                    constructed of stones in two courses, the innermost 3∣ feet thick in the

                    the river rises sometimes 13 feet.” The radius of the arch was 133 feet. This

                    construction, and names Grenier and Estone as builders without giving his
                    authority. The design of the bridge appears to favour the date given by Gauthey.

                    statements arc often met with that this bridge was built from a design by Michel

                    span over each main arch of the bridge. The design is remarkably fine. Heck
                    calls it the bridge of Barbaruh, and states that it is named from its builder,
                    but it is of unknown antiquity. All the bridges of Ispahan are said, in the 7th

                    18th century. Their failure after so short a period was due to a defective

                    This was excessive and forced up the crown, the depth of which was very small.
                    This failure led to the adoption of the pierced spandrils.</p>

                    has ever been constructed; the design might be analyzed as consisting of a
                    series of superposed trusses, as in fig. 87, which represents the bridge at
                    Schaffhausen built by the same engineers or village carpenters. The Schaffhausen
                    bridge (fig. 119), destroyed by French troops in 1799, had two openings, one of
                    172 feet and the other 193 feet. The Wittingen bridge, burnt shortly afterwards,

                    spanned by wood.</p>
                <p>Mr Smiles states that the first attempt to build a castiron bridge was made in
                    1755 at Lyons, and that one of the arches was put together in a builder’s yard,
                    but that the project was abandoned as too costly. Mr Abraham</p>

                    London new bridge (fig. 40, <hi rend="italic">supra,</hi> and Plate XVIIL fig.
                    2), is as fine an example of the modern stone arch bridge as can be found. The
                    shape of the arches, the variation in their span, the slight curvature of the
                    roadway, and the simple yet bold architectural details, are combined so as to
                    produce a singularly beautiful structure. It is now insufficiently wide for the
                    traffic it has to convey, but all who value beauty must earnestly desire that it
                    may not be disfigured by having overhanging footpaths fitted to it as has been
                    frequently proposed. London can well afford to pay for new bridges, but can by
                    no means afford to part with a single object of real beauty.</p>
                <p>The design was made by Mr George Rennie, and the acting engineer was his brother,
                    Sir John Rennie. The centre arch has a span of 152 feet, and rises 29 feet 6
                    inches above Trinity high water mark; the arches on each side of the centre have
                    a span of 140 feet, and the abutment arches 130 feet. The total length of the
                    bridge is 1005 feet, its width from outside to outside 56 feet, and height above
                    low water 60 feet. The two centre piers are 24 feet thick, the exterior stones
                    are granite, the interior, half Bramley Fall and half from Painshaw,
                    Derbyshire.</p>
                <p>The voussoirs of the centre arch (all of granite) are 4 feet 9 inches deep at the
                    crown, and increase to not less than 9 feet at the springing. The general depth
                    at which the foundations arc laid is about 29 feet 6 inches below low water.
                    Seven years and a quarter were spent in the construction of London bridge, which
                    was opened in 1831. The total cost was £1,458,311, but the contractor’s tender
                    for the bridge alone was £425,081.</p>
                <p>Waterloo Bridge, Plate XVIII. fig. 3, is another fine structure of the same
                    character (1817).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Introduction of Suspension Bridges.—</hi> It will be observed
                    that from the earliest ages in which we have records Darby, the owner of iron
                    works of Coalbrookdale, was the first person who actually erected a cast-iron
                    arch. This bridge (fig. 120) crosses the Severn by a span of 100 feet, near the
                    town of Ironbridge, which has sprung up in the neighbourhood. Each of the ribs
                    consisted of two pieces. The design is a bold and original one, and has been
                    practically successful. Wearmouth Bridge, completed in 1796, is an arch built of
                    open cast-iron panels, acting as voussoirs; the span is 236 feet, with a rise ol
                    34 feet; the springings begin 95 feet above the bed of the river; and the width
                    of the bridge was 32 feet. It contained 214 tonβ of cast-iron and 46 tons of
                    wrought iron. The name of Thomas Paine, the well-known author, has been
                    associated with the design of this bridge; but Mr L. D. B. Gordon (first
                    Professor of Engineering in Glasgow) assures the writer that after careful
                    investigation he finds that Rowland Burdon, member for the county, was engineer,
                    architect, and paymaster for this remarkable bridge. It was repaired and widened
                    by Robert Stephenson in 1858. The bridge erected by of the construction of
                    permanent bridges until very lately, the stone or brick arch has been the
                    structure principally relied on. Timber bridges more or less permanent have also
                    been employed for great spans, as in the noble bridges erected by the brothers
                    Grubenmann (1757); and after the construction of the bridge at Coalbrookdale
                    (1777) cast-iron was not unfrequently employed in England. The theory of the
                    metal arch was, however, very imperfectly understood, and the great metal arch
                    of Southwark bridge (completed 1819), Plate XVIII. fig. 4 (largest span 240
                    feet), is little more than a heavy and wasteful imitation of a stone ring. By
                    the use of timber or cast-iron instead of stone, the opening which a bridge
                    could span was, however, somewhat increased. An immense stride in this direction
                    was made when suspension bridges were introduced. A bridge of this kind over the
                    Tees, 70 feet in length, was built in 1741 for the use of miners. Similar
                    bridges are also said to have been used by Mr Finley in America, but the
                    introduction of the modern suspension bridge practically dates from about 1820.
                    (Galashiels bridge, 112 feet in length, was constructed in 1816, also a bridge
                    of similar dimensions at Peebles over the Tweed). In 1819 Telford began the
                    construction of the Menai suspension bridge (Plate XIX. fig. 2), in which the
                    span of the catenary is 570 feet and the dip 43 feet. The success of this
                    structure led to the construction of many other large suspension bridges, as at
                    Fribourg (span 870 feet), Hammersmith (span 422 feet), Pesth (span 666 feet).
                    This form of bridge was not, however, found suitable for railway traffic; and on
                    the introduction of railways engineers were for many years dependent on stone,
                    brick, or cast-iron arches.</p>

                    Stephenson of a bridge to carry the Chester and Holyhead Railway across the
                    Menai Straits led to a complete revolution in engineering practice. Mr
                    Stephenson’s first conception was that of a tube partly carried by chains. This
                    would have practically been a suspension bridge stiffened by a girder. Under Mr

                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0382-0335"/>, experiments and calculations on the strength and
                    best form of tubes were made by Mr William Fairbairn (Sir William Fairbairn) aud
                    Mr Eaton Hodgkinson. In the course of the experiments it was found that the tube
                    could be made self-supporting over the desired span of 4G0 feet; and in
                    consequence of this discovery the Conway and Menai tubular bridges were built,
                    being the first great examples of properly designed girders. Some disputes arose
                    as to the real inventor of these bridges. Sir William Fairbairn justly claimed
                    the great merit of first perceiving that the girder might be self-supporting. Mr
                    Hodgkinson had, perhaps, the smallest part in the design, but the shares of
                    Fairbairn and Stephenson respectively cannot be very rigorously apportioned; nor
                    is this now of much conse quence. Both engineers were men of extraordinary
                    merit, and co-operated in producing the great revolution in practice which has
                    led to the adoption of the wrought iron girder as the most common type of
                    bridge. The first train passed through the Britannia Bridge in 1850. The
                    following description of the structure appeared in the 8th edition of the
                    present work. It will be seen that this description is to some extent a defence
                    of the design against criticisms asserting that the structure was unnecessarily
                    heavy and costly. It is true that a considerably lighter bridge could now be
                    built, but some prudence in introducing so great a novelty was certainly
                    commendable.</p>
                <p>“The Britannia Bridge which carries the Chester and Holyhead Railway over the
                    Menai Straits (figs. 122 and 123, and Plate XIX. fig. 1) consists of two
                    independent continuous wrought iron tubular beams, 1511 feet in length, and
                    weighing 4680 tons each, independent of the cast-iron frames inserted at their
                    bearings on the towers. They are 15 feet wide, and vary in depth from 23 feet at
                    the ends to 30 feet at the centre. They rest on two abutments aud three towers
                    of masonry at a height of 100 feet above high water. The roadway is laid along
                    the bottom, viz., one line of rails in each tube. The centre or Britannia tower,
                    which is altogether 230 feet high, is built on a rock in the middle of the
                    Straits. The bridge has thus four spans, viz., two spans of 4G0 feet over the
                    water, and two spans of 230 feet over the land. On each side the weight of a
                    single span of 470 feet is 1587 tons, and of a span of 242 feet G 30 tons. These
                    tubes repose solidly on the centre tower, but repose on roller beds on the land
                    towers and abutments. Now, these gigantic dimensions are by no means the only
                    remarkable features in this work. The opponents of the Holyhead Road had imposed
                    conditions on the Chester and Holyhead Railway which were thought insurmountable
                    with respect to this bridge. The navigation was not to be interrupted—no
                    scaffolding could thus be used—and the clear height of 100 feet was to be
                    retained throughout, - - arches being objected to unless the springing and not
                    the centre was at this elevation. The tides set through this portion of the
                    Strait with a velocity of 9 miles per hour, and the quiet water at each turn of
                    the tide lasts but for a very short space of time. The tubes were designed to
                    meet all these requirements; they were so constructed at a considerable distance
                    from their permanent site on the shores of the Straits; they were floated upon
                    pontoons upon these rapid tides to the base of the towers; and they were then
                    drawn up by hydraulic presses to their required height. They were here united
                    through the towers by the insertion of shorter lengths, and ultimately brought
                    into the condition of continuous beams as regards strain, by the means employed
                    for their junction. It is evident such structures would be designed specially
                    for such varied circumstances, for example :—</p>
                <p>“As soon as they were completed on temporary platforms, these platforms were
                    removed, and they became isolated beams; the ends were accordingly strengthened
                    with cast and wrought iron framing for this special object, and had they always
                    remained there the sides might have been throughout considerably lighter than
                    they are; they now weigh nearly 40 per cent, of the whole weight. But in the
                    next operation, that of floating, the tubes were liable to be supported at <hi
                    rend="italic">any point</hi> of their length, besides being subjected to chances
                    of considerable distortion, and to disasters <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n383/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0383-0336"/> which on more thau one occasion did actually
                    threaten their entire destruction. The stiffening frames and gussets, which in
                    an ordinary girder would have only been necessary at the ends, became therefore
                    necessary throughout the whole length, and even the top and bottom were
                    considerably modified, as it is evident that while overhanging the pontoons on
                    each end to the extent of 70 feet, the top, instead of being in compression was
                    thrown into extension; the λveight of the tubes was consequently much increased
                    by these arrangements. Again, they had to be raised by being suspended freely
                    from four chains. Provision for this suspension from such limited attachment had
                    also to be made of a totally opposite character from that made for their
                    vertical support when on their bed; and, ultimately, when raised to their place,
                    they remained no longer independent beams, but were converted into continuous
                    beams, parts before in tension being now thrown into compression, and <hi
                    rend="italic">vice versa;</hi> while the ends which were before subject to no
                    horizontal strain were now exposed to greater straiu than even the centre of the
                    span. And, last of all, during the act of raising one of these enormous masses,
                    the press the large tubes, for the important purpose of converting them into
                    continuous beams by their overhanging weight. By examining their detail, it will
                    be found they are designed solely for this special purpose, their use as beams
                    being made entirely subsidiary.</p>
                <p>“Some misapprehension exists on the object and importance of the cells of which
                    the top and bottom of these tubes is composed. These cells are rectangular,
                    there being eight of them in the top and six of them in the bottom, and they run
                    throughout the bridge. With respect to their importance, it must be observed
                    that the whole section of the top of the Britannia tube at the centre is 648 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 25 square inches, and of the bottom 585 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 43 square inches, and that the tube is 15 feet wide;
                    the thickness of a single plate to ensure this section would therefore have been
                    2 ’ 7 inches for the top, and 2 ’ 3 inches for the bottom; and had such a plate
                    been procurable, nothing better could have been desired, and the cells would be
                    unnecessary. Such a thing, however, is evidently impossible, and the engineer in
                    this, as in numberless other details, had to adopt what he could obtain; from
                    which it was suspended burst, and one end of the beam fell through a space of no
                    less than 9 inches on to a loose uneven heap of planks beneath it, bulging in
                    the bottom plates, breaking all the castings, distorting seriously the side3 and
                    stiffening frames; while the broken press itself, which descended from a height
                    of about 100 feet above, broke through the top plates and completed the
                    crippling of the whole section of support. It may surely be doubted whether
                    anything but a tube could have stood such unexampled violence; and in
                    proportioning the parts of a structure destined for such usage, the mere
                    consideration of the strain to which as an ordinary beam it would be subjected,
                    formed but a part of the problem; no direct comparison can therefore be made
                    between the weight of this bridge and an ordinary beam. If this were the case
                    with the large spaus, it is still more so with the small spans of 230 feet,
                    which as simple beams would weigh only 230 tons each, whereas their actual
                    weight is G50 tons. But it must be borne in mind that as regards the bridge
                    itself these small spans were not required at all, and that they were merely
                    designed and used as counterpoises for now the arrangement of the plates in
                    cells is almost the only conceivable arrangement possible for obtaining the
                    required section, allowing access, at the same time, to every part for
                    construction and future maintenance. This alone led to their use in the bottom
                    of the tube, where their form was totally unimportant. With respect to the top,
                    however, it was of great importance, since thick plates could not be had, to
                    ascertain the best form of cell for resistance to compression that could be
                    devised with thin plates. A series of valuable experiments by Mr Eaton
                    Hodgkinson led to the use of the rectangular cells as actually used, not because
                    such form presented any peculiar advantage over any other form, as some have
                    imagined, but because these experiments demonstrated that cells of that
                    magnitude and thickness were independent of form, and arc crushed only by the
                    actual crushing of the iron itself; under these circumstances, the square cells
                    were used as the best practical method of obtaining the sectional area
                    required.</p>
                <p>“Similar misapprehension also exists as to the considerations which led to the
                    rectangular form of the tubes <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0384-0337"/> themselves. Now, the result of direct experiments
                    made with round, oval, and rectangular tubes—there being precisely the same
                    section and weight in all three, and, consequently, different depths—was, that
                    the circular tube was the weakest, and the oval tube the strongest, the
                    rectangular form being intermediate. The oval tube was, indeed, first studied
                    with a view to its use. Its form, however, was not favourable,—neither for its
                    actual construction, nor for its connection with the suspension chains which
                    were originally intended to be used in the erection; and practical
                    considerations, in this case, also compelled the use of the rectangular tube. It
                    must also be remarked, that the result of experiments made on round, oval, and
                    -rectangular wrought iron tubes, when reduced to the same depth and compared,
                    was in favour of the rectangular form, although within ordinary limits the form
                    was not proved to be a matter of very great importance. It may be added, that
                    this bridge has now been in use six years, that the deflection has been
                    carefully tested, from time to time, with the utmost precision, and that not the
                    slightest perceptible increase has taken place during that period. The care with
                    which the painting has been attended, and the protection afiorded by the roof,
                    have also entirely preserved it from the slightest damage by oxidation; and it
                    is difficult to conceive that even the lapse of centuries can in any way affect
                    such a structure, or to doubt that it will remain one of the most durable, as it
                    certainly is one of the most remarkable monuments of the enterprise of the
                    present century.”</p>

                    Viaduct.—</hi> The High-Level Bridge at Newcastle (figs. 124 and 125, also Plate
                    XIX. fig. 3) is a fine example of the true bowstring arch, in which there is no
                    cross bracing. This bridge is also described at great length in the 8th edition;
                    but the type cannot be recommended for imitation, being essentially more
                    expensive and heavier than a true girder. The bridge was opened by the Queen in
                    1849. The design was therefore made almost at the same time as that for the
                    Britannia Bridge, and is chiefly interesting as showing a transitional form
                    intermediate between the arch and beam. The bridge has six spans, each of 125
                    feet, and the superstructure is supported on stone piers and abutments, the
                    height to the soffit above high water being 83 feet. The arched ribs are
                    cast-iron, and the ties wrought iron. 4728 tons of cast-iron and 321 tons of
                    wrought iron were employed in the superstructure. There are two roadways, the
                    carriage roadway passing under the railway. The bridge cost £243,000.</p>
                <p>The solid or continuous plate girder soon led to the introduction of open frames,

                    (1851- 53) under the direction of Mr Joseph Cubitt from the designs of Mr
                    Charles Wild.</p>
                <p>This bridge (figs. 126 and 127) consists of four independent girders, viz., two
                    for each line of railway. The roadway is beneath the girder. The top flange of
                    each girder consists of a series of cast-iron pipes butting end to end; the
                    lower flange consists of wrought iron links, and the flanges are connected by
                    diagonals forming a series of equilateral triangles, and these diagonals are
                    alternately struts and ties. The ties are formed of wrought iron; and the struts
                    of castiron: the length of each side of these triangles is 18 feet 6 inches.</p>
                <p>The length between the supports is 259 feet, and the depth from centre to centre
                    of the joint pins is 16 feet. The clear span between the abutments is 240 feet 6
                    inches.</p>
                <p>The weight of iron is 244 tons 10 cwt., of which 106 tons 5 cwt. is wrought iron,

                <p>“It crosses the Niagara River at a height of 245 feet above the water by a single

                <p>“The superstructure may be best described as a hollow rectangular box, 18 feet
                    deep and 24 feet wide, on the top of which the railway is laid, while the
                    bottom, which is 25 feet wide, forms the roadway for public traffic—both these
                    floors are constructed of timber beams; and each connecting side consists of a

                    suspended from two wire cables at intervals of 5 feet, and the lower floor is
                    suspended at similar intervals from two other wire câblée which have a
                    deflection of 10 feet more than the girder; it was erected on the Taff Vale
                    Extension Railway under Messrs Liddell and Gordon as engineers, by Mr T. W.
                    Kennard as contractor. The following description is compiled from that given in
                    Mr Humber’s work:—The length of the bridge is 1800 feet, divided into two parts,
                    one consisting of seven spans of 100 feet, and the other of three similar spans.
                    The greatest height of the road-way between which at the base of the pier
                    measures 13 feet 6 inches, excepting between the centre rows, where it measures
                    6 feet throughout the height. The wrought iron girders are 150 feet in length
                    and 14 feet 6 inches deep. Some details of the construction are shown in fig.
                    128.</p>
                <p>upper ones; these cables, four in number, are each 10 inches in diameter, and
                    composed of seven strands, each containing 520 wires, making a total of 3640
                    wires. One strand forms the axis round which the other six are twisted. Sixty
                    wires are equal to 1 square inch of solid section; therefore the total area of
                    each cable is 60'4 square inches, or the total sectional area of iron supporting
                    the structure is 241'6 square inches.</p>
                <p>“Each cable rests upon a separate saddle, there being two on the top of each of
                    the four towers. The saddles are placed on ten cast-iron rollers, 5 inches
                    diameter and 25∣ inches long, which bear upon cast-iron plates 8 feet ιquare and
                    2∣ inches thick, strengthened by three parallel flanges which form two
                    compartments for the reception of the saddles.</p>
                <p>“The ends of the cables are attached to cast-iron shoes, in each of which is
                    inserted a wrought iron pin which forms the connection with the anchor chains.
                    These anchor chains are each embedded in a solid shaft of masonry 7 feet by 3
                    feet, enlarged at the bottom to form a chamber 8 feet square cut in the rock.
                    The shafts are sunk to a depth of 25 feet on the New York side, and 35 feet on
                    the Canada side.</p>
                <p>“Each anchor chain is composed of nine links, the eight lower links being 7 feet
                    long, and the ninth or uppermost 10 feet long. The lowest link consists of seven
                    wrought iron bars, 7 inches by 1 ’ 4 inches each, and amounting <pb break="no"

                    are secured to a cast-iron anchor plate, by a pin 3∣ inches diameter. From the
                    fourth link the chain curves, and the section is gradually increased to an area
                    of 93 square inches. There are two towers at each end of the bridge, based upon
                    a mass of masonry 60 feet by 20 feet, which is pierced by an arch 19 feet wide,
                    forming the entrance to the lower roadway. The towers are 60 feet high, 15 feet
                    square at the base, and 8 feet square at the top.</p>
                <p>“Above the floors are 64 diagonal stays, extending from the saddles to the
                    suspenders, amongst which they are equally distributed; they are formed of
                    wire-rope l∣th inches diameter. There are also 56 stays attached at their upper
                    extremities to the soffit of the bridge, and at their other ends well anchored
                    to the rocks below. The superstructure is thus tied down as well as suspended,
                    and all undulations directly resisted.</p>
                <p>“The bridge was commenced in September 1852, and opened for traffic in March
                    1855. The total cost was £80,000.”</p>
                <p>The use of two chains of different versed 3ines is certainly a defect in thie

                <p>Illinois bridge over the Mississippi (fig. 5, Plate XVIII.) is the finest example

                    Hartley who visited it in 1873 :—</p>
                <p>“The Mississippi at St Louis is confined to a single channel 1600 feet wide and 8
                    feet deep at extreme low water by an embankment or levee on the Illinois side,
                    which is carried up to the level of extreme high water, at which time the width
                    is augmented to 2200 feet. Both shores are revetted below the low water, some
                    with rabble stones, and protected by the wharf pavements above that line. The
                    extreme range between high and low water is 41 feet. Owing to the narrow gorge
                    through which the whole volume of the Mississippi flows the variations in the
                    bed of the river are very great. Captain James B. Eads, Μ. Inst. C.E., the
                    distinguished engineer</p>
                <p>There are several other suspension bridges in the United States of great span,
                    e.y., Cincinnati, 1057 feet; Brooklyn 1600 feet.</p>

                <p>§ 82. <hi rend="italic">St Louis and Illinois Bridge.—</hi> The St Louis and who
                    designed the bridge and superintended its construction,informed the author that
                    a rise of 13 feet less than high-water mark caused a scour of 18 feet, and that
                    in the freshet of 1870 the scour reached a depth of 51 feet below lew-water mark
                    alongside the east pier. These facts induced him to believe it possible that the
                    scour, at times of extraordinary high flood, might extend even to the rock
                    itself. He therefore determined to establish the piers and abutments on the
                    rock; and this was done by means of caissons provided with air chambers and
                    locks at depths for the east pier and east abutment reaching 136 feet below
                    high-water mark, or 110 feet from the surface of the water where the foundation
                    work was actually performed. This feat, which was satisfactorily executed in
                    1870-71, is quite unprecedented in the annals of engineering.</p>
                <p>The piers and abutments are composed of coursed rabble masonry up to low-water
                    mark. Above this level they are faced <pb break="no"

                <p>The bridge has three spans, each formed with ribbed arches made of cast steel, a
                    novelty in bridge building. The centre span is 520 feet and the side ones 502
                    feet in the clear.</p>
                <p>The rise of the centre arch is 47⅛ feet, that of the side ones I5 feet each.
                    These are by far the largest arched spans in the world, and under the able
                    direction of Colonel Read, Captain Eads’s chief assistant, they are now being
                    rapidly erected gradually from each ρier and abutment without the aid of
                    centering. Each span is composed of four double ribs of steel (well braced
                    together at their relative distances from each other), and the tubes forming
                    them are jointed butt to butt. They are clasped together by wrought iron
                    couplings (which proved to be much better than steel), furnished with parallel
                    grooves corresponding with similar grooves in the tubes. Steel pins, varying
                    from 4⅛ inches to 7 inches in diameter, pass through the centre of the couplings
                    and the ends of the tubes at every joint. The vertical bracing between the upper
                    and the lower tubular ribs, which are 12 feet apart from centre to centre,
                    convert the two members into a single arch.</p>
                <p>At the time of the author’s visit two of the openings were already spanned by the
                    steel tubes, which are all 18 inches in diameter, and 12 feet to 13 feet long,
                    but of thicknesses varying from 1⅛ inches to 2∣ inches.</p>
                <p>The arches are to cany a double railroad track, and above the track a roadway 54
                    feet wide for carriages and foot passengers.”</p>
                <p>The bridge was opened, subsequently to Sir C. Hartley’s visit, on the 4th July
                    1874.</p>
                <p>§ 83. <hi rend="italic">Projected Bridges.—</hi> The Tay Bridge is a railway
                    bridge in course of construction (1876), to form a connection between the town
                    of Dundee and the North British Railway system in Fife, and crosses the Firth of
                    Tay about a mile and a half to the west of Dundee. The length of the bridge
                    exceeds two miles. It will therefore be the longest iron bridge in the world.
                    The following description has been furnished by Mr A. D. Stewart, who assisted
                    the chief engineer, Mr T. Bouch, in the design of the bridge :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Curves.—</hi> Commencing at the south shore, the bridge for the
                    first five spans is on a curve of a quarter of a mile radius. It is then
                    straight for a distance of a mile and a half. At the north shore, between high
                    and low water mark, it describes a curve of a quarter of a mile radius, forming
                    nearly a quarter of a circle towards the town of Dundee.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Gradients.</hi> —The level of the rails at the south end of the
                    bridge is 78 feet above high water. The gradient descends 1 in 100 for the first
                    three spans; it is level for the next two spans; it then ascends 1 to 353
                    towards the centre of ths bridge. Over the navigable part of the river it is
                    level, and the rails are 92 feet above high water, leaving 88 feet for the
                    passage of shipping above high water of spring tides. From this the gradient
                    falls 1 in 73 ⅜ to the end of the bridge.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Spans.—</hi> The portion of the bridge at present being
                    executed extends to 3420 yards. It is intended to add an opening of 120 feet and
                    a number of 27 feet spans at the north end. The magnitude of the several spans
                    in order, commencing at the Fife shore, is as follows:—3 spans of 60 feet, 2 of
                    80 feet, 10 of 120 feet, 12 of 136 feet, 13 of 230 feet, 1 of 150 feet, 11 of
                    120 feet, 25 of 60 feet, 1 of 155 feet, and 6 of 27 feet—the total number of
                    spans being thus 84.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Piers and Foundations.—</hi> The first fourteen piers are
                    founded upon rock, which was generally covered to the depth of a few feet with
                    clay or other soft material. These piers consist of double solid cylinders of
                    brickwork, built with strong Portland cement mortar, connected by a wall of
                    brickwork from low water to the superstructure. Foundations for these piers were
                    obtained by placing caissons or hollow cylinders on their site, excavating
                    within them, and sinking them by forcing out the water by air pressure. These
                    caissons were built on the foreshore on a properly prepared foundation, and
                    lined internally with brickwork to such a height that when fully sunk the
                    brickwork extended above low water. When carried out and placed in position,
                    this brickwork formed part of the permanent pier, and gave weight and stability
                    to the caisson when the water was displaced from the inside. When the whole
                    material above the rock was thus excavated, the working chamber and shaft of the
                    caisson were filled with concrete, put in in a liquid state, and when this
                    solidified the building upwards of the pier was continued. A difficulty arose in
                    keeping the cylinders vertical during the sinking. This was overcome by
                    combining them into a single caisson. Between the fourteenth and fifteenth pier
                    the rock disappears. At the sites of the next six piers the bed consists of a
                    layer of hard material resting on silt. It is proposed to pile these piers from
                    an outside staging within an oval-shaped wrought iron caisson. After the piles
                    are driven, their heads are to be surrounded with concrete, the water is then to
                    be pumped out of the caisson, and brickwork to be built up to the level of about
                    5 feet above high water. The upper portions of these, and of all the piers to
                    the north of them, are to consist of cast-iron columns braced together.</p>
                <p>From the twenty-second pier northwards the bed of the river consists of sand,
                    with occasional layers of coarse gravel and boulders. It was, however, necessary
                    to modify the designs for the piers, and the method of founding and building
                    them, according to the load each had to carry.</p>
                <p>For the 120 and 136 feet spans there are eighteen piers. For each pier two
                    wrought iron caissons are prepared, partly cylindrical and partly conical in
                    shape, and having a base of 15 feet. These are built on the fore-shore, and
                    lined with brickwork; they are then floated out by means of pontoons having
                    hydraulic machinery for lowering: when they have been sunk in their proper place
                    until they take a bearing in the sand, the pontoons are removed, and by means of
                    sand-pumps the mateπal from the interior is removed and they sink by their own
                    weight. During the operation of sinking, rings of wrought iron and brickwork are
                    added to the top of the caisson, and stones are laid round the outside to fill
                    the void caused by the scour and pumping. When a sufficient depth has been
                    obtained the pumps are removed, and the interior is filled with liquid concrete;
                    and when this has solidified, the brickwork is continued to above high
                    water.</p>
                <p>For the 230 feet spans, large wrought iron caissons of a cylindrical form, 31
                    feet in diameter, are erected on the fore-shore, one for each pier, and lined
                    with brickwork to the height which it is intended to sink them in the sand. The
                    upper and temporary portion of the caisson, of the same diameter as the under,
                    but with no lining of brickwork, is placed on the top of the lower part and
                    bolted securely to it. The compound caisson is floated out and sunk, as above
                    described, by means of sand-pumps, and the permanent portion of the caisson is
                    filled with concrete. The temporary portion is then unbolted by divers, and
                    removed for further use. From the surface of the ground to above low water, the
                    pier consists of a brick ovalshaped lrollow cylinder, which is built on the
                    fore-shore on girders; and when it has thoroughly set, it is also floated out
                    and lowered on the concrete foundation. The interior of this brick pier is then
                    filled with concrete, and the building of the brickwork is continued to above
                    high water as tidal work.</p>
                <p>For the 60 feet spans towards the north end of the bridge, the piers consist of
                    three braced cast-iron columns placed in a row across the bridge, the western
                    column having a rake or batter of 1 in 3. Every fourth pier is double. Some of
                    these were sunk as screw piles, others were founded in 6 feet cylinders,
                    previously sunk by sand-pumps, and filled with concrete.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Superstructure.—</hi> The superstructure consists wholly of
                    wrought iron girders. With the exception of two spans which have girders of the
                    bowstring form, they have the top and bottom members straight and parallel. The
                    bracing is of the double lattice form, crossing nearly at right angles, and from
                    the point of intersection a vertical support is carried to the member on which
                    the cross-girder or beam rests. The girders for the 230 feet spans, and the
                    bowstring girders, have wrought iron cross girders resting on, and rivetted to,
                    the lower member on which the roadway is placed. All the others have timber
                    cross-beams resting on and rivetted to the top flange, and the roadway is above
                    these girders. They are sent to the Tay built in convenient pieces for shipment,
                    and rivetted together on jetties prepared near the shore. They are then floated
                    out and raised to their places by machineιy suited to their respective weights.
                    They are generally continuous in groups of four consecutive spans. In order to
                    make continuity perfect, the further end of each girder is raised through a
                    certain calculated height before rivetting it to the next.</p>
                <p>Montreal papers state that a bridge 15,500 feet in length is about to be
                    constructed over the St Lawrence at Montreal, from the designs of Mr Legge. It
                    will have one span of between 500 and 600 feet, and 60 smaller spans, with a
                    height of 130 feet above the water at high tide. The estimated cost is
                    £800,000.</p>
