                    a distinguished scholar and historian of Greek philosophy, was born on 13th
                    February 1790 at Hildesheim. His father, a physician of some distinction, held
                    for a time a professorship at the university of Kiel. His education was begun at
                    the gymnasia of Holzminden and Kiel, and in 1806" he entered the university of
                    the latter town. His attention was soon drawn from theology, in the study of
                    which he was then engaged, to philosophy, particularly to Plato. In 1809 he
                    accepted the post of private tutor in the family [of Count Adam Moltke at
                    Nütschau, and there became acquainted with Niebuhr, whose noble character made a
                    deep impression on him. In 1812 he graduated at the university of Copenhagen,
                    and presented as his thesis “Commentationes Eleaticae,” a careful collection of
                    thefragments of Xenophanes, Parmenides, and Melissus. Two years later he
                    attended the university of Gottingen, and in 1815 presented as his inaugural
                    dissertation at Berlin an essay <hi rend="italic">On the Idea of the History of
                    Philosophy (</hi><hi rend="italic">Von dem Begriff der Geschichte der
                    Philosophie).</hi> In 1816 he had the offer of an extraordinary professorship at
                    Heidelberg, but preferred to accompany Niebuhr to Italy. Six years were spent in
                    examination of the principal libraries, and Brandis began the labours on
                    Aristotle which were to occupy many years of his life. In 1821 he was made
                    professor of philosophy in the newly founded university of Bonn, and in 1823
                    appeared his edition of the <hi rend="italic">Metaphysics</hi> of Aristotle <hi
                    rend="italic">(Aristotelis</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Theophrasti</hi><hi rend="italic">Metaphy</hi><hi rend="italic">sied).</hi> To
                    this was added in 1837 a second part, <hi rend="italic">Scholia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Groeca</hi><hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Aristotelis</hi><hi rend="italic">Metaphysica.</hi> He became part editor,
                    along with Boeckh and Niebuhr, of the new classical journal <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rheinisches</hi><hi rend="italic">Museum·,</hi> and contributed largely to it.
                    His articles on Socrates (1827, 1829) are particularly deserving of notice. In
                    1835 appeared the first part of his great work, <hi rend="italic">Handbuch der
                    Geschichte der Griechisch-röm.</hi><hi rend="italic">Phil.,</hi> and in 1836 the

                    >Aristotelem,</hi> forming the 4th volume of the Berlin edition of Aristotle.
                    The following three years were spent in Greece, whither he had gone as
                    instructor to the young king Otho. Some of his experiences in Greece were
                    published in 1843 <hi rend="italic">(Mittheilungen über</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >lG</hi><hi rend="italic">riechenland).</hi> The remainder of his Hfe was
                    devoted to his history of Greek philosophy, the last part of which was published
                    in 1866, little more than a year before his death, which took place on the 24th
                    July 1867.</p>
                <p>Brandis’s great work, that by which he will be best remembered, appeared at
                    intervale from 1835 to 1866, and altogether fills six volumes. It is
                    characterized generally by great extent of reading, sound judgment, and critical
                    examination of authorities. But it is to some extent defective in speculative
                    insight and in power of exposition. The history for the most part is moulded too
                    rigidly on the work of the author under consideration, and the whole course of
                    exposition follows the order of the author’s thought. Thus in many cases it is
                    apt to degenerate into what is little more than a running commentary or summary
                    of the original text. This is particularly noticeable in the portions on Plato
                    and Aristotle. There is no attempt made to bring together information from all
                    quarters and to work the whole into an organic unity. A comparison of the work
                    of Brandis with that of Zeller would bring out the contrast between the two
                    methods. At the same time the <hi rend="italic">Handbuch</hi> will always retain
                    a high value, even by the side of Zeller’s later work, and its best portion,
                    that on Aristotle, is perhaps as complete and accurate an account as can be
                    desired. That Brandis himself felt the defects of his own method of history is
                    shown by the fact that he threw the whole matter of his larger treatise into a
                    smaller and more systematic form, the very title of which, <hi rend="italic"
                    >History of the Developments of Greek Philosophy</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(Geschichte der Entwickelungen der Griechischen Philosophie,</hi> 2 vols., in
                    three parts, 1862, 1864, 1866), indicates the change made. This smaller work is
                    decidedly one of the best and completest histories of Greek thought in
                    existence.</p>
