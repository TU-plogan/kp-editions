                <p><label type="entry">BURY</label>, a manufacturing town and parliamentary borough
                    of England, in the county of Lancaster, on the Irwell, 8 miles N.N.W. of
                    Manchester. The woollen-trade, introduced in the 14th century, and of such
                    importance in the reign of Elizabeth that she appointed an officer to stamp the
                    cloth, still gives employment to 1000 of the population, but it has been greatly
                    surpassed in extent by the cotton manufacture, which with its various branches
                    gave employment in 1872 to 16,256 men and women of the age of twenty years or
                    upwards. The auxiliary and supplemental trades of engine-making, spindle-making,
                    calico-printing, bleaching, and dyeing are also largely carried on; the paper
                    manufacture employs about 600 people; upwards of 1000 miners find work in the
                    neighbouring coal-pits; 1200 workmen are engaged in the iron manufacture, and
                    nearly 200 in the stone quarries. The town has been not only greatly extended
                    but also greatly improved since the middle of the century; it is well drained,
                    and has a good supply of water. It contains a town-hall, an athen∞um (including
                    a museum), a free grammar school, founded by the Rev. Roger Kay, a mechanics’
                    institute, and several public libraries. The parish church of St Mary’s was
                    rebuilt in 1776. The government, which was at one time in the hands of three
                    constables, appointed by the earl of Derby, the lord of the manor, was
                    afterwards entrusted to a board of commissioners under a local Act; but the town
                    has applied for municipal incorporation. Bury is a place of considerable
                    antiquity, and w as formerly the seat of a baronial castle, which was destroyed
                    by the Parliamentary forces in 1644. Sir Robert Peel was born at Chamber Hall in
                    the neighbourhood, and his father did much for the prosperity of the town by the
                    establishment of extensive printworks. A monument to the statesman now adorns
                    the market-place. The parliamentary borough, which comprises the townships of
                    Bury and Elton, has returned one member to Parliament since the Reform Bill of
                    1832. Its population in 1871 was 41,344, of whom 19,849 were males, and 21,495
                    females; the inhabited houses numbered 8279, and the registered electors
                    5518.</p>
