                    haunt, an end came to the race in 1832; on the wolds of Yorkshire about 1826, or
                    perhaps a little later; and on those of Lincolnshire about the same time. Of
                    Wiltshire, Montagu, writing in 1813, says that none had been seen in their
                    favourite haunts on Salisbury Plain for the last two or three years. In
                    Dorsetshire there is no evidence of an indigenous example having occurred since
                    that date, nor in Hampshire nor Sussex within the present century. From other
                    English counties, as Cambridgeshire, Hertfordshire, and Berkshire, it
                    disappeared without note being taken of the event, and the direct cause or
                    causes of its extermination can only be inferred from what, on testimony cited
                    by Mr Stevenson <hi rend="italic">(Birds of Norfolk,</hi> ii. pp. 1-42), is
                    known to have led to the same result in Norfolk and Suffolk. In the latter the
                    extension of plantations rendered the country unfitted for a bird whose shy
                    nature could not brook the growth of covert that might shelter a foe, and in the
                    former the introduction of improved agricultural implements, notably the
                    corn-drill and the horse-hoe, led to the discovery and generally the destruction
                    of every nest, for the bird’s chosen breeding-place was in wide fields—“brecks,”
                    as they are locally called,—of winter-corn. Since the extirpation of the native
                    race the Bustard is known to Great Britain only by occasional wanderers,
                    straying most likely from the open country of Champagne or Saxony, and occurring
                    in one part or another of the United Kingdom some two or three times every three
                    or four years, and chiefly in midwinter.</p>
                <p>An adult male will measure nearly four feet from the tip of the bill to the end
                    of the tail, and its wings have an expanse of eight feet or more,—its weight
                    varying (possibly through age) from 22 to 32 pounds. This last was that of one
                    which occurred to the younger Naumann, the best biographer of the bird <hi
                    rend="italic">(Vögel Deutschlands,</hi> vii. p. 12), who, however, stated in
                    1834 that he was assured of the former existence of examples which had attained
                    the mass of 35 or 38 pounds. The female is considerably smaller. Compared with
                    most other birds frequenting open places the Bustard has disproportionately
                    short legs, yet the bulk of its body renders it a conspicuous and stately
                    object, and when on the wing, to which it readily takes, its flight is not
                    inferior in majesty to that of an Eagle. The bill is of moderate length, but,
                    owing to the exceedingly flat head of the bird, appears longer than it really
                    is. The neck, especially of the male in the breeding-season, is thick, and the
                    tail, in the same sex at that time of year, is generally carried in an upright
                    position, being, however, in the paroxysms of courtship turned forwards, while
                    the head and neck are simultaneously reverted along the back, the wings are
                    lowered, and their shorter feathers erected. In this posture, which has been
                    admirably portrayed by Mr Wolf <hi rend="italic">(Zool. Sketches,</hi> pl. 45),
                    the bird presents a very strange appearance, for the tail, head, and neck are
                    almost buried amid the upstanding feathers before named, and the breasts are
                    protruded to a remarkable extent. The Bustard is of a pale grey on the neck and
                    white beneath, but the back is beautifully barred with russet and black, while
                    in the male a band of deep tawny-brown—in some examples approaching a
                    claret-colour—descends from either shoulder and forms a broad gorget on the
                    breast. The secondaries and greater wing-coverts are white, contrasting vividly,
                    as the bird flies, with the black primaries. Both sexes have the ear-coverts
                    somewhat elongated— whence doubtless is derived the name <hi rend="italic"
                    >Otis</hi> (Gr. ώτις)—and the male is adorned with a tuft of long, white,
                    bristly plumes, springing from each side of the base of the mandible. The food
                    of the Bustard consists of almost any of the plants natural to the open country
                    it loves, but in winter it will readily forage on those which are grown by man,
                    and especially coleseed and similar green crops. To this vegetable diet much
                    animal matter is added when occasion offers, and from an earth-worm to a
                    field-mouse little that lives and moves seems to come amiss to its appetite.</p>
                <p>Though not many birds have had more written about them than the Bustard, much
                    remains to be determined with regard to its economy. A moot point, which will
                    most likely always remain undecided, is whether the British race was migratory
                    or not, though that such is the habit of the species in most parts of the
                    European continent is beyond dispute. Equally uncertain as yet is the question
                    whether it is polygamous or not—the evidence being perhaps in favour of its
                    having that nature. But one of the most singular properties of the bird is the
                    presence in some of the fully-grown males of a pouch or gular sack, opening
                    under the tongue. This extraordinary feature, first discovered by James Douglas,
                    a Scotch physician, and made known by Albin in 1740, though its existence was
                    hinted by Sir Thomas Browne sixty years before, if not by the Emperor Frederick
                    II., has been found wanting in examples that, from the exhibition of all the
                    outward marks of virility, were believed to be thoroughly mature; and as to its
                    function and mode of development judgment had best be suspended, with the
                    understanding that the old supposition of its serving as a receptacle whence the
                    bird might supply itself or its companions with water in dry places must be
                    deemed to be wholly untenable. The structure of this pouch—the existence of
                    which in some examples has been well established,—is, however, variable; <hi
                    rend="superscript"> l</hi> It may be open to doubt whether <hi rend="italic"
                    >tarda</hi> is here an adjective. Several of the mediaeval naturalists used it
                    as a substantive.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n640/mode/1up"

                <p>and though there is reason to believe that in one form or another it is more or
                    less common to several exotic species of the family <hi rend="italic"
                    >Otididoe,</hi> it would seem to be as inconstant in its occurrence as iu its
                    capacity. As might be expected, this remarkable feature has attracted a good
                    deal of attention <hi rend="italic">(Journ.</hi><hi rend="italic">für</hi><hi

                    latest investigator of the matter, shew that in an example of the Australian
                    Bustard <hi rend="italic">(Otis australis)</hi> examined by him there was,
                    instead of a pouch or sack, simply a highly dilated oesophagus—the distention of
                    which, at the bird’s will, produced much the same appearance and effect as that
                    of the undoubted sack found at times in the <hi rend="italic">0. tarda.</hi></p>
                <p>The distribution of the Bustards is confined to the Old World—the bird so called
                    in the Fur-Countries of North America, and thus giving its name to a lake,
                    river, and cape, being the Canada Goose <hi rend="italic">(Bernicla

                    of, the British Islands. Two species, known indifferently by the name of
                    IIoubara (derived from the Arabic), frequent the more southern portions of the
                    Region, and one of them, <hi rend="italic">0. macqueeni,</hi> though having the
                    more eastern range and reaching India, has several times occurred in
                    North-western Europe, and once even in England. In the east of Siberia the place
                    of <hi rend="italic">0. tarda</hi> is taken by the nearly-allied, but apparently
                    distinct, <hi rend="italic">0. dybovskii,</hi> which would seem to occur also in
                    Northern China. Africa is the chief stronghold of the family, nearly a score of
                    well-marked species being peculiar to that continent, all of which have been by
                    later systematists separated from the genus <hi rend="italic">Otis.</hi> India,
                    too, has three peculiar species, the smaller of which are there known as
                    Floricans, and, like some of their African and one of their European cousins,
                    are remarkable for the ornamental plumage they assume at the breeding-season.
                    Neither in Madagascar nor in the Malay Archipelago is there any form of this
                    family, but Australia possesses one large species already named. From Xenophon’s
                    days <hi rend="italic">(Anab.</hi> i. 5) to our own, the flesh of Bustards has
                    been esteemed as of the highest flavour. The Bustard has long been .protected by
                    the game-laws in Great Britain, but, as will have been seen, to little purpose.
                    A few attempts have been made to reinstate it as a denizen of this country, but
                    none on any scale that would ensure success. Many of the older authors
                    considered the Bustards allied to the Ostrich, a most mistaken view, their
                    affinity pointing apparently towards the Cranes in one direction and the Plovers
                    in another. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. n.)</hi></p>
