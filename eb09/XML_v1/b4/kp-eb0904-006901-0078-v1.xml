                <p><label type="entry">BOSSI, <hi rend="smallcaps">Giuseppe</hi></label>, an Italian
                    painter and writer on art, was born at the village of Busto Arsizio in the
                    Milanese, in 1776 or 1777 He was educated at the college of Monza; and his early
                    fondness for drawing was fostered by the director of the college, who supplied
                    him with prints after the works of Agostino Carracci for copies. Passing next to
                    the academy of Brera at Milan, he there pursued his special artistic studies,
                    and about 1795 went to Rome. Here he studied for five or six years, associating
                    with many artists of the Italian school, and especially forming an intimate
                    friendship with Canova. On his return to Milan he was named assistant secretary
                    of the Academy of Fine Arts, and on the death of Bianconi succeeded him in the
                    office of secretary. He rendered important service in the organization of this
                    new institution. In 1804, in conjunction with Oriani, he drew up the rules of
                    the three academies of art of Bologna, Venice, and Milan, and soon after was
                    rewarded with the decoration of the Iron Crown. On the occasion of the visit of
                    Napoleon I. to Milan in 1805, Bυssi exhibited a drawing of the Last Judgment of
                    Michael Angelo, and pictures representing Aurora and</p>
                <p>Night, (Edipus and Creon, and the Italian Parnassus. By command of Prince Eugene,
                    viceroy of Italy, Bossi undertook to make a copy of the Last Supper of Leonardo,
                    then almost obliterated, for the purpose of getting it rendered in mosaic. The
                    drawing was made from the remains of the original with the aid of copies and the
                    best prints. The mosaic was executed by Raffaelli, and was placed in the
                    Imperial Gallery of Vienna. Bossi made another copy in oil, which was placed in
                    the museum of Brera. This museum owed to him a fine collection of casts of great
                    works of sculpture acquired at Paris, Rome, and Florence. Bossi devoted a large
                    part of his life to the study of the works of Leonardo; and his last work was a
                    series of drawings in monochrome representing incidents in the life of that
                    great master. He left unfinished a large cartoon in black chalk of the Dead
                    Christ in the bosom of Mary, with John and the Magdalene. In 1810 he published a
                    special work in large quarto, entitled <hi rend="italic">Del Cenacolo di
                    Leonardo da Vinci,</hi> which had the merit of greatly interesting Goethe. His
                    other works are <hi rend="italic">Delie Opinioni</hi><hi rend="italic">di
                    Leonardo intorno alia simmetria de' corpi umani</hi> (1811), and <hi
                    rend="italic">Del Tipodell' arte della pittura</hi> (1816). Bossi died at Milan,
                    December 15, 1816. A monument by Canova was erected to his memory in the
                    Ambrosian library, and a bust was placed in the Brera.</p>
