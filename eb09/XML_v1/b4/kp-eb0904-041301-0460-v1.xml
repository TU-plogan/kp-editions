                    (1791—1868), fifteenth President of the United Stateβ, was born in Franklin
                    County, Pennsylvania. His father, of the same name, was an Irishman who had
                    eight years before emigrated from Donegal, and had become a well-to-do farmer.
                    The son completed his education at Dickinson College, Carlisle, and took his
                    degree in 1809. He then applied himself to the study of the law, was admitted to
                    the bar in 1812, and settled at Lancaster in Pennsylvania. Notwithstanding his
                    youth he soon gained considerable reputation, and with it a large and growing
                    practice. In 1812 he joined a party of volunteers who, under the command of
                    Judge Shippen, marched to the defence of Baltimore against the British; but
                    their services were not wanted. He was at this time a zealous federalist. In
                    1814 he was elected member of the State Legislature, and constantly recommended
                    the vigorous prosecution of the war. He was re-elected the following year; and
                    in 1820 he became a member of Congress. Among his important early speeches were
                    those on a deficiency in the military appropriation, in January 1822; on the
                    bankrupt law, in March following, when he successfully opposed its extension to
                    all citizens whether traders or not; and on the tariff question, on which he
                    maintained that duties ought to be levied for revenue only. He uttered grave
                    warnings against forming alliances with Mexico and the South American Republics,
                    the condition of which was not calculated to inspire hopefulness, and insisted
                    on the immense importance of Cuba, both commercially and strategically, to the
                    United States. In 1828 he supported General Jackson at the Presidential
                    election, and was at the same time re-elected to Congress. In the following year
                    he succeeded Daniel Webster as head of the judiciary committee, and in this
                    capacity conducted the trial on impeachment of Judge Peck,—one of the <hi

                    jurisprudence. On completing his fifth term, Buchanan retired from Congress
                    (1831), and the next year was appointed envoy extraordinary and minister
                    plenipotentiary to St Petersburg. His mission is marked by the negotiation of
                    the first treaty of commerce between the United States and Russia,—a treaty by
                    which important privileges in the Baltic and the Black Sea were secured to the
                    former. On his return from Russia he was elected United States senator; and he
                    retained his seat till 1845. In the great struggle between President Jackson and
                    the party headed by Mr Calhoun, Buchanan warmly defended the president and his
                    claims. In the first years of the movement against slavery, he saw the large
                    results which were likely to follow, and desired to suppress the agitation in
                    its infancy, and this by suppressing the discussion of the subject in Congress.
                    He advocated the recognition by Congress of the independence of Texas, and at a
                    later time its annexation. During the presidency of Van Buren, Buchanan greatly
                    distinguished himself in support of the principal measure of the Government—the
                    establishment of an independent treasury. In 1845 he was appointed Secretary of
                    State under President Polk; and at the close of his term of office in 1849 he
                    retired into private life. But four years later he accepted from President
                    Pierce the post of United States Minister to Great Britain. In 1854 he was the
                    originator and one of the three members of the Ostend Conference on the subject
                    of the acquisition of Cuba by the United States, and with hi3 colleagues
                    maintained that, on the principle of self-preservation from dangers of the
                    gravest kind, an armed intervention of the United States and the capture of the
                    island from the Spaniards would be justifiable. He returned from England in
                    1856, and the same year w as elected, as Democratic candidate, to the
                    Presidential chair. For a short time there seemed to be ground for hope that
                    political passions and excitement would subside. But this hope was soon found to
                    be fallacious. The troubles in Kansas and the large questions involved in them
                    gave rise to new discussions and division. The president gave his support to the
                    pro-slavery party, and dissensions grew during his administration to such an
                    extent that disruption and war between North and South followed the election of
                    his successor, President Lincoln. From the close of his administration in 1860
                    till his death, Buchanan led a retired life. He died at Wheat-land in
                    Pennsylvania, June 1, 1868. Two years before his death he published an account
                    of his administration.</p>
