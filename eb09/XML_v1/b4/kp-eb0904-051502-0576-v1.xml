                <p><label type="entry">BUKOWINA</label>., a duchy and crown-land of the Austrian
                    empire, bounded on the N. and N.W. by Galicia, W. by Hungary and Transylvania,
                    S. by Moldavia, and E. by Moldavia and Russia. It has an area of 4036 English
                    square miles, and the population in 1869 amounted to 511,964, of whom 255,919
                    were males and 256,045 females. The country, especially in its southern parts,
                    is largely occupied by offshoots of the Carpathian mountains. Its northern
                    border is skirted by the Dniester, and a considerable section is drained by the
                    Pruth, but by far the larger portion belongs to the system of the Danube, and is
                    watered by the head streams of the Sereth, the Moldava, and the Bistritza. The
                    climate is healthy but severe, especially in winter; and the soil, particularly
                    in the north, is of great fertility. A large part of the surface, —according to
                    official statistics in 1870, no less than 1,050,849 acres, or nearly one-half of
                    the whole,—is occupied by woodland; and the very name of the country is derived
                    from the abundance of beech-trees. Wheat, rye, oats, maize, barley, beans,
                    potatoes, flax, and hemp are all more or less cultivated; and about 643,319
                    acres of arable land are under tillage. Gardens and meadows occupy 301,706
                    acres, vineyards 11, and pasture 290,531. In 1870 the number of horses in the
                    duchy was 42,649, cattle 224,424, sheep 217,913, goats 18,786, and swine
                    133,385, while the bee stocks amounted to no fewer than 27,091. The mineral
                    productions comprise copper, iron, lead, silver, coal, salt, sulphur, and
                    alabaster, some of which, however, are only yielded in very moderate quantities.
                    In 1870 the iron ore obtained amounted to 5808 tons, the copper to 945, and the
                    salt 2590. The principal mineral springs are at Dorna-Watra, Jakobeny, and
                    Lopuszna, but none of them as yet are much frequented. The country is divided
                    into the eight districts of Czernowitz, Kimpolung, Kotzmann, Radautz, Sereth,
                    Storozynec, Suczawa, and Wisznitz, the capital Czernowitz forming a separate and
                    ninth division. There are seven towns in all, eight market-villages, and 456
                    hamlets, the most populous places being Czernowitz with 33,884 of a population,
                    Radautz 9429, Suczawa 7450, Sereth 6486, Kuszusmare 6419, and Kimpolung 5561.
                    Industrial activity is still comparatively slight, the most important
                    establishments being the breweries, of which there were fifteen in 1870, and the
                    distilleries, which numbered forty-nine. The population is of various origin,—
                    about 180,000 being Roumanians, 200,000 Ruthenians, and the rest Germans, Poles,
                    Jews, Hungarians, <hi rend="italic">&amp;</hi> c <hi rend="italic">.</hi> The
                    German language alone is used in twenty-one of the village schools, and
                    Roumanian in forty-nine, while in many both are in use. In 1869 there were
                    376,946 adherents of the Greek church, 74,347 Catholics, 11,393 Protestants, and
                    47,772 Jews, the total population amounting to 511,964, while in 1857 it was
                    only 456,920. The Bukowina diet consists by the law of 1861 of thirty members,
                    including, besides the bishop, ten appointed by the landed proprietors, seven by
                    the towns, and twelve by the rural communes. Five members are sent to the
                    imperial diet. Originally a part of Transylvania, Bukowina, passed in 1482 to
                    Moldavia, and in 1775 to Austria, who united it in 1786 as the Czernowitz circle
                    with Galicia, but in 1849 raised it to its present independence.</p>
