                    >Brüssel),</hi> capital of Belgium and of the province of South Brabant, is
                    situated on the small River Senne, about 50 miles from the sea, in 50° 5Γ N.
                    lat., 4° 22' E. long. It lies in the midst of a beautiful and fertile country,
                    and is picturesquely built on the top and sides of a hill, which slopes down to
                    the Senne. The general contour of the old town of Brussels is pentagonal, and is
                    well defined by the boulevards, which occupy the site of the old fortifications;
                    but extensive additions have been made, especially to the east and south, and
                    present a very irregular outline</p>
                <p>Brussels may be considered to consist of two parts, each presenting
                    characteristics peculiar to itself. The New Town or upper part of the city is
                    dry and healthy, and contains a very large number of handsome buildings, both
                    public and private. The lower part is the more ancient and interesting of the
                    two, but is damp, and in summer unhealthy, from the exhalations of the river and
                    the numerous canals. In the former are situated nearly all the public offices,
                    the royal palace, the chamber of deputies, the residence of the foreign
                    representatives, and the principal hotels. The latter contains the Hôtel de
                    Ville, and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n452/mode/1up"

                    architecture, and is the seat of nearly all the trade and commerce of the town.
                    The facilities for commerce are very considerable. Though the Senne is not
                    navigable itself, and is in fact now (1876) in process of being arched over to
                    afford room for a new boulevard, it supplies water to some of the canals that
                    intersect the lower portion of the city. By these canals Brussels communicates
                    with the great Belgian cities, Mechlin, Ghent, Bruges, and Antwerp on the north,
                    and Charleroi on the south. It further enjoys the advantage of railway
                    communication with France and Germany, and the chief towns of the Belgian
                    dominions. The streets are for the most part well paved, well lighted, and
                    abundantly supplied with excellent water. There are largest are the Place du
                    Grand Sablon, the Place Royale, and the Grande Place before the Hôtel de Ville.
                    In the last-named square, surrounded for the most part with houses that date
                    from the time of the Spanish possession, the Counts Egmont and Horn were
                    beheaded in 1568, by order of the duke of Alva, who surveyed the scene from the
                    windows of the Brood-Huys (otherwise Maison du Roi), a remarkable specimen of
                    Gothic architecture still extant. In the Place de la Monnaie are the mint, the
                    exchange, and the great theatre. In the Place des Martyrs, the heroes who fell
                    in the Revolution of 1830 are interred. In front of the palace is the Public
                    Park, a fashionable summer promenade, which covers an area of about 14 acres. It
                    is beautifully laid out with walks, adorned at moderate distances with groups of
                    sculpture; and as it is planted with tree3 which shade it from the sun, the
                    grass is in the town innumerable fountains, some of which are handsomely
                    ornamented with sculptures in stone and bronze. Of these the best are <hi
                    rend="italic">Les Fontaines</hi><hi rend="italic">des Fleuves</hi> in the Hôtel
                    de Ville, <hi rend="italic">La Fontaine</hi><hi rend="italic">de Minerve</hi> in
                    one of the great squares, and the <hi rend="italic">Mannekin-pis</hi> behind the
                    Hôtel de Ville. Some of the streets are macadamized, but the majority of them
                    are causewayed, while the <hi rend="italic">trottoirs</hi> are either flagged or
                    paved with flint-stones. In the new town some of the streets are remarkably
                    handsome; they contain a considerable number of shops and cafés similar to those
                    of Paris, and form the chief promenades of the inhabitants. In the old town they
                    are for the most part narrow and sombre. There are fourteen squares in Brussels,
                    many of which are used as market-places. Of these the always fresh and green. In
                    the lower town is the Allée Verte, an equally fashionable promenade, which runs
                    parallel with the Mechlin canal, having a triple row of linden trees on each
                    side, and leads towards the village of I.acken, where, since 1815, the king has
                    had a suburban castle. »</p>
                <p>Of the public buildings of Brussels the most remarkable are the cathedral church
                    of St Michel et Ste Gudule, the Hotel de Ville, and the Palace of Justice, a
                    modern erection. The cathedral was built in 1010, and in it was held the first
                    chapter of the order of the Golden Fleece in 1535. It contains a remarkable
                    pulpit, and some splendid specimens of stained glass. From its towers a fine
                    view of the surrounding country may be obtained. The Hôtel de Ville, built in
                    1400, is profusely ornamented; it has a tower 360 feet in height. The other
                    public buildings of Brussels are for the most part handsome, tut are quite <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0453-0406"/> uninteresting. The principal hospitals are those
                    of St Peter and St John, which are both admirably managed, and contain together
                    about 1000 beds. The patients are waited upon by the sisters of charity. As in
                    all the large Belgian towns, there is, besides two other nunneries, a convent of
                    Beguins, which formerly numbered 1000 nuns. The mass of the native population
                    are Catholics; but as the English residents are very numerous, there are several
                    Protestant churches. The Jews have a synagogue at Brussels, and hold their grand
                    consistory there.</p>
                <p>The number of charities in Brussels is very great; of these the most important
                    are the Foundling Hospital, the Orphan Asylum, and the Société Philanthropique,
                    whose object is to prevent mendicity. There are besides numerous alms-houses,
                    which annually give relief to about 35,000 persons. Some of these establishments
                    are supported entirely by subscription; others of them are subsidized by
                    Government. Great attention is paid to the education of poor children. The
                    communal expense for public instruction amounted in 1873 to 858,150 francs.
                    Among the educational establishments are the gymnasium, the polytechnic school,
                    the Royal Athenaeum, a Lancasterian school, and many public and private
                    academies, besides the Free University, which was founded in 1834 by a company
                    belonging to the liberal party. The number of students at the university
                    amounted in 1874 to nearly 580; while at the Royal Athenaeum the number in the
                    same year was 772. There is also a well-conducted veterinary and agricultural
                    school.</p>
                <p>Some of the societies of Brussels are very celebrated. The Royal Conservatorium
                    of Music had 529 pupils on its roll in 1874. The Royal Society was founded in
                    1769. The geographical establishment of Vandermaelen, instituted in 1830, is in
                    a flourishing condition. The botanical garden is one of the best in Europe, and
                    there is also a large zoological garden. The Palais de l’industrie contains an
                    admirable museum of natural history, and an extensive and valuable collection of
                    books and manuscripts, which is accessible to the public. The number of books is
                    234,000, of which 2000 belong to the' 15th century, while the manuscript
                    department, known as the <hi rend="italic">Bibliothèque</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >de</hi><hi rend="italic">Bourgogne,</hi> contains about 22,000 MSS., many of
                    which are beautifully illuminated. From sixty to sixty-five thousand francs are
                    annually voted for the maintenance of the library. Eminent literary men and
                    others are sometimes allowed to take books home, but the number to whom this
                    privilege is conceded never exceeds 100 annually. There are numerous printing
                    and lithographic presses in constant operation in Brussels, a large number of
                    the former being engaged in the republication of standard works that appear in
                    France.</p>
                <p>The principal manufactures of Brussels are those of lace and tulle, carpets,
                    woollen, linen, and cotton fabrics, jewellery, and articles of vertu. The most
                    remarkable of these is that of lace. The finer sorts of flax used in the
                    manufacture cost from £12 to £16 sterling per lb. An English yard of this-lace
                    costs £8. The persons who spin the thread work in rooms almost completely
                    darkened, and are thus compelled to concentrate their attention; and the thread
                    spun in this way is said to be finer and more delicate than any that has
                    hitherto been produced by other means. Excellent carriages are made in Brussels
                    two-thirds cheaper than those of England, but inferior to them in quality.</p>
                <p>In 1837, the population of Brussels was 104,265; in 1846, 123,874; in 1849,
                    138,189; in 1850, 142,289; and in 1873, 180,172. At the last date there were
                    365,404 in the nine contiguous communes. In 1846, the houses in the town
                    numbered 13,563, and in 1866, 18,543.</p>
                <p>The history of Brussels, though it does not date from so remote a period as that
                    of other Flemish cities, can still be clearly traced back to the 7th century. At
                    that time St Gery, bishop of Cambray, built a chapel on one of the small islands
                    in the river, and by his eloquence and piety soon attracted a large
                    congregation. The site being well adapted for building, a hamlet soon sprung up,
                    and speedily became a town, which in the 11 th century was walled in and
                    fortified. Though in commercial importance Brussels did not at this time equal
                    Ghent or Bruges, its traffic in cloth was very considerable, and its workers in
                    iron and steel were not surpassed by any in Europe. In the 14th century the
                    various trades were incorporated into guilds, who regulated the taxes and other
                    financial matters of the city, and drew up a code of municipal laws, in which
                    the principle of trial by jury was admitted. These arrangements had scarcely
                    been completed, when a dreadful fire visited the city and nearly burnt it to the
                    ground. At the end of this century a general persecution of the Jews in Europe
                    took place. In Brussels, many of them were put to death, and the value of the
                    confiscated property amounted to upwards of half a million sterling. At the
                    beginning of the 15 th century, Brussels was again visited by a destructive
                    fire, from the effects of which it speedily recovered by the patriotic exertions
                    of its rulers, and soon became more distinguished than ever as a seat of
                    learning, art, and science. In 1489, and again in 1587, it was visited by the
                    plague, which, on the former of these occasions, carried off many thousands of
                    the inhabitants. Its horrors were enhanced by the ensuing famine, which lasted
                    for four years.</p>
                <p>Brussels was highly favoured by Charles V., who often resided in the city, and
                    raised it to the rank of capital of the Netherlands. Under his son Philip II. it
                    became the centre of the great revolutionary movement, which resulted in the
                    independence of the United Province. In 1598 Brussels passed into the dominion
                    of the Austrians, and soon began once more to prosper. In 1695 the French under
                    Marshal Villeroy besieged Brussels, but were obliged to retire after doing much
                    damage to the town; and in 1706 the city opened its gates to Marlborough. In
                    1746 it was again besieged by the French under Marshal Saxe, and after a siege
                    of three weeks was obliged to surrender. In 1792 it fell into the hands of
                    General Dumouriez, who being soon after defeated at Louvain, evacuated Brussels
                    for a while, but again enteredit in 1794. From that year till 1814, it remained
                    in the possession of the French, as capital of the department of the Dyle. On
                    the fall of Napoleon, Belgium and Holland were united into one kingdom under
                    William of Nassau, and Brussels was the seat of government alternately with the
                    Hague. In 1830, however, after a sanguinary conflict of four days in the streets
                    of the city, the Belgians declared their independence; and erecting their state
                    into a separate kingdom, offered the crown to Leopold of Saxe-Coburg, whose long
                    and peaceful reign (1831-1865) contributed greatly to the development of the
                    resources of the country.</p>
