                    (1805-1841), a traveller in Central Asia, was born at Montrose in 1805. While
                    serving in India, in the army of the East India Company, which he had joined in
                    his seventeenth year, he made himself acquainted with Hindostani and Persian,
                    and thus obtained an appointment as interpreter at Surat in 1822. Transferred to
                    Cutch in 1826 as assistant to the political agent, he turned his attention more
                    particularly to the history and geography of North-Western India and the
                    adjacent countries, which at that time were very imperfectly known. His proposal
                    in 1829 to undertake a journey of exploration through the valley of the Indus
                    was not carried out owing to political apprehensions; but in 1831 he was sent to
                    Lahore with a present of horses from King William to the Rajah Rungit Sing, and
                    took advantage of the opportunity for extensive investigations. In the following
                    years his travels were extended through Afghanistan, across the Hindu Kush to
                    Bokhara ar.d Persia. The narrative which he published on his visit to England in
                    1834 added immensely to our knowledge of the countries traversed, and was one of
                    the most popular books of the time. The first edition brought the author the sum
                    of £800, and his services were recognized not only by the Royal Geographical
                    Society of London, but also by that of Paris. Soon after his return to India in
                    1835 he was appointed to the court of Sindh to secure a treaty for the
                    navigation of the Indus; and in 1836 he undertook a political mission to Dost
                    Mohammed at Cabul. On tho restoration of Shah Shujah in. 1839, he became regular
                    political agent at Cabul, and remained there till his assassination in 1841
                    (November 2), during the heat of an insurrection. The calmness with which he
                    continued at his post, long after the imminence of his danger was apparent,
                    gives an heroic colouring to the close of an honourable and devoted life. A
                    narrative of his later labours was published in 1842 under the title of <hi
