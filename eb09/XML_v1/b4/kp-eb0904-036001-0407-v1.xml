                <p><label type="entry">BROKER</label>, a word derived variously from the French <hi
                    rend="italic">broier,</hi> to grind, and <hi rend="italic">brocarder,</hi> to

                <p>A broker is an agent or intermediate person appointed for transacting special
                    business on account of another, but differing somewhat from an ordinary factor
                    in functions and responsibility. Of this class there are various descriptions,
                    exercising employment without the smallest analogy, though all are brought under
                    the general name of brokers: of these the principal are—exchange brokers, whose
                    province is to ascertain the rates and relation of exchange between countries;
                    stock-brokers, who negotiate transactions in the public funds; insurance
                    brokers, who effect insurances on lives or property; and pawnbrokers, who
                    advance money on goods, on the condition of being allowed to sell the goods if
                    the sum advanced is not repaid with interest within a limited time. See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Agent</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Insurance.</hi></p>
                <p>Separating pawnbrokers, and those dealers in old wares who are called brokers, as
                    both distinct from the class to whom the term in its broader acceptation
                    applies, the broker is an agent for both parties, the buyer and the seller; and
                    for the general principles of jurisprudence applicable to his position,
                    reference may be made to the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Agent.</hi> It is a
                    marked peculiarity, however, of the broker as an agent, that his quality of
                    agency is not only palpable in the face of the transactions, but he is agent for
                    both parties. The function of the broker is indeed a very simple one, and easily
                    separates itself from the usual intricacies of the law of sale and of agency. It
                    is his proper function to find buyers and sellers, and to bring them together
                    that they may transact with each other. Hence the rise of such a class in any
                    department of business is an indication of its great increase. In small towns,
                    and in narrow and peculiar departments of business, the buyers and the sellers
                    know each other, and need not be at the expense of employing a third party. But
                    where both bodies are numerous, and the individual members of each find enough
                    to occupy their attention in the production of their commodity, or its purchase
                    and distribution, there is economy in the establishment of a distinct class who
                    bring the buyer and the seller together. The broker usually gives what are
                    called bought and sold notes to his clients, and some nice questions have arisen
                    as to the effect of these when they do not correspond with each other or with
                    the entry in the broker’s books. The amount of broker’s commission is in some
                    few cases fixed by statute,— <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> under 10 Anne c. 19, §
                    120, a fine of £20 is imposed on brokers charging more than 2s. 9d. per cent,
                    for buying or selling tallies, exchequer tickets, bank bills, &amp;c. Generally
                    it is settled by agreement with the principals or by the custom of trade. The
                    brokers for the purchase and sale of goods within the city of London are a body
                    with peculiar privileges, and acting under special licensing regulations, some
                    of which date back to the reign of Henry VIII. The London Brokers’ Relief Act
                    (1870) has considerably altered their position, but they must still be admitted
                    by the court of mayor and aldeιmen, and the penalty of £100 for acting as a
                    broker without qualification may still be imposed. A list of London brokers is
                    kept by the mayor and aidermen; and if a broker has been convicted of felony or
                    fraud, or certified by a superior judge to have been guilty of fraud, he may be
                    absolutely or for a time disqualified. There has been some doubt as to the class
                    of persons falling under these regulations; ship-brokers and auctioneers, it
                    would appear, do not.</p>
