                <p><label type="entry">BULL, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label>, a distinguished
                    English composer and organist, was born in Somersetshire about 1563. In 1591 he
                    was appointed organist in the Queen’s chapel in succession to Blitheman, from
                    whom he had received his musical education; in 1592 he received his degree of
                    doctor of music at Cambridge University; and in 1596 he was made music professor
                    at Gresham College, London. As he was unable to lecture in Latin according to
                    the foundation-rules of that college, the executors of Sir Thomas Gresham made a
                    dispensation in his favour by permitting him to lecture in English. He gave his
                    first lecture on 6th October 1597. He afterwards visited France and Germany, and
                    was everywhere received with the respect due to his talents. The story told by
                    Anthony Wood of Dr Bull’s feat at St Omer, which consisted in adding, within a
                    few hours, forty parts to a composition already written in forty parts, is
                    simply impossible. Honourable employments were offered to him by various
                    Continental princes; but he declined them, and returned to England, where he was
                    appointed organist to James I. in 1607, and in the same year resigned his
                    Gresham professorship. In 1613 he again went to the Continent on account of his
                    health; and, in the Netherlands, entered into the service of the archduke. In
                    1617 he was appointed organist to the cathedral of Nôtre Damo <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n579/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0579-0518"/> at Antwerp, and lie died in that city on the 12th
                    March 1628. The usual statement that he died at an earlier date at Hamburg or
                    Lübeck is incorrect. Little of his music has been published, and the opinions of
                    critics differ much as to its merits. A claim made on his behalf to the
                    composition of the music of the English national anthem has given rise to much
                    discussion, but it seems now generally agreed that the claim is not well
                    founded. Contemporary writers speak in the highest terms of Bulbs skill as a
                    performer on the organ and the virginals.</p>
