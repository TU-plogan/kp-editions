                    rend="smallcaps">Thrush),</hi> tried to get over it by proposing to erect an
                    intermediate Family for the <hi rend="smallcaps">Wheatear</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(q.v.)</hi> and some similar forms, under the name <hi rend="italic"
                    >Saxicolidae.</hi> In truth the difficulty was thereby doubled, for, if it was
                    before hard to distinguish between <hi rend="italic">Sylviidae</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Turdidae,</hi> it has since become harder to distinguish on the
                    one hand between <hi rend="italic">Sylviidae</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Saxicolidae,</hi> and on the other between <hi rend="italic">Saxicolidae</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Turdidae.</hi> The confusion thus caused is chiefly due to
                    the adoption in a more or less modified form of the views put forth by Sundevall
                    in 1872, and revised by him in 1874 <hi rend="italic">(cf.</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Ornithology,</hi> vol. xviii. p. 38). For him, however, it is
                    to be said that he at least proceeded in a fashion that had long been
                    recognized, and gave reasons, whether good or bad, for the system he propounded;
                    but his imitators have omitted so obvious a requirement, and leave to any one
                    who would use their results the task of discovering how they have been reached.
                    Hence it has been suggested that some of the alterations introduced since
                    Sundevall's time have been purely arbitrary, if indeed they did not proceed from
                    considerations of personal convenience, or occasionally even through mischance.
                    Still the greatest allowance must be made for those who attempt to reduce to
                    order such a multitudinous assemblage of forms—forms which present an almost
                    endless variety of small differentiating characters, pointing in numerous
                    directions—while the essential structure of all is apparently so similar that at
                    present there is no hope of assistance from the anatomist or the morphologist.
                    But the affinity, seeming or real, to the <hi rend="italic">Turdidae</hi> does
                    not offer the only difficulty. The resemblance which some other forms, often
                    placed with the <hi rend="italic">Sylviidae,</hi> bear to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Timeliidae</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>These
                    are exotic birds, having no recognized English name. Those of “Babblers,”
                    “Bush-Babblers,” and “Babbling-Thrushes” have been applied to them by some
                    writers, who consider them to be sufficiently characterized by their short,

                    >Crateropodidae</hi> of some systematists—is equally if not more puzzling. It is
                    admitted by many systematists that the <hi rend="italic">Timeliidae</hi> form a
                    group that has been made a “refuge for the destitute,” a group into which genera
                    and species that were troublesome to classify have been thrust; and, as a
                    natural consequence, the limits of such a “Family” or group have scarcely been
                    plausibly defined.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    so-called <hi rend="italic">Timeliidae</hi> lead off to other groups, as the <hi
                    rend="italic">Laniidae (cf .</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Shrike)</hi> and what not,
                    aud their existence as a separate “Family” can hardly be taken for a certainty.
                    Again, a small group of birds, almost wholly peculiar to the Australian region,
                    have been sometimes separated as <hi rend="italic">Maluridae,</hi> and of these
                    more must be said presently. Lastly, there are certain genera that, though
                    formerly included without hesitation among the <hi rend="italic">Sylviidae,</hi>
                    have lately been designated “Fly-catchers,” on grounds, however, that have not
                    been explained.</p>
                <p>To deal with this theme in satisfactory detail would require far more space than
                    can here be allowed, for the failures of later systematists would have to be
                    shewn by a series of minute criticisms of a kind that would be only acceptable
                    to specialists, and hardly understood by others than experts. All things then
                    considered, it would seem to be best for our present purpose to regard the
                    “Warblers”—without pledging our faith to the recognition of a “Family” <hi
                    rend="italic">Sylviidae—</hi> from the point of view which obtained before the
                    more recent and perplexing (because ill-defined) opinions were introduced, and
                    that aspect is afforded by the scheme furnished by Canon Tristram to Mr Wallace,
                    and by him adopted in his <hi rend="italic">Geographical Distribution of
                    Animals</hi> (ii. pp. 257-260); but our limits will only allow us to touch upon
                    a few of the most prominent members in addition to those which have already been
                    or will form the subject of separate articles. In this sense then the first that
                    may be mentioned are those forming a group of more or less aquatic habit,
                    usually called <hi rend="italic">Calamoheripinae</hi> but more correctly <hi
                    rend="italic">Acrocepha-linae,</hi> the commonest of which in England is the
                    well-knowm Sedgebird or Sedge-Warbler, <hi rend="italic">Acrocephalus
                    schoenobaenus,</hi> whose chattering song resounds in summer-time from almost
                    every wet ditch in most parts of Britain. As is the case with so many of its
                    allies, the skulking habits of the bird cause it to be far more often heard than
                    seen; but, with a little patience, it may be generally observed flitting about
                    the uppermost twigs of the bushes it frequents, and its mottled back and the
                    yellowish-white streak over its eye serve to distinguish it from its ally the
                    Reed-Wren or Reed-Warbler, <hi rend="italic">A. streperus,</hi> which is clad in
                    a wholly mouse-coloured suit. But this last can also be recognized by its
                    different song, and comparatively seldom does it stray from the reed-beds which
                    are its favourite <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n390/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0390-0367"/> haunts. In them generally it builds one of the
                    most beautiful of nests, made of the seed-branches of the reed and long grass,
                    wound horizontally round and round so as to include in its substance the living
                    stems of three or four reeds, between which it is suspended at a convenient
                    height above the water, and the structure is so deep that the eggs do not roll
                    out when its props are shaken by the wind. Of very similar habits is the
                    Reed-Thrush or Great Reed-Warbler, <hi rend="italic">A. arundinaceus,</hi> a
                    loud-voiced species, abundant on the Continent but very rarely straying to
                    England. Much interest also attaches to the species known as Savi’s Warbler, <hi
                    rend="italic">A. luscinioides,</hi> which was only recognized as a constant
                    inhabitant of the Fendistrict of England a few years before its haunts were
                    destroyed by drainage. The last example known to have been obtained in this
                    country was killed in 1856. The nest of this species is peculiar, placed on the
                    ground and formed of the blades of a species of <hi rend="italic">Glyceria</hi>
                    so skilfully entwined as to be a very permanent structure, and it is a curious
                    fact that its nests were well known to the sedgecutters of the district which it
                    most frequented, as those of a bird with which they were unacquainted, long
                    before the builder was recognized by naturalists. In coloration the bird
                    somewhat resembles a Nightingale (whence its specific name), and its song
                    differs from that of any of those before mentioned, being a long smooth trill,
                    pitched higher but possessing more tone than that of the Grasshopper-Warbler,
                    <hi rend="italic">A. naevius—</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Salicaria
                    locustella</hi> of many authors — which is a widely-distributed species
                    throughout the British Isles, not only limited to marshy sites, but affecting
                    also dry soils, inhabiting indifferently many kinds of places where there is
                    tangled and thick herbage, heather, or brushwood. In those parts of England
                    where it was formerly most abundant it was known as the Reeler or Reel-bird,
                    from its song resembling the whirring noise of the reel at one time used by the
                    spinners of wool. The precise determination of this bird—the Grasshopper Lark,
                    as it was long called in books, though its notes if once heard can never be
                    mistaken for those of a grasshopper or cricket, and it has no affinity to the
                    Larks—as an English species is due to the discernment of Gilbert White in 1768.
                    In its habits it is one of the most retiring of birds, keeping in the closest
                    shelter, so that it may be within a very short distance of an eager naturalist
                    without his being able to see it,—the olive-colour, streaked with dark brown, of
                    its upper plumage helping to make it invisible. The nest is very artfully
                    concealed in the thickest herbage. The foreign forms of Aquatic Warblers are far
                    too numerous to be here mentioned.</p>
                <p>In the scheme already mentioned, a Subfamily <hi rend="italic">Drymoecinae,</hi>
                    with 15 genera and nearly 200 species, is recognized. That such a natural group
                    may exist is quite likely, but about its composition and limits much doubt
                    cannot fail to be entertained. If its existence be acknowledged, the remarkable
                    genera <hi rend="italic">Orthοtomus</hi> with about 12 aud <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cisticola</hi> with some 30 species may be fairly admitted as belonging to it.
                    The former includes the Tailor-birds of the Indian region of w'hich all have
                    heard or read, for their habit of sewing together the leaves of plants so as to
                    form a cone in which to build their nests has often been described and the
                    fabric figured. Jerdon <hi rend="italic">(B. India,</hi> ir. p. 166) writes of
                    the common Indian Tailor-bird, <hi rend="italic">O. longicauda,</hi> that it
                    “makes its nest of cotton, wool, and various other soft materials,” and “draws
                    together one leaf or more, generally two leaves, on each side of the nest, and
                    stitches them together with cotton, either woven by itself, or cotton thread
                    picked up; and, after passing the thread through the leaf, it makes a knot at
                    the end to fix it.” <hi rend="italic">Cisticola,</hi> of which one species
                    inhabits the south of Europe, follows the same trade on stems of grass,
                    confining them by stitches above the nest, which assumes a globular form.</p>
                <p>In the same group <hi rend="italic">Drymoecinae</hi> is placed by some authors
                    the Australian genus <hi rend="italic">Malurus,</hi> to which belong the birds
                    known as “Superb Warblers,” and they are not inaptly so named, since in beauty
                    they surpass any others of their presumed allies. Part of the plumage of the
                    cocks in breeding-dress is generally some shade of intense blue, and is so
                    glossy as to resemble enamel, while black, white, chestnut, or scarlet, as well
                    as green and lilac, are also present in one species or another, so as to
                    heighten the effect. But, as already stated, there are systematists who would
                    raise this genus, which contains some 15 species, to the rank of a distinct
                    Family, though on what grounds it is hard to say.</p>
                <p>Of the other Subfamilies, <hi rend="italic">Saxicolinae, Sylviinae,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Phylloscopinae,</hi> will be conveniently treated under <hi

                    >Wren</hi><hi rend="italic">(qq</hi>. v.), while the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ruticillinae</hi> have been already mentioned under <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Nightingale, Redbreast,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Redstart,</hi> and the
                    <hi rend="italic">Accentorinae</hi> under [Hedge-] <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Sparrow.</hi></p>
                <p>The birds known as “American Warblers,” forming what has now for a long while
                    been almost universally recognized as a distinct Family, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mniotiltidae,</hi> remain for consideration. They possess but nine instead of
                    ten primaries, and are peculiar to the New World. More than 130 species have
                    been described, and these have been grouped in 20 genera or more, of which
                    members of all but three are at least summer-visitants to North America. As a
                    whole they are much more brightly coloured than the <hi rend="italic">Sylviidae
                    (Malurus,</hi> if it belongs to them, always excepted); for, though the
                    particular genus <hi rend="italic">Mniotilta</hi> (from which, as the fortune of
                    nomenclature will have it, the Family takes its right name)<note anchored="true"

                    the most abnormal—its colours being plain black and white, and its habits rather

                    genus <hi rend="italic">Dendroeca,</hi> the name of “Golden” Warblers. In the

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Mniotiltidae</hi> contain forms exhibiting quite as many
