                <p><label type="entry">WARRANTY</label> is etymologically another form of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Guarantee</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.).</hi> It is used,
                    however, in a rather different sense. The sense common to both words is that of
                    a collateral contract, under which responsibility for an act is incurred, and
                    for the breach of which an action for damages lies. Warranty generally expresses
                    the responsibility of the person doing the act, guarantee the responsibility of
                    some other person on his behalf. A warranty may be defined, in the words of Lord
                    Abinger, as “an express or implied statement of something which the party
                    undertakes shall be part of the contract, and, though part of the contract,
                    collateral to the express object of it” (Chanter <hi rend="italic">v.</hi>
                    Hopkins, 4 <hi rend="italic">Meeson and Welsby’s Reports,</hi> 404). It differs
                    from a condition in that a condition forms the basis of the contract and a
                    breach of it discharges from the contract, and from a representation in that the
                    latter does not affect the contract unless made a part of it expressly or by
                    implication, as in contracts of insurance and other contracts <hi rend="italic"
                    >uberrimae fidei,</hi> or unless it be fraudulent. These distinctions are not
                    always accurately maintained. Thus in 8 and 9 Vict. c. 106, § 4, condition seems
                    to be used for warranty.</p>
                <p>Warranty as it affected the law of real estate was, up to half a century ago, a
                    matter of the highest importance. A warranty in a conveyance was a covenant real
                    annexed to an estate of freehold, and either expressed in a clause of warranty
                    or implied in cases where a feudal relation might exist between feoffor and
                    feoffee. The warranty, as described by Littleton, § 697, was an outgrowth of
                    feudalism, and something very like it is to be found in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Liber Feudorum.</hi> At the time of Glanvill the heir was bound to warrant the
                    reasonable donations of his ancestor. Warranty was one of the elements in
                    Bracton’s definition of homage, 78 <hi rend="italic">b</hi>, “juris vinculum quo
                    quis astringitur ad warrantizandum defendendum et acquietandum tenentem suum in
                    seisina versus omnes.” For an express warranty the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >warrantizo</hi> or warrant was necessary. The word “give” implied a warranty,
                    as did an exchange and certain kinds of partition. In order to bind heirs a
                    clause of warranty was required. This was either lineal, collateral, or
                    commencing by disseisin. The differences between the three kinds were very
                    technical, and depended on abstruse and obsolete <pb break="no"

                    works on real property, especially Coke upon Littleton by Butler, 364 <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi>. The feoffor or his heirs were bound by voucher to warranty
                    or judgment in a writ of <hi rend="italic">warrantia chartae</hi> to yield other
                    lands to the feoffee in case of the eviction of the latter. Vouching to warranty
                    was a part of the old fictitious proceedings in a common recovery in use for the
                    purpose of barring an entail before the Fines and Recoveries Act (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Entail).</hi> Warranty of this nature, as far as it relates to
                    the conveyance of real estate, though not actually abolished in all possible
                    cases, is now superseded by covenants for title. The more usual of these are now
                    by the Conveyancing Act, 1881, deemed to be implied in conveyances (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Real Estate).</hi> For the implied warranties of title and
                    quality see <hi rend="smallcaps">Sale.</hi> Vouching to warranty was at one time
                    important in the law of personalty as well as of realty. The procedure is fully
                    described in Glanvill. The right of calling on the holder of lost or stolen
                    goods to vouch to warranty (<hi rend="italic">interciare), i.e.,</hi> to give up
                    the name of the person from whom he received them, under pain of forfeiture, was
                    often granted under the name of <hi rend="italic">theam</hi> as a local
                    franchise (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Theft).</hi> Warranty, as it exists at
                    present in the law of personalty, is either express or implied. There is no
                    general rule as to what constitutes a warranty. It is not necessary that an
                    express warranty should be in writing, the law being that every affirmation at
                    the time of sale of personal chattels is a warranty, provided that it appears to
                    have been so intended. The principal cases of implied warranty occur in the
                    contracts of sale and <hi rend="smallcaps">Insurance (</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >q.v.).</hi> There is also an implied warranty in other kinds of contract, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g., of</hi> seaworthiness by the shipowner in a contract between
                    him and a charterer for the hire of a ship. In all cases of implied warranty the
                    warranty may be excluded by the special terms of the contract. For breach of
                    warranty an action may be brought directly, or the breach may be used as ground
                    for a counter claim or for reduction of damages, but the breach will not in the
                    case of a warranty proper entitle the person suffering by it to a rescission of
                    the contract. Thus in a sale the property passes although the warranty be
                    broken. In some cases warranties on sale are the subject of statutory
                    enactments. By the Merchandise Marks Act, 1887, a vendor is deemed to warrant
                    that the trade mark or trade description on any goods sold is genuine. The Chain
                    Cables and Anchors Act, 1874, enacts that every contract for the sale of a chain
                    cable shall (in the absence of any stipulation to the contrary) imply a warranty
                    that the cable has been duly tested and stamped. In some other Acts, such as the
                    Bills of Exchange Act, 1882, the term warranty does not occur, but the practical
                    effect is the same.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Scotland.—</hi> The term corresponding to warranty in the law
                    of heritable property is “warrandice.” Warranty, strictly speaking, seems
                    confined to movables. Warrandice appears early in Scots law, the heir by <hi
                    rend="italic">Regiam Majestatem</hi> being bound to warrant the reasonable
                    donations of his ancestor. Warrandice in the existing law is either real or
                    personal. Real warrandice is that whereby warrandice lands are made over, as
                    indemnity for those conveyed, to assure the person to whom they were conveyed
                    from loss by the appearance of a superior title. Real warrandice is implied in
                    excambion. Its effect is that the excamber, in case of eviction, may recover
                    possession of his original lands. This is not in accordance with the English law
                    in exchange. Personal warrandice is either express or implied. There is an
                    implied warrandice in every onerous deed, and an absolute warrandice presumes an
                    onerous consideration. Express warrandice is either simple, against the future
                    acts of the vendor, from fact and deed, against acts whether past or future, or
                    absolute, or against all deadly, that is, on any ground existing before the
                    sale. A clause of warrandice is the Scottish equivalent of the English covenants
                    for title. By 32 and 33 Vict. c. 116 a clause of warrandice in the form given in
                    the schedule to the Act imports absolute warrandice as regards the lands and the
                    title-deeds thereof, and warrandice from fact and deed as regards the rents. For
                    the warranty in the sale of movables see <hi rend="smallcaps">Sale.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">United States.—</hi> Warranty in conveyances of real estate is
                    expressly abolished by statute in many States. In some States warranty is
                    implied on the transfer and indorsement of negotiable instruments. ( J. W†.
