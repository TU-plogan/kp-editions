                    swelling and throbbing pain. In the simplest form, apt to occur in sickly
                    children, the inflammation results in a whitish vesicle of the skin, containing
                    watery or bloody fluid. In all such cases, where the deeper structures are not
                    implicated, no radical local treatment is needed, although the illness is an
                    indication for constitutional treatment. The affection is not usually spoken of
                    as whitlow unless it involves the deeper structures of the last joint of the
                    finger. These are in a peculiarly close relation to the surface; hence the
                    liability to deep-seated formations of matter, from some slight scratch or prick
                    (poisoned or otherwise) of the skin over the pulp of the finger, or even when
                    there is no obvious external provocation. The intimate connexion of the surface
                    with the deep structures is near the finger-tip; in that region there are
                    certain regular bundles of strong fibres passing from the under layers of the
                    skin, through the fat of the finger pulp, down to the free end of the bone,
                    which is roughened and expanded in a very peculiar manner for their insertion.
                    These fibres, which are proper to adults, serve to convey an inflammatory
                    infection from the skin down to the bone, or to the periosteum or covering of
                    the bone, and to the tendon (of the deep flexor muscle of the finger) inserted
                    into that part of the last joint of the finger next to the hand. The peculiar
                    danger of a whitlow is that, if it be not opened in time by a deep cut down to
                    the bone along the middle line of the phalanx, the inflammation will attack the
                    covering of the bone, and so produce mortification or necrosis of the latter,
                    and then attack the insertion of the tendon, causing sloughing of it also. In
                    this way a whitlow, which has been neglected or treated by temporizing and
                    ineffective methods, often leads to a loss of the bony tip of the last
                    finger-joint, or even of the whole of the joint, and to a proportionate
                    shortening and deformity of the finger. In another class of cases, which are
                    fortunately less common, the deep-seated inflammation travels along the various
                    structures of the finger towards the palm of the hand. The inflammation extends
                    inside the dense fibrous tunnel or sheath which contains and binds down both
                    tendons upon the middle and proximal joints of the finger. In that confined
                    space the inflammation becomes peculiarly virulent: the tension of the part
                    gives the pain a bursting character; the redness and swelling extend all round
                    the fingers and to the back of the hand and wrist; and the result of all this
                    suppuration and sloughing may be rigidity and contraction of the fingers and
                    hand. Whenever matter burrows in this way, the treatment must be by free
                    incisions. In all cases of whitlow the general disturbance of health is
                    excessive.</p>
                <p>The general treatment of all whitlow inflammations consists at the outset in
                    relief of a congested state of the system, where such exists, by a purge and by
                    a restricted diet, in applying poultices or hot compresses to the affected
                    finger, and in carrying the arm in a sling. The presence of matter will not be
                    obvious by the ordinary signs of a gathering; attempts to let out the matter by
                    anything short of a free and deep incision are likely to fail and to cause the
                    loss of more or less of tue bone.</p>
                <p>Whitlows have sometimes been observed to occur among a number of persons
                    together, in a sort of epidemic, especially where the individuals are all
                    subject to the same conditions of living, as among troops in garrison. These
                    epidemics usually occur at a season (probably the spring) when erysipelas,
                    carbuncles, and boils are prevalent.</p>
