                <p><label type="entry">WHITE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Gilbert</hi></label> (1720-1793),
                    the natural historian of Selborne, was born on 18th July 1720 in the little
                    Hampshire village which his writings have rendered so familiar to all lovers of
                    either books or nature. He was educated at Basingstoke under Warton, father of
                    the poet, and subsequently at Oriel College, Oxford, where he obtained a
                    fellowship (1744). Entering upon a country curacy in 1753, he returned to
                    Selborne in 1755, where he seems soon to have discontinued his ministrations. He
                    obtained a sinecure living from his college in 1758; but after his father’s
                    death in the same year he became curate of the neighbouring parish of Faringdon,
                    and repeatedly declined valuable livings elsewhere, until 1784, when he returned
                    to the curacy of Selborne, and there ministered until his death on 26th June
                    1793. He was never married.</p>
                <p>His daily life was practically unbroken by any great changes or incidents; for
                    nearly half a century his pastoral duties, his watchful country walks, the
                    assiduous care of his garden, and the scrupulous posting of his calendar of
                    observations made up the essentials of a full and delightful life, but hardly of
                    a biography. At most we can only fill up the portrait by reference to the tinge
                    of simple old-fashioned scholarship, which on its historic side made him an
                    eager searcher for antiquities and among old records, and on its poetic
                    occasionally stirred him to an excursion as far as that gentlest slope of
                    Parnassus inhabited by the descriptive muse. Hence we are thrown back upon that
                    correspondence with brother naturalists which has raised his life and its
                    influence so far beyond the commonplace. His strong naturalist tendencies are
                    not, however, properly to be realized without a glance at the history of his
                    younger brothers. The eldest, Thomas, retired from trade to devote himself to
                    natural and physical science, and contributed many papers to the Royal Society,
                    of which he was a fellow. The next, Benjamin, became the publisher of most of
                    the leading works of natural history which appeared during his lifetime,
                    including that of his brother. The third, John, became vicar of Gibraltar, where
                    he accumulated much material for a work on the natural history of the rock and
                    its neighbourhood, and carried on a scientific correspondence, not only with his
                    eldest brother, but with Linnaeus. The youngest, Henry, who died soon after
                    entering the church, is mentioned as having engaged in meteorological
                    observations. The sister’s son, Samuel Barker, also became in time one of
                    White’s most valued correspondents. With other naturalists, too, he had intimate
                    relations: with Pennant and Daines Barrington he was in constant correspondence,
                    often too with the botanist Lightfoot, and sometimes with Sir Joseph Banks and
                    others, while Chandler and other antiquaries kept alive his historic zeal. At
                    first he was content to furnish information from which the works of Pennant and
                    Barrington largely profited; but gradually tire ambition of separate authorship
                    developed from a suggestion thrown out by the latter of these writers in 1770.
                    The next year White sketched to Pennant the project of “a natural history of my
                    native parish, an <hi rend="italic">annus historico-naturalis,</hi> comprising a
                    journal for a whole year, and illustrated with large notes and observations.
                    Such a beginning might induce more able naturalists to write the history of
                    various districts and might in time occasion the production of a work so much to
                    be wished for, a full and complete natural history of these kingdoms.” Yet the
                    famous <hi rend="italic">Natural History of Selborne</hi> did not appear until
                    1789. It was well received from the beginning.</p>
                <p>To be a typical parish natural history so far as completeness or order is
                    concerned, it has of course no pretensions; batches of letters, an essay on
                    antiquities, a naturalist’s calendar, and miscellaneous jottings of all kinds
                    are but the unsystematized material of the work proper, which was never written.
                    Yet it is largely to this very piecemeal character that its popularity has been
                    due. The style has the simple, yet fresh and graphic, directness of all good
                    letter writing, and there is no lack of passages of keen observation, and even
                    shrewd interpretation. White not only notes the homes <pb break="no"

                    animals,—comparing, for instance, the different ways in which the squirrel, the
                    field-mouse, and the nuthatch eat their hazel-nuts,—or watches the migrations of
                    birds, which were then only beginning to be properly recorded or understood, but
                    he knows more than any other observer until Darwin about the habits and the
                    usefulness of the earthworms, and is as certain as the latest physicists that
                    plants distil dew and do not merely condense it. The book is also interesting as
                    having appeared on the borderland between the mediaeval and the modern school of
                    natural history, avoiding the uncritical blundering of the old Encyclopaedists,
                    without entering on the technical and analytic character of the opening age of
                    separate monographs. Moreover, as the first book which raised natural history
                    into the region of literature, much as the <hi rend="italic">Compleat</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Angler</hi> did for that gentle art, we must affiliate to it the
                    more finished products of later writers like Thoreau or Jefferies. Yet, while
                    these are essential merits of the book, its endearing charm lies deeper, in the
                    sweet and kindly personality of the author, who on his rambles gathers no spoil,
                    but watches the birds and field-mice without disturbing them from their nests,
                    and quietly plants an acorn where he thinks an oak is wanted, or sows beech-nuts
                    in what is now a stately row. He overflows with anecdotes, seldom indeed gets
                    beyond the anecdotal stage, yet from this all study of nature must begin; and he
                    sees everywhere intelligence and beauty, love and sociality, where a later view
                    of nature insists primarily on mere adaptation of interests or purely
                    competitive struggles. The encyclopaedic interest in nature, although in White’s
                    day culminating in the monumental synthesis of Buffon, was also disappearing
                    before the analytic specialism inaugurated by Linnaeus; yet the catholic
                    interests of the simple naturalist of Selborne fully reappear a century later in
                    the greater naturalist of Down.</p>
