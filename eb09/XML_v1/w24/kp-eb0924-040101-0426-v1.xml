                <p><label type="entry">WATERFORD</label>, a city, county of a city, municipal and
                    parliamentary borough, and the chief town of the above county, is finely
                    situated on the south bank of the Suir 4 miles above its junction with the
                    Barrow, at the head of the tidal estuary called Waterford Harbour, and on
                    several railway lines, which afford it convenient communication with all parts
                    of Ireland. It is 32 miles west of Wexford, 76 north-east of Cork, and 97
                    south-south-west of Dublin. The Suir is crossed by a wooden bridge of
                    thirty-nine arches, and 832 feet long, connecting Waterford with the suburb of
                    Ferrybank. The town is built chiefly along the banks of the river, occupying for
                    the most part low and level ground except at its western extremity. The modern
                    Protestant cathedral of the Holy Trinity, generally called Christ Church, a
                    plain structure with a lofty spire, occupies the site of the church built by the
                    Danes in 1096. Near it are the episcopal palace and deanery. There is a handsome
                    Catholic cathedral, erected at a cost of &lt;£20,000; and the training seminary
                    for priests called St John’s College deserves notice. The principal secular
                    buildings are the town-hall, the county and city courts and prisons, the new
                    custom-house, erected in 1876, at a cost of £9000, the barracks, and the union
                    workhouse. At the extremity of the quay is a large circular tower, called
                    Reginald’s Tower, forming at one time a portion of the city walls, and occupying
                    the site of the tower built by Reginald the Dane in 1003. Near the summit one of
                    the balls shot from the cannon of Cromwell while besieging the city is still
                    embedded in the wall. There are a number of hospitals and similar benevolent
                    institutions, including the leper house founded in the reign of King John, now
                    possessing an income of £1000 a year, and made use of practically as an
                    infirmary. The town possesses breweries, salt-houses, foundries, and
                    flour-mills; and there is a large export trade in cattle, sheep, and pigs, and
                    in agricultural produce. The population of the city (area 10,059 acres) in 1871
                    was 29,979, and in 1881 it was 29,181.</p>
                <p>Waterford Harbour is a winding and well-sheltered bay, formed by the estuary of
                    the river Suir, and afterwards by the joint estuary of the Nore and Barrow. Its
                    length to the sea is about 15 miles. Its entrance is about 2½ miles wide, and is
                    well lighted by a fixed bright light on the ancient donjon of Hook Tower (139
                    feet in height), by a red light on Dunmore pier, and by two leading lights at
                    Duncannon. The quay, at which vessels of 2000 tons burden can discharge, was
                    enlarged in 1705 by the removal of the city walls, and is about 1¼ miles in
                    length. At Ferrybank, on the Kilkenny side of the river, there is a shipbuilding
                    yard with patent slip and graving dock. By the Suir there is navigation for
                    barges to Clonmel, by the Barrow for sailing vessels to New Ross and thence for
                    barges to Athy, and by the Nore for barges to Inistiogue. The total number of
                    vessels connected with the port in 1885 was 33, of 5246 tons. The number of
                    British and foreign vessels that entered the port in the same year was 1784 of
                    530,092 tons, while 1255 of 412,326 tons cleared.</p>
                <p>Anciently Waterford was called <hi rend="italic">Cuan-na-groith,</hi> the haven
                    of the sun. By early writers it was named Menapia. It is supposed to have
                    existed in very early times, but first acquired importance under the Danes, of
                    whom it remained one of the principal strongholds until its capture by Strongbow
                    in 1171. On 18th October 1172 Henry II. landed near Waterford, and he here
                    received the hostages of the people of Munster. It became a cathedral city in
                    1096. Prince John, afterwards king of England, who had been declared lord of
                    Ireland in 1177, landed at Waterford in 1185. After ascending the English throne
                    he in 1204 granted it a fair, and in 1206 a charter of incorporation. He landed
                    at Waterford in 1210, in order to establish within his nominal territories in
                    Ireland a more distinct form of government. The city received a new <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0427-0402"/> charter from Henry III. in 1232. Richard II.
                    landed at Waterford in October 1394 and again in 1399. In 1447 it was granted by
                    Henry VI. to John Talbot, earl of Shrewsbury, who was created earl of Waterford.
                    In 1497 it successfully resisted an attempt of Perkin Warbeck to capture it, in
                    recognition of which it received various privileges from Henry VII., who gave it
                    the title of <hi rend="italic">urbs intacta.</hi> In 1603, after the accession
                    of James I. to the English crown, the city, along with Cork, took a prominent
                    part in opposition to the Government and to the Protestant religion, but on the
                    approach of Mountjoy it formally submitted. From this time, however, the
                    magistrates whom it elected refused to take the oath of supremacy, and, as by
                    its charter it possessed the right to refuse admission to the king’s judges, and
                    therefore to dispense with the right of holding assizes, a rule was obtained in
                    the Irish chancery for the seizure of its charter, which was carried iuto effect
                    in 1618. In 1619 an attempt was made to induce Bristol merchants to settle in
                    the city and undertake its government, but no one would respond to the
                    invitation, and in 1626 the charter was restored. The city was unsuccessfully
                    attacked by Cromwell in 1649, but surrendered to Ireton 10th August 1650. After
                    the battle of the Boyne James II. embarked at it for France (July 1690). Shortly
                    afterwards it surrendered to William, who sailed from it to England. It sent two
                    members to parliament from 1374 to 1885, when the number was reduced to one.</p>
