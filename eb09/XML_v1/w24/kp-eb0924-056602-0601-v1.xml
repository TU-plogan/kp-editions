                <p><label type="entry">WILKES, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label> (1727-1797),
                    the champion of the right of free representation by British constituencies, was
                    descended from a family long connected with Leighton-Buzzard in Bedfordshire,
                    but he himself was born at Clerkenwell, London, on 17th October 1727. His
                    father, Israel Wilkes, was a rich distiller, and the owner, through his wife
                    Sarah, daughter of John Heaton of Hoxton, of considerable house property in its
                    north-eastern suburbs. After some training under private tuition John Wilkes was
                    sent to the university of Leyden, matriculating there on 8th September 1744.
                    Several young men of talent from Scotland and England were studying in this
                    Dutch university at that period, and a lively picture of their life, in which
                    Wilkes displays the gaiety of temper which remained faithful to him all his
                    days, is presented to us by “Jupiter” Carlyle. With this training he acquired an
                    intimate knowledge of classical literature, and he enlarged his mind by
                    travelling through Holland, Flanders, and part of Germany. At the close of 1748
                    he returned to his native land, and in a few months (October 1749) was drawn by
                    his relations into marrying Mary, sole daughter and heiress of John Mead,
                    citizen and grocer of London, who was ten years his senior. The ill-assorted
                    pair,—for she was grave and staid, while he rioted in exuberant spirits and love
                    of society,— lived together in the country for some months, when, to make
                    matters worse, they returned to town to dwell with the wife’s mother. One child,
                    a daughter, was born to them, when Wilkes left his wife and removed to
                    Westminster, where he kept open house for many young men about town possessing
                    more wit than morals. To this unfortunate marriage should in justice be
                    attributed some of his errors in life. In 1754 he contested the constituency of
                    Berwick-upon-Tweed, but failed to gain the seat. Wilkes was now a well-known
                    figure in the life of the West End, and among his associates were Thomas Potter,
                    the son of the archbishop of Canterbury, Sir Francis Dashwood, afterwards Lord

                    towards his old companion in revelry. In July 1757, by a triangular arrangement
                    in which Potter and the first William Pitt played the other parts, Wilkes was
                    elected for Aylesbury, and for this constituency he was again returned at the
                    general election in March 1761. Pitt was his leader in politics; but to Pitt he
                    applied in vain for a seat at the board of trade; nor was he successful in his
                    other applications for office. Stung by these disappointments, Wilkes threw
                    himself into bitter opposition to Bute, and to make his antagonism more
                    effective established a paper called <hi rend="italic">The North Briton,</hi> in
                    which he from the first attacked the Scotch prime minister with exceeding
                    bitterness, and grew bolder as it proceeded in its course. One of its articles
                    ridiculed Lord Talbot, the steward of the royal household, and a duel was the
                    result. When Bute resigned, the issue of the journal was suspended; but, when
                    the royal speech framed by George Grenville’s ministry showed that the change
                    was one of men only, not of measures, a supplementary number, No. 45, was
                    published, 23d April 1763, containing a caustic criticism of the king’s message
                    to his parliament. Lord Halifax, the leading secretary of state, issued a
                    general warrant “to search for authors, printers, and publishers,” and to bring
                    them before him for examination. Charles Churchill, the poet and a coadjutor in
                    this newspaper enterprise, escaped through the good offices of Wilkes; but the
                    chief offender was arrested and thrown into the Tower. A week later, however, he
                    was released by order of the Court of Common Pleas on the ground that his
                    privilege as a member of parliament afforded him immunity from arrest. General
                    warrants were afterwards declared illegal, and Halifax himself after a series of
                    discreditable shifts was cast in heavy sums, on actions brought against him by
                    the persons whom he had injured,—the total expenses incurred by the ministry in
                    these lawless proceedings amounting to at least &lt;£100,000. So far Wilkes had
                    triumphed over his enemies, but he gave them cause for rejoicing by an
                    indiscreet reprint of the obnoxious No. 45, and by striking off at his private
                    press thirteen copies of an obscene <hi rend="italic">Essay on Woman,</hi>
                    written by his friend Potter, in parody of Pope’s <hi rend="italic">Essay on
                    Man,</hi> one of which got into the hands of Lord Sandwich. Immediately on the
                    meeting of the House of Commons (15th November 1763) proceedings were taken
                    against him. Lord North moved that No. 45 was “a false, scandalous, and
                    seditious libel,” and, as the motion was of course carried, the paper was
                    publicly burnt in Cheapside on 4th December. The <hi rend="italic">Essay on
                    Woman</hi> was brought before the Upper House by Lord Sandwich, and, on account
                    of the improper use which had been made of Bishop Warburton’s name as the author
                    of some coarse notes, the work was voted a breach of privilege, and Wilkes was
                    ordered to be prosecuted in the Court of King’s Bench for printing and
                    publishing an impious libel. He was expelled from the House of Commons on 19th
                    January 1764; and on 21st February he was found guilty in the King’s Bench of
                    reprinting No. 45 and of printing and publishing the <hi rend="italic">Essay on
                    Woman.</hi> Wilkes was on these dates absent from England. Some strong
                    expressions applied to him by Samuel Martin, an ex-secretary of the treasury,
                    had provoked a duel (16th November 1763), in which Wilkes was severely wounded
                    in the stomach. He withdrew to Paris, and as he did not return to England to
                    receive his sentence in the law courts was pronounced an outlaw.</p>
                <p>For several years Wilkes remained abroad, receiving £1000 a year from the leading
                    Whigs, and in the course of his travels he visited many parts of Italy. In March
                    1768 he returned to London and sued the king for pardon, but in vain. His next
                    step was to offer himself as a candidate for the representation of the City of
                    London, when he was the lowest at the poll. Undaunted by this defeat, he
                    solicited the freeholders of Middlesex to return him as their champion, and they
                    placed him at the head of all competitors. He appeared before the King’s Bench,
                    and on a technical point procured a reversal of his outlawry; but the original
                    verdict was maintained, and he was sentenced to imprisonment for twenty-two
                    months as well as to a fine of £1000, and he was further ordered to produce
                    securities for good behaviour for seven years after his liberation. His conduct
                    was brought before the House of Commons, with the result that he was expelled
                    from the House on 3d February 1769, and with this proceeding there began a
                    series of contests between the ministry and the electors of Middlesex without
                    parallel in English history. They promptly re-elected him (16th February), only
                    to find him pronounced incapable of sitting and his election void. Again they
                    returned him (16th March) and again he was rejected. A fourth election then
                    followed, when Colonel Henry Lawes Luttrell, with all the influence of the court
                    and the Fox family in his favour, obtained but 296 votes to 1143 given for
                    Wilkes, whereupon the House declared that Luttrell had been duly elected.
                    Through these audacious proceedings a storm of fury broke out throughout the
                    country. In the cause of “Wilkes and liberty” high and low enlisted themselves.
                    His prison cell was thronged daily by the chief of the Whigs, and large sums of
                    money were subscribed for his support. So great was the popular sympathy in his
                    favour that a keen judge of contemporary politics declared that, had George III.
                    possessed a bad and Wilkes a good character, the king would have been an outcast
                    from his dominions. At the height of the combat in January 1769 Wilkes was
                    elected an alderman for the City of London; in 1771 he served as sheriff for
                    London and Middlesex, and as alderman he took an active part in the struggle
                    between the corporation and the House of Commons by which freedom of publication
                    of the parliamentary debates was obtained. His admirers endeavoured in 1772 to
                    procure his election as lord mayor of London, but he was set aside by the
                    aldermen, some of whom were allied with the ministry of Lord North, while
                    others, as Oliver and Townshend, leant to the Liberalism of Lord Shelburne. In
                    1774, however, he obtained that dignity, and he retained his seat for Middlesex
                    from the dissolution in 1774 until 1790. He moved in 1776 for leave to bring in
                    a bill “for a just and equal representation of the people of England in
                    parliament”; but attempts at parliamentary reform were premature by at least
                    half a century. After several failures better fortune attended his efforts in
                    another direction, for in 1782 all the declarations and orders against him for
                    his elections in Middlesex were ordered to be expunged from the journals of the
                    House. In 1779 Wilkes was elected chamberlain of the city by a large majority,
                    and the office became his freehold for life. He died at his house in Grosvenor
                    Square, London, on 20th December 1797.</p>
                <p>Wilkes printed editions of Catullus and Theophrastus, and at the time of his
                    death had made considerable progress with a translation of Anacreon. His
                    conversation was often sullied by obscenity and profanity; but he knew how to
                    suit his conversation to his company, and his well-known assertion that, ugly as
                    he was, with the start of a quarter of an hour he could get the better, of any
                    man, however good-looking, in the graces of any lady, shows his confidence in
                    his powers of fascination. The king was obliged to own that he had never met so
                    well-bred a lord mayor, and Dr Johnson, who made his acquaintance at the house
                    of Dilly, the bookseller in the Poultry, confessed that “Jack has great variety
                    of talk, Jack is a scholar, and Jack has the manners of a gentleman.” It is
                    doubtful how fiιr he himself believed in the justice of the principles which he
                    espoused. To George III. he remarked of his devoted friend and legal adviser,
                    Serjeant Glynn, “Ah sir! he was a Wilkite, which I never was.” His writings were
                    marked by great power of sarcasm. Two collections of his letters were published,
                    one of <hi rend="italic">Letters to his Daughter,</hi> in four volumes in 1804,
                    the other <hi rend="italic">Com·</hi><pb break="no"
