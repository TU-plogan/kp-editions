                <p><label type="entry">WARREN, <hi rend="smallcaps">Samuel</hi></label> (1807-1877),
                    author of <hi rend="italic">Ten Thousand a Year,</hi> was born in Denbighshire
                    in 1807. After a curriculum at the university of Edinburgh, of such distinction
                    that he made the acquaintance of “Christopher North” through his undergraduate
                    fame, he began the study of medicine, but soon abandoned it for the English bar.
                    He entered at the Inner Temple in 1828, and was successful in his profession. He
                    took silk in 1851, was made recorder of Hull in 1854, represented Medhurst in
                    parliament for three years (1856-59), and was rewarded by his party leaders in
                    1859 with a mastership in lunacy. Meantime he had made a much more brilliant
                    success in fiction-writing. Very early in his career, before he was called to
                    the bar, he had begun to write for <hi rend="italic">Blackwood.</hi> His <hi
                    rend="italic">Passages from the Diary of a Late Physician</hi> appeared in that
                    magazine between August 1830 and October 1831, being collected into two volumes
                    in 1832. A third volume was published in 1838, the contents of which appeared
                    originally in the same magazine between September 1832 and August 1837. These
                    short stories, most of them of a horrible character, with morbid interest
                    shielded under a moral purpose, were extremely popular, and so realistic that as
                    long as the writer remained anonymous it was customary for doctors to declare
                    that some brother must be making capital of the secrets of his profession.
                    Warren’s brief experience as a medical student thus stood him in good stead. But
                    his great success was <hi rend="italic">Ten Thousand a Year,</hi> which ran in
                    <hi rend="italic">Blackwood</hi> from October 1839 to August 1841, and was
                    published separately immediately on its conclusion. Critics complained of the
                    coarseness of the workmanship, of the banality of the moralizing, the crudeness
                    of the pathos, the farcical extravagance of the humour; but meantime the work
                    established itself as one of the most popular novels of the century. Of the
                    higher qualities of imagination and passion Warren was destitute, but his
                    sketches of character, especially farcical character,—Tittlebat Titmouse, Oily
                    Gammon, Mr Quicksilver (an open caricature of Lord Brougham),—are bold and
                    strong, forcibly imprinted on the memory, and the interest of the story is made
                    to run with a powerful current. For several years Warren was content to be known
                    as the author of <hi rend="italic">Ten Thousand a Year,</hi> and many tales were
                    told of his open pride in the achievement. In 1847 he made another venture, but
                    <hi rend="italic">Now and Then</hi> was not a success. <hi rend="italic">The
                    Lily and the Bee,</hi> a squib on the Crystal Palace, published in 1851, though
                    it had the honour of translation into Italian, was a signal failure. A
                    pessimistic dissertation on <hi rend="italic">The Intellectual and Moral
                    Development of the Age,</hi> published in 1853, also fell flat, and thenceforth
                    Warren, after publishing his <hi rend="italic">Works, Critical and
                    Imaginative,</hi> in four volumes in 1854, retired on his laurels. He died at
                    London, July 29, 1877.</p>
                <p>Besides his novels and other contributions to <hi rend="italic">Blackwood,</hi>
                    Warren wrote several legal works of repute— <hi rend="italic">Introduction to
                    Law Studies</hi> (1835), <hi rend="italic">Extracts from Blackstone</hi> (1837),
                    <hi rend="italic">Manual of Parliamentary Law</hi> (1852).</p>
                <p>His whole attitude towards the subject of insanity in its legal relations was
                    determined by his clear perception and tenacious grasp of the fact that the
                    disease insanity is merely one of the indicia of legal “unsoundness of mind he
                    thus reduced medical expertism to its proper proportions, by treating the
                    alienist as a witness and not a judge. The masterly brevity with which he
                    addressed the jury in the Windham inquiry branded as practically irrelevant the
                    mass of the evidence produced at the trial, and prepared the public mind for the
                    third section of the Lunacy Regulation Act of 1862.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It is substantially as follows :—Under every
                    commission, the inquiry shall be confined to the question whether or not the
                    alleged lunatic is, at the time of such inquiry, of unsound mind, and no
                    evidence as to his acts, demeanour, or state of mind at any time being more than
                    two years before the date of the inquiry shall be receivable in proof of
                    insanity, unless the judge or master shall otherwise direct.</p></note> To the
                    doctrine of moral insanity he offered an uncompromising but ineffective and, it
                    must be confessed, an ignorant opposition. It is doubtful whether he understood
                    the meaning, and it is certain that he had never studied the evidences, of the
                    theory which he so severely condemns. A writer who imagined that the cases of
                    Oxford and MacNaughten bore any resemblance to the “observations” of Pinel was
                    hardly qualified to criticize even the less worthy of his disciples. Yet this
                    hostility was not altogether irrational. Exaggerating, indeed mistranslating,
                    the language of Pinel, in whose work moral insanity appears as “manie sans
                    délire,” the English alienists had pressed into their service cases which were
                    far less closely allied to insanity than to crime, and had claimed, in tho name
                    of science, to return the verdict whenever mental incompetence existed or was
                    presumed. Against these extravagant pretensions the school of Alderson and Rolfe
                    arose in healthy revolt. Ignorant of, or possibly not caring to sift, the
                    residuum of fact which undoubtedly they would have <pb break="no"

                    délire,” they believed moral insanity to be nothing more than the immoral and
                    illogical plea with which English alienists had made them familiar, and they
                    sternly refused to recognize it. To the exertions of this school, of which
                    Samuel Warren was a distinguished member, we owe the wise jealousy with which
                    the defence of moral insanity is now regarded by alienists themselves. See
