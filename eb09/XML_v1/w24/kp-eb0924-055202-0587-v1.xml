                <p><label type="entry">WHITEHAVEN</label>, a parliamentary borough of England and
                    the principal seaport of Cumberland, is situated at the extremity of the Solway
                    Firth, facing the Irish Sea, 4l miles south-west of Carlisle and 304 north-west
                    of London. It is connected by a branch line with the London and North Western
                    Railway. The town is built chiefly in a valley overlooked by high grounds on the
                    north and south. The streets are spacious, with handsome shops. The principal
                    public buildings are the town-hall, court-room, custom-house, police office,
                    theatre, baths, free library, infirmary, and dispensary. The harbour is
                    protected by two stone piers; the west pier (erected 1824-39) is 965 feet long,
                    and the north pier (1837-41) 918 feet. There is daily communication with
                    Liverpool, Glasgow, Belfast, Dublin, and the Isle of Man. The town has an import
                    trade from America, the Baltic ports, France, Spain and Portugal, and the
                    Mediterranean. The principal exports are coal, pig iron, lime, freestone, and
                    grain. The number of vessels that entered the port in 1886 was 2377, of 269,811
                    tons, the number that cleared 2297, of 257,025 tons. Iron ship-building is
                    carried on, but the number of vessels built in 1886 was only 2 of 2406 tons. The
                    other principal industries are engineering, brassfounding, boiler-making, brick
                    and earthenware manufacturing, and dyeing. There are two large collieries, one
                    extending about 1∣ miles under the sea. Fishing is carried on to a small extent,
                    the number of boats engaged in 1886 being 18 of 441 tons. The population of the
                    urban sanitary district (area 679 acres) was 18,243 in 1871 and 19,295 in
                    1881.</p>
                <p>Whitehaven owes its name to the light colour of the rocks adjoining it. In the
                    reign of Henry I. the manor formed part of the monastery of St Mary’s at York,
                    to which the priory of St Bees belonged. In 1599 the manor of St Bees was
                    purchased from Sir Thomas Chaloner by General Lowther and Thomas Wybergh, and
                    the whole in 1644 came into the possession of Sir John Lowther, under whose
                    auspices the town advanced with great rapidity. From Charles II. the Lowthers
                    obtained an additional grant of 150 acres, now partly included in the town, soon
                    after which means were taken greatly to improve the harbour. By Acts passed in
                    the 7th and 11th years of Queen Anne’s reign the town is governed by twenty-two
                    trustees elected triennially. The earl of Lonsdale, whose castle adjoins the
                    town, is lord of the manor. Whitehaven has returned one member to parliament
                    since 1832.</p>
