                    Stephens in 1826 <hi rend="italic">(Gen. Zoology,</hi> xiv. pt. i. p. 34); but
                    in 1782 Latham <hi rend="italic">(Synopsis,</hi> i. p. 435) had called the “<hi
                    rend="italic">Troupiale du Sénégal"</hi> of Buffon the “Weever Oriole,” from its
                    habit of entwining the wires of the cage in which it was kept with such
                    vegetable fibres as it could get, and hence in 1788 Gmelin named it <hi
                    rend="italic">Oriolus textor.</hi> In 1800 Daudin used the term " <hi
                    rend="italic">Tisserin”</hi> for several species of the Linnaean genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Loxia,</hi> and this was adopted some years later by Cuvier as the
                    equivalent of his <hi rend="italic">Ploceus,</hi> as mentioned in the
                    text.</p></note> by which a group of between 200 and 300 species are now usually
                    called, from the elaborately interwoven nests that many of them build, some of
                    the structures being of the most marvellous kind. By the older systematists such
                    of these birds as were then known were distributed among the genera <hi
                    rend="italic">Oriolus, Loxia, Emberiza,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fringilla</hi>; and it was Cuvier who in 1817 first brought together these
                    dissevered forms, comprising them in a genus <hi rend="italic">Ploceus.</hi>
                    Since his time others have been referred to its neighbourhood, and especially
                    the genus <hi rend="italic">Vidua</hi> with its allies, so as to make of them a
                    Subfamily <hi rend="italic">Ploceinae,</hi> which in 1847 was raised by Prof.
                    Cabanis to the rank of a Family <hi rend="italic">Ploceidse,—</hi> a step the
                    propriety of which has since been generally admitted, though the grounds for
                    taking it—far too technical to be here criticized—are very slight, and such as
                    could not be held valid in any other Order than that of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Passeres.</hi></p>
                <p>Where so many forms are concerned, only a few of the most important can now be
                    mentioned. The type of Cuvier’s genus is certainly the <hi rend="italic">Loxia
                    philippina</hi> of Linnaeus, so termed from the islands it inhabits. But the
                    typical Weaver-bird of Latham (not that he had the name in that precise form) is
                    the <hi rend="italic">Hyphantornis cucullata</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >textor</hi> of modern writers, an African species, and it is to the Ethiopian
                    Region that by far the greatest number of these birds belong, and in it they
                    seem to attain their maximum of development. They are all small, with, generally
                    speaking, a Sparrow-like build; but in richness of colouring the males of some
                    are very conspicuous—glowing in crimson, scarlet or golden-yellow, set off by
                    jet-black, while the females are usually dull in hue. Some species build nests
                    that are not very remarkable, except in <pb break="no"

                    whose nests may be compared to pensile pockets, while those of these
                    Weaver-birds can best be likened to a stocking hung up by the “toe,” with the
                    “heel” enlarged to receive the eggs, while access and exit are obtained through
                    the "leg.”</p></note> of closely and uniformly interwoven tendrils or fine
                    roots, that often hang from the bough of a tree over water, and, starting with a
                    solidly wrought rope, open out into a globular chamber, and then contract into a
                    tube several inches in length, through which the birds effect their exit and
                    entrance. But the most wonderful nests of all, and indeed the most wonderful
                    built by birds, are those of the so-called Sociable Grosbeak, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philhetaerus socius,</hi> of Africa. These are composed wholly of grass, and
                    are joined together to the number of 100 or 200—indeed 320 are said to have been
                    found in one of these aggregated masses, which usually take the form of a
                    gigantic mushroom,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>But
                    at a distance they may often be mistaken for a native hut, with its
                    grass-roof.</p></note> affording a home and nursery to many pairs of the birds
                    which have been at the trouble of building it. These nests, however, have been
                    so often described and figured by South-African travellers that there is no need
                    here to dilate longer on their marvels. It may be added that this species of
                    Weaver-bird, known to French writers as the <hi rend="italic">Républicain,</hi>
                    is of exceptionally dull plumage.</p>

                    written Whydah bird—from the place on the West Coast of Africa so named; but
                    Edwards, who in 1745 figured one of the species, states that he was informed
                    that “the Portuguese call this bird the Widow, from its Colour and long Train”

                    >Viduinae,</hi> is remarkable for the extraordinary growth of the tail-feathers
                    in the males at the breeding-season. In the largest species, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vidua</hi> (sometimes called <hi rend="italic">Chera) progne,</hi> the
                    cock-bird, which, with the exception of a scarlet and buff bar on the upper
                    wing-coverts, is wholly black, there is simply a great elongation of the
                    rectrices; but in <hi rend="italic">V. paradisea</hi> the form of the tail is
                    quite unique. The middle pair of feathers have the webs greatly widened, and
                    through the twisting of the shafts their inferior surfaces are vertically
                    opposed. These feathers are comparatively short, and end in a hair-like
                    filament. The next pair are produced to the length of about a foot—the bird not
                    being so big as a Sparrow—and droop gracefully in the form of a sickle. But this
                    is not all: each has attached to its base a hair-like filament of the same
                    length as the feather, and this filament originally adhered to and ran along the
                    margin of the outer web, only becoming detached when the feather is full
                    grown.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This curious
                    structure was long ago described by Brisson (Orni- <hi rend="italic"

                    rectrices are equally elongated, but their webs are convex, and the outer pair
                    contains the inner, so that when the margins of the two pairs are applied a sort
                    of cylinder is formed.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Both these species seem to have been first described and figured in 1600 by
                    Aldrovandus (lib. xv. cap. 22, 23) from pictures sent to him by Ferdinando de’
                    Medici, duke of Tuscany.</p></note> The females of all the Widow-birds differ
                    greatly in appearance from the males, and are generally clothed in a plumage of
                    mottled brown.</p>

                    rend="italic">Estreldinae</hi> would seem to be a more fitting name. These
                    comprehend the numerous species so commonly seen in cages, and known as
                    Amadavats, <hi rend="italic">Estrelda amandava,</hi> Nutmeg-birds, <hi
