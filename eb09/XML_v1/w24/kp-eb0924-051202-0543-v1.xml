                <p><label type="entry">WESTMEATH</label>, an inland county of Ireland, in the
                    province of Leinster, is bounded N.W. by Longford, N. by Cavan, N.E. and E. by
                    Meath, S. by King’s County, and W. by Roscommon. Its greatest length from east
                    to west is about 40 miles, and its greatest breadth from north to south about 35
                    miles. The total area is 453,453 acres, or about 708 square miles. Westmeath is
                    included within the great central limestone plain of Ireland, but at
                    Moat-a-Genogue and near Ballymahon the sandstone rises above the limestone bed
                    and forms isolated protuberances. The general average height of the surface of
                    the county is over 250 feet above sea-level. Being diversified with hill,
                    valley, lake, and river it is highly picturesque, but in no part can it be
                    termed mountainous, the highest summits being Knocklayde (795 feet), Hill of Ben
                    (710 feet), and Knockayon (707 feet). Good limestone is obtainable for building
                    or agricultural purposes, but in some -cases tlτe-limestone is difficult to
                    calcine. Copper, lead, coal, and marble have been dug, but are not found in
                    sufficient quantities to make the speculation profitable. In some parts there
                    are numerous eskers of calcareous gravel. A large surface is occupied by bog. A
                    special feature of Westmeath is the number of large loughs, which have a
                    combined area of nearly 17,000 acres. In the north, on the borders of Cavan, is
                    Lough Sheelin, with a length of 5 miles and an average breadth of between 2 and
                    3 miles, and adjoining it is the smaller Lough Kinale. In the centre of the
                    county there is a group of large loughs, of which Lough Dereveragh has an area
                    of 2555 acres. To the north of it are Loughs Lene, Glore, Bawn, and others, and
                    to the south Loughs Iron and Owel. Farther south is Lough Ennell or Belvidere,
                    and in the south-west Lough Ree, forming part of the boundary with Roscommon.
                    The river Inny, which rises in Cavan, enters Westmeath from Lough Sheelin, and,
                    forming for parts of its course the boundary with Longford, falls into Lough
                    Ree. The Inny has as one of its tributaries the Glore, flowing from Lough Lene
                    through Lough Glore, a considerable part of its course being underground. From
                    Lough Lene the Dale also flows southwards to the Irish Sea, and thus this lake
                    sends its waters to the opposite shores of the island. The Brosna flows from
                    Lough Ennell southwards by King’s County into the Shannon.</p>

                    Owners of Land,</hi> 1876, Westmeath was divided among 668 proprietors
                    possessing 430,003 acres, at an annual value of £301,696, or about 14s. an acre.
                    There were also 4262 acres of common or waste lands. Of the proprietors only 111
                    possessed less than one acre. The following possessed over 8000 acres:—earl of
                    Longford, 15,014; John Malone, 12,555; Lord Castlemaine, 11,445; Lord Greville,
                    9784; Captain Thomas Smyth, 9779; Patrick Edward Murphy, 9694; Sir Benjamin
                    Chapman, Bart., 9517; G. A. Rochfort-Boyd, 9431; Charles Brinsley Marley, 9060;
                    and Sir John Ennis, Bart. , 8775. The soil is generally a rich loam of great
                    depth resting on limestone, and is well adapted both for tillage and pasturage.
                    Even the hills when not under tillage are clothed with a rich pasturage to their
                    summits. In 1886 22 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 2 per cent, of the entire
                    area was under crops, 62 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 3 per cent, under grass,

                    mountain land, and 4T per cent, water, roads, &amp;c. The total number of
                    holdings in 1886 was 10,992, of which 42 were above 500 acres in extent, 281
                    between 200 and 500 acres, 535 between 100 and 200 acres, 1094 between 50 and
                    100 acres, 3589 between 15 and 50 acres, 2466 between <hi rend="italic">5</hi>
                    and 15 acres, 1698 between 1 and 5 acres, and 1287 not exceeding 1 acre. Within
                    about the last forty years the area under crops has diminished nearly a third.
                    In 1849 it was 130,913 acres, and in 1859 it was 122,684. Between 1876 and 1886
                    it has been fluctuating rather than decreasing; in the former year it was
                    98,959, and in the latter 96,287. Only in the area under meadow and clover has
                    there been an increase: in 1849 it was 35,359 acres, and by 1859 it had
                    increased to 41,535, by 1876 to 51,262, and by 1886 to 56,619. The decline in
                    the area under green crops has not been marked: in 1876 the area was 21,369
                    acres, and in 1886 it was 19,292; but since 1849, when it was 76,173 acres, the
                    area under corn crops has declined more than two-thirds, and the decline has
                    been continuous, the area in 1876 being 26,305 acres, and in 1886 only 20,375.
                    More than half the area under green crops is occupied by potatoes (11,948 acres
                    in 1876, and 11,106 acres in 1886), turnips occupying in these years
                    respectively 6155 acres and 5362 acres, mangel-wurzel, &amp;c., 1232 and 1129,
                    and other green crops 2534 and 1695. The bulk of the area under corn crops has
                    always been occupied by oats, but their area has declined from 59,424 acres in
                    1849 to 25,709 in 1876, and 19,969 in 1886. The areas under other corn crops are
                    inconsiderable. The number of horses in 1886 was 13,014, of which 883 were kept
                    for amusement and recreation. Mules numbered 659, and asses 4391. Cattle
                    numbered 102,878, 15,806 of them milch cows, and 45,915 other cattle above two
                    years of age. The number of sheep was 118,401, of which 44,265 were under one
                    year old. Pigs numbered only 17,303, goats 6811, and poultry 265,759, including
                    21,014 turkeys and 36,908 geese.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Manufactures. —</hi> The occupations are almost wholly
                    agricultural, dairy farming predominating. Flour and meal are largely made. The
                    only textile manufactures are those of friezes, flannels, and coarse linens for
                    home use. The only mineral of any value is limestone.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration and Population.—</hi> De Burgo in 1760 placed
                    the population at 50,340; in the parliamentary census of 1812 it was given as
                    112,000; in 1821 it amounted to 128,819, in 1841 to 141,300, in 1861 to 90,879,
                    and in 1881 to 71,798 (males 36,478, females 35,320). Between 1841 and 1881 the
                    decrease has thus been 49'18 per cent. Roman Catholics in 1881 numbered 92 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 2 per cent, of the population, and Protestant
                    Episcopalians 6 ’ 9. In 1881 54 per cent, of the population could read and
                    write, 14 ’ 7 per cent, could read but could not write, and 31 ’ 3 per cent,
                    could neither read nor write,—14 ’ 8 per cent, being under seven years of age.
                    There were none who could speak Irish only; 828 could speak Irish and English.
                    By the Act of 1885 Westmeath, which formerly returned two members to Parliament,
                    was formed into two parliamentary divisions, North and South, each returning one
                    member; and, Athìone having been disfranchised, that part of the borough within
                    the county was included in the South Division. The principal towns are Athione,
                    of which about half (3072 inhabitants out of 6755) is within the county, the
                    remainder being in Roscommon, and Mullingar (4787), the county town, a Catholic
                    cathedral city, and an important railway junction. The county is divided into 12
                    baronies, and contains 63 parishes and 1356 townlands. It is in the home
                    circuit, and assizes are held at Mullingar, and quarter sessions at Mullingar
                    and Moate. There are 16 petty session districts. The county is within the Dublin
                    military district, and forms part of No. 67 sub-district, the brigade dépôt of
                    which is at Birr. There is a banack station at Mullingar.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History and Antiquities.—</hi> Westmeath was included in the
                    kingdom of Meath formed by Tuathal, overlord of the Scoti <hi rend="italic"
                    >(ob.</hi><hi rend="italic">cir.</hi> 160 A.D.), to serve as his mensal land.
                    The district suffered much in the 10th and 11th centuries from the Danes, who
                    burnt the town and abbey of Fore. In 1153 the northern region was the scene of a
                    bloody battle under the leadership of the two sons of Dermod O’ Brien, after
                    which Turlough, having obtained the victory, put out his brother’s eyes. On the
                    settlement of the English in Leinster it formed part of the palatinate of Hugh
                    de Lacy, who received about 800,000 acres from the king, and allotted large
                    tracts to his followers. In the reign of Henry VIII. the palatinate was divided
                    into two parts, the western of which was distinguished by the name of Westmeath.
                    In the latter division a portion of Longford was included until this district
                    was formed into a separate county by Elizabeth. The plan for the insurrection of
                    1641 was concerted in the abbey of Multifarnham, and both in the wars of this
                    period and those of 1688 the gentry of the county were so deeply implicated that
                    the majority of the estates were confiscated. There are a considerable number of
                    old raths: one at Rathconrath is of great extent; another at Ballymore,
                    originally a Danish fort, was fortified during the wars of the Cromwellian
                    period and those of 1688, and afterwards was the headquarters of General
                    Ginckell, when preparing to besiege Athione; and there is a third of
                    considerable size near Lough Lene. The ruins of the Franciscan abbey of
                    Multifarn-ham, founded in 1236 by William Delaware, picturesquely situated near
                    Lough. Dereveragh, include a tower 93 feet in height. Others of less importance
                    are at Fore, Kilmocahill, and Kilbeggan.</p>
