                <p><label type="entry">WARSAW</label><hi rend="italic">(Warszawa),</hi> capital of
                    Poland, and chief town of the above government, is beautifully situated on the
                    left bank of the Vistula, 395 miles to the east of Berlin, and 700 miles to
                    south-west of St Petersburg. It stands on a terrace nearly 100 feet in height,
                    which stretches far to the westward, and descends by steep slopes towards the
                    river, leaving a broad beach at its base. The suburb of Praga on the right bank
                    of the Vistula, here from 450 to 880 yards broad, is connected with Warsaw by
                    two bridges,—the railway bridge, which passes right under the guns of the
                    Alexandrovsk citadel to the north, and the Alexandrovsk bridge in the centre of
                    the town.</p>
                <p>With its population of nearly 450,000, its beautiful river, its ample
                    communications and its commerce, its university and scientific societies, its
                    palaces and numerous places of amusement, Warsaw is one of the most pleasant as
                    well as one of the most animated cities of eastern Europe. In Russia it is
                    excelled in importance by the two Russian capitals only; and doubtless it would
                    have attained even a larger population, and a yet higher place in the world of
                    commerce and intellect, were it not for its sad and chequered history, and the
                    foreign domination of which the traveller is reminded at every step.</p>
                <p>Situated in a fertile plain, on a great navigable river, below its junction with
                    the Pilica and Weprz, which water southern Poland, and above its junction with
                    the Narew and Bug, which water a wide region in the east, it became in mediaeval
                    times the chief entrepôt for the trade of those fertile and populous valleys
                    with western Europe. Its position in the territory of Mazovia, which was neither
                    Polish nor Lithuanian, and, so to say, remained neutral between the two rival
                    powers which constituted the united kingdom, it became the capital of both, to
                    the detriment of the purely Polish Cracow and the Lithuanian Vilna. And now,
                    connected as it is by six trunk lines with Vienna, south-western Russia, Moscow,
                    St Petersburg, Dantzic, and Berlin <hi rend="italic">(via</hi> Bromberg), it has
                    become one of the most important commercial cities of eastern Europe. The
                    south-western railway connects it with Łodz, the Manchester of Poland, as also
                    with the rich coal fields of Kielce, which supply its steadily growing
                    manufactures with coal and iron, so that Warsaw and its neighbourhood have
                    become a centre for all kinds of manufactures, greatly aided in their
                    development by the high technical training and general superiority of the
                    engineers of the Polish capital, as well as by the skill, taste, and
                    intelligence of its artisans. The periodical wholesale deportations of Warsaw
                    artisans, who never failed to take an active part in the Polish insurrections,
                    especially in 1794, 1831, and 1863, considerably checked, but could not wholly
                    stop the industrial progress of the town; but the lines of customhouses which
                    surround Poland, and thus limit the Warsaw market, as also the Russian rule,
                    which militates against the progress of Polish science, technology, and art, are
                    so many obstacles to the development of its natural resources. The population of
                    Warsaw has nevertheless grown rapidly of late, having risen from 161,008 in
                    1860, and 276,000 in 1872, to 436,570 in 1887; of these more than 25,000 are
                    Germans, and one-third are Jews (43,000 in 1860, and 117,300 in 1879). The
                    Russian garrison amounts to nearly 20,000 men.</p>
                <p>The streets of Warsaw are very animated, and are adorned with many fine
                    buildings—partly due to the old Polish nobility’s love of display (there are
                    more than 160 palaces, 60 of which have been confiscated by the Russian
                    Government), partly churches and cathedrals (179 Catholic, 6 Greek, and 2
                    Lutheran, several synagogues, 14 monasteries, and 4 nunneries), and partly
                    public buildings,—schools, hospitals, scientific societies,—erected at great
                    expense by the municipality or by private bodies. Fine public gardens and
                    several monuments further embellish the city. The present university, founded as
                    the “Glawnaja Szkoła,” in 1816, but closed in 1832, was again opened in 1864; it
                    has a remarkable library of more than 350,000 volumes, rich natural history
                    collections, a fine botanic garden, and an observatory well known for its
                    astronomical work. There are 75 professors and nearly 1000 students. The
                    teaching is in Russian, and mostly by Russians, and the close intercourse which
                    used to exist between the university and the educated classes of Poland is
                    becoming a thing of the past. The rich university library, one of the largest in
                    the world, was confiscated in 1794, and transferred to St Petersburg, where it
                    became the nucleus of the present imperial public library; and, after the
                    insurrection of 1831, it was again ransacked for the same purpose. The medical
                    school, which enjoys high repute in the scientific world, still retains the
                    right of teaching in Polish, and has about 220 students. The same privilege is
                    enjoyed by the school of arts, the academy of agriculture and forestry, and the
                    conservatory of music, all of which are high-class institutions. There are,
                    besides, six classical gymnasia, two “real” schools, and numerous elementary
                    schools. The museum of the society of fine arts is rich in examples of ancient
                    and modern art. The association of the friends of science and the historical and
                    agricultural societies of Warsaw were once well known, but all were closed after
                    the insurrections, and now they live but a precarious life, the scientific works
                    which continue to be produced in Poland being partly published at Cracow.</p>
                <p>The great theatre for Polish drama and the ballet is a fine building which really
                    includes two theatres under the same roof; but the pride of Warsaw is its
                    theatre in the Łazienki gardens, which were laid out in an old bed of <pb

                    and have beautiful shady alleys, artificial ponds, an elegant little palace with
                    ceilings painted by Bacciarelli, several imperial villas, and a monument to
                    Sobieski. An artificial ruin on an island makes an open-air theatre, the stage
                    of which is separated from the auditorium by a channel of water, and the
                    decorations of which blend with the parks and the palace behind. Two other
                    public gardens, with alleys of old chestnut trees, are situated in the centre of
                    the city. One of these, the Saski Ogrod, or Saxon garden (17 acres), which has a
                    summer theatre and excellent fountains, and is richly adorned with statues and
                    flowers, is one of the most beautiful in Europe; it is the resort of the Warsaw
                    aristocracy. The Krasinski garden, now somewhat less frequented, and many other
                    smaller squares and gardens in the theatres of which Polish and German companies
                    give their summer representations, contribute very much to the enlivenment of
                    the streets of Warsaw; while the variety of smart national costumes still worn
                    by the Polish peasantry gives colour and brightness to the crowds which throng
                    them.</p>
                <p>Warsaw is semicircular in plan, the diameter, nearly 5 miles in length, lying
                    along the Vistula. The central point of the life of the place is the castle
                    (Zamek Królewski) on Sigismund Square. It was built by the dukes of Mazovia,
                    enlarged by Sigismund III. (whose memorial stands opposite) and Ladislaus IV.,
                    and embellished by Stanislaus Augustus. At present it is inhabited by the
                    “governor-general of the provinces on the Vistula,” and its pictures and other
                    art treasures have been removed to St Petersburg. Four main thoroughfares
                    radiate from it: one, the Krakow-skie Przedmiescie, the best street in Warsaw,
                    runs southward. It is continued by the Nowy Swiat and the Ujazdowska Aleja
                    avenue, which leads to the Łazienki gardens. Many fine buildings are found in
                    these two streets:—the church of the Bernardine convent; the house of the
                    benevolent society; the Carmelite church, now closed, where the crown archives
                    of Poland are still kept; the rich Radziwill palace, now inhabited by the
                    governor-general; the university, Saxon Square, on which Nicholas I. ordered the
                    erection of a memorial to the Polish generals who refused to take part in the
                    insurrection of 1831 and were therefore shot by the insurgents; the Saxon garden
                    behind the square; the fine palaces of the Potockis, the Oginskis, the Uruskis,
                    &amp;c.; the church of the Holy Cross, erected in 1682-96, the richest in
                    Warsaw; the palace of the Krasinskis, with library and museum; the statue of
                    Copernicus, by Thorwaldsen, erected in 1822 by national subscription; the house
                    of the friends of natural history, now a gymnasium; the palace of the Zamojskis,
                    now confiscated and transformed into a building for subalterns of the garrison;
                    the church of St Alexander, erected to commemorate the re-establishment of the
                    kingdom of Poland; and the deaf and dumb asylum. The Ujazdowska Aleja avenue,
                    planted with lime-trees and surrounded by cafés and various places of amusement,
                    is the Champs Elysées of Warsaw. It leads to the Łazienki park, and to the
                    Belvedere palace, now the summer residence of the governor-general, and farther
                    west to the Mokotowski parade ground, which is surrounded on the south and west
                    by the smoky chimneys of the manufacturing district. Another great street, the
                    Marszałkowska, runs parallel to the Ujazdowska from the Saxon garden to this
                    parade ground, on the south-east of which are the Russian barracks. The
                    above-mentioned streets are crossed by another series running west and east, the
                    chief of them being the Senaterska, which begins at Sigismund Square and
                    contains the best shops. The palace of the archbishops of Gnesen and primates of
                    Poland, confiscated by the Prussian Government, and now used by the ministry of
                    education, the bank of Poland, the fine mansion-house burned in 1863 and now
                    rebuilt as police bureau, the small Pod Blachoi palace, now occupied by a
                    chancery, the theatre, the old mint, the chief postoffice, the beautiful
                    Reformed church, the exchange, the school of subaltern officers, and several
                    palaces are grouped in Senators’ Street, which is joined from the north by
                    Miodowa Street, in which are situated the fine church of the Capuchins, erected
                    in 1683 to commemorate the victory of John Sobieski over the Turks, the palace
                    of the archbishops of Warsaw, and the Russian cathedral.</p>
                <p>To the west Senators’ Street is continued by Electors’ Street, where is the very
                    elegant modern church of St Charles Borromeo and the Chłodna leading to the
                    suburb of Wola, with a large field where the kings of Poland used to be elected.
                    In Leshno Street, which branches off from Senators’ Street, are the Zelazna
                    Brama, or Iron Gate, in the market-place, the gostinyi dvor or bazaar, the
                    arsenal, and the Wielopolski barracks. The cemeteries, the summer barracks of
                    the troops (Powonzski lager), and the artillery barracks lie to the
                    north-west.</p>
                <p>To the north of Sigismund Square is the old town—Staro Miasto —the Jewish
                    quarter, and farther north still the Alexandrovsk citadel. The old town very
                    much recalls old Germany by its narrow streets and old buildings; it has the
                    church of St John at its entrance, and farther down the cathedral, which is the
                    oldest church of Warsaw, having been built in the 13th century and restored in
                    the 17th. The citadel, erected in 1832-35 as a punishment for the insurrection
                    of 1831, is of the old type, with six forts too close to the walls of the
                    fortress to be useful in modern warfare. The railway bridge, built in 1865 and
                    570 yards long, begins under the Avails of the citadel and is protected on the
                    right bank of the Vistula by the Sliwnicki <hi rend="italic">tête de
                    pont.</hi></p>
                <p>The suburb of Praga, on the right bank of the Vistula, is poorly built and often
                    flooded; but the bloody assaults which led to its capture in 1794 by the
                    Russians under Suwaroff, and in 1831 by Paskevitch, give it a name in
                    history.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Industry and Trade.—</hi> Warsaw has of late become
                    industrially important, and now has more than 320 establishments employing
                    nearly 20,000 workmen, and producing to the amount of nearly 40 million roubles
                    annually. The leading industries are the production of plated silver ware, with
                    a wide market throughout Russia, machinery and engines, chemicals, musical
                    instruments, especially pianos, carpets, boots, and shoes, largely exported,
                    carriages, woollen cloth, leather wares, spirits, and beer. The trade of Warsaw
                    is considerable. Nearly 14,000,000 cwts. of coal and 4,800,000 cwts. of
                    miscellaneous goods are imported by rail from the soutli-west (Kielce, Łodz, and
                    Galicia),’and 3,200,000 cwts. of manufactured goods, corn, flax, &amp;c., are
                    exported in the same direction. Corn and flax are imported to the amount of
                    7,000,000 cwts. from the south-east and east, and exported to Prussia to the
                    amount of 5,300,000 cwts. by rail and partly down the Vistula, while the total
                    railway traffic is represented by 34,400,000 cwts. of merchandise brought in and
                    18,000,000 cwts. sent away. To all this must be added the traffic on the Vistula
                    (about 3,000,000 cwts. ). A great proportion of the trade is in the hands of
                    Germans, especially of Jews.</p>
                <p>The suburbs of Warsaw are surrounded by villas, palaces, and battlefields.
                    Wilanow, the palace of John Sobieski, now belonging to the Potockis, was partly
                    built by Turkish prisoners in a fine Italian style, and is now renowned for its
                    historical portraits and pictures. It is situated to the south of Warsaw,
                    together with many other fine villas (Morysin, Natolin, Krolikarnia, which also
                    has a picture gallery, &amp;c. ). The Marymont, an old country residence of the
                    wife of John Sobieski, and the Kaskada, much visited by the inhabitants of
                    Warsaw, in the north, the Saska Kempa on the right bank of the Vistula, and the
                    castle of Jabłona down the Vistula are among others that deserve mention.</p>
                <p>The events associated with the name of Praga have been already alluded to. Among
                    other battlefields in the neighbourhood of Warsaw is that of Grochowo, where the
                    Polish troops were defeated in 1831 after a gallant fight. Raszyn saw its fields
                    covered with blood in the war of 1809 with Austria; at Maciejowice, 50 miles up
                    the Vistula, Kosciuszko was wounded and taken by the Russians in 1794; and 20
                    miles down the river stands the fortress of Modlin, now Novogeorgievsk,
                    fortified by Napoleon, taken in 1813 by the Russians, aud the last stronghold of
                    the Poles during the insurrection of 1831.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The history of Warsaw from the 16th century
                    onwards is intimately connected with that of <hi rend="smallcaps">Poland
                    (</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> q.v.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">).</hi> The
                    precise date of the foundation of the town is not known. The banks of the
                    Vistula between the Pilica and the Narew must have been inhabited from a very
                    early period, and it is supposed that Conrad, duke of Mazovia, erected a castle
                    on the present site of Warsaw as early as the 9th century. Casimir the Just is
                    supposed to have fortified it in the 11th century, but Warsaw is not mentioned
                    in annals before 1224. Until 1526 it was the residence of the dukes of Mazovia,
                    but when their dynasty was extinguished the land of the Mazurs, till then
                    independent, was annexed to Poland. When Poland and Lithuania became united, it
                    was chosen as the royal residence. Sigismund Augustus (Wasa) made it the real
                    capital of Poland, and from 1572 onwards the election of the kings of Poland
                    took place on the field of Wola. From the 17th century possession of it was
                    continually disputed by the Swedes, the Russians, and the Brandenburgers and the
                    Austrians. Charles Gustavus of Sweden took it in 1655 and kept it for a year;
                    the Poles retook it in July 1656 but lost it again almost immediately. Augustus
                    II. and Augustus III. did much for its embellishment, but it had much to suffer
                    during the northern war. Charles XII. took it in 1702, but in the following year
                    peace was made between the Swedes and Stanislaus Lezczynski, and it became free
                    again. The disorderly rule of the Rzec Pospolita opened a large field for
                    Russian intrigue, and in 1764 the Russians took possession of it and secured the
                    election of Stanislaus Poniatowski, which led in 1773 to the first partition of
                    Poland. In November 1794 the Russians took it again, after the bloody assault on
                    Praga, but next year, in the third partition of Poland, Warsaw was given to
                    Prussia. In November 1806 the town was occupied by the troops of Napoleon, and

                    independent duchy of Warsaw; hut the Austrians took it on April 21, 1809, and
                    kept it till June 2, when it once more became independent, but only for a few
                    years. The Russians finally took it on February 8, 1813, since which time they
                    have always retained it. On November 29, 1830, Warsaw gave the signal of the
                    great but unsuccessful insurrection which lasted nearly one year; it was taken
                    after great bloodshed by Paskevitch, on September 7, 1831. Deportations on a
                    large scale, executions, and confiscation of the domains of the nobility
                    followed, and until 1856 Warsaw remained under severe military rule. In 1862 a
                    series of demonstrations began to be made in Warsaw in favour of the
                    independence of Poland, and after a bloody repression a general insurrection
                    followed in January 1863, the Russians remaining, however, masters of the
                    situation. The Russian Government now decided to take the most stringent
                    measures to crush the powers of the clergy, the landed nobility, and the
                    turbulent Warsaw artisans and educated classes. Executions, banishment to the
                    convict prisons of Siberia, and confiscation of estates followed. Deportation to
                    Siberia and the interior of Russia was carried out on an unheard-of scale.
                    Scientific societies and high schools were closed; monasteries and nunneries
                    were emptied. Hundreds of Russian officials were called in to fill up
                    administrative posts, the schools, and the university; the Russian language was
                    rendered obligatory in official acts, in all legal proceedings, and even, to a
                    great extent, in trade. The very name of Poland was expunged from official
                    writings, and, while the old institutions were abolished, the Russian tribunals
                    and administrative institutions were introduced. The serfs were liberated. See

                <p>Officially, Warsaw is now simply the chief town of the government of Warsaw, the
                    residence of the governor-general of the provinces on the Vistula and the
                    commander of the Warsaw military district, and the see of the Roman and Greek
                    archbishops. But it continues to be the heart of the Polish nationality. (P. A.
