                    of Orange,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For some
                    account of this family, see <hi rend="smallcaps">Holland,</hi> vol. xii. pp. 74
                    and 79 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi></p></note> was the son of William IL,
                    stadtholder of the United Netherlands, and Mary, daughter of Charles I. of
                    England. He was born on 14th November 1650. His father died eight days before
                    his birth, whereupon the states-general abolished the office of stadtholder. As
                    he grew up, William became the head of the party, at once democratic and
                    monarchical, which was attached to the house of Orange. But all power was
                    concentrated in the hands of John de Witt and other leaders of the rival or
                    aristocratic republican party. Hence William learned caution, reserve, insight
                    into character, and the art of biding his time.</p>
                <p>When, however, France and England declared war upon the Netherlands in the spring
                    of 1672, the rapid success of the French arms, and the rejection by Louis of the
                    terms offered by the Dutch Government, produced a revolution in favour of
                    William. A popular rising obliged De Witt to repeal the perpetual edict (which
                    ratified the suppression of the stadtholdership in 1667), and on 8th July 1672
                    the prince of Orange was declared by the states-general stadtholder,
                    captain-general, and admiral for life. The revolution was followed by a riot in
                    which John and Cornelius de Witt lost their lives. There appears no evidence
                    connecting William with the attack on the De Witts; but he made no attempt to
                    punish it: on the contrary, he rewarded the leaders. Then, rejecting the
                    outrageous terms offered by the allies, he placed his private fortune and the
                    revenues of his offices at the disposal of the state, and declared himself ready
                    to die in the last ditch. In order to check the French advance the sluices were
                    opened and vast tracts of country placed under water. The Dutch fleet prevented
                    an English landing. An alliance was made with the elector of Brandenburg, whose
                    forces effected a useful diversion on the eastern frontier. Next year (1673)
                    William lost Maestricht, but he more than balanced this disaster by treaties
                    with Spain and the empire. Tlιe war now began to turn in his favour. Early in
                    1674 the French troops evacuated Holland, and in February of the same year peace
                    was made with England in the treaty of Westminster. As the tide turned,
                    William’s allies became more active in his behalf. The league of The Hague, the
                    first of those great coalitions by which he sought to set a limit to the
                    aggressions of Louis XIV., was joined by the elector of Brandenburg, who had
                    been obliged a year <pb break="no"

                    several other German princes. In Flanders William himself opposed Condé and
                    fought the indecisive battle of Seneffe (August 1674). For the next two years
                    the war dragged on without very important results. William, although he had
                    saved Holland, could not prevent France from winning places at the expense of
                    the empire and Spain. In April 1677 he was decisively beaten by the duke of
                    Orleans near St Omer. A great part of the Spanish Netherlands as well as Franche
                    Comté was now in the hands of France. These advances caused much alarm in
                    England; and the prince of Orange linked himself closer to that country by
                    marrying Mary, elder daughter of James, duke of York, in November 1677. Early
                    next year William signed a treaty of alliance with England, the object of which
                    was to compel Louis to come to terms. The duplicity of Charles and the attitude
                    of the country party in England, anxious for war with France but unwilling to
                    put an army into the king’s hands, prevented this arrangement from taking
                    effect. A fresh treaty was, however, made between the two powers (July), and the
                    pressure thus brought to bear upon Louis led to the peace of Nimeguen (August
                    1678). Four days after the peace was signed William attacked the French army
                    under the duke of Luxembourg in its entrenchments round Mons. A sanguinary but
                    resultless battle ensued. William attempted to justify this bloodshed by the
                    insufficient and incredible plea that he was not aware that the peace had been
                    signed. He can hardly have wished to prolong the war; but it is not surprising
                    if he was dissatisfied with a peace which gave Franche Comté and many places in
                    the Spanish Netherlands to France.</p>
                <p>During the years which immediately followed the peace of Nimeguen, Louis’s
                    aggressive proceedings provoked a general uneasiness, of which the prince of
                    Orange made skilful use. The French king had seized on William’s ancestral
                    principality of Orange in the south of France. William declared publicly that he
                    would make Louis repent the outrage, and when called on to withdraw his words
                    refused to do so. Personal affront was thus added to the national grounds of his
                    hostility. The second of his coalitions against France began by a treaty between
                    the Netherlands and Sweden (October 1681) for the maintenance of the peace of
                    Nimeguen, which was soon joined by the empire and Spain, and by several of the
                    German states. When, however, Louis declared war on Spain, invaded the Spanish
                    Netherlands, and even took Luxemburg (1683-84), William could not persuade the
                    states-general to raise an army, and the allied powers acquiesced in the truce
                    of Ratisbon, which left the French king in possession of all that he had won
                    (1685). Certain claims on the Palatinate which Louis urged on behalf of his
                    sister-in-law, the duchess of Orleans, gave William an occasion for organizing a
                    further combination against him. In July 1686 the emperor, with the kings of
                    Spain and Sweden, acting as members of the empire, and the most important German
                    princes entered into the league of Augsburg, which, however, William did not
                    himself join.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, as heir presumptive to the English throne, he paid close attention to
                    what was passing in England. He sought to win Charles by sheltering the duke of
                    Monmouth during the exile to which his father had unwillingly condemned him. The
                    same motives led him to dismiss the duke when James II. succeeded his brother,
                    and to discourage the attempt which Monmouth made to win the crown. He also
                    endeavoured to stop Argyll and his friends when they were setting out for
                    England; and he tried to dissuade Monmouth from his rash expedition, and to
                    induce him to take service against the Turks in Hungary, and, when this failed,
                    he sought, with as little success, to prevent his crossing to England.
                    Throughout the whole crisis he showed a scrupulous regard for the interests of
                    his father-in-law, which fortunately coincided with his own; but at the same
                    time he astutely avoided any step which would have alienated from him the
                    constitutional party. When, however, James II. began to show himself in his true
                    colours, William became the head of the opposition in England. As such, he
                    strongly disapproved of the first Declaration of Indulgence (1686) and
                    remonstrated with James on the unconstitutional nature of his act. When the king
                    requested him, a year later, to place Papists instead of Protestants in command
                    of the English regiments then in the service of Holland, he declined to do so,
                    and rejected with equal firmness a demand from James that he should send the
                    troops back to England. Nevertheless he refused to listen to Mordaunt’s
                    premature suggestion that he should undertake an invasion in 1686, and, even
                    when Edward Russell visited him at The Hague (May 1688), he was unwilling to
                    move till he was assured that the majority of the nation would be with him. The
                    letter, signed by seven leaders of the two great English parties, which Admiral
                    Herbert carried to Holland (June 30) set his scruples at rest.</p>
                <p>On 30th September he issued a declaration in which he recapitulated James’s
                    unconstitutional acts, and stated that he was coming to England in order to
                    secure the assembling of a free parliament, by whose decision he was resolved to
                    abide. On 2d November he sailed from Holland, and three days later landed at
                    Torbay. At first only few persons joined him, but presently the gentry began to
                    come in. James, who had massed his troops at Salisbury, was compelled by
                    William’s advance and by the desertion of Churchill and others to fall back upon
                    London. Here he attempted to treat with the invader. William, anxious to avoid
                    all appearance of conquest, consented to negotiate, and it was agreed that a
                    parliament should be summoned, both armies meanwhile holding aloof. James,
                    however, attempted to leave the country, but was stopped and returned to
                    Whitehall. For a moment he seemed to contemplate resistance, but William now
                    insisted on his retiring from London. His final flight relieved the prince of a
                    great difficulty. On 19th December William arrived in London, and at once called
                    a meeting of peers and others who had sat in the parliaments of Charles H.’s
                    reign. By their advice he summoned a convention, which met on 22d January 1689
                    and settled the crown on William and Mary, who, after accepting the Declaration
                    of Rights, were on 13th February proclaimed king and queen.</p>
                <p>The revolution had so far succeeded beyond expectation; but William’s
                    difficulties had only begun. His primary object was to bring England into the
                    field against France. But he had first to secure his own throne, which was still
                    endangered by resistance in Scotland and Ireland; in order to do it with effect
                    he had to gain the good will of the English parliament and to harmonize or
                    control its two great factions, which, momentarily united by the imminence of
                    despotism, were again almost on the verge of civil war. He wished to be superior
                    to party, which he could only become by being independent of parliament, and
                    this the revolution had rendered impossible. The revolution was due mainly to
                    the Whigs, who were therefore William’s natural allies; but the political
                    principles of the Whigs led them to curtail the power of the sovereign. The
                    principles of the Tories were much more to his taste; but the Tories were
                    disinclined to apply their principles on behalf of a sovereign whose title they
                    could not conscientiously acknowledge. In selecting his first ministry William
                    endeavoured to conciliate both sides and to hold the balance even. He eventually
                    saw that such a policy was impracticable, and that, the nation having arrived at
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n615/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0615-0580"/> its majority, ministers must represent the party
                    which was strongest in parliament. His natural reluctance to recognize this
                    change, or to give up any of the powers which his predecessors had possessed,
                    led to not unfrequent collisions with parliament and exposed him to some
                    humiliation, while the struggle between the two parties at times reduced him to
                    despair, and constantly hampered his action on the Continent.</p>
                <p>For nearly a year and a half after William’s acceptance of the crown he was
                    occupied in forming the coalition against Louis XIV. known as the Grand
                    Alliance. As stadtholder of the United Netherlands, William had already entered
                    into an alliance with the emperor. In December he joined the league as king of
                    England, and in 1690 the coalition was completed by the adhesion of Spain,
                    Brandenburg, and Savoy. William had thus gained his first great object: he had
                    united Europe against the Bourbon. Meanwhile, however, his arms had made little
                    progress in Scotland and Ireland. James had landed in Ireland in March 1689 and
                    nearly the whole island was in his hands. The relief of Londonderry (July) and
                    the battle of Newtown Butler (August) saved the north for William, but elsewhere
                    Schomberg could make no way. In Scotland the convention had offered the crowm to
                    William and Mary; but in the battle of Killiecrankie (July) the clans under
                    Dundee had routed William’s army. The convention, which shortly after his
                    accession had been turned into a parliament, met for its second session in the
                    autumn of 1689, and the two parties quarrelled so violently over the Corporation
                    and Indemnity Bills that William threatened to leave the country. He was induced
                    by Nottingham and Shrewsbury to give up this intention, but in January 1690 he
                    dissolved the parliament. William put an end to the quarrel about the indemnity
                    by issuing an Act of Grace, which gave an almost complete amnesty; and, after
                    placing the government in the hands of the queen and a council of nine persons,
                    he left for Ireland. The defeat of the English and Dutch fleets off Beachy Head
                    and the repulse of the allied forces at Fleurus (June and July 1690) were severe
                    blows to William’s hopes; but the former led to no important results and the
                    latter was more than balanced by the victory which William won at the battle of
                    the Boyne (1st July 1690). James fled from the country, and William entered
                    Dublin in triumph. In September he returned to England, leaving Marlborough to
                    conquer the south of Ireland in a short but brilliant campaign. Meanwhile the
                    resistance in Scotland had collapsed, and Mackay reduced the Highlands to
                    tranquillity. In 1691 William was able to go abroad and to take the command in
                    Flanders, where, however, his efforts were unsuccessful.</p>
                <p>The next year (1692) opened with the massacre of Glencoe. It is improbable that,
                    in signing an order for the “extirpation” of the Macdonalds, he intended that
                    the order should be literally executed. Nevertheless, the order came from him,
                    and he cannot be acquitted of all blame. About the same time the insecurity of
                    his position was shown by the discovery of Marlborough’s treachery; and
                    Marlborough did not stand alone. While many whom William trusted or appeared to
                    trust were intriguing with James, an invasion of England was being organized by
                    the French Government. Fortunately, and in great measure owing to the politic
                    conduct of Mary, the commanders of the fleet were induced to stand firm, and the
                    great victory of La Hogue (19th May 1692) put a stop to the projected invasion.
                    But the fortune of war went against William on the Continent. He could not save
                    Nàmur from the French, and he was severely defeated in an attempt to surprise
                    the duke of Luxembourg at Steenkerke (4th August 1692). Next year he was again
                    beaten by the same commander at Neerwinden (19th July). The battle of La Hogue
                    had not given England the command of the seas, and French privateers inflicted
                    great damage on English trade. In June 1693 the Smyrna fleet was almost entirely
                    destroyed off Cape St Vincent.</p>
                <p>In spite of these reverses William struggled on with indomitable courage, and he
                    was well supported by the country. Parliament, under the skilful guidance of
                    Montague, adopted various important financial measures to meet the expenses of
                    the war. The land-tax was re-assessed, the national debt created, the Bank of
                    England established, and the coinage renewed (1693-95). In 1694 William
                    confirmed the parliamentary system by giving his consent, though an unwilling
                    consent, to the Triennial Act, and he recognized the principles of ministerial
                    government by modifying the ministry, until in 1696 it was in thorough harmony
                    with the parliamentary majority. In 1695 William won his first important success
                    on the Continent by recovering Namur, and, though no advance was made by the
                    allies next year, the exhaustion of France was becoming more and more evident.
                    At length, in March 1697, a congress met at Ryswick, and in September peace was
                    made. Louis was obliged to give up all (with the exception of Strasburg) that he
                    had added to his dominions since 1678, and he recognized William as king of
                    England. With the conclusion of the war the dread of a standing army revived in
                    England, and, much to William’s disgust, a vote of parliament reduced the
                    military force to 10,000 men, although the question of the Spanish succession
                    (see vol. ix. p. 580) was pending. The new parliament which met early in 1699
                    reduced the army still further and resolved that it should consist solely of
                    English troops, thus compelling William to dismiss his favourite Dutch guards.
                    They went on to institute an inquiry into the manner in which the forfeited
                    estates in Ireland had been disposed of, and in their second session (November
                    1699) they passed a bill for the “resumption” of these estates. William died on
                    8th March 1702 from the consequences of a fall from his horse on 20th
                    February.</p>
