                <p><label type="entry">WORKINGTON</label>, a seaport and market-town of Cumberland,
                    England, on the south bank of the Derwent, where it enters the Solway Firth, and
                    on several branch railway lines, 34 miles south-west of Carlisle and 311 miles
                    from London by rail. The Derwent is crossed by a stone bridge of three arches
                    erected in 1841. In the more ancient portions of the town the streets are narrow
                    and irregular, but there are now many spacious streets with handsome houses and
                    shops. The ancient parish church of St Michael was rebuilt in 1770, and, this
                    building having been destroyed by fire in 1887, another is now (1888) in course
                    of erection. The other public buildings are the jubilee hall, the
                    assembly-rooms, the temperance hall, the mechanics’ institute, the infirmary,
                    the new covered market, the custom-house, and the bonded warehouses. Near the
                    town is Workington Hall, the seat of the ancient lords of the manor, a
                    quadrilateral castellated structure in great part modern, but still retaining
                    some of the ancient rooms, including that in which Mary queen of Scots is said
                    to have slept when she escaped to England after the battle of Langside in May
                    1568. The harbour is remarkably safe, and has been improved by the construction
                    of a breakwater 600 feet in length. The Lonsdale dock, 4⅜ acres in extent, was
                    opened in 1862. In 1886 37 vessels in the foreign and colonial trade (19,806
                    tons) entered the port, and 24 cleared (10,495 tons); 1687 in the coasting-trade
                    entered (197,487 tons), and 1682 cleared (206,404 tons). The value of the
                    exports of the produce of the United Kingdom in 1882 was £181,012, but in 1885
                    it was only £13,845, and in 1886 it was £38,468. The chief exports are pig-iron,
                    lime, coal, steel rails, and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n718/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0718-0677"/> steel plates. The value of the imports of foreign
                    and colonial merchandise in 1882 was £57,512, but since then it has declined,
                    and was only £18,282 in 1885, and £27,448 in 1886. A considerable proportion of
                    the imports are, however, from the ports of the United Kingdom, the principal
                    items being iron-ore and moulding-sand. In the neighbourhood there are large
                    collieries, but the chief industry is the manufacture of iron and steel by the
                    Bessemer and Siemens process. There are large blast-furnaces, engineering works,
                    and bolt and rivet and tinplate works. Iron shipbuilding is also carried on: 2
                    vessels were built in 1886, of 3986 tons. The population of the urban sanitary
                    district (area 641 acres) in 1871 was 7979, which by 1881 had increased to
                    13,308. In 1882 the area was extended to embrace 3463 acres, the population of
                    that area in 1871 being 8413, which by 1881 had increased to 14,371. The town is
                    about to be incorporated (1888).</p>
