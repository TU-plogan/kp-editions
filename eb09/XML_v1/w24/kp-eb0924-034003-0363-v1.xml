                    1170- <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> 1230), the most illustrious of the German
                    minnesänger, was born in Tyrol between 1165 and 1170. He belonged to a noble
                    family, but had no hereditary possessions. At an early age he seems to have
                    given evidence of an aptitude for poetry, and his genius was developed under the
                    influence of the older poet Reinmar, whom he soon far surpassed. His earliest
                    patron was the young and brilliant Duke Frederick of Austria, at whose court in
                    Vienna he spent several years. After Duke Frederick’s death Walther betook
                    himself to King Philip, at whose coronation in Mainz, on the 8th September 1198,
                    he was present. King Philip appreciated his genius, but nothing is definitely
                    known as to their relations to one another, or as to the causes which brought
                    their connexion to an end. After a short stay at the court of Duke Leonhard of
                    Carinthia Walther went to Eisenach, where poets were always welcomed by the
                    landgrave Hermann. Here he remained until 1211, when the landgrave, in deference
                    to the pope, joined some other princes in an attempt to secure the crown for the
                    prince afterwards known as Frederick II. Walther, who disapproved of this
                    policy, soon afterwards entered the service of the emperor Otho; but, the
                    emperor having proved unfriendly towards him, he associated himself with the
                    cause of Frederick, who greatly pleased him by granting him a small fief near
                    Würzburg, thereby gratifying a wish the poet had often expressed. He might now
                    have led a settled life, but he had so long <pb break="no"

                    was apparently hard for him to live without the excitement of travel and
                    adventure. In 1217 he was at the court of Duke Leopold of Austria, after whose
                    departure for the Holy Land he appears to have been received first by the duke’s
                    uncle, Henry of Medlik, then by Berthold of Andechs, the patriarch of Aquileia.
                    On the return of Duke Leopold Walther again spent some time with him; but in
                    1220 he joined the retinue of the imperial vicar Engelbert of Cologne and
                    Frederick Ii.’s son, Henry, to whom he seems to have acted as tutor. In 1224
                    Walther retired to Würzburg, where, although living in privacy, he watched
                    closely the course of public affairs. He may have taken part in the crusade of
                    1228, but he certainly did not reach Palestine. He died about 1230 at Würzburg,
                    where, under a tree in the Laurence garden of the new minster, a stone was long
                    pointed out as that which, according to tradition, marked his grave. A new
                    monument to him was erected at Würzburg in 1843, and a statue of him was
                    unveiled at Innsbruck in 1877.</p>
                <p>Walther von der Vogelweide was a poet not only of exquisite sensibility, but of a
                    frank, independent, and manly character. He lived in a troubled age, when church
                    and state were often in deadly conflict. In this struggle, in which he took keen
                    interest, his sympathy was wholly with the imperial cause, and he did much to
                    influence opinion by the vigour with which he attacked the extravagant
                    pretensions of the papacy. While defending the rights of secular rulers, he did
                    not forget their duties, and many of his verses—considering the period to which
                    they belong—display a remarkably clear and generous conception of the principles
                    of humanity and freedom. In writing of love, the favourite subject of the
                    minnesänger, he had all the brightness, freshness, and gaiety of the best of his
                    contemporaries, and he excelled them in his delicate appreciation of the noblest
                    womanly qualities. His love of nature, especially in the season of spring, was
                    an essential element of his intellectual and emotional life, and gives an
                    enduring charm to the poems in which it is incidentally or indirectly expressed.
                    He was a master of all the forms of verse used in Middle High German, and the
                    perfection of his rhythm and diction, combined with the depth and wide range of
                    his ideas, secures for him an enduring place in the front rank of the lyrical
                    poets of his country.</p>
                <p>A critical edition of his poems was issued by Lachmann in 1827, and there have
                    been later editions by Wackernagel, Rieger, and Pfeiffer. There are renderings
                    into modern German by Simrock, Koch, and Weiske. An admirable biography of the
                    poet was written by Uhland (1S22). Biographical and critical studies have also
                    been written by Reuss, Rieger, Menzel, and Böse.</p>
