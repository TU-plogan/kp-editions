                <p><label type="entry">WELLINGBOROUGH</label>, a market-town of Northamptonshire,
                    England, is situated on the declivity of a hill near the junction of the Ise
                    with the Nen, and on the London and North-Western and Midland railway lines, 63½
                    miles north-north-west of London, and 10½ east-north-east of Northampton. The
                    church of St Luke contains some Norman and Early English portions, with later
                    work of various periods, and a Decorated western tower and spire. The
                    grammar-schools, founded in 1594 and endowed with the revenues of a suppressed
                    guild, include a school of the second and a school of the third grade, the
                    former a building of red brick in the Renaissance style erected in 1880 at a
                    cost of £6000, and the latter an old Elizabethan structure. Another educational
                    endowment is Freeman’s school, founded by John Freeman in 1711. There are also
                    several charities. The market-place, situated in the centre of the town, was
                    founded in 1874. The principal public buildings include the corn exchange
                    (erected in 1861 at a cost of £4000), and the “Priory,” an old residence now
                    used for Sunday school and other parochial purposes. Formerly the town was famed
                    for the chalybeate springs to which it owes its name. It is now of some
                    importance as a centre of agricultural trade; but the staple industry is
                    leather. A great impulse to the prosperity of the town was given by the
                    introduction of the boot and shoe trade, especially the manufacture of uppers.
                    Smelting, brewing, and iron-founding are also carried on, as well as the
                    manufacture of portable steam-engines. A coal depôt of the <pb break="no"

                    population of the township and urban sanitary district (area 3992 acres) in 1871
                    was 9385 and in 1881 it was 13,794.</p>
                <p>In 948 Edred gave the church at Wellingborough to Croyland abbey, and the grant
                    was confirmed by King Edgar in 966. In the reign of Edward II. the abbot was
                    lord in full. It received the grant of a market in the 2d year of King John. In
                    1621 it was visited by Charles I. and his queen, who resided in tents during a
                    whole season that they might drink the waters. It was after its almost total
                    destruction by fire in 1738 that the town was built on its present site on the
                    hill.</p>
