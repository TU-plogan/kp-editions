                <p><label type="entry">WHITSTABLE</label>, a watering-place and seaport of Kent,
                    England, is situated on the south side of the Thames estuary and on the South
                    Eastern and the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway lines, 6 miles
                    north-north-west of Canterbury and 62 south-south-east of London. It consists
                    chiefly of one main street, about a mile in length, and two narrower streets
                    parallel with it, built on an embankment. The church of All Saints, in the
                    Decorated and Perpendicular styles, possesses some old brasses; it was restored
                    in 1875. The other principal buildings are the institute for literature,
                    science, and art (in connexion with which there are a library, museum, and
                    aquarium), the assembly rooms, the foresters’ hall, and the Wynn Ellis
                    almshouses. The “Street,” a low narrow ledge of shingle running for three
                    quarters of a mile towards the sea, forms a natural pier and promenade.
                    Whitstable has been famous for its oyster beds from time immemorial. The oysters
                    raised there greatly excel all others in delicacy oi flavour, and to economize
                    space spat from other beds is brought to Whitstable to mature. The lands are
                    held by a company of dredgers incorporated by Act of Parliament in 1793, the
                    affairs being administered by a foreman, deputy foreman, and jury of twelve men.
                    The less extensive Seasalter and Ham oyster fishery adjoins. Of late years the
                    productiveness of the beds has been declining, owing, it is said, to the
                    emptying of refuse and rubbish into the Thames. There is a considerable coasting
                    trade in coal in conjunction with the South Eastern Railway Company, who are the
                    owners of the harbour. The population of the township and parish (3601 acres) in
                    1871 was 4881 and 4882 in 1881. A portion of Seasalter is included in
                    Whitstable.</p>
                <p>Whitstable and Seasalter embrace what was formerly known as the “borough of
                    Harwich,” but its boundaries are not now recognizable. Some Roman remains have
                    been discovered. At Domesday the manor of Whitstable was held by Odo, bishop of
                    Bayeux. Subsequently it came by female descent to the earls of Athole, and
                    afterwards was several times in the hands of the crown, before it came to St
                    John, Viscount Bolingbroke. In modern times it was held by Wynn Ellis, who left
                    a valuable collection of paintings to the nation.</p>
