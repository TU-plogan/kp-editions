                    (1826-1871), best known by his <hi rend="italic">History of Philosophy,</hi> was
                    born on the 2 2d January 1826 at Leichlingen, in Rhenish Prussia, where his
                    father was Lutheran pastor. His mother, left early a widow, devoted her scanty
                    means to the education of her only son. Ueberweg passed through the gymnasium at
                    Elberfeld, and studied at the universities of Göttingen and Berlin. In 1852 he
                    qualified himself at Bonn as privatdocent in philosophy. His <hi rend="italic"
                    >System of Logic,</hi> published in 1857 (English translation 1871), and his
                    essay <hi rend="italic">On the Authenticity and the Order of the Platonic
                    Writings,</hi> crowned by the Imperial Academy of Vienna (published 1861),
                    contributed to draw attention to him as at once a scholar and a thinker. In 1862
                    he was called to Königsberg as extraordinary professor, and in 1867 he was
                    advanced to the ordinary grade. He married in 1863, and on the 9th June 1871 he
                    died prematurely.</p>
                <p>The chief work of his later years was his compendious <hi rend="italic">History
                    oj Philosophy,</hi> which is unmatched for fulness of information combined with
                    conciseness, accuracy, and impartiality of treatment. The first part appeared in
                    1862. An English translation, in two volumes, was published in 1872, and has
                    gone through several editions. Ueberweg translated, in 1869, Berkeley’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Principles oj Human Knowledge,</hi> with notes, for Kirchmann’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Philosophische Bibliothek.</hi> In philosophy Ueberweg was
                    strongly opposed to the subjectivistic tendency of the Kantian system,
                    maintaining in particular the objectivity of space and time, which involved him
                    in a somewhat violent controversy with several opponents. His own mode of
                    thought he prefeιτed to describe as an ideal realism, which refused to reduce
                    reality to thought, but asserted a parallelism between the forms of existence
                    and the forms of knowledge. Beneke and Schleiermacher seem to have exercised
                    most influence upon the development of his thought. A short memoir, by his
                    friend F. A. Lange (author of the <hi rend="italic">History of
                    Materialism),</hi> gives some account of what may be called personal opinions in
