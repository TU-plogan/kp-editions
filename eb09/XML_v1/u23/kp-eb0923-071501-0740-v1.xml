                <p>U holds the twenty-first place in our alphabet. The corresponding place in the
                    Greek alphabets was occupied by Y (with some slight variations of form). The
                    form in the Italian alphabets was generally V. These three are only
                    modifications of one original; but they are independent symbols with us, though
                    Y does not represent any sound otherwise unrepresented. It will be most
                    convenient to describe the three forms once for all.</p>
                <p>With T we reach the end of the original Phoenician alphabet. The remaining
                    symbols—no fewer than six with us, four in the completed Latin alphabet—are
                    accretions, either modifications of old symbols for greater exactness or old
                    symbols themselves which had fallen out of their proper place and were added
                    again. The first new symbol was needed to represent the important vowel sound
                    <hi rend="italic">u.</hi> We have already seen that the Greeks employed the
                    Phoenician symbols for the breaths which they did not want as symbols for the
                    vowels which they did want. Thus we should have expected that the Phoenician vau
                    would have been used for <hi rend="italic">u.</hi> But vau was already employed
                    for <hi rend="italic">w,</hi> which was a living sound in early Greek; the form
                    used was F (the so-called digamma), the origin of our F. What then was the
                    origin of the symbol for <hi rend="italic">u</hi>? In the earliest Greek we find
                    the two forms Y and V, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in inscriptions of Thera.
                    Now the Moabite form of vau is Y, which resembles the Y more than F. It is
                    difficult to see why the presumably oldest Phoenician form should appear, not in
                    the sixth place of the Greek alphabet, but at the end, where it must have been
                    an arbitrary addition; and, although the Y form could be derived from F (middle
                    steps are found), it is not easy to get F from Y. We may suppose that the two
                    symbols, F and Y, were obtained by the Greeks from independent Phoenician
                    alphabets, the first being kept by those Greeks who required a symbol for <hi
                    rend="italic">w,</hi> and did not at first need any special sign to distinguish
                    <hi rend="italic">u</hi> (which in the earliest Greek times known to us had the
                    value of German <hi rend="italic">u)</hi> from o; while the others took the form
                    Y to express the modified «, and probably never really adopted the F, except as
                    a numeral; it does not appear even in the very old Abu Simbel inscription
                    written by the Ionian mercenaries of Psammitichus. It is noteworthy that in that
                    inscription <hi rend="italic">both</hi> the forms Y and V appear, whereas in
                    those of Thera and Melos we have sometimes the one sometimes the other, but not
                    both in the same inscription, and a study of the writing leads to the conclusion
                    that the Y was felt to be the true <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> the older)
                    form, but that V was used more frequently for the sake of simplicity.</p>
                <p>At Rome the single form V denoted both the vowel <hi rend="italic">u</hi> and
                    also the consonantal <hi rend="italic">w.</hi> F retained its place as sixth in
                    the alphabet, but with the value of <hi rend="italic">f</hi> which was unknown
                    to the Greeks; a peculiar form, C, in which the middle stroke has gone to the
                    bottom, seems to have been affected by its neighbour E; this is found in
                    Etruscan, Umbrian, and Samnite inscriptions; it has, however, the value of <hi
                    rend="italic">w</hi>; while a curious symbol 8 appears at the end of the
                    Etruscan alphabet, and is also used in the Eugubine tables, with the value of /;
                    the origin of this is uncertain. It may be a rounded form of the second symbol
                    in the digraph F0 <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> FH) by which the sound F is
                    indicated in a very old inscription (see <hi rend="italic">Rhein.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Mus.,</hi> xlii. 317); if this is so, the Latin alphabet has the
                    first member of the digraph, the Etruscan has the second. Next, the symbol Y was
                    added (together with Z) in the 1st century B.c. to represent more exactly, in
                    borrowed words, the sound of Greek upsilon.</p>
                <p>Lastly, the form U was differentiated from V. It is the uncial form, and so
                    belongs to the general transition from the pointed to the rounded character
                    which conduced to greater convenience of writing. Examples of it may be seen in
                    the article on <hi rend="smallcaps">Palaeography</hi>; see the specimen of Latin
                    uncial of the 5th or 6th century (vol. xviii. p. 153), and the half-uncial of
                    the Lindisfarne Gospels, about 700 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(fbid.,</hi> p. 159). It was clearly a matter of convenience to
                    have separate symbols to represent sounds so distinct as <hi rend="italic"
                    >u</hi> and <hi rend="italic">v</hi>; but the application of the two symbols
                    seems to have been due to chance rather than design. The form V remained in use
                    at the beginning of words, whereas <hi rend="italic">u,</hi> which was the
                    uncial and cursive form, naturally was used rather in the middle; by degrees the
                    initial form was appropriated to consonants,— perhaps, as Dr Taylor suggests <hi
                    rend="italic">(Alphabet,</hi> ii. 189), because the consonant is commoner at the
                    beginning of words, or for some other reason, while the medial form was
                    connected with vowels.</p>
                <p>The sound which U denotes is produced by “rounding” the lips to the furthest
                    extent consistent with a clear vowel-sound, and by raising the back of the
                    tongue higher than for any other rounded sound. It has two varieties (like all
                    other vowels) according as the position of the tongue is more or less tense,
                    producing thereby a narrower or a wider aperture for the voice to pass through;
                    whence the sounds are technically called “narrow” and “wide” respectively. The
                    narrow sound is heard in English only when the vowel is long, as in “book,”
                    “rule,” but in northern English (Scotch) “book” may be heard short. The wide
                    sound is heard in “full,” “good.” The digraph <hi rend="italic">oo</hi> is
                    commonly used for the <hi rend="italic">u</hi> sound, and attests the fact that
                    the original sound of <hi rend="italic">o</hi> has frequently passed into <hi
                    rend="italic">ü,</hi> as in “good,” “food,” &amp;c., written “gode,” “fode” in
                    Middle English; sometimes, however, the <hi rend="italic">oo</hi> has come by
                    analogy into words where <hi rend="italic">û</hi> is the original sound, as in
                    “room,” M.E. “roum,” O.E. “rum.” Original <hi rend="italic">ü</hi> has commonly
                    passed into the <hi rend="italic">au</hi> sound, spelt in English <hi
                    rend="italic">ou</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ow,</hi> as in “how,” “house,”
                    “mouse,” “bower,” for O.E. “hù,” “hüs,” “mùs,” “bur.” According to Mr A. J.
                    Ellis, words derived from the French had in Chaucer’s time the sound of French
                    <hi rend="italic">u</hi>; and Sir John Cheke’s statement “cum <hi rend="italic"
                    >dulce, tuke, lute, rebuke, 8υκ, τνκ,</hi> λυτ, <hi rend="italic">ρeβυκ</hi>
                    dicimus, Graecum υ sonaremus,” seems strong for the same practice in the 16th
                    century. In the 17th century the modern pronunciation of <hi rend="italic"
                    >u</hi> as <hi rend="italic">iu</hi> in “muse,” “duke,” “mute,” “pure” had come
                    in. Hence also we may explain the substitution of <hi rend="italic">u</hi> for
                    <hi rend="italic">y</hi> in some genuine English words, as “busy” (orig. bysig).
                    At the same time begins the corruption of <hi rend="italic">u</hi> to the
                    (so-called) <hi rend="italic">ü</hi> sound in “but,” “shut,” &amp;c.; this is
                    not a <hi rend="italic">u</hi> sound at all, but the neutral vowel as heard
                    indifferently in “but,” “sun,” “son,” “blood”; it is often confounded by writers
                    with the true <hi rend="italic">ü</hi> heard in “pull” and in the northern
                    pronunciation of “but,” “shut.” For the history of the German “modified” <hi
                    rend="italic">u</hi> (spelt <hi rend="italic">ü,</hi> but originally <hi
                    rend="italic">ue)</hi> see under Y.</p>
