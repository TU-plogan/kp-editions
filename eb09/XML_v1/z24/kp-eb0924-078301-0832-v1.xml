                <p>In ancient records we are told that Zeuxis, following the initiative of
                    Apollodorus, had introduced into the art of painting a method of representing
                    his figures in light and shadow, as opposed to the older method of outline, with
                    large flat masses of colour for draperies, and other details, such as had been
                    practised by Polygnotus and others of the great fresco painters. The new method
                    led to smaller compositions, and often to pictures consisting of only a single
                    figure, on which it was the more easy for the painter to demonstrate the
                    combined effect of the various means by which he obtained perfect roundness of
                    form. The effect would appear strongly realistic, as compared with the older
                    method, and to this was probably due the origin of such stories as the contest
                    in which Zeuxis painted a bunch of grapes so like reality that birds flew
                    towards it, while Parrhasius painted a curtain which even Zeuxis mistook for
                    real. The story reads in Pliny (<hi rend="italic">N. H.,</hi> XXXV. 65) as if
                    Parrhasius had brought forward a picture with an apparent curtain hung in front
                    to protect the colours from the light, and that Zeuxis had tried to pull the
                    curtain aside. It is perhaps a variation of this story when we are told (Pliny,
                    <hi rend="italic">loc. cit.)</hi> that Zeuxis also painted a boy holding grapes,
                    towards which birds flew, the artist remarking that if the boy had been as well
                    painted as the grapes the birds would have kept at a distance. But, if the
                    method of Zeuxis led him to real roundness of form, to natural colouring, and to
                    pictures consisting of single figures or nearly so, it was likely to lead him
                    also to search for striking attitudes or motives, which by the obviousness of
                    their meaning should emulate the plain intelligibility of the larger
                    compositions of older times. Lucian, in his <hi rend="italic">Zeuxis,</hi>
                    speaks of him as carrying this search to a novel and strange degree, as
                    illustrated in the group of a Female Centaur with her Young. When the picture
                    was exhibited, the spectators admired its invention and overlooked the skill of
                    the painter, to the vexation of Zeuxis. The pictures of Hercules Strangling the
                    Serpents to the astonishment of his father and mother (7), Penelope (10), and
                    Menelaus Weeping (11) are quoted as instances in which strong motives naturally
                    presented themselves to him. But, in spite of the tendency towards realism
                    inherent in the new method of Zeuxis, he is said to have retained the largeness
                    of form which had characterized his predecessors. Of all his known works it
                    would be expected that this quality would have appeared best in his famous
                    picture of Helena, for this reason, that we cannot conceive any striking or
                    effective incident for him in her career. In addition to this, however,
                    Quintilian.</p>

                <p>states (<hi rend="italic">Inst. Orat.,</hi> xii. 10, 4) that in respect of
                    largeness of form Zeuxis had followed Homer, while there is the fact that he had
                    inscribed two verses of the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> (iii. 156 <hi
                    rend="italic">sqf)</hi> under his figure of Helena. As models for the picture he
                    was allowed the presence of five of the most beautiful maidens of Croton at his
                    own request, in order that he might be able to “transfer the truth of life to a
                    mute image.” Cicero (<hi rend="italic">De Invent.,</hi> ii. 1, 1) assumed that
                    Zeuxis had found distributed among these five the various elements that went to
                    make up a figure of ideal beauty. It should not, however, be understood that the
                    painter had made up his figure by the process of combining the good points of
                    various models, but rather that he found among those models the points that
                    answered to the ideal Helena in his own mind, and that he merely required the
                    models to guide and correct himself by during the process of transferring his
                    ideal to form and colour. This picture also is said to have been exhibited
                    publicly, with the result that Zeuxis made much profit out of it. By this and
                    other means, we are told, he became so rich as to rather give away his pictures
                    than to sell them. He presented his Alcmena to the Agrigentines, his Pan to King
                    Archelaus of Macedonia, whose palace he is also said to have decorated with
                    paintings. According to Pliny <hi rend="italic">{N. H.,</hi> XXXV. 62), he made
                    an ostentatious display of his wealth at Olympia in having his name woven in
                    letters of gold on his dress. But, as there would not be much ostentation in
                    that, and as Pliny at times makes mistakes in translating from his Greek
                    sources, it is possible that Zeuxis may merely have presented some piece of
                    tapestry to a temple at Olympia with the customary inscription woven in letters
                    of gold. Under his picture of an Athlete (12) he wrote that “It is easier to
                    revile than to rival” <hi rend="italic">(μωμήσεταί</hi> τις <hi rend="italic"
                    >μάλλον ἢ μιμήσετaι).</hi> A contemporary, Isocrates <hi rend="italic">{De
                    Permut.,</hi> 2), remarks that no one would say that Zeuxis and Parrhasius had
                    the same profession as those persons who paint <hi rend="italic">pinakia,</hi>
                    which is equivalent to the vase-painters of the time. We possess many examples
                    of the vase-painting of the period <hi rend="italic">circa</hi> 400 B.c., and it
                    is noticeable on them that there is great freedom and facility in drawing the
                    human form, so as to suggest roundness and perspective. In the absence of fresco
                    paintings of that date we have only these vases to fall back upon. Yet, with
                    their limited resources of colour and perspective, they in a measure show the
                    influence of Zeuxis, while, as would be expected, they retain perhaps more of
                    the largeness of form of older times. It is said that he died of laughter at the
                    quaintness of a picture he had painted of an Old Woman.</p>
