                <p><label type="entry">FABLE</label>. With certain restrictions, the necessity of
                    which will be shown in the course of the article, we may accept the definition
                    which Dr Johnson proposes in his life of Gay: —“A <hi rend="italic">fable</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">apologue</hi> seems to be, in its genuine state, a
                    narrative in which beings irrational, and sometimes inanimate <hi rend="italic"
                    >{arbores loquuntur, non tantum ferae),</hi> are, for the purpose of moral
                    instruction, feigned to act and speak with human interests and passions.” Before
                    tracing the history of the fable we may compare it with its nearest congeners in
                    literature, the myth, the allegory, and the parable. The myth, whether, as is
                    most commonly the case, it has its origin in some physical phenomenon, or can be
                    traced to mistaken metaphor or distorted history, or is merely a play of the
                    imagination, is always the unconscious product of the race, never like the fable
                    invented expressly for a moral or didactic purpose. A closer analogy to the
                    fable is to be found in the literary myth, the artificial product of a later
                    age, such, for instance, as the Acrai of the <hi rend="italic">Iliad,</hi> the
                    Hesiodic legend of Pandora, or the story of Er in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Republic</hi> of Plato. Yet these allegorical myths are clearly distinguished
                    from the fable, inasmuch as the story and the moral are intermingled throughout.
                    Between the parable and the fable there is no clear line of distinction.
                    Archbishop Trench insists on two essential differences,—first, that the parable
                    teaches spiritual truths, whereas the fable never lifts itself above the earth,
                    and secondly, that the parable never transgresses the actual order of nature.
                    But, though the parables of the New Testament may well be set in a class by
                    themselves, a comparative study of religious writings will show that the parable
                    is one of the commonest forms of religious teaching, and that no hard or fast
                    line can be drawn between moral and spiritual truths. The second difference we
                    should regard as accidental, and it is not altogether borne out by facts.</p>
                <p>Most writers on the history of the fable are content to trace its origin to /Esop
                    or the <hi rend="italic">Panca Tantra</hi> of the mythical Vishnu Sarman, and
                    these are doubtless the oldest collections which have been preserved in writing;
                    but though we possess no earlier record, we may, from its wide diffusion, regard
                    it as a natural growth of the imagination, and one of the most primitive forms
                    of literature. It springs from the universal need of men to express their
                    thoughts by concrete images and emblems, and thus is strictly parallel to the
                    use of metaphor in language. Even now fables are made every day, and a
                    quick-witted race like the Arabs will invent fables at every turn as the
                    readiest form of argument. To take a familiar illustration, the wise saws and
                    modern instances of Sam Weller would only need a slight expansion to form a very
                    respectable book of fables. Our most familiar proverbs are often fables in
                    miniature.</p>
                <p>With the fable, as we know it, the moral is indispensable. As La Fontaine puts
                    it, an apologue is composed of two parts, one of which may be called the body,
                    the other the soul. The body is the fable, the soul the morality. But if we
                    revert to the earliest type we shall find that is no longer the case. In the
                    primitive beast-fable, which is the direct progenitor of the Aesopian fable, the
                    story is told simply for its own sake, and is as innocent of any moral as our
                    fairy tales of Little Red Ridinghood and Jack and the Beanstalk. Thus, in a
                    legend of the Flathead Indians, the Little Wolf found in cloud-land his
                    grandsires the Spiders w’ith their grizzled hair and long crooked nails, and
                    they spun balls of thread to let him down to earth; when he came down and found
                    his wife the Speckled Duck, whom the Old Wolf had taken from him, she fled in
                    confusion, and this is why she lives and dives alone to this very day. Such
                    animal myths are as common in the New World as in the Old, and abound from
                    Finland and Kamtchatka to the Hottentots and Australasians. From the story
                    invented, as the one above quoted, to account for some peculiarity of the animal
                    world, or told as a pure exercise of the imagination, just as a sailor spins a
                    yarn about the sea-serpent, to the moral apologue the transition is easy; and
                    that it has been effected by savages un aided by the example of higher races
                    seems sufficiently proved by the tales quoted by E. B. Tylor <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Primitive Culture,</hi> vol. i. p. 411). From the beast-fables of savages we
                    come next to the Oriental apologues which are still extant in their original
                    form. The East, the land of myth and legend, is the natural home of the fable,
                    and Hindustan was the birth-place, if not of the original, of these tales, at
                    least of the oldest shape in which they still exist. The <hi rend="italic">Panca
                    Tantra,</hi> or fables of the Brahma Vishnu Sarman, have been translated into
                    almost every language and adapted by most modern fabulists. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Kcdila wa Damna</hi> (names of two jackals), or fables of Bidpai,
                    is an Arab version made about 760 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> From the Hebrew
                    version of Rabbi Joel, John of Capua produced a Latin translation about the end
                    of the 15th century, whence all later imitations are derived. (See Monier
                    Williams, <hi rend="italic">Indian Wisdom,</hi> p. 508.) The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hitopadesa,</hi> or “friendly instruction,” is a modernized form of the same
                    work, and of it there are three translations into English by Dr Charles Wilkins,
                    Sir William Jones, and Professor F. Johnson. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hitopadesa</hi> is a complete chaplet of fables loosely strung together, but
                    connected so as to form something of a continuous story, with moral reflections
                    freely interspersed, purporting to be written for the instruction of some
                    dissolute young princes. Thus, in the first fable a flock of pigeons see the
                    grains of rice which a fowler has scattered, and are about to descend on them,
                    when the king of the pigeons warns them by telling the fable of a traveller who
                    being greedy of a bracelet was devoured by a tiger. They neglect his warning and
                    are caught in the net, but are afterwards delivered by the king of the mice, who
                    tells the story of the Deer, the Jackal, and the Crow, to show that no real
                    friendship can exist between the strong and the weak, the beast of prey and his
                    quarry, and so on to the end of the volume. Another book of Eastern fables is
                    well worthy of notice, <hi rend="italic">Buddhaghosha’s Parables,</hi> a
                    commentary on the <hi rend="italic">Bhammapada, or Buddha's Paths of
                    Virtue.</hi> The original is in Pali, but an English translation of the Burmese
                    version has been made by Captain T. Rogers, R.E. As the work is little known we
                    may venture to extract a single gem. A young mother, disconsolate for the death
                    of her first-born son, carries the dead body of her child from house to house
                    seeking medicine to restore it. At last she is sent to Para Takem, the lord and
                    master of the Buddhists, who promises to help her, but she must herself fetch
                    the medicine, which is some mustard seed taken from a house where no son,
                    husband, parent, or slave has died. Gladly the girl speeds on her errand,
                    carrying the dead body of her son on her hip. By degrees she is taught that she
                    is not the only mourner. In the whole of the Savetthi country everywhere
                    children are dying, parents are dying. She leaves her dead son and returns to
                    Para Takem, having learnt the first and last commandment of the Buddhist
                    creed.</p>
                <p>From Hindustan the Sanskrit fables passed to China, Thibet, and Persia; and they
                    must have reached Greece at an early age, for many of the fables which passed
                    under the name of /Esop are identical with those of the East. /Esop to us is
                    little more than a name, though, if we may trust <pb break="no"

                    have lived in the 6th century B.c. Probably his fables were never written down,
                    though several are ascribed to him by Xenophon, Aristotle, Plutarch, and other
                    Greek writers, and Plato represents Socrates as beguiling his last days by
                    versifying such as he remembered. Aristophanes alludes to them as merry tales,
                    and Plato, while excluding the poets from his ideal republic, admits AEsop as a
                    moral teacher. Of the various versions of <hi rend="italic">jEsop's Fables,</hi>
                    by far the most trustworthy is that of Babrius or Babrias, a Greek of the 1st
                    century <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> who rendered them in choliambic verse.
                    These, which were long known in fragments only, were recovered in a MS. found by
                    M. Minas in a monastery on Mount Athos in 1842, and have been edited by Sir G.
                    C. Lewis.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>M. Minas
                    professed to have discovered under the same circumstances another collection of
                    ninety-four fables by Babrius. This second part was accepted by Sir G. C. Lewis,
                    but J. Conington has conclusively proved that it is spurious, and probably a
                    forgery. See article <hi rend="smallcaps">Babrius.</hi></p></note> An inferior
                    version of the same in Latin iambics was made by Phaedrus, a slave of Thracian
                    origin, brought to Rome in the time of Augustus, and manumitted by him, who
                    tells us that he published in senarian verse the rude materials produced by
                    zEsop; but the numerous allusions to contemporary events, as, for example, that
                    to Sejanus in the Frogs and the Sun, which brought upon the author disgrace and
                    imprisonment, show that many of them are original or free adaptations. For some
                    time scholars doubted as to the genuineness of Phsedrus’s fables, but their
                    doubts have been lately dispelled by a closer examination of the MSS. and by the
                    discovery of two verses of a fable on a tomb at Apulum in Dacia. Phmdrus’s style
                    is simple, clear, and brief, but dry and unpoetical; and, as Lessing has pointed
                    out, he often falls into absurdities when he deserts his original. For instance,
                    in ZEsop the dog with the meat in his mouth sees his reflexion in the water as
                    he passes over a bridge; Phaedrus makes him see it as he swims across the
                    river.</p>
                <p>To sum up the characteristics of the zEsopian fable, it is artless, simple, and
                    transparent. It affects no graces of style, and we hardly need the moral with
                    which each concludes, 6 <hi rend="italic">p-vOos</hi><hi rend="italic
                    smallcaps"> 8y]XoI oti, k. t.</hi><hi rend="italic">X.</hi> The moral inculcated
                    is that of wordly wisdom and reasonable self-interest. .zEsop is no makei’ of
                    phrases, but an orator who wishes to gain some point or induce some course of
                    action. It is the zEsopian type that Aristotle has in view when he treats of the
                    fable as a branch of rhetoric, not of poetry.</p>
                <p>If we consider their striking gift of narrative and their love of moralizing, it
                    is strange that the Romans should have produced no body of national fables. But,
                    with the doubtful exception of Phaedrus, we possess nothing but solitary fables,
                    such as the famous apologue of Menenius Agrippa to the Plebs, and the exquisite
                    Town Mouse and Country Mouse of Horace’s <hi rend="italic">Satires.</hi></p>
                <p>The fables of the rhetorician Aphthonius in Greek prose, and those in Latin
                    elegiac verse attributed to Avianus or Avienus, make, in the history of the
                    apologue, a sort of link between the classical and the dark ages. In that
                    overflowing chaos which constitutes the literature of the Middle Ages, the fable
                    reappears in several aspects. In a Latin dress, sometimes in prose, sometimes in
                    regular verse, and sometimes in rhymed stanzas, it contributed, with other kinds
                    of narratives, to make up the huge mass of stories which has been bequeathed to
                    us by the monastic libraries. These served more uses than one. They were always
                    easier reading, and were often held to be safer and more instructive reading
                    also, than the difficult and slippery classics, for those monks who cared for
                    reading at all, and were not learned enough for any pursuit deserving the name
                    of study. For those who were a little more active-minded, they aided the <hi
                    rend="italic">Gesta Romanorum</hi> and other collec tions of fabliaux or short
                    novels, in suggesting illustrations available for popular preaching. Among those
                    mediaaval fables in Latin, very little of originality is to be detected. The
                    writers contented themselves with working up the old fables into new shapes,
                    with rendering from prose into verse, or from verse into prose,—a species of
                    attempts which had its merits in such hands as those of Babrius or Phaedrus, but
                    from which no fruit could be expected to be gathered in the convents. The few
                    monks who could have performed such a task well aimed wisely at something
                    higher. It might be enough to name, among the monkish fabulists, Vincent of
                    Beauvais, a Dominican of the 12 th century, in whose <hi rend="italic">Speculum
                    Doctrinale</hi> are a good many prose fables, more than half of them from
                    Phaedrus. About the end of the same century, too, a considerable number of
                    fables, some of which have been printed, were compiled by an English Cistercian
                    monk, Odo de Cerinton. Nor was this the only collection that arose in
                    England.</p>
                <p>As the modem languages became by degrees applicable to literary use, fables began
                    to appear in them. A good many still exist in Norman-French, of which may be
                    noted the fables called those of Ysopet, and those composed by Marie de France,
                    the authoress of the well-known fabliaux. Later, also, they were not wanting,
                    though not numerous, in our own tongue. Chaucer has given us one, in his Nonne
                    Preste’s Tale, which is an expansion of the fable “Don Coc et don Werpil” of
                    Marie of France; another is Lidgate’s tale of The Churl and the Bird. But the
                    course of the short and isolated fables through the Middle Ages is not here
                    worth prosecuting.</p>
                <p>Several of Odo’s tales, like Chaucer’s story, can be ultimately traced to a work,
                    or series of works, for the sake of which chiefly the mediaeval history of the
                    apologue is interesting—the History of Reynard the Fox. This great beast-epic
                    has been referred by Grimm as far back as the 10th century, and is known to us
                    in three forms, each having independent episodes, but all woven upon a common
                    basis. The Latin form is probably the earliest, and the poem <hi rend="italic"
                    >Reinardus et Ysengrinus</hi> dates from the 10th or 11th century. Next come the
                    German versions. The most ancient, that of a minnesinger Heinrich der
                    Glichesaere (probably a Swabian), was analysed and edited by Grimm in 1840. In
                    1498 appeared <hi rend="italic">Reynke de Voss,</hi> almost a literal version in
                    Low Saxon of the Flemish poem of the 12th century, <hi rend="italic">Reinaert de
                    Vos.</hi> Hence the well-known version of Goethe into modem German hexameters
                    was taken. It was written in 1793, during the siege of Mainz, and the
                    philosophic poet sought, in the study of animal nature and passions, to divert
                    his thoughts from the bloody scenes of the Reign of Terror. The poem has been
                    well named “an unholy world bible.” In it the .zEsopian fable received a
                    development which was in several respects quite original. We have here no short
                    and unconnected stories. Materials, partly borrowed from older apologues, but in
                    a much greater proportion new, are worked up into one long and systematic tale,
                    so as to form what has been quaintly called an animal-romance. The moral, so
                    prominent in the fable proper, shrinks so far into the background, that the work
                    might be considered as a mere allegory. Indeed, while the suspicion of its
                    having contained personal satires has been convincingly set aside, some writers
                    deny even the design to represent human conduct at all; and we can scarcely get
                    nearer to its signification than by regarding it as being, in a general way,
                    what Carlyle has called “a parody of human life.” It represents a contest
                    maintained successfully, by selfish craft and audacity, against enemies of all
                    sorts, in a half-barbarous and ill-organized society. With hiB weakest foes,
                    like Chaunteclere the Cock, Reynard uses brute-force; over the weak who are
                    protected, like Kiward the Hare and <pb break="no"

                    violence with cunning; Bruin, the dull, strong, formidable Bear, is humbled by
                    having greater power than his own enlisted against him; and the most dangerous
                    of all the fox’s enemies, Isengrim, the obstinate, greedy, and implacable Wolf,
                    after being baffled by repeated strokes of malicious ingenuity, forces Reynard
                    to a single combat, but even thus is not a match for his dexterous adversary.
                    The knavish fox has allies worthy of him in Grimbart the watchful badger, and in
                    his own aunt Dame Rukenawe, the learned She-ape; and he plays at his pleasure on
                    the simple credulity of the Lion-King, the image of an impotent feudal
                    sovereign. The characters of these and other brutes are kept up with a rude kind
                    of consistency, which gives them great liveliness; many of the incidents are
                    devised with much force of humour; and the sly hits at the weak points of
                    mediaeval polity and manners and religion are incessant and palpable.</p>
                <p>It is needless, as has already been said, to attempt tracing the appearance which
                    fables, or incidents borrowed from them, make so frequently as incidental
                    ornaments in the older literature of our own country and others. Nor is there
                    here fit occasion for dwelling minutely on the cultivation of the apologue in
                    modern times, as a special form of poetical composition. It has appeared in
                    every modern nation of Europe, but has nowhere become very important, and has
                    hardly ever exhibited much originality either of spirit or of manner. In our own
                    language, Prior indicated the possession of much aptitude for it; but neither
                    the fables of Moore, nor even the much more lively ones of Gay, possess any
                    distinguished merit. To Dryden’s spirited remodellings of old poems, romances,
                    and fabliaux, the name of fables, which he was pleased to give them, is quite
                    inapplicable. In German, Hagedorn and Gellert are quite forgotten; and even
                    Lessing’s fables are read by few but schoolboys. In Spanish, Yriarte’s fables on
                    literary subjects are sprightly and graceful. A spirited version of the best
                    appeared in <hi rend="italic">Blackwood's Magazine,</hi> 1839. Among Italians
                    Pignotti is famous for versatility and command of rhythm, as amongst Russians is
                    Kriloff for his keen satire on Russian society. He has been translated into
                    English by Mr Ralston.</p>
                <p>France alone in modern times has attained any preeminence in the fable, and this
                    distinction is almost entirely owing to one author. Marie de France in the 13th
                    century, Gilles Corrozet, Guillaume Haudent, and Guillaume Gueroult in the 16
                    th, are now studied only as the precursors of La Fontaine, from whom he may have
                    borrowed a stray hint or the outline of a story. The unique character of his
                    work has given a new word to the French language: other writers of fables are
                    called <hi rend="italic">fabulistes,</hi> La Fontaine is named <hi rend="italic"
                    >le fablier.</hi> Referring for fuller details to the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">La Fontaine,</hi> we must content ourselves here with briefly
                    indicating his chief characteristics. He is a true poet; his verse is
                    exquisitely modulated; his love of nature often reminds us of Virgil, as does
                    his tenderness and pathos (see, for instance, The Two Pigeons and Death and the
                    Woodcutter). He is full of sly fun and delicate humour; like Horace he satirizes
                    without wounding, and “plays around the heart.” Lastly, he is a keen observer of
                    men. The whole society of the 17th century, its greatness and its foibles, its
                    luxury and its squalor, from <hi rend="italic">Le grand monargue</hi> to the
                    poor <hi rend="italic">manant,</hi> from his majesty the lion to the courtier of
                    an ape, is painted to the life. To borrow his own phrase, La Fontaine’s fables
                    are <hi rend="superscript"> u</hi> une ample comddie k cent actes divers.”</p>
                <p>The fables of Lessing represent the reaction against the French school of
                    fabulists. “With La Fontaine himself,” says Lessing, “I have no quarrel, but
                    against the imitators of La Fontaine I enter my protest.” His attention was
                    first called to the fable by Gellert’s popular work published in 1746. Gellert’s
                    fables were closely modelled after La Fontaine’s, and were a vehicle for lively
                    railings against the fair sex, and hits at contemporary follies. Lessing’s early
                    essays were in the same style, but his subsequent study of the history and
                    theory of the fable led him to discard his former model as a perversion of later
                    times, and the “Fabeln,” published in 1759, are the outcome of his riper views.
                    Lessing’s fables, like all that he wrote, display his vigorous common sense. He
                    has, it is true, little of La Fontaine’s <hi rend="italic">curiosa
                    felicitas,</hi> his sly humour and lightness of touch; and Frenchmen would say
                    that his criticism of La Fontaine is an illustration of the fable of the sour
                    grapes. On the other hand he has the rare power of looking at both sides of a
                    moral problem; he holds a brief for the stupid and the feeble, the ass and the
                    lamb; and in spite of his formal protest against poetical ornament, there is in
                    not a few of his fables a vein of true poetry, as in the Sheep (ii. 13) and
                    Jupiter and the Sheep (ii. 18). But the value of the work is infinitely enhanced
                    by the monograph on the essence of the fable which appeared at the same time,
                    anil as an illustration of which the fables were written. Much of the essay is
                    taken up with the refutation of the theories of contemporary fabulists, De la
                    Motte, Richer, Breittinger, Batteux, who only survive in Lessing’s pages like
                    the fly in amber. Passing over this negative criticism we may briefly state the
                    results of Lessing’s investigation. According to Lessing the ideal fable is that
                    of jEsop. All the elaborations and refinements of later authors, from Phaedrus
                    to La Fontaine, are perversions of this original. The fable is essentially a
                    moral precept illustrated by a single example, and it is the lesson thus
                    enforced which gives to the fable its unity and makes it a work of art. The
                    illustration must be either an actual occurrence or represented as such, because
                    a fictitious case invented <hi rend="italic">ad hoc</hi> can appeal but feebly
                    to the reader’s judgment. Lastly, the fable requires a story or connected chain
                    of events. A single fact will not make a fable, but is only an emblem. We thus
                    arrive at the following definition :—“A fable is a relation of a series of
                    changes which together form a whole. The unity of the fable consists herein,
                    that all the parts lead up to an end, the end for which the fable was invented
                    being the moral precept.”</p>
                <p>We may notice in passing a problem in connexion with the fable which had long
                    been debated, but never satisfactorily resolved till Lessing took it in
                    band,—Why should animals have been almost universally chosen as the chief <hi
                    rend="italic">dramatis personae 1</hi> The reason, according to Lessing, is that
                    animals have distinct characters which are known and recognized by all. The
                    fabulist who writes of Britannicus and Nero appeals to the few who know Roman
                    history. The Wolf and the Lamb comes home to every one whether learned or
                    simple. But, besides this, human sympathies obscure the moral judgment; hence it
                    follows that the fable, unlike the drama and the epos, should abstain from all
                    that is likely to arouse our prejudices or our passions. In this respect the
                    Wolf and the Lamb of 2Esop is a more perfect fable than the Rich Man and the
                    Poor Man’s Ewe Lamb of Nathan.</p>
                <p>Lessing’s analysis and definition of the fable, though he seems himself
                    unconscious of the scope of his argument, is in truth its death-warrant. The
                    beast-fable arose in a primitive age when men firmly believed that beasts could
                    talk and reason, that any wolf they met might be a werewolf, that a peacock
                    might be a Pythagoras in disguise, and an ox or even a cat a being worthy of
                    their worship. To this succeeded the second age of the fable, which belongs to
                    the same stage of culture as the Hebrew proverbs and the gnomic poets of Greece.
                    That honesty is the best policy, that death is common to all, seemed to the men
                    of <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n875/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0875-0840"/> that day profound truths worthy to be embalmed in
                    verse or set off by the aid of story or anecdote. Last comes an age of high
                    literary culture which tolerates the trite morals and hackneyed tales for the
                    sake of the exquisite setting, and is amused at the wit which introduces topics
                    and characters of the day under the transparent veil of animal life. Such an
                    artificial product can be nothing more than the fashion of a day, and must, like
                    pastoral poetry, die a natural death. A serious moralist would hardly choose
                    that form to inculcate, like Mandeville in his <hi rend="italic">Fable of the
                    Bees,</hi> a new doctrine in morals, for the moral of the fable must be such
                    that he who runs may read. A true poet will not care to masquerade as a moral
                    teacher, or show his wit by refurbishing some old-world maxim. <hi
