                    (1813—1866), a most industrious antiquary, draughtsman, and editor of our older
                    literature, was born in London in the year 1813. His father, who was of a German
                    family (the name was originally Fahrholz), was a tobacco manufacturer, and for
                    some years Fairholt himself was employed in the business. He had, however, other
                    aims. For a time he was a drawing-master, afterwards a scene-painter. Some pen
                    and ink copies made by him of figures from Hogarth’s plates led to his being
                    employed by Charles Knight on several of that gentleman’s illustrated
                    publications. His first published literary work was a contribution to Hone’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Year-Book</hi> in 1831. His life seems to have been one of almost
                    uninterrupted quiet labour, carried on until within a few days of death. Several
                    works on civic pageantry and some collections of ancient unpublished songs and
                    dialogues were edited by him for the Percy Society in 1842. In 1844 he was
                    elected fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. Au edition of the dramatic works
                    of Lilly was published by him in 1853. His principal independent works are <hi
                    rend="italic">Tobacco, its History and Association,</hi> 1859; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Up the Nile and Home Again,</hi> 1862; many articles and serials contributed to
                    the <hi rend="italic">Art Journal,</hi> some of which were afterwards separately
                    published, as <hi rend="italic">Costume in England,</hi> 1846; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dictionary of Terms in Art,</hi> 1854. These works arc illustrated by numerous
                    cuts, drawn on the wood by his own hand. His pencil was also employed in
                    illustrating Evan’s <hi rend="italic">Coins of the Ancient Britons,</hi>
                    Madden’s <hi rend="italic">Jewish Coinage,</hi> Halliwell’s folio <hi
