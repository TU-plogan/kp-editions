                <p><label type="entry">FABIUS MAXIMUS VERRUCOSUS, <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Quintus</hi></label>, also named <hi rend="italic">Cunctator</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Ovicula,</hi> was one of the most distinguished Romans of the
                    republic,—the incarnation of all that a Roman meant by patriotism. It appears
                    that he served his first consulship in Liguria, 233 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.,</hi> that he was censor in 230, and consul for the second time in 228. In
                    218 he was sent to Carthage to inquire whether that state approved of Hannibal’s
                    conduct in attacking Saguntum. The answer proved unsatisfactory; and Fabius,
                    assuming the haughty dignity of a Roman senator, and folding up his cloak so as
                    to form a cavity, thus addressed the nobles of Carthage: “Hie vobis bellum et
                    pacem portamus; utrum placet sumite.” Being answered that he might give which he
                    pleased, he indignantly exclaimed, “Then I give you war;” and the deputies
                    returned to Rome to state the result of their mission. The disastrous campaign
                    on the Trebia, and the defeat on the banks of the Thrasymene Lake, warned the
                    Romans that their successful resistance to Hannibal, and even their existence,
                    depended on the wisdom of the general to whom they entrusted their troops. So
                    Fabius was named dictator in 271, and began his tactics of “masterly
                    inactivity.” Manoeuvring among the hills, where Hannibal’s horse were useless,
                    he cut off his supplies, harassed him incessantly, did everything except fight.
                    His steady adherence to this plan, in spite of all the misconceptions which his
                    caution had aroused at Rome, evinced the moral strength of the man. He was
                    suspected of an ambition for the prolongation of his command. Hannibal was one
                    of the few men in Italy who understood him. Even Minucius, the master of the
                    horse, ridiculed the proceedings of Fabius; and he seized the opportunity of the
                    latter’s absence at Rome to attack the enemy, and win a victory. This tended
                    only more strongly to confirm the opponents of Fabius in their opinion, and the
                    command was divided between Minucius and Fabius. The result was exactly such as
                    might have been anticipated. Minucius engaged in battle with Hannibal, and his
                    army was on the verge of ruin when the opportune arrival of Fabius changed the
                    aspect of affairs. Minucius seems to have had the moral courage to confess his
                    folly, and cheerfully to submit to the orders of Fabius. Fabius having retired
                    at the end of the legal time of six months, the conduct of the war was entrusted
                    to jEmilius, who followed the ex-dictator’s plan, and Varro, who did not. “You
                    must beware of Varro, as well as of Hannibal,” said Fabius; and the warning was
                    followed by the disaster of Cannae. Fabius might have accused him; but it is
                    narrated that the magnanimous Roman thanked his rival “because he had not
                    despaired of the republic.” After the defeat at Cannae (216 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.)</hi> he was appointed to the command of the armies with Marcellus, “the
                    sword,” as Fabius himself was “the shield,” of the republic. He laid siege to
                    the important city of Capua; and when Hannibal marched towards Rome, threatening
                    the city itself, Fabius remained firmly at his post. In 214 B.c. when consul for
                    the fourth time, he captured Casilinum in Samnium. In his fifth consulship, 209,
                    he took the city of Tarentum; and when it was proposed, towards the conclusion
                    of the war, that Scipio should pass into Africa, Fabius was decidedly opposed to
                    the scheme. He did not live to witness the final success of Scipio, having died
                    at an advanced age, 203 B.c. In the previously named year he became <hi
                    rend="italic">princeps senatus,</hi> a dignity almost hereditary in the family
                    of the Fabii Maximi.</p>
