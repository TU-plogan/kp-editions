                <p><label type="entry">RASTELL</label> the name of two early English printers.</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="smallcaps">John Rastell</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Rastall,</hi>
                    printer and author, was born at London towards the end of the 15th century. He
                    was educated at Oxford, and married Elizabeth, the sister of Sir Thomas More. He
                    was a man of considerable learning and, although not bred to the law like his
                    son, showed his devotion to legal studies by his writings. He went into the
                    printing business about the year 1514, and produced <hi rend="italic">Liber
                    assisarum</hi> , with a preface by himself. His first dated publication was <hi
                    rend="italic">Abbreviamentum librorum legum Anglorum</hi> (1517). He also
                    printed <hi rend="italic">The Wydow Edyth</hi> (1525), <hi rend="italic">A
                    Dyaloge of Syr Thomas More</hi> (1529), and a number of other books. The last
                    dated piece from his press was <hi rend="italic">Fabyl’s Ghoste</hi> (1533), a
                    poem. He lived “at the sygne of the meremayd at Powlysgate.” John Rastell, the
                    Jesuit, who has been frequently confounded with him, was no relation. By his
                    will, dated 20th April 1536, he appointed Henry VIII. one of his executors;
                    administration was granted on the renunciation of the executorship by the king
                    on 18th July 1536. It is a curious document, and contains a long account of the
                    testator’s religious belief. Rastell was occupied upon a concordance at the time
                    of his death; its publication was provided for by the will (see Arber’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Registers of Comp, of Stationers,</hi> ii. 8, 9). He died at
                    London, leaving two sons, —William, printer and judge (see below), and John, a
                    justice of the peace.</p>
                <p>Rastell’s chief writings are the following. <hi rend="italic">The Pastyme of
                    People; the Chronycles of dyuers Realmys and most specyally of the Rcalme of
                    Englonde</hi> (1529), now of extreme rarity; a note in the catalogue of the
                    British Museum says, “the only perfect copy known.” It ranges from the earliest
                    times to Richard III., and was edited by Dibdin in 1811 for the quarto series of
                    English chronicles. <hi rend="italic">A new Boke of Purgatory,</hi> 1530, being
                    dialogues on the subject between “Comyngo au Almayne a Christen Man, and one
                    Gyngemyn a Turke.” This was answered by John Frith, producing Rastell’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Apology against John Fryth,</hi> also answered by the latter. The
                    controversy is said to have ended in Rastell’s conversion to the Reformed
                    religion. <hi rend="italic">Expositioncs terminorum legum anglorum</hi> (in
                    French, also translated into English, 1527; reprinted as recently as 1812 as <hi
                    rend="italic">Lcs Termes de la Ley). The Abbreviacion of Statutis</hi> (1520),
                    the first abridgment of the statutes in English, with an interesting preface by
                    Rastell, giving reasons for the innovation; down to 1625 fifteen editions
                    appeared.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="smallcaps">William Rastell</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">(c.</hi>
                    1508-1565), printer and judge, son of the above, was born in London about 1508.
                    At the age of seventeen he went to the university of Oxford, but did not take a
                    degree, being probably called home to superintend his father’s business. The
                    first work which bears his own imprint was <hi rend="italic">A Dyaloge of Sir
                    Thomas More</hi> (1531), a reprint of the edition published by his father in
                    1529. He also brought out a few law books, some poetry, an edition of <hi
                    rend="italic">Fabyaris Cronycle</hi> (1533), and <hi rend="italic">The
                    Apologye</hi> (1533) and <hi rend="italic">The Supplycacyon of Soulys</hi> of
                    his uncle Sir Thomas More. His office was “in Fletestrete in saynt Brydys
                    chyrche yarde.” He became a student at Lincoln’s Inn on 12th September 1532, and
                    gave up the printing business two years later. In 1547 he was appointed reader.
                    On account of his religion he left England for Louvain; but upon the accession
                    of Mary he returned, and was made sergeant-at-law in October 1555. He was one of
                    the seven sergeants who gave the famous feast that year in the Inner Temple Hall
                    (see Dugdale’s <hi rend="italic">Orig. Jurid.,</hi> 1680, p. 128). His patent as
                    judge of the Queen’s Bench was granted on 27th October 1558. One of his
                    predecessors, John Boteler, had also been printer and judge. Rastell continued
                    on the bench until 1562, when he retired to Louvain without the queen’s licence.
                    By virtue of a special commission issued by the barons of the Exchequer on the
                    occasion an inventory of his goods and chattels was taken. It furnishes an
                    excellent idea of the modest nature of the law library (consisting of
                    twenty-four works) and of the chambers of an Elizabethan judge (see <hi
                    rend="italic">Law Magazine,</hi> February 1844). He died at Louvain on 27th
                    August 1565.</p>
                <p>It is difficult to distinguish between the books written by him and those by his
                    father. The following are believed to be his: <hi rend="italic">A Collecdon of
                    all the Statutes</hi> (1557), <hi rend="italic">A Table collected of the Yeares
                    of the Kynges of Englande</hi> (1561), both frequently reprinted witli
                    continuations, and <hi rend="italic">A Colleccion of Entrees, of
                    Declaracions,</hi> &amp;c. (1566), also frequently reprinted. The entries are
                    not of Rastell’s own drawing, but have been selected from printed and MS.
                    collections; their “pointed brevity and precision” are commended by Story. He
                    supplied tables or indexes to several law books, and edited <hi rend="italic">La
                    novel natura brevium de Monsieur Anton. Fitzherbert</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Workes of Sir T. More in the English Tonge</hi> (1557). He is also stated
                    to have written a life of Sir T. More, but it has not come down to us.</p>
