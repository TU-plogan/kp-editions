                <p><label type="entry">RHUBARB</label>. This name is applied both to a drug and to a
                    vegetable.</p>
                <p>1. The drug has been used in medicine from very early times, being described in
                    the Chinese herbal <hi rend="italic">Pen-king,</hi> which is believed to date
                    from 2700 b.c. The name seems to be a corruption of <hi rend="italic">Rheum
                    barbarum</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Reu barbarum,</hi> a designation applied to
                    the drug as early as the middle of the 6th century, and apparently identical
                    with the <hi rend="italic">pηov</hi> or pα of Dioscorides, described by him as a
                    root brought from beyond the Bosphorus. Rha is said by Ammianus Mar-cellinus to
                    take its name from the river Rha (Volga), on the banks of which a species of <hi
                    rend="italic">Rheum (R. Rhαponticum)</hi> grows. It is not, however, known
                    whether the root of this species was the article used under the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Rha ponticum</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Rha barbarum,</hi> or
                    whether these names were applied to the drug brought overland from China by way
                    of the Caspian Sea. It is, however, certain that in the early part of the 11th
                    century Chinese rhubarb was distinguished as superior to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rha barbarum.</hi> In the 14th century rhubarb appears to have found its way to
                    Europe by way of the Indus and Persian Gulf to the Red Sea and Alexandria, and
                    was therefore described as “East Indian” rhubarb. Some also came by way of
                    Persia and the Caspian to Syria and Asia Minor, and reached Europe from the
                    ports of Aleppo and Smyrna, and became known as “Turkey” rhubarb. Subsequently
                    to the year 1653, when China first permitted Russia to trade on her frontiers,
                    Chinese rhubarb reached Europe chiefly by way of Moscow; and in 1704 the rhubarb
                    trade became a monopoly of the Russian Government, in consequence of which the
                    term “Russian” or “crown” rhubarb came to be applied to it. Urga was the great
                    depot for the rhubarb trade in 1719, but in 1728 the depot was transferred to
                    Kiachta. All rhubarb brought to the depot passed through the hands of the
                    Government inspector, acting under the instructions of the Russian minister of
                    war, and all pieces except those of good quality were rejected. Hence Russian
                    rhubarb was invariably good and obtained a remarkably high price. This severe
                    supervision naturally led, as soon as the northern Chinese ports were thrown
                    open to European trade, to a new outlet being sought; and the increased demand
                    for the drug at these ports resulted in less care being exercised by the Chinese
                    in the collection and curing of the root, so that the rhubarb of good quality
                    offered at Kiachta rapidly dwindled in quantity, and after 1860 Russian rhubarb
                    ceased to appear in European commerce. The drug from that date became known as
                    Chinese rhubarb, although the older names still continue in domestic use in
                    England. ' Owing to the expense of carrying the drug across the whole breadth of
                    Asia and the difficulty of preserving it from the attacks of insects, rhubarb
                    was formerly one of the most costly of drugs. In 1542 it was sold in France for
                    ten times the price of cinnamon and four times that of saffron, and in an
                    English price list bearing date of 1657 it is quoted at 16s. per lb, opium being
                    at that time only 6s. and scammony 12s. per lb.</p>
                <p>Rhubarb is used in medicine as a mild purgative and cholagogue, promoting
                    digestion and improving the appetite when given in small doses, probably by
                    stimulating the intestinal secretions. It has a subsequent astringent effect due
                    to the rheotannic acid it contains but this can <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n549/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0549-0530"/>be counteracted by giving it with alkaline
                    preparations. It is especially valuable in the treatment of duodenal catarrh or
                    catarrh of the biliary ducts with jaundice; and in certain skin diseases it has
                    proved to be a valuable medicine, the results obtained being probably due to the
                    chrysophan contained in it.</p>
                <p>The botanical source of Chinese rhubarb cannot be said to have beeu as yet
                    definitely cleared up by actual identification of plants observed to be used for
                    the purpose. Rheum palmatum, R. officinale, R. palmatum (var. tanguticuni), R.
                    colinianum, and R. Fraηzeηbaxhii have been variously stated to be the source of
                    it, but the roots produced by these species under cultivation in Europe do not
                    present the characteristic network of white veins exhibited by the best
                    specimens of the Chinese drug (see Goebel and Kunze, pt. ii., pi. i. figs. 25,
                    35).</p>
                <p>Chemistry.—The chief chemical constituents of Chinese rhubarb are chrysophan
                    (CιHO), rheotannic acid (CH <hi rend="subscript">2ti</hi> Oj), emodin (CHO), a
                    neutral colourless crystalline substance having the formula CHO, a white and a
                    dark brown crystalline resin; it also contains mucilage in the proportion of 11
                    to 17 per cent., and a considerable quantity of oxalate of lime. An albuminoid
                    principle containing nitrogen and sulphur is also found in the root, which, in
                    the presence of water, as recently shown by Kubli, <note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Jour. Phαrm. Soe., [3], vi. p. 65.
                    </p></note> decomposes the chrysophan into chrysophanic acid and glucose, and
                    apparently exerts a similar action on rheotannic acid, giving rise to the
                    formation of rheumic acid (C <hi rend="subscript">2θ</hi> HO) and a fermentable
                    sugar. Rheumic acid is a reddish-brown powder, sparingly soluble in cold water.
                    The albuminoid principle is insoluble in rectified spirit of wine; consequently
                    a preparation of the root made with that menstruum contains the active
                    principles of the drug in the natural state, whilst an aqueous extract contains
                    them in an altered condition.</p>
                <p>Production and Commerce.—Rhubarb is produced in the four northern provinces of
                    China proper (Chih-li, Shan-se, Shen-se, and Ho-uan), in the north-west
                    provinces of Kan-suh formerly included in Shen-se, but now extending across the
                    desert of Gobi to the frontier of Tibet, in the Mongolian province of Tsing-hai,
                    including the salt lake Koko-nor, and the districts of Tangut, Sifan, and
                    Turfan, and in the mountains of the western provinces of Sze-chuen. According to
                    Richthofen the best rhubarb is collected exclusively from wild plants in the
                    high mountains of western Sze-chuen between the sources of the Hoang-ho and the
                    rivers Ya-lung Keang and Min-keang, and comes into trade under the name of
                    Shen-se rhubarb. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>According to Mr F. Newcombe, Mea. Press and Cire., August 2, 1882, the
                    Chinese esteem the Shen-se rhubarb as the best, that coming from Kanchow being
                    the most prized of all; Sze-chuen rhubarb has a rougher surface and little
                    flavour, and brings only about half the price; Chung-chi rhubarb also is greatly
                    valued, while the Chi-chuang, Tai-huang, and Shan-huang varieties are considered
                    worthless. </p></note> Two of the most important centres of the trade are
                    Sining-fu in the province of Kan-suh and Kwan-hien in Sze-chuen. From Shen-se,
                    Kan-suh, and Sze-chuen the rhubarb is.forwarded to Hankow, and thence carried to
                    Shanghai, whence it is shipped to Europe. Lesser quantities are shipped from
                    Tien-tsin, and occasionally the drug is exported from Canton, Amoy, Fuh-chow,
                    and Ning-po.</p>
                <p>Very little is known concerning the mode of preparing the drug for the market.
                    According to Mr Bell, who on a journey from St Petersburg to Peking had the
                    opportunity of observing the plant in a growing state, the root is not
                    considered to be mature until it is six years old. It is then dug up, usually in
                    the autumn, and deprived of its cortical portion and smaller branches, and the
                    larger pieces are divided in half longitudinally; these pieces are bored with
                    holes and strung up on cords to dry, in some cases being previously subjected to
                    a preliminary drying on stone slabs heated by fire underneath. In Bhutan the
                    root is said to be hung up in a kind of drying room, in which a moderate heat is
                    regularly maintained. The effect produced by the two drying processes is very
                    different; when dried by artificial heat, the exterior of the pieces becomes
                    hardened before the interior has entirely lost its moisture, and consequently
                    the pieces decay in the centre, although the surface may show no change. These
                    two varieties are technically known as kiln-dried and sun-dried; and it was on
                    account of this difference in quality that the Russian officer at Kiachta had
                    every piece examined by boring a hole to its centre. The best rhubarb occurs in
                    pieces of a yellowish colour externally, more or less marked with a network of
                    whitish veins, the surface being convex and smooth. Internally it presents no
                    signs of decay, but is compact, marbled with reddish-brown and white, mixed
                    sometimes with iron grey. The smaller cylindrical sections of the root which
                    have not been divided longitudinally are technically known as “rounds,” and have
                    usually a hole with a piece of string left in it; the flat pieces are more
                    rarely pierced. Inferior qualities are shrunken and shrivelled on the surface,
                    and externally of a brownish tint, showing traces of the darker bark, and when
                    broken opeu are frequently decayed in the centre.</p>
                <p>European Rhubarb.—As early as 1608 Prosper Alpinus of Padua cultivated as the
                    true rhubarb a plant which is now known as Rheum Rhapontieum, L., a native of
                    southern Siberia and the basin of the Volga. This plant was introduced into
                    England through Sir Matthew Lister, physician to Charles I., who gave seed
                    obtained by him in Italy to the botanist Parkinson. The culture of this rhubarb
                    for the sake of the root was commenced in 1777 at Banbury in Oxfordshire, by an
                    apothecary named Hayward, the plants being raised from seed sent from Russia in
                    1762, and with such success that the Society of Arts awarded him a silver medal
                    in 1789 and a gold one in 1794. The cultivation subsequently extended to
                    Somersetshire, Yorkshire, and Middlesex, but is now chiefly carried on at
                    Banbury. English rhubarb root is sold at a cheaper rate than the Chinese
                    rhubarb, and forms a considerable article of export to America, and is said to
                    be used in Britain in the form of powder which is of a finer yellow colour than
                    that of Chinese rhubarb. The Banbury rhubarb appears to be a hybrid between R.
                    Rhapontieum and A. undulaturn,—the root, according to E. Colin, not presenting
                    the typical microscopic structure of the former. During the last few years very
                    good rhubarb has been grown at Banbury from Kheum officinale, but these two
                    varieties are not equal in medicinal strength to the Chinese article, yielding
                    less extract,—Chinese rhubarb affording, according to H. Seier, 58 per cent.,
                    English rhubarb 21 per cent., and R. officinale 17 per cent. In France the
                    cultivation of rhubarb w ’ as commenced in the latter half of the last
                    century,—R. com-pactum, R. palmatum, R. Rhapontieum, and R. undulaturn, L.,
                    being the species grown. The cultivation has, however, now nearly ceased, small
                    quantities only being prepared at Avignon and a few other localities.</p>
                <p>The culture of Rheum compaetum was begun in Moravia in the beginning of the
                    present century by Prikyl, an apothecary in Austerlitz, and until twenty-five or
                    thirty years ago the root was largely exported to Lyons and Milan, where it was
                    used for dyeing silk. As a medicine 5 parts are stated to be equal to 4 of
                    Chinese rhubarb. Rhubarb root is also grow <hi rend="superscript">ι</hi> n at
                    Auspitz in Moravia and at Ilmitz, Kremnitz, and Frauenkirchen in Hungary; A.
                    Emodi is said to be cultivated for the same purpose in Silesia.</p>
                <p>The cultivation of Rheum palmatum, var. tangutieum, has been begun within the
                    last few' years in the United States.</p>
                <p>Rhubarb is also prepared for use in medicine from wild species in the Himalayas
                    and Java.</p>
                <p>2. The rhubarb used as a vegetable consists of the leaf stalks of several hybrids
                    between the species <hi rend="italic">R. rhapontieum, R. undulaturn, R.
                    palmatum.</hi> The petioles of <hi rend="italic">R. officinale</hi> have also
                    been proved to be edible; but that plant is grown more frequently on account of
                    its ornamental foliage (see Horticulture, vol. xii. p. 287). (e. m. h.)</p>
