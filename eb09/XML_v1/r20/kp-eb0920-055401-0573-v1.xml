                <p><label type="entry">RIGAUD</label> Hyacinthe (1659-1743), French painter, born at
                    Perpignan 20th July 1659, was the descendant of a line of painters. Having early
                    lost his father, he was sent by his mother to Montpellier, where he studied
                    under Pezet and was helped by Ranc, then to Lyons, and in 1681 to Paris. There,
                    whilst following the regular course of academical instruction, Rigaud produced a
                    great number of portraits so good that Lebrun advised him to give up going to
                    Rome and to devote himself wholly to this class of work. Rigaud, although he had
                    obtained the Great Prize, followed this advice, and for sixty-two years painted
                    at the rate of thirty to forty portraits a year, all carried through with
                    infinite care by his own hand. He had a magnificent emphatic manner appropriate
                    to the rendering of the pompous types of the age, but, although some of his most
                    famous works belong to the class of official portraiture, his talent showed to
                    even greater advantage in the painting of subjects whose life and position
                    admitted of less formal treatment. His portraits of himself, of the sculptor
                    Desjardins (Louvre), of Mignard, and of Lebrun (Louvre) may be cited as triumphs
                    of a still more attractive, if less imposing, character than that displayed in
                    his grand representations of Bossuet (Louvre) and Louis XIV. (Louvre), while his
                    beautiful portraits of his mother, Marie Serre</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n574/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0574-0555"/>
                <p>(Louvre), must for ever remain amongst the masterpieces of French art. Rigaud,
                    although the great successes to which he owed his fame were won without
                    exception in portrait painting, persisted in pressing the Academy to admit him
                    as an historical painter. This delayed his reception, and it was not until
                    January 2, 1700, that he succeeded in obtaining his desire. He presented as his
                    diploma works a St Andrew (Louvre) and the portrait of Desjardins already
                    mentioned, exhibited at the salon of 1704, and fdled in turn all the various
                    posts of academical distinction. Having attained a professional position of
                    unsurpassed eminence, Rigaud died at the age of eighty-four on 27th December
                    1743, having never recovered from the shock of losing his wife in the year
                    previous. He had many pupils, and his numerous works had the good fortune to be
                    reproduced by the greatest of French engravers — Edelinck, Drevet, Wille,
                    Audran, and others.</p>
