                <p><label type="entry">RATEL</label>. The animals known as Ratels or Honey-badgers
                    are small clumsy-looking creatures of about the size and appearance of the true
                    badgers, and belong to the same natural group of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Carnivora,</hi> namely, the subfamily <hi rend="italic">Melinas</hi> of the
                    large family <hi rend="italic">Mustelidse,</hi> which contains the otters,
                    badgers, stoats, weasels, <hi rend="italic">&lt;kc.</hi> (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Mammalia,</hi> vol. xv. p. 440). Of the ratels two species are
                    generally recognized, viz., the Indian Ratel ( <hi rend="italic">Mellivora
                    indica),</hi> a native of all the peninsula of India, and the African <hi
                    rend="italic">(M. ratel),</hi> which ranges over the whole of the African
                    continent —although by some authors the West African race is considered to
                    represent a third distinct species, which has been named <hi rend="italic">M.
                    leueonota.</hi> All the ratels are of very much the same colour, namely,
                    iron-grey on the upper parts of the head, body, and tail, and black below, a
                    style of coloration rather rare among mammals, as the upper side of the body is
                    in the great majority darker than the lower. Their body is stout and thickly
                    built; the legs are short and strong, and armed, especially on the anterior
                    pair, with long curved fossorial claws; the tail is short; and the ear-conches
                    are reduced to mere rudiments. These modifications are all in relation to a
                    burrowing mode of life, for which the ratels are among the best adapted of all
                    carnivores. The skull is conical, stout, and heavy, and the teeth, although
                    sharper and less rounded than those of their allies the badgers, are yet far
                    less suited to a purely carnivorous diet than those of such typical <hi
                    rend="italic">Mustelidae</hi> as the stoats, weasels, and martens. The two
                    species of ratel may be distinguished by the fact that the African has a
                    distinct white line round the body at the junction of the grey of the upper side
                    with the black of the lower, while in the Indian this line is absejit; the teeth
                    also of the former are on the whole decidedly larger, rounder, and heavier than
                    those of the latter. In spite of these differences, however, the two ratels are
                    so nearly allied that they might almost be considered to be merely geographical
                    races of a single widely spread species.</p>
                <p>The following account of the Indian ratel is extracted from Dr Judson’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Mammals of India·.</hi> — “The Indian badger is found throughout
                    the whole of India, from the extreme south to the foot of the Himalayas, chiefly
                    in hilly districts, where it has greater facilities for constructing the holes
                    and dens in which it lives; but also in the north of India in alluvial plains,
                    where the banks of large rivers afford equally suitable localities wherein to
                    make its lair. It is stated to live usually in pairs, and to eat rats, birds,
                    frogs, white ants, and various insects, and in the north of India it is accused
                    of digging out dead bodies, and is popularly known as the grave-digger. It
                    doubtless also, like its Cape congener, occasionally partakes of honey. It is
                    often very destructive to poultry, and I have known of several having been
                    trapped and killed whilst committing such depredations in Central India and in
                    the northern Circars. In confinement the Indian badger is quiet and will partake
                    of vegetable food, fruits, rice, &amp;c.” ' (O. T. )</p>
