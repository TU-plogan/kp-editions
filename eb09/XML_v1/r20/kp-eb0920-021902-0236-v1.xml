                    (1781-1826), the son of a captain in the West India trade, was born at sea off
                    the coast of Jamaica on 5tli July 1781. Returning with his mother to England, he
                    was placed in a boarding-school at Hammersmith, where he remained till the age
                    of fourteen, when he entered the East India House as an extra clerk. While
                    employed there he occupied his leisure hours in particularly studying languages,
                    for which he possessed great facility. In 1805 the directors of the India House
                    having resolved to found a new trading settlement at Penang, Raffles was
                    appointed assistant-secretary, and on his voyage out he acquired the Malay
                    language. Owing to the illness of the chief secretary, he soon had to undertake
                    the entire administrative labour of the new government. In 1808 he had to visit
                    Malacca to recruit his shattered strength; here he enjoyed large opportunity of
                    mingling with a very varied population, and, in company with the two
                    Orientalists Marsden and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n237/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0237-0220"/>Leyden, he began his elaborate researches into the
                    history, laws, and literature of the Hindu and Malay races. In zoology he took
                    special interest, and on his return to England became founder and first
                    president of the Zoological Society. While in Calcutta in 1809, Raffles
                    suggested to Lord Minto, then governor-general of India, the desirableness of
                    wresting Java from the French. The governor-general took up the idea with
                    vigour; a fleet of ninety ships dropped anchor before Batavia in August 1811,
                    and in a short time the conquest of the island was effected. Raffles was made
                    lieutenant-general of the new territory, and resolved to give to the island a
                    pure and upright administration. There were three sources of abuse to
                    eradicate—the revenue system, the system of police and public justice, and the
                    slave trade. In a period of only five years Raffles had almost effected his
                    design; his popularity was secured, and the revenue was eight times larger than
                    it had been under the Dutch. The policy of some of his measures being, however,
                    considered doubtful by the home authorities, he was recalled in 1816, but his
                    conduct was approved. He published a valuable and well-illustrated <hi
                    rend="italic">History of Java,</hi> in 2 vols. 4to, 1817.</p>
                <p>Having received knighthood, Sir Stamford Raffles set out for Sumatra as
                    lieutenant-governor of Bencoolen, arriving in March 1818, and immediately
                    recommenced the work of reform. In 1819 he induced the marquis of Hastings to
                    annex Singapore. He again visited Singapore, his “political child,” in 1822, and
                    occupied himself for nearly a year in laying out the new city, and in
                    establishing its constitution as a free port. Java had been given up to the
                    Dutch shortly after Sir Stamford left it, and now Bencoolen was granted to them
                    in exchange for Malacca. On setting sail for England from Sumatra in February
                    1824 the ship took fire and the crew and passengers were with difficulty saved.
                    The loss to Sir Stamford was beyond all repair. The whole of his drawings, all
                    his collections in botany and zoology, all his multitudinous papers and
                    manuscripts, fell a prey to the flames, his pecuniary loss amounting to more
                    than ¿£20,000. During one of his excursions into the interior of Sumatra, in
                    company with Dr Arnold, he came upon the largest and most extraordinary of known
                    flowers, the <hi rend="italic">Rafflesia Amoldi</hi> (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Parasitism,</hi> vol. xviii. p. 265). In 1820 he sent home a large collection
                    of preserved animals, now in the museum of the London Zoological Society,
                    described in the <hi rend="italic">Transactions</hi> of the Linnean Society. He
                    died of apoplexy at his house near London on 5th July 1826.</p>
