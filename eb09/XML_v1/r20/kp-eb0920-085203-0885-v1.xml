                    which is run off through a tap at the bottom of the still, purified by passing

                    turpentine is drawn and the amount of heat applied in distillation, from an
                    opaque almost pitchy black substance through grades of brown and yellow to an
                    almost perfectly transparent colourless glassy mass. The commercial grades are

                    about three times the value of the common qualities. Rosin is a very brittle and
                    friable resin, with a faint piny odour, softening at about 176° and melting
                    completely at the temperature of boiling water. It dissolves freely in ether,
                    benzol, and chloroform, and to some extent in alcohol and fatty oils. When
                    exposed to the action of hot dilute alcohol or when boiled with alkaline
                    solutions it takes up a molecule of water and becomes converted into abietic
                    acid, a change which also takes place slowly in the air when the resin is yet
                    mixed with the essential oil as it flows from the trees. Rosin is thus regarded
                    as an anhydride of abietic acid, and its use in yellow soaps is due to the fact
                    that this acid itself combines with caustic alkalies to form a kind of soap. In
                    addition to its extensive use in soap-making, rosin is largely employed in
                    making inferior varnishes, sealing wax, and various cements. It is also used for
                    preparing shoemaker’s wax, for soldering metals, for pitching lager beer casks,
                    for rosining the bows of musical instruments, and numerous minor purposes. In
                    pharmacy it forms an ingredient in several plasters and ointments. On a large
                    scale it is treated by destructive distillation for the production of an oily
                    complex hydrocarbon, having a tarry odour and a whitish opalescent colour, which
                    under the name of rosin oil is much used as a lubricant. Rosin oil also enters
                    extensively into the common kinds of fatty oils as an adulterant.</p>
                <p>The chief region of rosin production is the southern coast States of the American
                    Union,—the ports of Wilmington, Charleston, Savannah, and Brunswick being the
                    principal centres of the trade. American rosin is obtained from the turpentine
                    of the swamp pine, <hi rend="italic">Pinus australis,</hi> and of the loblolly
                    pine, <hi rend="italic">P. Taeda.</hi> The main source of supply in Europe is
                    the “landes” of the departments of Gironde and Landes in France, where the sea
                    pine, <hi rend="italic">P. maritima,</hi> is extensively cultivated. In the
                    north of Europe rosin is obtained from the Scotch fir, <hi rend="italic">P.
                    sylvestris,</hi> and throughout European countries local supplies are obtained
                    from other species of pine. The imports into the United Kingdom average about
                    1,250,000 cwts. annually, nearly the whole of which comes from America. In 1883
                    the amount imported was 1,377,368 cwts. (1,337,848 cwts. from the United States
                    and 16,242 cwts. from France), the total estimated value of the imports being
                    £400,938.</p>
