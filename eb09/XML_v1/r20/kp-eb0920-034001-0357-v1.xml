                <p><label type="entry">REGALIA</label> insignia of royalty used at the coronation of
                    the sovereign and other great state ceremonials. The regalia of England were in
                    very early times deposited for security in some religious house dependent on the
                    crown, most generally in the treasury of the Temple. The first mention of their
                    being deposited in the Tower of London is in the reign of Henry III., who on his
                    return from France in 1230 commanded the bishop of Carlisle to replace the
                    jewels in the Tower as they had been before. From his time down to the present
                    the regalia (with the exception of the ancient crown of Edward the Confessor,
                    long retained in Westminster Abbey) have been generally in the Tower under the
                    care of a keeper, but both Henry III. and several of his successors, when in
                    money difficulties, had recourse to the expedient of pawning the crown jewels to
                    raise a loan. Originally the keeper was appointed by letters patent at a stated
                    salary of <hi rend="italic">£50</hi> per annum, which was so largely increased
                    by perquisites that in the time of Henry VIII. it amounted to about ¿£1500. The
                    office had attached to it important privileges, and was frequently held by
                    persons of distinction. At the Restoration many of the perquisites were
                    abolished, and since that period the duties have been merged in those of the
                    lord chamberlain, who appoints a person to have charge of the regalia in the
                    Tower. To make up for the decrease in the perquisites of the office, the regalia
                    were first in the reign of Charles II. allowed to be exhibited in public, the
                    profits accruing being given to the person appointed by the lord chamberlain to
                    have charge of the regalia. They were originally kept in a small building in the
                    south side of the White Tower, till the reign of Charles I., when they were
                    transferred to a strong chamber in the Martin Tower, afterwards called the Jewel
                    Tower. During the Civil War they were nearly all carried off by the Puritans and
                    destroyed, and in 1671 an attempt made to steal the new regalia by Colonel <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Blood</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.)</hi> was nearly successful.
                    During the fire of 1841 they were removed for safety to the house of the
                    governor, and afterwards a new room within the Wakefield Tower was constructed
                    for their reception. The regalia now contained in this room include St Edward’s
                    crown, made for the coronation of Charles II. to replace the one broken up and
                    sold during the Civil War; the new state crown made for the coronation of Queen
                    Victoria; the prince of Wales’s crown; the queen consort’s crown; the queen’s
                    diadem or circlet of gold made for the coronation of Marie d’Este, consort of
                    James IT.; St Edward’s staff of beaten gold; the royal sceptre or sceptre with
                    the cross; the rod of equity or sceptre with the dove; the queen’s sceptre with
                    the cross; the queen’s ivory sceptre, made for Marie d’Fste; an ancient sceptre
                    supposed to have been made for Queen Mary, consort of William III.; the orb; the
                    queen’s orb; the Koh-i-Noor diamond; the sword of mercy or curtana; the sword of
                    justice; the armilke or coronation bracelets; the royal spurs; the ampulla for
                    the holy oil; the gold coronation spoon (supposed to be the only relic of the
                    ancient regalia now remaining); the golden salt cellar; the baptismal font; and
                    the silver wine fountain presented to Charles II. by the corporation of
                    Plymouth.</p>
                <p>The regalia of Scotland, of which there is a very complete account in <hi
                    rend="italic">1’aprrs relative to the regalia of Scotland</hi> published by the
                    Bannatyne Club (1829), consist of the crown, the sceptre, and the sword of
                    state. The ancient regalia were carried off or destroyed by Edward I. of England
                    in 1296, and Robert Bruce was crowned at Scone with a temporary crownlet, which
                    also shortly afterwards fell into the hands of the English. The present crown,
                    from the character of a portion of its workmanship, is supposed to be that made
                    by the orders of Robert Brace and first used at the coronation of David TI. in
                    1329. Two concentric circles were added to it in the reign of James V.,
                    surmounted at the point of intersection with a mound of gold enamelled and a
                    large cross patee, upon which arc the characters J. R. V. The sceptre was made
                    in the reign of</p>
                <p>James V., and the sword of state was presented to King James IV. in 1507 by Pope
                    Julius II. When Cromwell invaded Scotland the regalia were removed for greater
                    security by the earl marischal from the crown room in Edinburgh Castle to his
                    castle of Duunottar, one of the strongest fortresses in Scotland. During its
                    siege by Cromwell they were carried from it by a stratagem devised by the wife
                    of the governor and the wife of the minister of Kiuneff, and buried under the
                    flagstones in Kinneff church, where they remained till the Restoration. From the
                    Restoration till the Union they were deposited in the crown room of Edinburgh
                    Castle. After the Union they lay locked in a chest until 1818, when they were
                    first publicly exhibited. See also the articles <hi rend="smallcaps">Coronation,
