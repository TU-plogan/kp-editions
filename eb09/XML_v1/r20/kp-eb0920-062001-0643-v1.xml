                <p><label type="entry">ROEMER</label> Ole (Latinized Olaus) (1644-1710), Danish
                    astronomer, was born at Aarhuus in Jutland, 25th September 1644. He studied
                    mathematics at the university of Copenhagen until 1671, when he assisted Picard
                    in determining the geographical position of Tycho Brahe’s observatory
                    (Uranienburg on the island of Huen). In 1672 he accompanied Picard to Paris,
                    where he remained nine years, occupied with observations at the new royal
                    observatory and hydraulic works at Versailles and Marly. In 1675 he read a paper
                    before the Academy on the successive propagation of light as revealed by a
                    certain inequality in the motion of the first of Jupiter’s satellites (see
                    Parallax, vol. xviii. p. 251). In 1681 he returned to Copenhagen, where he spent
                    the remainder of his days as professor of astronomy, but his great ability and
                    practical talents were made use of in several other public employments. He died
                    on 23d September 1710.</p>
                <p>Roemer’s name is now best known by his discovery of the finite velocity of light.
                    Most of his contemporaries doubted the reality of this discovery, chiefly
                    because the eclipses of the three outer satellites of Jupiter did not show
                    similar irregularities to those exhibited by the first satellite. This is not
                    surprising, as the mutual attraction of the satellites makes their motions far
                    more complicated than astronomers imagined before the development of the theory
                    of gravitation, and it should perhaps be chiefly ascribed to chance that Roemer
                    brought forward his theory, which Bradley’s discovery of the aberration of light
                    about fifty years later proved to be a true one. Roemer’s ingenuity has,
                    however, appeared very prominently in the important improvements which he
                    carried out in the construction of astronomical instruments. The large
                    “armil-lary spheres,” first constructed by the astronomers of Alexandria and
                    also used by Tycho Brahe, had been superseded by the meridian or mural quadrant
                    for measuring meridian zenith distances, and by the sextant for measuring
                    distances between stars in order to find their difference of right ascension by
                    solving the spherical triangle between the pole and the two stars. Both these
                    instruments were introduced by Tycho Brahe. Roemer, however, saw that Tycho’s
                    idea of making the rotating earth itself an astronomical instrument by observing
                    the transits of stars across the meridian could be carried out better by fixing
                    a telescope at right angles to a horizontal axis placed exactly east and west,
                    so that the telescope could only move in the meridian. The first transit
                    instrument was constructed in 1689 and erected in Roemer’s house in 1690. In the
                    same year he erected in the university observatory an instrument with altitude
                    and azimuth circles (for observing equal altitudes on both sides of the
                    meridian) and an equatorial instrument. In 1704 he constructed a private
                    observatory at Vridlösemagle, a few miles west of Copenhagen, and mounted a
                    meridian circle (the transit instrument and vertical circle combined) and a
                    transit instrument moving in the prime vertical. Roemer may thus be considered
                    the inventor of nearly all our modern instruments of precision, and it is much
                    to be regretted that his ideas were not adopted by astronomers until about a
                    century later. All the results of his observations were destroyed in a great
                    conflagration in 1728, except three days’ work, which has been discussed by
                    Galle (O. <hi rend="italic">Roemeri triduum οbservatiοnum astroenoemiearum a.
                    1706 institutarurn,</hi> Berlin, 1845). His disciple Horrebow has left us a very
                    detailed description of Roemer’s instruments and ideas in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Opera mathematico-physiea</hi> (3 vols., Copenhagen, 1740-41). Grant’s <hi
                    rend="italic">History of Physical Astronomy</hi> (London, 1852) gives a very
                    correct account of Roemer and his inventions. About his life see also an article
                    by Philipsen in <hi rend="italic">Nordisk Universitets Tidsskrift,</hi> vol. v.,
