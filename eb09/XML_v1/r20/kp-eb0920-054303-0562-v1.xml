                <p><label type="entry">RICHARDSON</label> Samvel (1689—1761), as the inventor or the
                    accidental discoverer of a new literary form, the modern novel of domestic life
                    and manners, is entitled to a more prominent place in history than his powers,
                    whether of thought or style, would justify. He stumbled on novel writing by
                    accident and late in life. The son of a Derbyshire joiner (born in 1689), he had
                    been apprenticed at the age of seventeen to a London printer (Wilde of
                    Stationers’ Hall), had spent some years as a press reader or proof corrector—not
                    a bad position for acquiring some knowledge of literature—had married his
                    master’s daughter, and acquired an extensive business, trying his hand
                    occasionally in composition as a writer of prefaces and dedications to the books
                    that he printed. When he was near the age of fifty some bookseller friends of
                    his, struck perhaps by the excellence of his letters, had suggested to him that
                    he should compose a “familiar letter-writer”— “a little volume of letters, in
                    common style, on such subjects as might be of use to those country readers who
                    were unable to indite for themselves.” Richardson improved upon the suggestion.
                    As it happened, he had had a singular experience in the way of writing letters
                    for others. When he was a boy of thirteen three young women λvho could not write
                    had employed him to conduct their correspondence with their sweethearts, which
                    he did, he tells us, much to the satisfaction of his employers and without
                    betraying their confidence. It occurred to him, turning over the project of the
                    booksellers in his mind, and reverting to this early experience, that he might
                    tell a story in a series of letters which would serve equally well as models for
                    letter-writing and at the same time cultivate the principles of virtue and
                    religion in the minds of the youth of both sexes. Accordingly, the publication
                    being for country readers, he chose a country girl, Pamela, in the service of a
                    young squire Mr B. (Fielding afterwards expanded the initial to “Booby ”), and
                    made-her relate in letters to her friends her experiences from day to day and
                    week to week in very trying circumstances. Friends write to advise Pamela in her
                    difficulties, and so the story is carried on with circumstantial minuteness,
                    Pamela describing with the most careful elaboration every particular of what
                    happens to her, and adding her own reflexions, surmises, and appeals for
                    approbation and counsel. The natural effect of this method is that, if we have
                    any sympathy with the heroine, we get intensely interested in her
                    perplexities,—the very fulness of the details and the close truth to nature with
                    which the novelist follows every turn in the girl’s thoughts compelling us to
                    read on. This effect was fully realized in days when the voluminous moralizing
                    was more in harmony with the general taste than it is now, and the kind of thing
                    was new and fresh. The success of <hi rend="italic">Pamela</hi> was immediate
                    and widespread, and extended at once far beyond the circle of country cousins
                    for whom it was designed. It is said that ladies at Ranelagh Gardens were to be
                    seen holding up one to another their copies of <hi rend="italic">Pamela</hi> to
                    show that they had in their possession the most popular book of the day. The
                    industrious antiquary has cast doubt upon this anecdote, pointing out that
                    Ranelagh Gardens were not open to the public till eighteen months after <hi
                    rend="italic">Pamela</hi> had begun to run through many editions. Vauxhall,
                    however, was open if Ranelagh was not, and the incident may have been observed
                    there. At any rate the fact expressed by the anecdote is true enough, that the
                    novel was at once and universally popular. <hi rend="italic">Pamela,</hi> the
                    first of one long line of novels, was published in November 1740. In January
                    1741 the following appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</hi>
                    :—“Several encomiums on a series of <hi rend="italic">Familiar Letters,</hi>
                    published but last month, entitled <hi rend="italic">Pamela, or Virtue
                    Rewarded,</hi> came too late for this magazine, and we believe there will be
                    little occasion for inserting them in our next, because a second edition will
                    then come out to supply the demands of the country, it being judged in town as
                    great a sign of want of curiosity not to have read <hi rend="italic">Pamela</hi>
                    as not to have seen the <hi rend="italic">French</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Italian</hi> Dancers.” This testimony is hardly less quaint and significant
                    than the accredited anecdote.</p>
                <p>It was thus that this industrious prosperous printer, a stout, rosy, vain,
                    precise little man, carrying himself with sensitive dignity, not at all the kind
                    of man that might have been expected to be a fashionable novelist, stumbled in
                    the natural course of his business upon a new species of composition for which
                    he had an unsuspected genius.</p>

                <p>The fame of <hi rend="italic">Pamela</hi> made him a great personal favourite,
                    especially with women, of λvhose hearts and fancies he had shown a knowledge so
                    intimate. Several ladies of quality made a pet of him, deluged him with
                    questions and confidences, and urged him to write more. Under this flattering
                    encouragement, the sedate author, still keeping his head and following his own
                    plans amidst a multitude of counsellors, produced <hi rend="italic">Clarissa
                    Harlowe</hi> (1749), a model of every virtue in higher life, and <hi
                    rend="italic">Sir Charles Grandison</hi> (1753), his ideal of a perfect
                    gentleman. <hi rend="italic">Clarissa</hi> is universally acknowledged to be his
                    masterpiece. Au anecdote was given by Macaulay which shows how entrancing the
                    story may become to readers once fairly caught by the current of it. He took the
                    whole eight volumes with him, when he was in India, to a hill station during the
                    hot season, and one day lent the first volume to the governor’s wife. She read
                    it and lent it to the governor’s secretary, and went to Macaulay for the second.
                    Thus all the eight volumes passed from hand to hand, and for a week or more the
                    whole station was in a ferment over the fortunes of Clarissa, the readers
                    anxiously waiting their turn for the successive volumes. Richardson is
                    long-winded and prolix to a degree; but that, in spite of all his faults, he had
                    the art of interesting his own generation was abundantly proved, and apparently
                    his greatest novel is still capable in favourable circumstances of exerting its
                    spell.</p>
                <p>Richardson has long received the honour of being regarded as the founder of the
                    English novel, but of late it has been customary to go a little farther back and
                    trace the beginnings of the novel in the papers of Addison and Steele in the
                    Tatler and the Spectator. The novel, it is said, λvas developed, not created, by
                    Richardson. Now this is hardly fair to the ingenious printer, if it is meant to
                    deny him any of the credit generally given to originators of new forms in
                    literature. It is true that the novel was developed and not created, but it is
                    not more true of Richardson’s novel than of any other new species of
                    composition, such as Marlowe’s tragedy, or Scott’s romantic tale, or Byron’s
                    personal epic. All alike are not created but developed in this sense that they
                    have strongly marked affinities with kinds of writing immediately anterior to
                    them. Thus in the novel of manners there are two elements—there is description
                    of ordinary character, and there is plot-interest, i.e., there is a story. Both
                    of these elements are found in the generation before Richardson. But not in
                    combination. It was he that combined them in his novel of manners, and therefore
                    he is entitled to the praise of being the father of a new species of
                    composition. There is abundance of description of manners in the Spectator and
                    there are many delicate studies of character. And the general reader in the days
                    of Queen Anne and of George I. had abundance of stories to choose from—tales of
                    scandal, of crime, of high-flown romance. But it had not occurred to anybody
                    before Richardson to make a heroine out of such a character as Jenny Simper, or
                    a hero out of her baronet Sir Anthony Love, or a story out of incidents within
                    the probabilities of ordinary life. The epistolary form in which his stories
                    were cast, and which remains as a memorial of their first suggestion, was
                    abandoned by Richardson’s first great follower and satirist, Fielding; but it
                    was Richardson that led the way into the new field of literature. He lived long
                    enough to see many imitators. Within twelve years of the publication of Pamela,
                    the Monthly Review began to complain of the labour of reading the multitude of
                    novels submitted to its judgment, and the masterpieces of Fielding, Smollett,
                    and Sterne were produced before his death in 1761. His correspondence was
                    published in six volumes in 1804. (W. M.)</p>
