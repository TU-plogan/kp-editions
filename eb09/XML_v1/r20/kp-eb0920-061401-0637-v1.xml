                <p><label type="entry">ROCHESTER</label> a city of the United States, capital of
                    Monroe county, New York, lies 229 miles to the west of Albany (43° 9' 22" <hi
                    rend="superscript">-</hi> 44 N. lat. and 77° 36' 50" ’ 97 W. long.), in a rich
                    agricultural region, upon a plateau on both banks of the Genesee river, 7 miles
                    from its mouth at Lake Ontario and 263 feet above the lake level. There are
                    three falls in the river of 96, 26, and 83 feet respectively within the city
                    limits, the banks below the first fall varying in height from 100 to 210 feet.
                    To this abundant water-power of the Genesee, supplemented by the transportation
                    facilities afforded by the Erie Canal and the various railway connexions,
                    Rochester mainly owes its progress and prosperity. The streets of the city are
                    generally wide, and well paved and lighted (partly by electricity), and trees
                    and flowering plants are abundant. Rochester is an important railway centre. The
                    New York Central Railroad, with elevated tracks through the city, has two lines
                    east to Syracuse, two west to Buffalo and Niagara Falls respectively, and one
                    north to Charlotte, where connexion is made with the Rome, Watertown, and
                    Ogdensburg line; a branch of the New York, Lake Erie, and Western Railway
                    connects with the main line at Corning and with the Buffalo branch at Avon; the
                    Rochester and Pittsburgh Railway runs south to Salamanca, and the Genesee Valley
                    Railway to Olean, crossing the West Shore Railway a short distance south of the
                    city line; and there are also railway lines to Irondequoit Bay and Windsor
                    beach, and about 30 miles of street railway, radiating from the centre in all
                    directions. The manufactures of Rochester are numerous and varied. Though no
                    longer at the head of the flour industry, it still possesses twenty mills,
                    capable of producing 2900 barrels daily. The principal manufacture is that of
                    ready-made clothing, the sales reaching $9,000,000 annually. In its boot and
                    shoe trade the city ranks fourth in the country (5000 hands; annual sales,
                    $6,500,000). There are also sixteen breweries and ten malt-houses; some eighty
                    or ninety cigar-makers and tobacconists have a total output of about 2,000,000
                    lb of tobacco, 18,000,000 cigars, and 140,000,000 cigarettes; while
                    furniture-making employs 1000 hands. The lumber business is extensive; and of
                    late years the city has been one of the principal centres for the distribution
                    of the anthracite and bituminous coal of Pennsylvania. Its numerous nurseries
                    are a peculiar feature of the place; and there is a great variety of other
                    industries. The main supply of water is brought in iron conduits (147 miles of
                    pipe) from Hemlock Lake, 29 miles to the south; an additional supply for
                    subsidiary purposes is drawn from the Genesee river (ll∣ miles of pipe). The
                    total cost of the works has been $3,744,749. The princi pal cemetery, Mount
                    Hope, with an area of 200 acres, is exceedingly picturesque and well cared for.
                    Rochester has two State institutions, the Western House of Refuge and the
                    Western New York Institution for Deaf Mutes. The former, opened in 1849, is a
                    substantial structure of brick, with accommodation for 600 inmates, built at a

                    they are instructed in trades and labour upon the farm belonging to the refuge.
                    The institution for deaf mutes (1875) instructs about 160 pupils annually. Among

                    seminaries, and parochial schools. The university of Rochester was established
                    in 1850, under Baptist auspices; its faculty consists of a president and ten
                    professors, and the annual attendance of students is about 160. It has two
                    buildings,—Anderson Hall and Sible Hall. The Rochester theological seminary
                    (Baptist), founded in 1850 and housed in two commodious buildings—Trevor and
                    Rockefeller Halls—has eight professors and about seventy students, besides a
                    German department. Other public libraries in addition to those of the university

                <p>Rochester derives its name from Nathaniel Rochester, who projected a settlement
                    here in 1810; the first house was built in 1812; and the incorporation of the
                    city dates from 1834.</p>
