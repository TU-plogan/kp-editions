                <p><label type="entry">RADNOR</label> an inland county of South Wales, is situated
                    between 52° 5' and 52° 25' N. lat. and between 2° 57' and 3° 25' W. long., and
                    is bounded E. by Hereford and Shropshire, N. by Montgomery, W. by Cardigan, and
                    S. by Brecknock. Its greatest length from north to south is about 30 miles, and
                    its greatest breadth from east to west about 33 miles. The area is 276,552
                    acres, or 432 square miles.</p>
                <p>The greater part of the surface of the county is hilly, and the centre is
                    occupied by a mountainous tract called Radnor Forest, running nearly east and
                    west, its highest summit reaching 2163 feet. Towards the south and south-east
                    the hills are much less elevated and the valleys widen out into considerable
                    plains, abounding with small rivulets. The hills for the most part present
                    smooth and rounded outlines, but the valley of the Wye is famed for its beauty.
                    The higher ranges are covered with heath, but there is good pasturage on the
                    lower slopes. The smaller elevations are frequently clothed with wood. The
                    prevailing strata are the Lower Silurian rocks; but in the east there is a
                    considerable area occupied by Old Red Sandstone, and throughout the county
                    felspathic ash and greenstone are found, while near Old Radnor there is a large
                    patch of Silurian limestone. Lead and copper are said to exist, but not in
                    quantities sufficient to pay the working. There are saline, sulphurous, and
                    chalybeate wells at Llandrindod. The Wye enters the county in the north-west, 18
                    miles from its source in Plinlimmon, and flowing in a south-easterly direction
                    divides it from Brecknock, until it bends north-east and reaches Hay, after
                    which it for some distance forms the boundary with Hereford. Its principal
                    tributary is the Ithon, which flows south-west and joins it 7 miles above
                    Builth. The Teme, flowing southeast, forms the northern boundary of the county
                    with Shropshire. The Llugw, rising in the northern part of the county, flows
                    south-east into Hereford, a little below Presteigne.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Agriculture.</hi> —The climate is somewhat damp, and in the
                    spring cold and ungenial. The greater part of the county is suitable only for
                    pasturage, but there is some good arable land in the valleys in the southern and
                    south-eastern districts, which produces excellent crops of turnips, oats, and
                    Welsh barley, the soil being chiefly open shaly clay, although in the east there
                    is an admixture of red sandstone soils. In 1884 there w <hi rend="superscript"

                    cultivation, and of these 114,242 acres, or about four-fifths, were in permanent
                    pasture. Of the 21,356 acres under corn crops 12,245 acres, or more than half,
                    were under oats, whilst wheat occupied 5200 acres and barley 3853. Green crops
                    occupied only 7100 acres, of which 1107 were under potatoes and 5682 under
                    turnips. Horses numbered 9249 (3755 used solely for agricultural purposes),
                    cattle 30,917 (10,223 cows and heifers in milk or in calf), and sheep as many as
                    244,771. The inhabitants are dependent almost solely on agriculture, the
                    manufactures being confined chiefly to coarse cloth, stockings, and flannel for
                    home use.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Railways.</hi> —The county is intersected by several lines: the
                    Central Wales Railway runs south-west from Knighton to Llandovery; another line
                    runs south-eastwards by Rhayader and Builth and joins the Hereford line, which
                    passes by Hay and Talgarth; while another branch line passes by Kineton to New
                    Radnor.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration and Population.</hi> —Radnor comprises six
                    hundreds, but contains no municipal borough. It has one court of quarter
                    sessions and is divided into six petty and special sessional divisions. The
                    ancient borough of Radnor (population 2005) is governed by the provisions of an
                    old charter, and has a commission of the peace. The county contains sixty civil
                    parishes with part of one other, and is partly in the diocese of St David’s and
                    partly in that of Hereford. It returns one member to the House of Commons. The
                    population in 1871 was 25,430 and in 1881 it was 23,528, of whom 11,939 were
                    males and 11,589 females. ,The number of inhabited houses was 4775. The average
                    number of persons to an acre was 009־ and of acres to a person 1175־.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History and Antiquities.</hi> —During the Roman occupation the
                    district was included in the province of Siluria. The Roman road from Chester to
                    Caermarthen entered the northern extremity of the county near Newtown and,
                    following the valley of the Ithon, crossed the Wye and entered Brecknockshire
                    near the town of Builth. There are remains of a Roman station at Cym near
                    Llandrindod, and at Wapley Hill near Presteigne there is a very good example of
                    a British camp. The district was afterwards included chiefly in Powis, but
                    partly in Gwent and partly in Feryllwge. It was made a county by Henry VIII.
                    Anciently it was called Maesy-fedd. The name Radnor is also of very great
                    antiquity, and occurs in the Cambrian annals as early as 1196. There are no
                    ancient castles claiming special notice, and the only ecclesiastical ruin of
                    importance is that of the abbey of Cwm-Hir, founded for the Cistercians in 1143,
                    and occupying a romantic situation in the vale of Clywedog. A considerable
                    portion of the ancient building has been used as materials for the adjoining
                    modern mansion.</p>
