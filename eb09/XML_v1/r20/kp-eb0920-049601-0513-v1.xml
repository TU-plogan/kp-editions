                <p><label type="entry">REVELATION</label> Book of. The book of the New Testament
                    called “Revelation of John” <hi rend="italic">(Άποκάλυψις ‰amv)</hi> so long
                    passed for the most obscure and difficult document of early Christianity that
                    scholars hesitated to apply to it the historico-critical method of
                    investigation. Since this hesitation has been overcome, it appears that the
                    matter of the book is neither obscure nor mysterious, although many special
                    points still remain to be cleared up. Without being paradoxical we may affirm
                    that the Apocalypse is the most intelligible book in the New Testament, because
                    its author had not the individuality and originality of Paul or of the author of
                    the Fourth Gospel, and because historically we can trace and comprehend its
                    author’s position much better than we can, for instance, the theology of Paul.
                    But all interpretations not strictly historical must bo excluded. The
                    ethico-spiritualistic, rationalistic, and dogmatic explanations, such as were
                    first attempted by the Alexandrine theologians, are fatal to the understanding
                    of the book, as are also the explanations drawn from church history which were
                    first put forward by mediaeval sects. To see with Hengstenberg “demagogy” in
                    “Gog and Magog” (xx. 8), to identify “Apollyon” (ix. 11) with “Napoleon,” or in
                    antichrist to detect the emperor or the pope or Mohammed or Luther or
                    Calvin—these interpretations are not a bit worse than those which turn the book
                    into a compendium of morality or dogma wherein is set forth by means of imagery
                    and allegories the triumph of virtue over vice or of orthodoxy over heterodoxy.
                    The justification of the interpretation which explains the book entirely in the
                    light of the historical circumstances attending its origin and of the views
                    current amongst primitive Christians follows, above all, from observing that as
                    a literary production the Revelation of John is by no means unique, but belongs
                    to a class of literature (comp. Apocalyptic Literature, vol. ii. p. 174) which
                    then had a very wide currency amongst the Jews, and the numerous remains of
                    which even the most orthodox theologians do not hesitate to interpret by the
                    help of the history of the time. The apocalyptic literature, in the strict sense
                    of the word, began with the Jews in the 2d century b.c.; in fact it developed as
                    an aftergrowth of the prophetical literature, from which it differs less in kind
                    than in degree. For more than three centuries it had sought to revive the
                    drooping spirit of the people by revelations of a near future when, after one
                    last dreadful onset of a hostile world, Jahveh would appear in the person of His
                    Messiah to conquer the nations of the world and to set up the kingdom of glory
                    for Israel. Every time the political situation culminated in a crisis for the
                    people of God the apocalypses appeared stirring up the believers. In spirit,
                    form, plan, and execution they closely resembled each other. Their differences
                    sprang only from the difference of the times, for every apocalyptic writer
                    painted the final catastrophe after the model of the catastrophes of his day,
                    only on a vaster scale and with deepened shadows. They all spoke in riddles;
                    that is, by means of images, symbols, mystic numbers, forms of animals,
                    &lt;fec., they half concealed Λvhat they meant to reveal. The reasons for this
                    procedure are not far to seek :— ( 1 ) clearness and distinctness would have
                    been too profane— only the mysterious appears divine; (2) it was often dangerous
                    to be too distinct. The apocalyptic writers in their works supplied revelations
                    on all possible questions, but their principal achievement was regularly a
                    revelation of the history of mankind in general and of the people of Israel in
                    particular; in their most essential features the apocalypses are political
                    manifestos. It is characteristic of all apocalypses that they pass under false
                    names, being attributed to the most celebrated persons of the Old Testament;
                    thus we still possess apocalypses under the names of Daniel, Baruch, Ezra,
                    Moses, and Enoch. These old heroes are represented in the respective w <hi
                    rend="superscript">r</hi> orks as speaking in the first person, and exhorting
                    their readers to await with hope and patience the coming of the Messiah. Usually
                    the apocalypse contains a brief summary of history, beginning with the time of
                    the nominal and ending with that of the actual author, in order that the reader,
                    perceiving how much of the prophecy has already been fulfilled to the letter,
                    may look w <hi rend="superscript">τ</hi> ith assured confidence for the
                    fulfilment of the rest. Lastly, the particular features in the descriptions as
                    well as the images and metaphors are usually borrowed in great measure from the
                    books of the old prophets, but they are painted in <pb break="no"

                    imagery is alive with the burning breath of the East; a luxuriant fancy
                    sacrifices beauty to boldness and sets proportion at defiance; all that is sweet
                    and human yields to all that is monstrous and repulsive. A flow of metaphors, an
                    interminable personification of abstractions, animates these strange creations
                    with the weird and awful life of some fantastic resurrection scene. At the same
                    time none of the descriptions are clear and intelligible; the outlines of the
                    pictures melt and fade away in tremulous lines despite the coarseness of the
                    material on which they are drawn.”</p>
                <p>2Ys Jesus Christ had promised to come again, the Jewish expectations of a Messiah
                    who should be revealed continued unabated among many of His disciples; that
                    which as Jews they had hoped from the first and only advent they now deferred
                    till the second. True, the kingdom of God which He had promised did not tally
                    with the materialistic hopes of the people, but on the other hand He had not
                    infrequently Himself employed the figurative language of the prophets and
                    apocalyptic writers; and, after He had left the earth, many sayings borrowed
                    from the Jewish apocalypses were put in His mouth by a vitiated tradition. <note

                    century spiritual and material elements were strangely blent. Hence not only
                    were the Jewish apocalypses, the genuineness of which no one doubted, read in
                    the Christian communities and transmitted to the Gentile converts, but soon
                    there appeared new apocalypses written by Christians. We cannot wonder at this,
                    for all conditions favourable to the production of such writings were to be
                    found in the churches also; above all, men were conscious of possessing the
                    spirit of prophecy in a far fuller measure than ever before, and this spirit
                    necessarily manifested itself not only in signs and wonders but also in
                    revelations and predictions. Of the Christian apocalypses written between 70 and
                    170 a.d. only a very small portion is known to us; for the later church viewed
                    them as dangerous and got rid of them. Even of the apocalypse of Peter, written
                    in the 1st century and regarded as canonical in some provinces as late as the
                    3d, only a very few fragments have come down to us. <note anchored="true"

                    form from the Jewish apocalypses; but undoubtedly its arrangement is better, and
                    its execution simpler and grander, and therefore more tasteful. <note

                    Apocalypse of John is much higher than that of any of the Jewish apocalypses.
                    The author possessed the art of keeping his readers enthralled and excited from
                    first to last; by a suitable arrangement he has really reduced his motley
                    material to order, and by skilful description he has contrived to make even the
                    repulsive endurable. </p></note> In its contents, however, the distinction
                    between this Christian apocalypse and its Jewish fellows is marked; for, while
                    the latter have not and could not have any actual knowledge of the Messiah whom
                    they promise, the Apocalypse of John centres round the crucified and risen
                    Jesus, the Lamb that was slain. The author knows whom he and the Christian
                    community have to expect; to him Jesus Christ is the alpha and the omega, the
                    first and the last; he is the Lord of the world and of history. And this faith
                    gives to the Apocalypse of John a tone of assured confidence and hope such as is
                    not to be found in the Jewish apocalypses. On the other hand, however firm and
                    sure the Christian faith of the author appears, he was still completely
                    hide-bound in the old forms; it is really a case of new wine in old bottles. But
                    this very circumstance gives to the book its peculiar charm, for in no other
                    early Christian writing are new and old to be found so completely mingled as in
                    this. The author’s attitude towards the world and the state is still entirely
                    the Jewish attitude of surly hate—this disciple of the gospel has not yet
                    learned that we are bound to love our enemies; but his attitude towards God and
                    his view of the value of a man’s own works show no longer the Jewish but the new
                    Christian belief, for he sees God in Christ, he has accepted the doctrine of the
                    forgiveness of sins through the blood of the Lamb, and regards himself as a
                    priest and king before God. Hence too he lives and moves no longer in the law
                    but in the prophets and the psalms. From them, especially from the prophets
                    Ezekiel, Zechariah, and Daniel, he borrowed most of his imagery and symbols.
                    What he has done in his book is to create a great apocalyptic painting or rather
                    a drama worked out in different acts. Impatient longing for the end, a deep
                    abhorrence of the heathen state, a firm faith in Christ and His second coming, a
                    minute and painstaking study of the old prophecies—these are the sources from
                    which the description of the future are drawn. The purpose is the same as that
                    of all apocalypses—to confirm and strengthen the little family of believers in
                    their patience, their courage, and their confidence, by pointing out that the
                    sufferings of the time will last but a brief span and that the present troubles
                    are already the beginning of that end when sorrow and suffering will in a moment
                    be transformed into glory unspeakable. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The revelation proper begins with iv. 1,—the first three chapters forming an
                    introduction (the seven letters to the seven churches of Asia Minor, which are
                    prefixed, are marked by poetical beauty and power of language). The future is
                    written in a book with seven seals, which the Lamb opens one after the other
                    (iv., v.). The opening of each seal brings a plague upon the earth (vi. ).
                    Before the seventh seal is opened, the church of the latter days is itself
                    sealed that it may be preserved harmless from the assaults of the powers of hell
                    (vii.). At the opening of the seventh seal seven angels with trumpets appear on
                    the scene, each of whom blows a trumpet-blast as a prelude to new honors on the
                    earth (viii., ix. ). With the sixth trumpet the preliminary judgments are at an
                    end (hence the episode, ch. x. ). The judgment proper begins with the fall of
                    Jerusalem (xi. ). Then the seventh trumpet sounds as the signal for the last
                    dread horrors and for the final judgment of the world and of all wickedness.
                    This is preceded, however, by a description of the preservation of the church of
                    the latter days (xii.), forming one of those pauses in the narrative which give
                    the reader breathing time and relieve the horror of the description by the
                    introduction of scenes of peace and words of comfort. The power of the world
                    that opposes Christ (the Roman empire) is described along with all its devilish
                    accomplices (xiii.), and (xiv.) its destruction is by anticipation set forth in
                    figures. The seven angels follow with the seven vials of wrath, which are poured
                    forth and represent the beginning of the final catastrophe (xv., xyi. ). This
                    final catastrophe, involving the imperial city, thθ antichristian emperor, his
                    governors, and, last of all, the devil himself, is described in xvii.-xx.
                    3,—xix. 11 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi> forming the climax, when Christ himself
                    appears on a white horse and vanquishes all his foes. The devil is chained in
                    the bottomless pit for a thousand years; during this time the saints of the
                    latter days—not all believers—reign with Christ. <note anchored="true"

                <p><hi rend="italic">Unity and Integrity.—</hi> The above analysis will have shown
                    the essential unity of the book. The more attentively we scan the connexion of
                    the descriptions with each other the more clearly do we perceive the unity, the
                    artistic and systematic arrangement, of the book. This is completely overlooked
                    by those who fancy that in the seven seals, the seven trumpets, the seven vials
                    of wrath, the whole course of the judgment is simply repeated in ever new
                    imagery. Leaving all other objections out of account, this supposition is
                    refuted by the simple observation that the author has not merely placed the
                    different scenes side by side but has linked them together in such a way that
                    each scene follows as a consequence from the scene before. A correct perception
                    of the plan of the book further negatives the opinion of older scholars and of

                    the book, as indeed the language itself is sufficient to prove. Unless we are
                    utterly deceived, the book underwent systematic if not very radical revisions

                    although he has shown in a hundred passages that he knew very well the rules
                    which he has here broken. He must have deliberately intended to break them in
                    order to give to the words of his greeting a certain elevation and solemnity. Of
                    course only to a foreigner could it have occurred to employ those means for this
                    end.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Author’s Standpoint.—</hi> That the book is not written by a
                    disciple of the apostle Paul, that its author is filled with Jewish hatred and
                    abhorrence of the heathen state, that in other ways traces of the Jewish spirit
                    crop up here and there in the Apocalypse, is beyond question. But many critics,
                    especially the so-called Tübingen school, as well as Renan, Mommsen, and others,
                    have gone still farther; the author of the Apocalypse, say they, was an Ebionite
                    and a decided opponent of the apostle Paul. In support of this hypothesis, which
                    they put forward as if it were an established truth, they appeal chiefly to the
                    following observations :—(1) in ch. vii. only 144,000 Jews are sealed, therefore
                    the author regarded only born Jews as full members of the Messiah’s kingdom;
                    consequently (ver. 9 <hi rend="italic">sq.)</hi> the multitude which is not
                    numbered forms a wider circle, viz., the proselytes, λvho are not counted and
                    also not sealed, and are therefore of lower rank; (2) in ii.-iii. the author
                    displays the greatest abhorrence of those who eat meat which has been offered to
                    idols and who practise “fornication”; by these none but disciples of Paul can be
                    meant; (3) in xxi. 14 the author speaks only of twelve apostles, and thereby
                    undoubtedly excludes Paul; (4) the author praises (ii. 2) the Ephesians because
                    they have found the false apostles to be liars and have rejected them, but by
                    these false apostles only Paul could be meant; (5) the author cannot conceive
                    (xi. 1, 2) that the temple at Jerusalem should ever be destroyed, and proves by
                    this how much he himself still clung to the temple worship.</p>
                <p>The point in dispute is of the highest importance for the proper understanding of
                    the history of primitive Christianity. If the Tübingen school is right, the
                    Pauline epoch was followed in Asia Minor by an Ebionitic epoch, and in this case
                    Catholicism may very well be the product of a compromise between Paulinism and
                    Jewish Christianity. But on this very point it can be clearly shown that the
                    Tübingen school is in the wrong; for the above arguments amount to nothing.</p>
                <p>(1) The 12×12,000 (vii. 4 <hi rend="italic">sq.)</hi> can only, like James i. 1,
                    be interpreted allegorically and referred to Christians generally without
                    respect of nationality; the twelve tribes are the Christians. This
                    interpretation is the only possible one, because (a) in xiv. 3 it is said of the
                    144,000 that they are bought from the earth, and because (5) besides the 144,000
                    who are sealed no one survives the horrors of the last time. We must not
                    overlook the fact that in ch. vii. two entirely different visions are presented,
                    which are not to be fused into a single vision: the 144,000 are on earth, the
                    unnumbered multitude (ver. 9 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi> ) are not a supplement
                    of these 144,000, but are already in heaven and represent the sum of all the
                    children of God from the beginning. Thus, if the 144,000 were exclusively Jews,
                    in the last time there would be no Christian at all from among the heathen; that
                    is, no heathen would be saved. But that this is the author’s meaning not even
                    the Tübingen critics can maintain. Thus the “twelve tribes” are to be understood
                    allegorically. Λs Abraham is the father of all believers, so all believers make
                    up the nation of the twelve tribes. (2) The polemic against the eating of meat
                    offered to idols and against “fornication” is not peculiar to the author, but is
                    to be found in several early Christian writings. It is not a polemic against
                    Paul; at most it is a polemic against lax disciples of Paul; further it is no
                    sign of Ebionitism, for very many Gentile Christian writers of the 2d century
                    <hi rend="italic">{e.g.,</hi> Justin) combated the eating of meat offered to
                    idols. The rule mentioned in Acts xv. 29 may really have been made between 58
                    aud 70 a.d., and may have been a condition of intercourse between Jewish and
                    Gentile Christians. After that time it gradually prevailed all over Christendom.
                    (3) In the ideal description of the new Jerusalem it would have been impossible
                    for the author to speak of thirteen apostles. (4) The plural <hi rend="italic"
                    >απόστολοι</hi> (ii. 2) shows that Paul is not meant, and the comparison with
                    ii. 9 and iii. 9 makes it probable that Jewish emissaries are intended. But,
                    apart from this, we see better than heretofore by the newly discovered <hi
                    rend="italic">Teaching of the Apostles</hi> that the name “apostle” was not
                    confined to the twelve apostles and Paul. If the author had wished to express
                    abhorrence of Paul lie could not have done it more obscurely than he has done it
                    in ii. 2. (5) The author says expressly (xxi. 22) that he saw no temple in the
                    new Jerusalem, “for the Lord is her temple and the Lamb”; hence he felt that the
                    temple worship was no longer needed to satisfy his religious wants; in excepting
                    the temple buildings from the universal destruction (xi. 1) he follows a Jewish
                    notion, to which in his heart he has already risen superior.</p>
                <p>The arguments to prove the Ebionitism of the Apocalypse are therefore
                    insufficient; rather, we should say, the Apocalypse shows us a Christianity free
                    from the law, free from national prejudices, universal, and yet a Christianity
                    which is quite independent of Paul. It is this that constitutes the high
                    importance of the book. The author speaks not at all of the law—the word does
                    not occur in his work; he looks for salvation from the power and grace of God
                    and <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n516/mode/1up"

                    must wash his robes in the blood of the Lamb; nowhere has he made a distinction
                    between Gentile and Jewish Christians; in this respect he is even more liberal
                    than Paul, for Paul believes in a continued preference accorded to the people of
                    Israel, while our author knows of no such thing; in his view preference is given
                    only to the martyrs and confessors of the latter days; they alone shall reign
                    with Christ a thousand years; <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    </p></note> the people of Israel, so far as it has rejected Christ, is to our
                    author simply a “synagogue of Satan” (ii. 9; iii. 9). In this respect it clearly
                    appears that the author of the Apocalypse has cast aside all national religious
                    prejudices. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Compare
                    also xi. 8, where Jerusalem is called “Sodom and Egypt.” </p></note> Accordingly
                    to him Jesus is not the Messiah of the Jews—of this there is no mention in the
                    book—but the Saviour of the world, the Lord of heaven and of earth, the disposer
                    and director of history. The Christology of the Apocalypse is nowhere Ebionitic;
                    rather it stands midway between that of Paul and that of the Fourth Gospel, and
                    is more elevated than the former: Christ is made almost equal with God and has
                    the same predicates and names as God. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The Christological conceptions and formulas which occur in

                    interpolation. </p></note></p>
                <p>The Apocalypse teaches us that even in the apostolic age the conceptions of
                    Paulinism and Ebionitism do not explain everything; it is neither Pauline nor
                    Ebionitic. It shows us that at the close of the apostolic age there was a
                    Christianity which was free from the law and universal, and yet continued to
                    adhere to Jewish modes of expression; it shows us that it was possible to think
                    and feel like a Jew in politics, and yet in religious thoughts and feelings to
                    be evangelical and superior to all earthly limitations. These, however, are
                    glaring contradictions which could not last. But the fact that in the Apocalypse
                    we possess a document exhibiting these contradictions imparts to the book its
                    high importance. From Paul’s epistles we can only learn how a great mind has
                    worked its way from the letter of the law up to freedom; from the Apocalypse we
                    can learn how from the Jewish fusion of religion, nationality, and politics
                    thousands were gradually led upwards to the gospel, and we can further learn
                    that the step from the premises to the conclusion is one of the hardest to take.
                    The author of the Apocalypse has in many points not yet drawn the
                    conclusions.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Date and Historical Position.—</hi> All impartial scholars are
                    now agreed that in chapters xiii. and xviii. of the Apocalypse we must look for
                    the key to the comprehension of the book as well as to the question of the date
                    of its composition. That the beast (xiii. 1 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi>; xvii. 3
                    <hi rend="italic">sq.)</hi> is the Roman empire, that the seven heads are seven
                    emperors, that the woman (xvii. 3-9) is the city of Rome, that the ten horns
                    (xiii. 1; xvii. 3, 12 <hi rend="italic">sqO</hi> are imperial governors—all this
                    is now beyond dispute. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Diisterdieck alone regards the ten horns as emperors. </p></note> Also it is
                    settled that a Roman emperor will be the antichrist, and that the author
                    abhorred nothing so much as the worship of the emperor. Hence it is very
                    probable, and has been maintained by Mommsen especially on good grounds, that
                    the second beast (xiii. 11) is meant to describe the imperial representatives in
                    the provinces, especially the Roman governors in the Asiatic continent. Finally,
                    almost every one regards the year 64 as the <hi rend="italic">terminus a
                    quo</hi> of the composition of the book, inasmuch as the bloody persecution of
                    the Christians in Rome (xiii.</p>
                <p>7; xvii. 6; xviii. 20-24) is presupposed in the narrative. <note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The statement of Epiphanius <hi rend="italic"
                    >CHaer.,</hi> li. 12) that the Apocalypse was written under Claudius is
                    untenable. </p></note></p>
                <p>But, while scholars are at one on these points, they still differ on the question
                    of the person of antichrist. The one side affirm that the author regarded Nero
                    returned from the grave as antichrist (so Ewald, Lücke, De Wette, Credner,
                    Reuss, Volckmar, Mommsen, Renan, &amp;c.); the other side deny this (so Weiss,
                    Düsterdieck, Bruston, &amp;c.), and try to identify antichrist either with
                    Domitian or with an emperor not defined. But the grounds on which they combat
                    the former hypothesis are of little moment. That the antichrist of the
                    Apocalypse is Nero returned to life results from the following considerations :—
                    (1) In ch. xiii. 3 it is said that one of the heads of the beast received a
                    deadly wound but was afterwards healed to the astonishment of the world. Now if
                    it is settled that the beast is the Roman empire, and that by the heads are
                    designated the emperors, the statement is only applicable to Nero, in whose
                    death it is well known that the people did not believe, many persons expecting
                    that he would return from the East. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Bruston refers the λvounded head to Caesar; but what could
                    have induced the author to mention and put in the foreground an event which had
                    taken place about one hundred years before? </p></note> (2) In xvii. 8, 11 one
                    head is identified with the whole animal, and of the animal it is said that “it
                    was and is not and will come again," meaning that the eighth head is not a new
                    one but one of the seven. From this it necessarily follows that in the author’s
                    view the antichrist will be an emperor who has reigned once already and who
                    represents the whole wickedness of the empire (the beast) concentrated and
                    embodied in himself; but this can only be Nero, for of no other emperor was the
                    report current in the empire that he would come again, and no emperor but Nero
                    had instituted a persecution of the Christians. (3) In xiii. 18 it is said that
                    the number of the beast —that is, according to the Hebrew art of Gematria, the
                    sum of the numerical values of the letters of his name—is the number of a man,
                    and is 666. Down to 1835 this saying was a riddle which no man could read,
                    though Irenaeus (v. 30) had attempted an explanation: he thought of Teitan,
                    Evanthes, Lateinos. But in 1835 Fritzsche, Benary, Reuss, and Hitzig discovered
                    simultaneously that the numerical values of the words ∣1^1J ^ffip (“Emperor
                    Neron ”) = 100 + 60 + 200 + 50 + 200 + 6 + 50 = 666. The old variant 616 must be
                    regarded as a confirmation of this explanation, for 616 is = 110 1Dp (“Emperor
                    Nero ”). It may certainly appear strange that the calculation is made according
                    to the numerical value of the Hebrew letters, while the book is written in
                    Greek; but, as there is no doubt that the author has thought as a Semite from
                    first to last, it is not surprising that he has set forth his great secret in
                    Hebrew letters (comp. ’Ap∕xβγ∈δωv, xvi. 16). (4) Down to the 5th century it was
                    believed by Western Christians that Nero would come again and be the antichrist
                    or his precursor. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See

                <p>For these four reasons it is certain that the author of the Apocalypse believed
                    that Nero would come again, and regarded him as the antichrist. He wrote under
                    the impression of the story current in the East that Nero had gone to the
                    Parthians and would return with them to reclaim his empire.</p>

                    the present century; only the traditionalists who reject the historical
                    interpretation accept it. It is the only case in the whole range of the New
                    Testament where criticism assigns to a writing a higher antiquity than is
                    allowed it by tradition. Whether criticism has not been too hasty in setting
                    aside the statement of Irenaeus will appear in the sequel.</p>
                <p>In support of the supposition that the Apocalypse was written before August 70
                    a.d., the chief argument adduced is that ch. xi. assumes that Jerusalem and the
                    temple are still uninjured. Mommsen <hi rend="italic">(Röm. Gesch.,</hi> v. 521)
                    has not succeeded in satisfactorily disposing of this argument. The Apocalypse
                    is cognizant of the flight of the Jewish Christians into the country beyond
                    Jordan towards Pella (ch. xii.); it expects the partial destruction of Jerusalem
                    in the immediate future. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>The three and a half years in xi. 2, xii. 14, xiii. 5 are taken from the
                    Apocalypse of Daniel, and no deeper meaning is to be sought in them. </p></note>
                    But this very expectation as well as the confidence that the temple would remain
                    uninjured shows that at that time city and temple were still standing. Hence, as
                    ch. xi. was written before August 70, most critics, assuming that the whole book
                    dates from one and the same time, conclude that it was composed under
                    Galba,—that is, between autumn 68 and spring 69. In their view the five emperors
                    who have fallen are Augustus, Tiberius, Claudius, Caligula, and Nero, therefore
                    the reigning emperor is Galba, <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    (the returning Nero) immediately succeed Galba is a wish to carry on the number
                    seven, and because “even a prophet owes some consideration to the powers that
                    be”; but he allows this unknown successor only a short reign, and then comes the
                    returned Nero and the end of the world. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Apocalypse in the reign of Galba, begi∏3 the enumeration of the heads with
                    Julius Caesar, and hence gets into difficulties. </p></note> Lastly, these
                    critics point to the fact that a false Nero appeared immediately after the death
                    of the real Nero (Tacitus, <hi rend="italic">Hist.,</hi> ii. 8, 9). This
                    position is very strong, but there are two objections to it,—in the first place,
                    it is uncertain whether Galba should be included in the list of emperors at
                    all—so eminent an authority as Mommsen is against including him, and reckons
                    Vespasian as the sixth, and, secondly, the author of the Apocalypse thinks of a
                    false Nero who will ally himself with the Parthians (see ch. ix. and elsewhere).
                    Therefore his false Nero appears not to be that of Tacitus, but the one who in
                    the last years of Vespasian found a following in the Euphrates district and was
                    acknowledged in the reign of Titus by King Artabanus, who prepared to restore
                    him at Rome by force of arms, but was at last surrendered by the Parthians,
                    about 88, to Domitian (so Mommsen; compare Persia, vol. xviii. ρ. 603). On this
                    view the Apocalypse was written about 75-79. Thus we see that we have here two
                    discrepant calculations (autumn 68 to spring 69; about 75-79); each has much in
                    favour of it, but also at least one strong argument against it :—against the
                    first calculation there is the argument that the false Nero who best suits the
                    case did not appear till about 75, while against the second calculation there is
                    the argument that according to ch. xi. the destruction of Jerusalem had not yet
                    taken place. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The view
                    that the Apocalypse was w <hi rend="superscript">τ</hi> ritten between the
                    spring of </p></note> In these circumstances it appears perhaps best to assume
                    that the Apocalypse was written under Galba, that is, that the conception and
                    the first draught of it date from this time, but that the seventeenth chapter
                    was afterwards revised in the last years of the reign of Vespasian, about 75-79.
                    Now it is to be remembered that Irenaeus asserts most explicitly that it was
                    revealed in the last years of Domitian. Such a statement is not to be simply set
                    aside, especially when it seems to make a writing later, and not earlier, and
                    when there is internal evidence that the book underwent revisions. Further exact
                    investigation of the details of the Apocalypse will perhaps supply positive
                    proofs; at present the following can be put forward merely as an hypothesis, for
                    which only a certain probability is claimed :—the Apocalypse was written under
                    Galba, but afterwards underwent revisions under Vespasian, about 75-79, and
                    perhaps in Domitian’s reign of terror, about 93-96 (compare what has been said
                    above on the unity and integrity).</p>

                <p>The tradition of the church ascribes the Apocalypse to the apostle John, <note

                    felt bound in this case to agree with tradition. Within the last twenty years or
                    so the question has been much complicated by being mixed up with the question of
                    the origin of the Fourth Gospel; all, however, agree that the book was written
                    by a born Jew. At present the following views are maintained :—(1) the Gospel
                    and the Apocalypse of John are by the apostle John (Ebrard, Hengstenberg and his
                    school, Hofmann and his school, Kliefoth); (2) the Gospel is by an unknown
                    author, the Apocalypse is by the apostle John (Baur, Schwegler, Köstlin,
                    Hilgenfeld); (3) the Gospel is by the apostle John, the Apocalypse is by a man
                    called John, the otherwise known presbyter, who had no wish to be taken for the
                    apostle (Lücke, Bleek, Ewald, Credner, De Wette, Neander, Reuss, Düsterdieck,
                    Keim, Holtzmann, &amp;c.); <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Some of these scholars also deny that the Gospel is by John. </p></note> (4)
                    the Apocalypse is by another John, one of the apostle’s disciples, who
                    afterwards received the tacit approval of the apostle, so that the Revelation
                    passed in the church as a work of the apostle (Renan); (5) the Apocalypse was
                    foisted on the apostle John without his knowledge (Volckmar, &amp;c.). Of these
                    views the first and fourth may be summarily dismissed, the latter because Renan
                    has not brought forward even the shadow of a proof, the former because the
                    differences between the Apocalypse and the Gospel in language and opinions are
                    too great to allow us to suppose that the books are by the same author. <note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This was observed by

                    nay, even that there is a profound affinity between them, but this only proves
                    that their authors lived in the same country, and were to some extent subject to
                    the same intellectual influences. Even Hase, who formerly thought it possible to
                    refer Gospel and Apocalypse to the apostle John (see his work, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Die Tübinger Schule,</hi> 1855), has renounced this view. But what is to

                <p>69 and August 70, hence in the beginning of Vespasian’s reign, has least to
                    recommend it. Some of the critics who have maintained it are much biased. Thus
                    Diisterdieck regards the sixth emperor (xvii. 10) as Vespasian, the seventh, who
                    is to remain for only a short time, as Titus, and the eighth as Nero. But, as
                    the book was written, according to Diisterdieck, shortly before 70, it follows
                    that ‘we have here a prophecy which definitely announces certain historical
                    events beforehand.” Thus the claim of the Apocalypse to be an actual prophecy is
                    justified, though only in one verse.</p>

                    doubts entertained by the Alexandrians, by Eusebius, and by Byzantine

                    book being little to their mind, and the substance of the Revelation would in
                    many respects suit John Boanerges. But the following considerations speak
                    against the apostle John as author :—</p>
                <p>(1) the so-called “Alogi” (Epiph., <hi rend="italic">Haer.,</hi> li.) denied that
                    the work was by the apostle, and declared that it came from Corinth and hence
                    was a forgery; but the Alogi were in Asia Minor about 160 and their negative, if
                    not their positive, evidence has therefore great weight; <note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>From Eusebius, <hi rend="italic">IL E.,</hi>
                    iii. 28, 1 many have assumed that the Roman presbyter Caius (about 200 a.d.) was
                    of the same opinion as the Alogi, but this is improbable. </p></note></p>
                <p>(2) the author of the Apocalypse does not style himself an apostle, and nowhere
                    does he designate himself as a personal disciple of Jesus or as an eye-witness;
                    (3) the author speaks (xxi. 14) in such an objective way of the twelve apostles
                    of the Lamb that it is scarcely credible that he himself belonged to them; (4)
                    the descriptions of Christ in the Apocalypse are psychologically scarcely
                    intelligible on the assumption that they were written by a personal disciple of
                    the Lord. On these grounds we must say that, though not quite impossible, it is
                    very improbable that the apostle John was the author of the Apocalypse. But not
                    less improbable is the supposition that the real author wished to pass for the
                    apostle John and fathered the work on him. It is true that amongst the Jews
                    apocalypses were fathered by their authors on famous men; but the fraud is
                    always very patent. But in this case the name of John occurs only four times (i.
                    1, 4, 9; xxii. 8), and in the whole book there is nothing that reveals the
                    author’s intention to pass for the apostle John. And we have further to remember
                    that, according to trustworthy evidence, the apostle John was still living at
                    the time in Asia Minor. It is at least improbable that another dweller in Asia
                    Minor should have fathered a book on him under his very eyes.</p>
                <p>In these circumstances only one hypothesis seems left —that started by the
                    Alexandrians in order to get rid of the inconvenient authority of the
                    Apocalypse—that the book is from the pen of another John in Asia Minor, namely,
                    the presbyter. But, though this hypothesis has had much acceptance in our time,
                    it is far from probable; for-—and here Zahn and Renan are right—the existence of
                    a conspicuous presbyter John in distinction from the apostle is very uncertain.
                    The Apocalypse, as the traditional text of the first chapter now runs, is
                    certainly not the work of any ordinary person of the name of John: it is by a
                    John who enjoyed the highest consideration in the churches (see i. 1, 4). If
                    besides the apostle John there was no second John who possessed such authority
                    in Asia Minor in the 1st century, and if it is impossible that the Apocalypse
                    can be the work either of the apostle John or of a literary forger, the only
                    supposition left is that the name of John was interpolated in the last revision
                    (after the death of the apostle John). Observe once more that this name occurs
                    only in the first verses of the first chapter, and in a verse of the last. No
                    hypothesis solves the problem so well as this. Whether originally a different
                    name appeared in i. 9, and how ch. i. gradually arose, are questions into which
                    we cannot enter here. In this difficult subject absolute certainty is
                    unattainable, but the supposition that the Revelation was written by an unknown
                    Christian of Asia Minor, and that the name of John is a later addition in order
                    to ascribe the Revelation to the apostle John, labours under fewer difficulties
                    than any other that has hitherto been started. That, thus introduced, John is
                    not expressly designated as apostle need not surprise us, for at the beginning
                    of the 2d century every one in Asia Minor knew who “John the servant of God”
                    was. The epistles also with the heading “the elder” are meant to be regarded as
                    written by the apostle John, although they do not contain the title apostle.
                    <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The view here put
                    forward as to the author of the Apocalypse is further recommended by its

                    Originally writings derived their authority from the nature of their contents,
                    afterwards from their author. When writings by obscure persons were intended to
                    attract attention, it was necessary to pass them off under the names of
                    celebrities; see Harnack, <hi rend="italic">Die Lehre der 12 Apostel,</hi> p.

                    enjoyed a high reputation as the work of the apostle John, was admitted into the
                    canon of the New Testament (see Murat, fragm., Irenaeus, Tertullian). In the
                    West it has always been retained in the canon, but in the East it was
                    discredited through Montanism, and the spiritualistic Alexandrians who gave the
                    tone threw more and more doubts upon it, so that towards the end of the 3d
                    century it began to be omitted from the New Testament. For nearly a thousand
                    years the Apocalypse was not recognized by the majority of the Greek Church as a
                    canonical book (and hence it is that we possess so few ancient Greek MSS. of the
                    Apocalypse), but, as no formal condemnation was pronounced against it, the book
                    was never suppressed, and regained its footing towards the end of the Middle
                    Ages, the Greek Church following the example of the Latin. At present the
                    Apocalypse forms part of the New Testament all over Christendom, and rightly so,
                    for it is one of the most instructive documents of early Christianity. Narrow or
                    dogmatic spirits, it is true, will never be able to value it aright, and will
                    therefore either reject it or seek to correct it by false interpretations.</p>
