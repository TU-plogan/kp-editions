                <p>CHAPTER I.—THE REGAL PERIOD.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Contributories to People, Customs, and Law.—</hi> The union of
                    the Latin, Sabine, and, to a small extent, Etruscan bands that, as conquerors or
                    conquered, old settlers or new immigrants, together constituted the first
                    elements of the Roman people, did not necessarily involve contemporaneous
                    adoption of identical institutions or identical notions of law. Although they
                    were descended from the same Indo-European stock, and inherited the same
                    primitive ideas about religion and government, those ideas must have been
                    modified in the course of centuries of separate and independent development. The
                    characteristics of the Latin race are said to have been its sense of the
                    importance of discipline and the homage it paid to power and might; those of the
                    Sabines were their religious feeling and their reverence for the gods; the
                    characteristic of the Etruscans was their subservience to forms and ceremonies
                    in matters both divine and human. Corresponding influences are very manifest in
                    the growth of Rome’s early public institutions, civil, military, and religious.
                    It does not seem too much to say that these same influences are traceable also
                    in the institutions of the private law. The <hi rend="italic">patria

                    <hi rend="italic">manus</hi> and the husband’s power over his wife; the doctrine
                    that those things chiefly was a man entitled to call his own which he had taken
                    by the strength of his arm; the right which a creditor had of apprehending and
                    imprisoning his defaulting debtor and reducing him to slavery,—all these seem to
                    point to a persuasion that might made right. The religious marriage ceremony and
                    the recognition of the wife as mistress of the household and participant in its
                    sacred offices as well as its domestic cares; the family council of kinsmen,
                    maternal as well as paternal, who advised the <hi rend="italic"
                    >paterfamilias</hi> in the exercise of the domestic jurisdiction; the practice
                    of adoption, to obviate the extinction of a family and to prevent its deceased
                    members being deprived of the prayers and sacrifices necessary for the repose of
                    their souls,—these seem to have flowed from a different order of ideas and to
                    bear evidence of Sabine descent. Etruscan influence could make itself felt only
                    at a later date; but to it may possibly be attributed the strict regard that
                    came to be required to the observance of ceremonials and words of style in the
                    more important transactions both of public and private life.</p>
                <p>While it can hardly be doubted that the result of the union of Latins and Sabines
                    was that regulations were at once adopted which should apply to their public
                    life as a united people, it is not only conceivable but probable that each
                    tribe, as regarded the private relations of its members, continued for a time to
                    accord a preference to its own ideas and traditions of right and law, and that
                    the amalgamation was a gradual process, partly silent, partly due to regal or
                    pontifical intervention.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Patricians, Clients, and Plebeians.—</hi> There was part of the
                    law of Rome that even in the empire was known by the name of <hi rend="italic">
                    Jus Quimtium,</hi> the Law of the Spearmen; and this in the regal period
                    constituted its main element. The <hi rend="italic">Quirites</hi> were the
                    members of the gentile houses, organized in their curies, primarily for military
                    and secondarily for political purposes. They alone of the rapidly increasing
                    population settled round the <hi rend="italic">urbs guad-rata</hi> ranked as
                    citizens, down at least to the time of Servius Tullius. They alone could consult
                    the gods through the medium of <hi rend="italic">auspicia,</hi> and participate
                    in the services offered to the tutelary deities of Rome. From their number the
                    king drew his council of elders, and they alone could take part in the curiate
                    comitia, the assembly of the warriors. They alone could contract a lawful
                    marriage and make a testament; in a word, it was they alone that were entitled
                    directly to the benefit of Rome’s peculiar institutions.</p>
                <p>These prerogatives they enjoyed as members of the gentile houses. Patrician Rome
                    was a federation of <hi rend="italic">g entes</hi> or clans, the clans
                    aggregations of families bearing a common name, and theoretically at least
                    tracing their descent from a common ancestor. Whether or not the traditional
                    account of the numerical proportion of families to clans and of clans to curies
                    has any substantial historical foundation, and whatever may be the explanation
                    of the method by which the symmetry on which the old writers dwell with so much
                    complacency was attained, it is beyond doubt that the gentile organization was
                    common to the two races at least that contributed most largely to the
                    citizenship of Rome, and that it was made the basis of the new arrangements.
                    Federation necessitated the appointment of a common chieftain and common
                    institutions, religious, military, political, and judicial. But it was long
                    before these displaced entirely the separate institutions of the federated <hi
                    rend="italic"> gentes.</hi> Every clan had its own cult, peculiar to its own
                    members; this was the universal bond of association in those early times. It had
                    its common property and its common burial-place. It must have had some common
                    council or assembly, for we read not only of special gentile customs but of
                    gentile statutes and decrees. Instances are on record of wars waged by
                    individual <hi rend="italic">gentes</hi>; so they must have had the right to
                    require military service alike from their <hi rend="italic">gentiles</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">gentilicii.</hi> Widows and orphans of deceased clansmen were
                    under the guardianship of the <hi rend="italic">gens,</hi> or of some particular
                    member of it to whom the trust was specially confided. If a clansman left no
                    heirs, his property passed to his fellow gentiles. Over the morals of its
                    members the <hi rend="italic">gens</hi> exercised supervision and discipline,
                    interfering to prevent prodigality and improvidence, restraining abuses of the
                    domestic authority, and visiting with censure and probably in grave cases with
                    punishment any breach of faith or other dishonourable conduct; and it is
                    difficult to suppose that, within its own limits, it was not constantly called
                    upon, through the medium of its chief, to act the part of peacemaker and
                    arbiter. Finally, its members were always entitled to rely upon its assistance,
                    to have maintenance when indigent, to be ransomed from captivity, to be upheld
                    in their just disputes and quarrels, and to be avenged when killed or
                    injured.</p>
                <p>The successes of the burgesses in one petty war after another deprived many small
                    communities of their independent existence, leaving their members bereft alike
                    of their religion, their territory, and their means of subsistence. These had to
                    turn elsewhere for protection, and in large numbers they sought it from their
                    conquerors. To many others, both voluntary immigrants and refugees from other
                    cities, the new settlement proved a centre of attraction. It was quite ready to
                    receive them, but as subjects only, not as citizens. Following a custom familiar
                    to both Latins and Sabines, the new-comers invoked the protection of the heads
                    of patrician families of repute, to whom they attached themselves as free
                    vassals. The relationship was known as that of patron and client. (See Patron
                    and Client, vol. xviii. p. 412.) The client became a dependent member of his
                    patron’s clan,—not <hi rend="italic">gentilis,</hi> however, but only <hi
                    rend="italic"> gentilicius.</hi> His patron had to provide him with all that was
                    necessary for his sustenance and that of his wife <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n693/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0693-0670"/>and children; and, as private holdings increased
                    in extent, it was not unusual for the patron or his <hi rend="italic">gens</hi>
                    to give him during pleasure a plot of land to cultivate for himself. The patron
                    had, moreover, to assist him in his transactions with third parties, obtain
                    redress for him for his injuries, and represent him before the tribunals when he
                    became involved in litigation. The client, on the other hand, had to maintain
                    his patron’s interests by every means in his power. But the advantage must have
                    been chiefly on the side of the client, who, without becoming a citizen,
                    obtained directly the protection of his patron and his clan, and indirectly that
                    of the state.</p>
                <p>The plebeians, as distinguished from the clients, must be regarded as a
                    heterogeneous mass of non-gentile freemen, small probably in numbers at first,
                    but augmenting with ever greater rapidity, who had of choice or compulsion made
                    Rome their domicile, but declined to subject themselves to a patron. That there
                    was any general cohesion amongst them before the time of Servius there is not
                    the slightest reason to believe. They were of different races, settling in Rome
                    from different motives, practising in many matters different customs. The bulk
                    of them, however, λvere undoubtedly Latins, with traditions and customs much the
                    same as those of the greater number of the patrician houses; and this it was
                    that in time caused the triumph of Latinism and the predominance of the
                    masterful spirit in thejws <hi rend="italic">Quintium.</hi> But by the ruling
                    caste those traditions and customs were simply ignored; till the time of Servius
                    what protection the plebeians got was simply of the grace of the kings, whose
                    policy it was to conciliate them as a body that in time might be a valuable
                    auxiliary against the pretensions of the patricians.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Regulatives of Public and Private Order.—</hi> We look in
                    vain for, and it would be absurd to expect, any definite system of law in those
                    early times. What passed for it was a composite of <hi rend="italic">fas,
                    jus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">boni mores,</hi> whose several limits and
                    characteristics it is extremely difficult to define. This may to some extent be
                    accounted for by the fact that much of what was originally within the domain of
                    <hi rend="italic">fas,</hi> once it had come to be enforced by secular
                    tribunals, and thus had the sanction of human authority, was no longer
                    distinguishable from <hi rend="italic">jus</hi>; while it may be that others of
                    its behests, once pontifical punishments for their contravention had gone into
                    desuetude, sank to nothing higher than precepts of <hi rend="italic">boni
                    mores.</hi></p>
                <p>By <hi rend="italic">fas</hi> was understood the will of the gods, the laws given
                    by heaven for men on earth, much of it regulative of ceremonial, but a by no
                    means insignificant part embodying rules of conduct. It appears to have had a
                    wider range than <hi rend="italic">jus.</hi> There were few of its commands,
                    prohibitions, or precepts that were addressed to men as citizens of any
                    particular state; all mankind came within its scope. It forbade that a war
                    should be undertaken without the prescribed fetial ceremonial, and required that
                    faith should be kept even with an enemy when a promise had been made to him
                    under sanction of an oath. It enjoined hospitality to foreigners, because the
                    stranger guest was presumed, equally with his entertainer, to be an object of
                    solicitude to a higher power. It punished murder, for it was the taking of a
                    god-given life; the sale of a wife by her husband, for she had become his
                    partner in all things human and divine; the lifting of a hand against a parent,
                    for it was subversive of the first bond of society and religion,—the reverence
                    due by a child to those to whom he owed his existence; incestuous connexions,
                    for they defiled the altar; the false oath and the broken vow, for they were an
                    insult to the divinities invoked; the displacement of a boundary or a landmark,
                    not so much because the act was provocative of feud, as because the march-stone
                    itself, as the guarantee of peaceful neighbourhood, was under the guardianship
                    of the gods. When an offence against any of these rules or prohibitions was
                    inexpiable, the punishment was usually what is called <hi rend="italic">sacratio
                    capitis,</hi> excommunication and outlawry of the offender. The <hi
                    rend="italic">homo sacer</hi> was in every sense of the word an outcast,—one
                    with whom it was pollution to associate, who dared take no part in any of the
                    institutions of the state, civil or religious, whose life the gods would not
                    accept as a sacrifice, but whom, nevertheless, any one might put to death with
                    impunity as no longer god-protected. The precepts of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >fas</hi> therefore were not mere exhortations to a blameless life, but closely
                    approached to laws, whose violation was visited with punishments none the less
                    effective that they were religious rather than civil.</p>
                <p>Recent philology derives the word <hi rend="italic">jus</hi> from the Sanscrit
                    <hi rend="italic">ju,</hi> to “join, bind, or unite,” from which some deduce as
                    its signification “that which binds,” “the bond of society,” others “that which
                    is regular, orderly, or fitting.” The latest inquirer (M. Bréal) identifies it
                    with the <hi rend="italic">jos, jaos,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">jaus</hi> of the
                    Vedas, and the <hi rend="italic">jaes</hi> of the Zend-Avesta,—words whose exact
                    meaning is controverted, but which he interprets as “the divine will.” <hi
                    rend="italic">Jubeo</hi> is generally allowed to be a contraction of <hi
                    rend="italic">jus hibeo,</hi> “hold or take as <hi rend="italic"> jus</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">.” If Bréal’s definition can be adopted we obtain a very
                    significant interpretation of the words addressed by the presiding magistrate to
                    the assembled comitia in asking them whether they assented to a law proposed by
                    him,—</hi><hi rend="italic">Velitis, jubeatis, Quintes,</hi> &amp;c., “Is it
                    your pleasure, Quirites, and do you hold it as the divine will, that,” and so
                    on. As legislation by the comitia of the curies and centuries was regarded as a
                    divine office, and their vote might be nullified by the fathers on the ground
                    that there had been a defect in the <hi rend="italic">auspicia,</hi> and the
                    will of the gods consequently not clearly ascertained, this explanation of
                    Bréal’s seems not without support,— <hi rend="italic">vox populi vox dei.</hi>
                    If it be right, then the only difference between <hi rend="italic">fas</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic"> jus</hi> was that the will of the gods, which both embodied,
                    was in the one declared by inspired and in the other by merely human agency.</p>
                <p>This <hi rend="italic">jus</hi> might be the result either of traditional and
                    inveterate custom <hi rend="italic">(jus monbus constitutum)</hi> or of statute

                    regulated some of their details; but they had taken shape and consistency before
                    Rome had its beginning. It can well be believed, however, that in the outset the
                    customs in observance may have been far from uniform, that not only those of the
                    different races but those also of the different <hi rend="italic">gentes</hi>

                    merely for the pontiffs but for the public, with which it was of importance that
                    the latter should be acquainted, that they might know the risks they incurred

                    which also contains references to the earlier literature, is that of Voigt, <hi

                    the <hi rend="italic">Transactions</hi> of the Saxon Academy). A collection of
                    them from Livy, Dionysius, Plutarch, Servius, Macrobius, &amp;c., will be found
                    in Bruns, p. 1 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi> Of the <hi rend="italic">Jus

                    commented on by one Granius Flaccus, who was of the time of Julius Caesar.
                    </p></note> It is not to be assumed that there was no legislation beyond this;
                    some of the laws of which we have record were of a different character. But on
                    the whole it seems beyond doubt that it was custom rather than statute that was
                    the main factor of the <hi rend="italic">jus</hi> of the regal period.</p>
                <p>What went by the name of <hi rend="italic">boni mores,</hi> quite distinct from
                    the <hi rend="italic">jus moribus constitutum,</hi> must also be regarded as one
                    of the regulatives of public and private order. Part of what fell within their
                    sphere might also be expressly regulated by <hi rend="italic">fas</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">jus</hi>; but there was much that was only gradually brought
                    within the domain of these last, and even down to the end of the republic not a
                    little that remained solely under the guardianship of the family tribunal or the
                    censor’s <hi rend="italic">regimen morum.</hi> Its function was twofold:
                    sometimes it operated in restraint of law by condemning—though it could not
                    prevent—the ruthless and unnecessary exercise of legal right, as, for example,
                    that of the head of a house over his dependants; and sometimes it operated
                    supplementarily, by requiring observance of duties that could not be enforced by
                    any compulsitor of law. Dutiful service, respect, and obedience from inferiors
                    to superiors, chastity, and fidelity to engagements, express or implied <hi
                    rend="italic">(Jides),</hi> were among the <hi rend="italic">officia</hi> that
                    were thus inculcated, and whose neglect or contravention not only affected the
                    reputation but often entailed punishments and disabilities, social, political,
                    or religious. It was the duty of those in authority to enforce their observance
                    by such <hi rend="italic">animadυersio</hi> as they thought proper,—the <hi
                    rend="italic">paterfamilias</hi> in his family, the <hi rend="italic">gens</hi>
                    among its members, the king in relation to the citizens generally; and many a
                    wrong was prevented not by the fear of having to make reparation to the party
                    injured but by the dread of the penalties that would follow conduct unbecoming
                    an upright citizen.</p>

                    the wife who had become a member of his family, was originally the generic term
                    for all the rights exercised not only over the things belonging but also the
                    persons subject to the head of the house; for a slave when enfranchised was said

                    sons, and possibly remoter descendants related through males; so long as they
                    remained subject to him they constituted but one family, that was split up only
                    on his death or loss of citizenship. But if his wife had not passed <hi
                    rend="italic">in mαnum—</hi> and that was common enough even during the
                    republic, and universal in the later empire —she did not become a member of his
                    family: she remained a member of the family in which she was born, or, if its
                    head was deceased or she had been emancipated, was the sole member of a family
                    of her own. Both sons and daughters on emancipation ceased to be of the family
                    of the <hi rend="italic">paterfamilias</hi> who had emancipated them. A
                    daughter’s children could never under any circumstances be members of the family
                    of their maternal grandfather; for children born in lawful marriage followed the
                    family of their father, while those who were illegitimate ranked from the moment
                    of birth as <hi rend="italic">p&gt;atresfamilias</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >matres-familias.</hi></p>
                <p>With the early Romans, as with the Hindus and the Greeks, marriage was a
                    religious duty a man owed alike to his ancestors and to himself. Believing that
                    the happiness of the dead in another world depended on their proper burial and
                    on the periodical renewal by their descendants of prayers and feasts and
                    offerings for the repose of their souls, it was incumbent upon him above all
                    things to perpetuate his race and his family cult. In taking to himself a wife,
                    he was about to detach her from her father’s house and make her a partner of his
                    family mysteries. With the patrician at least this was to be done only with
                    divine approval, ascertained by <hi rend="italic">auspicia.</hi> His choice was
                    limited to a woman with whom he had <hi rend="italic">coηubium (iπcγαpiα)</hi>
                    or right of intermarriage. This was a matter of state arrangement; and in the
                    regal period Roman citizens could have it outside their own bounds only with
                    members of .states with which they were in alliance, and with which they were
                    connected by the bond of common religious observances. A patrician citizen,
                    therefore, if his marriage was to be reckoned lawful <hi rend="italic">(ffustae
                    nuptiae),</hi> had to wed either a fellow-patrician or a woman who was a member
                    of an allied community. The ceremony was a religious one, conducted by the high
                    priests of the state, in presence of ten witnesses, representatives probably of
                    the ten curies of the bridegroom’s tribe, and was known as <hi rend="italic">
                    confarreatio.</hi> Its effect was to dissociate the wife entirely from her
                    father’s house and to make her a member of her husband’s; for confarreate
                    marriage involved what was called <hi rend="italic">in maηum conventio,</hi> the
                    passage of the wife into her husband’s “hand” or power, provided he was himself
                    <hi rend="italic">paterfamilias;</hi> if he was not, then, though nominally in
                    his hand, she was really subject like him to his family head. Any property she
                    had of her own—which was a possible state of matters only if she had been
                    independent before marriage—passed to him as a matter of course; if she had
                    none, her <hi rend="italic">paterfamilias</hi> provided her a dowry <hi
                    rend="italic">(ffos),</hi> which shared the same fate. Whatever she acquired by
                    her industry or otherwise while the marriage lasted also as a matter of course
                    fell to her husband. In fact, so far as her patrimonial interests were
                    concerned, she was in much the same position as her children; and on her
                    husband’s death she had a share with them in his inheritance as if she had been
                    one of his daughters. In other respects <hi rend="italic"> manus</hi> conferred
                    more limited rights than <hi rend="italic"> patria potestas</hi>; for Romulus is
                    said to have ordained that, if a man put away his wife except for adultery or
                    one of two or three other very grave offences, he forfeited his estate half to
                    her and half to Ceres, while if he sold her he was to be given over to the
                    infernal gods.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">patria potestas</hi> was the name given to the power
                    exercised by a father, or by his <hi rend="italic">paterfamilias</hi> if he was
                    himself <hi rend="italic">in potestate,</hi> over the issue of such <hi
                    rend="italic"> justoe nuptiae.</hi></p>

                <p>The Roman jurists boasted that it was a right enjoyed by none but Roman citizens;
                    and it certainly was peculiar to them in this sense, that nowhere else, except
                    among the Latin race from which they had sprung, did the paternal power attain
                    such an intensity. The omnipotence of the <hi rend="italic">paterfamilias</hi>
                    and the condition of utter subjection to him of his children <hi rend="italic"
                    >in potestate</hi> became greatly modified under the empire; but originally the
                    children, though in public life on an equality with the house father, in private
                    life, and so long as the <hi rend="italic">potestas</hi> lasted, λvere
                    subordinated to him to such an extent as, according to the letter of the law, to
                    be in his hands little better than his slaves. They could have nothing of their
                    own: all they earned was his; and, though it was quite common when they grew up
                    for him to give them <hi rend="italic">peculia,</hi> “cattle of their own,” to
                    manage for their own benefit, these were only <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi>
                    theirs, but <hi rend="italic">de jure</hi> his. For offences committed by them
                    outside the family circle, for which he was not prepared to make amends, he had
                    to surrender them to the injured party, just like slaves or animals that had
                    done mischief. If his right to them was disputed he used the same action for its
                    vindication that he employed for asserting his ownership of his field or his
                    house: if they were stolen, he proceeded against the thief by an ordinary action
                    of theft; if for any reason he had to transfer them to a third party, it was by
                    the same form of conveyance that he used for the transfer of things inanimate.
                    Nor was this all; for, according to the old formula recited in that sort of
                    adoption known as adrogation, he had over them the power of life and death, <hi
                    rend="italic">jus vitae necisgue.</hi> This power was subject to certain
                    restrictions during the infancy of a child; but, when he had grown up, his
                    father, in the exercise of his domestic jurisdiction, might visit his
                    misconduct, not only in private but in public life, with such punishment as he
                    thought fit, even banishment, slavery, or death.</p>
                <p>It might happen that a marriage was fruitless, or that a man saw all his sons go
                    to the grave before him, and that the <hi rend="italic">paterfamilias</hi> had
                    thus to face the prospect of the extinction of his family and of his own descent
                    to the tomb without posterity to make him blessed. To obviate so dire a
                    misfortune he resorted to the practice of adoption, so common in India and
                    Greece. If it was a <hi rend="italic">pater-familias</hi> that he adopted the
                    process was called adrogation <hi rend="italic">(gιdrogatio)</hi>; if it was a
                    <hi rend="italic">filiusfamilias</hi> it was simply <hi rend="italic"
                    >adoptio.</hi> The latter, unknown probably in the earlier regal period, was a
                    somewhat complicated conveyance of a son by his natural parent to his adopter,
                    the purpose of course being expressed; its effect was simply to transfer the
                    child from the one family to the other. But the former was much more serious,
                    for it involved the extinction of one family <note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A <hi rend="italic">paterfamilias</hi> who
                    had no person subject to him constituted a <hi rend="superscript">,,</hi>

                    therefore an affair of state. It had to be approved by the pontiffs, who
                    probably had to satisfy themselves that there were brothers enough of the
                    adrogatee to attend to the interests of the ancestors whose cult he was
                    renouncing; and on their favourable report it had to be sanctioned by a vote of
                    the curies, as it involved the deprivation of his <hi rend="italic">gens</hi> of
                    their possible right of succession to him. The result was that the <hi
                    rend="italic">adrogatus,</hi> from being himself the head of a house, sank to
                    the position of a <hi rend="italic">filiusfamilias</hi> in the house of his
                    adopting parent; if he had had wife or children subject to him, they passed with
                    him into his new family, and so did everything that belonged to him and that was
                    capable of transmission from one person to another. The adopting parent acquired
                    <hi rend="italic">potestas</hi> and power of life and death over the adopted
                    child exactly as if he were the issue of his body; while the latter enjoyed in
                    his new family the same rights exactly that he would have had if he had been
                    born in it.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">manus</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">patria potestas</hi>
                    represent the masterful aspects of the patrician’s domestic establishment. Its
                    conjugal and parental ones, however, though not so prominent in the pages of the
                    jurists, are not to be lost sight of. The Roman family in the early history of
                    the law was governed as much by <hi rend="italic">fas</hi> as by <hi
                    rend="italic"> jus.</hi> It was an association hallowed by religion, and held
                    together not by might merely but by conjugal affection, parental piety, and
                    filial reverence. The purpose of marriage was to rear sons who might perpetuate
                    the house and the family <hi rend="italic">sacra.</hi> In entering into the
                    relationship the wife renounced her rights and privileges as a member of her
                    father’s house; but it was that she might enter into a lifelong partnership with
                    her husband, and be associated with him in all his family interests, sacred and
                    civil. The husband was priest in the family, but wife and children alike
                    assisted in its prayers, and took part in the sacrifices to its lares and
                    penates. As the Greek called his wife the house-mistress, δeσ-7r0u'α, so did the
                    Roman speak of his as <hi rend="italic">materfamilias,</hi><note anchored="true"

                    so tempered by the natural sense of parental duty on the one side and filial
                    affection on the other that in daily life it was rarely felt as a grievance;
                    while the risk of an arbitrary exercise of the domestic jurisdiction, whether in
                    the heat of passion or under the impulse of justifiable resentment, was guarded
                    against by the rule which required the <hi rend="italic">paterfamilias</hi> to
                    consult in the first place the near kinsmen of his child, maternal as well as
                    paternal. Even the incapacity of the subject members of the family to hold
                    property of their own cannot in those times have been regarded as any serious
                    hardship; for, though the legal title to all their acquisitions was in the
                    house-father, yet in truth they were acquired for and belonged to the family as
                    a whole, and he was but a trustee to hold and administer them for the common
                    benefit.</p>
                <p>In Greece the <hi rend="italic">patria potestas</hi> never reached such
                    dimensions as in Rome, and there it ceased, <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> at
                    least, when a son had grown up to manhood and started a household of his own.
                    But in Rome, unless the <hi rend="italic">paterfamilias</hi> voluntarily put an
                    end to it, it lasted as long as the latter lived and retained his status. The
                    marriage of a son, unlike that of a daughter passing into the hand of a husband,
                    did not release him from it, nor did his children become subject to him so long
                    as he himself was <hi rend="italic">in potestate.</hi> On the contrary, his wife
                    passed on marriage into the power of her father-in-law, and their children as
                    they were born fell under that of their paternal grandfather; and the latter was
                    entitled to exercise over his daughters-in-law and grandchildren the same rights
                    he had over his sons and unmarried daughters. But there was this difference,
                    that, when the <hi rend="italic">paterfamilias</hi> died, his sons and daughters
                    who had remained <hi rend="italic">in potestate</hi> and his grandchildren by a
                    predeceased son instantly became their own masters <hi rend="italic"> (sui
                    juris),</hi> whereas grandchildren by a surviving son simply passed from the <hi
                    rend="italic">potestas</hi> of their grandfather into that of their father.</p>
                <p>The acquisition of domestic independence by the death of the family head
                    frequently involved the substitution of the guardianship of tutors <hi
                    rend="italic"> (futela)</hi> for the <hi rend="italic">potestas</hi> that had
                    come to an end. This was so invariably in the case of females <hi rend="italic">
                    sui juris,</hi> no matter what their age: they remained under guardianship until
                    they had passed by marriage <hi rend="italic">in maηum manti.</hi> It was only
                    pupil males, however, who required tutors, and their office came to an end when

                    regal period a testamentary appointment of tutors by a husband or parent to wife
                    or children was known in practice,— probably not. If so the office devolved upon
                    the <hi rend="italic">gens</hi> to which the deceased <hi rend="italic"
                    >paterfamilias</hi> belonged; and it may reasonably be assumed that it delegated
                    the duties to one of its members in particular, retaining in its collective
                    capacity a right of supervision.</p>

                    amongst the early Romans is one of the puzzling problems of their history. The

                    duties, and burdens according to the extent of their freeholds; and yet we know
                    very little with certainty of the way in which these were acquired. <note

                    Romulus of the little territory of his original settlement into three parts, not
                    necessarily of equal dimensions, one of which was intended for the maintenance
                    of the state and its institutions, civil and religious, the second <hi
                    rend="italic">(ager publicus)</hi> for the use of the citizens and profit of the
                    state, and the third <hi rend="italic">(ager prrvvatus)</hi> for subdivision
                    among his followers. Varro and Pliny further relate that to each of them he
                    assigned a homestead <hi rend="italic">(heredium)</hi> of two jugers, equal to
                    about an acre and a quarter, to be held by him and his heirs <hi rend="italic"
                    >(quae here-dem sequerentur),—</hi> Pliny adding that to none did the king give
                    more. There can be no doubt that a portion of the territory, gradually augmented
                    through new conquests, was reserved as <hi rend="italic">ager publicus</hi>;
                    that is sufficiently attested by the complaints made for centuries by the
                    plebeians of its monopolization by the patricians. But it is impossible to admit
                    the accuracy of the account of the mode in which the <hi rend="italic">ager
                    privatus</hi> was dealt with. The fact that the majority of the Servian local
                    tribes bore the names of well-known patrician <hi rend="italic">gentes</hi>
                    leads to the conclusion that many at least of the clans held tracts of land in
                    their corporate capacity, and that their constituent families settled alongside
                    each other, each with its own homestead in separate and independent right. It
                    can hardly be assumed, however, that two and a half jugers was its maximum.
                    Seven jugers, about 4∣ acres, seems to have been the normal extent of royal
                    grants to plebeians, and a patrician’s freehold is not likely to have been less;
                    probably in the ordinary case it was larger, seeing the minimum qualification
                    for the third Servian class was ten jugers, and for the first twenty. <note

                    till it himself with the aid of his sons. The case of Cincinnatus in the year
                    293 u.c. is often mentioned: having a freehold of just that extent, he had to
                    sell three jugers to meet engagements for which he believed himself in honour
                    responsible, and yet found the remaining four ample enough to maintain him with
                    all the dignity of a man who had been consul and who became dictator.

                    >gens</hi>; purchase from the former was by no means uncommon; and it may have
                    been on his purchased lands, outside his <hi rend="italic">heredium</hi> proper,
                    that his clients were usually employed. Those dependants were also employed in
                    large numbers upon those parts of the <hi rend="italic">ager publicus</hi> which
                    were occupied by the patricians under the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >possessioηes,</hi> and which really were the source of their wealth. These,
                    however, were not the property of their occupant; it was the lands acquired by
                    assignation or purchase that were alone regarded as his <hi rend="italic">ex

                    according to the law and custom of the Quirites.</p>
                <p>There are some who maintain that in the regal period, anterior to the reign of
                    Servius Tullius, there was no private property in movables. The proposition thus
                    broadly stated is manifestly untenable. If no more be meant by it than this,
                    that movables were not then recognized as objects of quiritarian right that
                    could be vindicated as such by a real action <hi rend="italic">per
                    sacramentum,</hi> it may be admitted that down to the time of Servius, with
                    exception perhaps of captured slaves and cattle, there was no property in
                    movables. But, if it be meant to negative the right of a man to alienate by
                    tradition what he held as his own, and to protect himself, or have protection
                    from the authorities, against any attempt to deprive him of it by theft or
                    violence, then the non-existence of ownership of movables must be emphatically
                    denied. Theft was theft, though the stolen article had been acquired only by
                    natural means,—by barter in the market, by the industry of the maker, or as the
                    product of something already belonging to its holder.</p>

                    succession in the regal period was extremely simple. It was this: on the death
                    of a <hi rend="italic">paterfamilias</hi> his patrimony devolved upon those of
                    his children <hi rend="italic">in potestate</hi> who by that event became <hi

                    distinction being made between movables and immovables, personalty and realty;
                    and, failing widow and children, it went to his <hi rend="italic">gens.</hi> The
                    notion that between the descendants and the <hi rend="italic">gens</hi> came an
                    intermediate class under the name of agnates does not seem well founded as
                    regards the regal period; they were introduced by the XII. Tables to meet the
                    case of the plebeians, who, having no <hi rend="italic">gentes,</hi> were
                    without legal heirs in default of children. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>It is quite true, however, that from the first the order of
                    succession was agnatic; for it -was those only of a man’s children who were
                    agnate as well as cognate that had any claim to his inheritance; and the <hi
                    rend="italic">gens</hi> was, theoretically at least, just a body of agnates. The
                    supposed mention of agnates in a law attributed to Numa rests simply on a
                    conjecture of I. G. Huschke’s <hi rend="italic">{Analecta litteraria,</hi>
                    Leipsic, 1826, p. 375). The law, which is preserved in narrative by Servius, <hi
                    rend="italic">In Virg. Eclog.,vt.</hi> 43, runs thus: “In Numae legibus cautum

                    cautione (Scalig., concione) offerret arietem.” Huschke’s substitution of <hi
                    rend="italic">agnatis</hi> for <hi rend="italic">et natis</hi> is all but
                    universally adopted; but, even were it necessary, it need mean nothing more than

                    touch the law of intestacy. </p></note> But it was more nominal than real. A
                    daughter who had passed into the hand of a husband during her father’s lifetime
                    of course could have no share in the latter’s inheritance, for she had ceased to
                    be a member of his family. One who was <hi rend="italic">in potestate</hi> at
                    his death, and thereby became <hi rend="italic">sui juris,</hi> did become his
                    heir, unless he had prevented such a result by testamentary arrangements. But
                    even then it was in the hands of the <hi rend="italic"> gens</hi> to prevent
                    risk of prejudice to themselves: for she could not marry, and so carry her

                    could she without their consent alienate any of the more valuable items of it;
                    nor, even with their consent, could she make a testament disposing of it in
                    prospect of death. Her inheritance, therefore, was hers in name only; in reality

                    to colonies diminished the number of those who had a claim to participate. But
                    the simplest plan of avoiding the difficulty was for the <hi rend="italic"
                    >paterfamilias</hi> to regulate his succession by testament; and there can be
                    little doubt that originally such a deed was had recourse to, not so much for
                    instituting a stranger heir when a man had no issue—according to patrician
                    notions his duty then was to perpetuate his family by adopting a son—as for
                    partitioning the succession when he had more children than one.</p>
                <p>There were two sorts of testaments made use of by the patricians of the regal
                    period,—that made in the comitia of the curies <hi rend="italic">{test. calatis

                    least—and the second was just a substitute for it on an emergency—was far from
                    being an independent exercise of the testator’s <hi rend="italic">voluntas.</hi>
                    For, though in course of time, and under the sanction of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >uti legassit ita jus esto</hi> of the XII. Tables, the curies may have become
                    merely the recipients of the oral declaration by the testator of his last will,
                    in order that they might testify to it after his death, it is impossible not to
                    see in the comitial testament what must originally have been a legislative act,
                    whereby the testator’s peers, for reasons which they and the presiding pontiffs
                    thought sufficient, sanctioned in the particular case a departure from the
                    ordinary rules of succession. The pontiffs were there to protect the interests

                    >gens</hi>; and it is hardly conceivable that a testament could have been
                    sanctioned by them which so far set at nought old traditions as to deprive a <hi

                    different traditions, and some of whom, as is thought by one or two writers of
                    note, laid more store on female kinship than on that through males. From the
                    moment that any of the former became part of the Roman <hi rend="italic"
                    >plebs</hi> everything like gentile organization was of course suppressed;
                    public policy could not suffer the continuance of what might have proved an
                    element of danger to the state. The inevitable consequence was a disturbance of
                    the whole family system. Having no longer any clansmen to stand by them in
                    emergencies, to avenge their quarrels and deaths, and to act as guardians of
                    their widows and orphans, the plebeians of Latin origin seem to have drawn
                    closer in their ideas to their fellows of Etruscan and Hellenic descent, and to
                    have transferred their regards to the circle of their relatives by blood and
                    marriage <hi rend="italic">{cognati et adfines).</hi> It is remarkable that,
                    notwithstanding the pre-eminence given to agnates by the XII. Tables in matters
                    of tutory and succession, the law reserved to the cognates, as distinguished
                    from the agnates, certain rights and duties that in patrician Rome must have
                    belonged to the <hi rend="italic">gens,—</hi> for example, the duty of
                    prosecuting the murderer (originally of avenging the death) of a kinsman, and
                    the right of appeal against a capital sentence pronounced upon a kinsman. This
                    can only have been because in olden times, when agnation was unknown as distinct
                    from the <hi rend="italic">gens,</hi> it was plebeian practice to entrust those
                    rights and duties to the sobrinal circle of cognates. <note anchored="true"

                    there may have been laxity amongst many of the plebeians in their domestic
                    relations is extremely probable. The ceremony of confarreation was denied to
                    them, and coemption (as seems likely) was not yet invented, so that the only way
                    of contracting a marriage that was open to them was simple interchange of
                    consent, which was not legally creative of <hi rend="italic">manus.</hi> Whether

                    conferred, while others may have been indifferent as to whether it did or not;
                    but we may be very sure that the patricians denied its possibility, on the
                    ground that it was a prerogative of Roman citizens, amongst whom the plebeians
                    had no claim to rank.</p>
                <p>The accounts of the early distributions of land amongst the plebeians are even
                    more uncertain than those we have of its distribution amongst the patricians.
                    They had undoubtedly become freeholders in large numbers before the Servian
                    reforms. But they probably attained that position only by gradual stages. There
                    are indications that their earliest grants from the kings in their character of
                    royal clients (as Cicero calls them) were only during pleasure; but latterly, as
                    they increased in numbers and importance, they obtained concessions of <hi
                    rend="italic"> heredia</hi> varying in extent from two to seven jugers. That
                    those who had the means also frequently acquired land by purchase from the state
                    may be taken for granted. In fact there is good reason to believe that by the
                    time of Servius the plebeians were as free to hold land in private property as
                    the patricians, although the stages by which they reached equality in this
                    respect are uncertain and difficult to follow. As for movable property their
                    rights in it were presumably the same as those of the patricians.</p>
                <p>As regards the law of succession it may safely be assumed that by custom at all
                    events the children of a plebeian usually took his estate on his death. But, as
                    he was not a member of a <hi rend="italic">gens,</hi> there was no provision for
                    the devolution of his succession on failure of children. The want of them he
                    could not supply by adrogation, as he had for long no access to the assembly of
                    the curies; and it is very doubtful if adoption of a <hi rend="italic"
                    >filiusfamilias</hi> was known before the reforms of Servius Tullius. The same
                    cause that disqualified him for adrogating a <hi rend="italic"
                    >paterfamilias</hi> disqualified him for making a testament <hi rend="italic">
                    calatis comitiis</hi>; and even one <hi rend="italic">in procinctu</hi> was
                    impossible, since, although before the time of Servius plebeians may
                    occasionally have served in the army, they were not citizens, and so had not the
                    requisite capacity for making a testament. Until therefore the XII. Tables
                    introduced the succession of agnates a plebeian unsurvived by children was
                    necessarily heirless,— that is to say, heirless in law. But custom seems to have
                    looked without disfavour on the appropriation of his <hi rend="italic">
                    heredium</hi> by an outsider: a brother or other near kinsman would have the
                    earliest opportunity, and, if he maintained his possession of it in the
                    character of heir for a reasonable period, fixed by the XII. Tables at a year,
                    the law dealt with him as heir, and in course of time the pontiffs imposed upon
                    him the duty of maintaining the family <hi rend="italic">sacra.</hi> This was
                    the origin, and a very innocent and laudable one,</p>

                    in connexion with the regal period, in the sense in which the words were
                    understood in the later jurisprudence, would be a misapplication of language. It
                    would be going too far to say, however, as is sometimes done, that before the
                    time of Servius Rome had no law of contract; for men must have bought and sold,
                    or at least bartered, from earliest times,—must have rented houses, hired
                    labour, made loans, carried goods, and been parties to a variety of other
                    transactions inevitable amongst a people engaged to any extent in pastoral,
                    agricultural, or trading pursuits. It is true that a patrician family with a
                    good establishment of clients and slaves had within itself ample machinery for
                    supplying its ordinary wants, and was thus to a great extent independent of
                    outside aid. But there were not many such families; and the plebeian farmers and
                    the artisans of the guilds were in no such fortunate position. There must
                    therefore have been contracts and a law of contract; but the latter was very
                    imperfect. In barter—for at that time money was not yet in use—with instant
                    exchange and delivery of one commodity against another, the transaction was
                    complete at once without the creation of any obligation. But in other cases,
                    such as those alluded to, one of the parties at least must have trusted to the
                    good faith of the other. What was his guarantee, and what remedy had he for
                    breach of engagement?</p>
                <p>His reliance in the first place was on the probity of the party with whom he was
                    dealing,—on the latter’s reverence for Fides, and the dread he had of the
                    disapprobation of his fellows should he prove false, and of the penalties,
                    social, religious, or pecuniary, that might consequently be imposed on him by
                    his <hi rend="italic">gens</hi> in the case of a patrician, by his guild in the
                    case of a craftsman, or by the king in the case of any other plebeian. <note

                    have been the case at a later period, in the time of the earlier kings he who
                    forswore himself was amenable to pontifical discipline. If he preferred a more
                    substantial guarantee, he took something in pledge or pawn from the other
                    contractor; and, though he had no legal title to it, and so could not recover it
                    by judicial process if he lost possession, yet so long as he retained it he had
                    in his own hand a <hi rend="italic"> de facto</hi> compulsitor to performance.
                    Upon performance he could be forced to return it or suffer a penalty,—not by
                    reason of obligation resulting from a contract of pledge, for the law as yet
                    recognized none, but because, in retaining it after the purpose was served for
                    which he had received it, he was committing theft and liable to its punishment.
                    At this stage breach of contract, as such, does not seem to have legitimated any
                    action for damages or reparation before the civil tribunals; but it is not
                    improbable that, where actual loss had been sustained, the injured party was
                    permitted to resort immediately to self-redress by seizure of the wrongdoer or
                    his goods. Such self-help was according to the spirit of the time,—not
                    self-defence merely in presence of imminent danger, but active measures for
                    redress of wrongs already completed.</p>

                    been attempted to explain the coexistence of these systems by reference to the
                    different temperaments of the races that constituted united Rome; and this
                    certainly is a consideration that cannot be left out of view. But the same
                    sequence is observable in the history of the laws of other nations whose
                    original elements were not so mixed, the later system gradually gaining ground
                    upon the earlier and eventually overwhelming it. The remarkable thing in Rome is
                    that private vengeance should so long not only have left its traces but really
                    continued to be an active power. It must still have been an admitted right of
                    the <hi rend="italic">gens</hi> or kinsmen of a murdered man in the days of
                    Numa; otherwise we should not have had that law of his providing that, where a
                    homicide was due to misadventure, the offering to them of a ram should stay
                    their hands. To avenge the death of a kinsman was more than a right: it was a
                    religious duty, for his <hi rend="italic">manes</hi> had to be appeased; and so
                    strongly was this idea entertained that, even long after the state had
                    interfered and made murder a matter of public prosecution, a kinsman was so
                    imperatively bound to set it in motion that if he failed he was not permitted to
                    take anything of the inheritance of the deceased. Private vengeance was lawful
                    too at the instance of a husband or father who surprised his wife or daughter in
                    an act of adultery; he might kill her and her paramour on the spot, though, if
                    he allowed his wrath to cool, he could afterwards deal with her only judicially
                    in his domestic tribunal. The talion we read of in the XII. Tables is also
                    redolent of the <hi rend="italic">vindicta privata,</hi> although practically it
                    had become no more than a compulsitor to reparation. And even the nexal

                    p. 694), which was not abolished until the fifth century of the city, may not
                    unfittingly, in view of the cruelties that too often attended it, be said to
                    have savoured more of private vengeance than either punishment or procedure in
                    reparation.</p>

                    offences against the gods rather than against either an individual or the state.
                    But it is difficult to draw the line between different classes of offences, and
                    predicate of one that it was a sin, of another that it was a crime, and of a
                    third that it was hut civil injury done to an individual. <note anchored="true"

                    other records of the regal period were regarded as violations of divine law, and
                    the punishments appropriate to them determined upon that footing. Yet in many of
                    them the prosecution was left to the state or to private individuals. It is not
                    clear, indeed, that there was any machinery for public prosecution except in
                    treason and murder,—the former because it was essentially a state offence, the
                    latter because it was comparatively early deemed expedient to repress the
                    blood-feud, which was apt to lead to deplorable results when friends and
                    neighbours appeared to defend the alleged assassin. <note anchored="true"

                    removal of a boundary stone, the slaughter of a plough-ox,—all these were
                    capital olfences; the offender, by the formula <hi rend="italic">saeer
                    esto,</hi> was devoted to the infernal gods. Festus says that, although the
                    rules of divine law did not allow that he should be offered as a sacrifice to
                    the deity he had especially offended <hi rend="italic">(nee fias est eum

                    protection that any one might kill him with impunity. But, as the <hi
                    rend="italic">saeratio</hi> was usually coupled with forfeiture of the
                    offender’s estate or part of it to religious uses, it is probable that steps
                    were taken to have the outlawry or excommunication judicially declared, though
                    whether by the pontiffs, the king, or the curies does not appear; such a
                    declaration would, besides, relieve the private avenger of the incensed god of
                    the chance of future question as to whether or not the citizen he had slain was

                <p>That there must have been other wrongful acts that were regarded in early Rome as
                    deserving of punishment or penalty of some sort, besides those visited with
                    death, sacration, or forfeiture of estate, total or partial, cannot be doubted;
                    no community has ever been so happy as to know nothing of thefts, robberies, and
                    assaults. The XII. Tables contained numerous provisions in reference to them;
                    but it is extremely probable that, down at least to the time of Servius Tullius,
                    the manner of dealing with them rested on custom, and was in the main
                    self-redress, restrained by the intervention of the king when it appeared to him
                    that the injured party was going beyond the bounds of fair reprisal, and
                    frequently bought off with a composition. When the offence was strictly within
                    the family, the <hi rend="italic">gens,</hi> and perhaps the guild, it was for
                    those who exercised jurisdiction over those corporations to judge of the wrong
                    and prescribe and enforce the penalty.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Effect of the Servian Reforms on the Private Law.—</hi> The aim
                    of the constitutional, military, and financial reforms of Servius Tullius was to
                    promote an advance towards equality between patricians and plebeians. While it
                    may be an open question whether the institution of the comitia of the centuries
                    was of his doing, or only a result of his arrangements in after years, it seems
                    clear that he had it in view to admit the plebeians to some at least of the
                    privileges of citizenship, imposing on them at the same time a proportionate
                    share of its duties and its burdens. Privileges, duties, and burdens were alike
                    to be measured by the citizen’s position as a freeholder; the amount of real
                    estate with its appurtenances held by him on quiri-tarian title was to determine
                    the nature of the military service he was to render, the extent to which he was
                    to be liable for tribute, and, assuming Servius to have contemplated the
                    creation of a new assembly, the influence he was to exercise in it.</p>
                <p>To facilitate the execution of his scheme it was necessary to establish a
                    register of the citizens <hi rend="italic">(census),</hi> which should contain,
                    in addition to a record of the strength of their families, a statement of the
                    value of their lands and appurtenances, and which should be revised
                    periodically. In order to ensure as far as possible certainty of title, and
                    relieve the officials of troublesome investigations into the genuineness of
                    every alleged change of ownership between two valuations, it was further
                    declared—presumably by Servius—that no alleged transfer would be recognized
                    which had not been effected publicly, with observance of certain prescribed
                    solemnities, or else by surrender in court before the supreme magistrate. The
                    form of conveyance thus introduced got the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >mancipium,</hi> and at a later period <hi rend="italic"> mancipatio,</hi> while
                    the lands and other things that were to pass by it came to be known—whether from
                    the first or not is of little moment—as <hi rend="italic">res mancipi.</hi>
                    Hence arose in the law of property a distinction of great importance, only
                    abolished by Justinian more than a thousand years later, between <hi
                    rend="italic">res mancipi,</hi> which were transferable in quiritarian right
                    only by mancipation or surrender in court, and <hi rend="italic">res nee
                    mancipi,</hi> which were transferable by simple delivery.</p>
                <p>Mancipation is described by Gaius, but with particular reference to the
                    conveyance of movable <hi rend="italic">res mancipi,</hi> as a pretended sale in
                    presence of five citizens as witnesses and a <hi rend="italic">libripens</hi>
                    holding a pair of copper scales. The transferee, with one hand on the thing
                    being transferred, and using certain words of style, declared it his by purchase
                    with an <hi rend="italic">as</hi> (which he held in his other hand) and the
                    scales <hi rend="italic">(hoe acre aeneaque libra)</hi>; and simultaneously he
                    struck the scales with the <hi rend="italic">as,</hi> which he then handed to
                    the transferrer as figurative of the price. The principal variation when it was
                    an immovable that was being transferred was that the mancipation did not require
                    to be on the spot: the land was simply described by its known name in the
                    valuation roll. Although in the time of Gaius only a fictitious sale—in fact the
                    formal conveyance upon a relative contract—yet it was not always so. Its history
                    is veιy simple. The use of the scales fixes its introduction to a time when
                    coined money was not yet current, but raw copper nevertheless had become a
                    standard of value and in a manner a medium of exchange. That, however, was not
                    in the first days of Rome. Then, and for a long time, values were estimated in
                    cattle or sheep, fines were imposed in them, and the deposits in the <hi
                    rend="italic">legis actio sacra· mento (infra,</hi> p. 681) took the same form.
                    The use of copper as a substitute for them in private transactions was probably
                    derived from Etruria. But, being only raw metal or foreign coins, it could be
                    made available for loans or payments only when weighed in the scales: it passed
                    by -weight, not by tale. There is no reason for supposing that the weighing was
                    a solemnity, that it had any significance beyond its obvious purpose of enabling
                    parties to ascertain that a vendor or borrower was getting the amount of copper
                    for which he had bargained.</p>
                <p>It was this practice of everyday life in private transactions that Servius
                    adopted as the basis of his mancipatory conveyance, engrafting on it one or two
                    new features intended to give it publicity and as it were state sanction, and
                    thus render it more serviceable in the transfer of censuable property. Instead
                    of the parties themselves using the scales, an impartial balance-holder,
                    probably an official, was required to undertake the duty, and five citizens were
                    required to attend as witnesses, who were to be the vouchers to the census
                    officials of the regularity of the procedure. They are generally supposed to
                    have been intended as representatives of the five classes in which Servius had
                    distributed the population, and thus virtually of the state; and the fact that,
                    when the parties appealed to them for their testimony, they were addressed not
                    as <hi rend="italic">testes</hi> but as <hi rend="italic">Quiritxs</hi> lends
                    some colour to this view. Servius is also credited with the introduction of
                    rectangular pieces of copper of different but carefully adjusted weights,
                    stamped by his authority with various devices <hi rend="italic">(aes
                    signatum),</hi> which are usually supposed to have been intended to take the
                    place of the raw metai <hi rend="italic">(aes rude)</hi> formerly in use, and so
                    facilitate the process of weighing; but there is more reason for thinking they
                    were cast and stamped as standards to be put into one scale, while the raw metal
                    whose weight was to be ascertained was put into the other.</p>
                <p>Instead, therefore, of being a fictitious sale, as Gaius describes it, and as it
                    became after the introduction of coined money early in the 4th century, the <hi
                    rend="italic"> mancipium or</hi> mancipation, as regulated by Servius, was an
                    actual completed sale in the strictest sense of the term. What were the precise
                    words of style addressed by the transferee to the transferrer, or what exactly
                    the form of the ceremonial, we know not. But, as attendance during all the time
                    that some thousands of pounds perhaps of copper were being weighed would have
                    been an intolerable burden upon the five citizens convoked to discharge a public
                    duty, it may be surmised that it early became the practice to have the price
                    weighed beforehand, and then to reweigh, or pretend to reweigh, before the
                    witnesses only a single little bit of metal <hi rend="italic"
                    >(rauduseulum),</hi> which the transferee then handed to the transferrer as “the
                    first pound and the last,” and thus representative of the whole. <note

                    witnesses. In the words addressed to the creditor by the debtor making payment

                    against a price weighed in the scales. The resulting obligation on the vendor to
                    maintain the title of the vendee, and the qualifications that might be
                    superinduced on the conveyance by agreement of parties—the so-called <hi
                    rend="italic">leges mancipii—</hi> will be considered in connexion with the
                    provisions of the XII. Tables on the subject <hi rend="italic">(infra,</hi> p.
                    690).</p>
                <p>The things included in the class of <hi rend="italic">res mancipi</hi> were lands
                    and houses held on quiritarian title, together with rights of way and aqueduct,
                    slaves, and domestic beasts of draught or burden (oxen, horses, mules, and
                    donkeys); all others were res <hi rend="italic">nee mancipi.</hi> In the time of
                    Servius and during the greater part of the republic the domain land <hi
                    rend="italic"> (ager publixus}</hi> in Italy, until it was appropriated by
                    private owners, was also reckoned as <hi rend="italic">res nee mancipi</hi>;
                    like all other things of the same class, it passed by simple delivery, whereas
                    res <hi rend="italic">mancipi</hi> could not be transferred in full ownership
                    except by mancipation or surrender in court. Many theories have been propounded
                    to account for the distinction between these two classes of things, and to
                    explain the principle of selection that admitted oxen and horses into the one,
                    but relegated sheep and swine, ships and vehicles, to the other. But there is
                    really little difficulty. Under the arrangement of Servius what was to determine
                    the nature and extent of a citizen’s political qualifications, military duties,
                    and financial burdens was the value of his <hi rend="italic">heredium</hi> (and
                    other freeholds, if he had any), and what may be called its appurtenances—the
                    slaves that worked for the household, the slaves and beasts of draught and
                    burden that worked the farm, and the servitudes of way and water that ran with
                    the latter. It may be that in course of time slaves without exception were dealt
                    with as <hi rend="italic">res mancipi,—</hi> without consideration, that is to
                    say, whether they were employed on their owner’s house or farm or on any part of
                    the public lands in his occupancy—and reasonably, because they were often
                    shifted from the one to the other. But the cattle a man depastured on the public
                    meadows were no more <hi rend="italic">res mancipi</hi> than his sheep. To say
                    that the things classed as <hi rend="italic">res mantipi</hi> were selected for
                    that distinction by Servius because they were what were essential to a family
                    engaged in agricultural pursuits would be to fall short of the truth. They <hi
                    rend="italic">constituted</hi> the <hi rend="italic">familia</hi> in the sense
                    of the family estate proper; whereas the herds and flocks, and in time
                    everything else belonging to the <hi rend="italic">paterfamilias,</hi> fell
                    under the denomination of <hi rend="italic">peeunia.</hi> So the words are to be
                    understood in the well-known phraseology of a testament, <hi rend="italic"
                    >familia ρeeuniaque mea.</hi></p>
                <p>The public solemnity of <hi rend="italic">mancipatio</hi> thus sanctioned as a
                    mode of transferring a quiritarian right of property, for which <hi
                    rend="italic"> manus</hi> was probably as yet the only technical descriptive
                    word in use, was not long of being adapted to other transactions in which <hi
                    rend="italic">mαηus</hi> of a different sort was to be acquired,—for example,
                    coemption, emancipation, adoption of a <hi rend="italic">filiusfamilias,</hi>
                    the contract of <hi rend="italic">nexum,</hi> release of a nexal debtor, and
                    that <hi rend="italic">mortis causa</hi> alienation of his estate by a plebeian
                    which in time developed into the testament <hi rend="italic">per aes et
                    libram.</hi></p>
                <p>It has been already explained (p. 674) that, prior to the time of Servius, the
                    matrimonial unions of the plebeians were not, in the estimation of the
                    patricians at least, regarded as lawful marriages <hi rend="italic">(justae
                    nuptiae),</hi> although amongst themselves they may have been held effectual and
                    productive, if not of <hi rend="italic">manus,</hi> at all events of <hi
                    rend="italic">patria potestas.</hi> For this there were two reasons: (1) not
                    being citizens, they did not possess the preliminary qualification for <hi
                    rend="italic">justαx nτιρtiae,</hi> namely, <hi rend="italic">conubium</hi>; and
                    (2) not being patricians, the only ceremony of marriage known to the law was
                    incompetent to them. The first obstacle was removed by their admission by
                    Servius to the ordinary rights of citizenship, the second by the introduction of
                    the civil ceremony of coemption. Once the efficacy of mancipation as a mode of
                    acquiring <hi rend="italic">manus</hi> over things was established, its adoption
                    by the plebeians, now citizens enjoying <hi rend="italic">conubium,</hi> as a
                    method of acquiring <hi rend="italic">manus</hi> over their wives was extremely
                    natural. The scales, the <hi rend="italic">libripens,</hi> and the five
                    witnesses were all there; but, as there was no real price to be paid, the only
                    copper that was needed was a single <hi rend="italic">raudusculum.</hi> The
                    words recited in the ceremonial, unfortunately not preserved, were necessarily
                    different from those in an ordinary mancipation, and, according to the testimony
                    of a considerable number of ancient writers, and as the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >eo-emptio</hi> itself seems to indicate (though this is disputed by most modern
                    civilians), the nominal purchase was mutual; the man acquired a <hi
                    rend="italic"> materfamilias</hi> who was to bear him children and enable him to
                    perpetuate his family, while she acquired a <hi rend="italic">paterfamilias</hi>
                    who was to maintain her while the marriage lasted, and in whose succession she
                    was to share when a widow. It was accompanied with other observances described
                    by many of the lay writers, but these were matters of usage and fashion rather
                    than of law, and it might be, and often was, accompanied also with religious
                    rites, which, however, were private, not public as in confarreation. It is
                    common, but not quite accurate, to speak of coemption as a form of marriage. It
                    was strictly the acquisition of <hi rend="italic">mawus</hi> by the husband over
                    nis wife, and probably in most cases contemporaneous with the marriage; but they
                    were really distinct, the latter being completed simply by interchanged consent.
                    That this was so latterly at least is evident from two facts,—(1) that,
                    according to Gaius, the <hi rend="italic">coemρtio</hi> might follow the
                    marriage at any distance of time; and (2) that, according to the same authority,
                    though the marriage was dissolved by divorce, the nιαr∏is still remained until
                    put an end to by remancipation (on which the divorced wife was entitled to
                    insist).</p>
                <p>It has also been explained that the plebeians were in a very much worse position
                    than the patricians in regard to their power of disposing of their estates in
                    contemplation of death. Their elevation to the rank of citizens did not
                    apparently give them admission to the comitia of the curies; and, as it was many
                    years after the assassination of Servius before the comitia of the centuries was
                    convened, they had still no means of making testaments unless perhaps in the
                    field on the eve of battle. So here again the expedient of mancipation was taken
                    advantage of, not indeed to make a testament instituting an heir, and to take
                    effect only on the death of the testator,—the form of the transaction, as an
                    instant acquisition in exchange for a price real or nominal, could not lend
                    itself to that without statutory intervention—but to carry the transferrer’s <hi

                    the early law, it was legally unprotected so far as the third parties were
                    concerned whom the transferrer meant to benefit; they had no action against the
                    trustee to enforce the trust; their sole guarantee was in his integrity and his
                    respect for Fides.</p>
                <p>Dionysius credits Servius with the authorship of more than fifty enactments
                    relative to contracts and crimes, which he says were submitted to and approved
                    by the assembly of the curies. The great majority of those so-called enactments
                    were probably nothing more than formularizations of customary law, for the use
                    of the private judges in civil causes whom the king is said to have instituted.
                    There was one contract, however, notorious in after years under the name of <hi
                    rend="italic"> nexmm,</hi> that manifestly was influenced, either directly or
                    indirectly, by his legislation. In its normal estate it was a loan of money, or
                    rather of the raw copper that as yet was all that stood for it. Whether before
                    the time of Servius it was accompanied by any formalities beyond the weighing of
                    it in a pair of scales (which was rather substance than form) we know <hi
                    rend="superscript">,</hi> not; and what right it conferred on the creditor over
                    his debtor who failed to repay can only be matter of speculation. But there are
                    indications that, in the exercise of undefined self-help, defaulters w <hi
                    rend="superscript"> τ</hi> ere treated with considerable severity, being taken
                    in satisfaction and put in chains by their creditors; for Servius is reported to
                    have promised to pay their debts himself in order to obtain their release, and
                    to pass a law limiting execution by persons lending money at interest to the
                    goods of their debtors. Whether he fulfilled the first part of his promise we
                    are not informed; but the second part of it was impracticable, since a debtor’s
                    failure to repay a loan was in most cases attributable to his insolvency and
                    want of means with which to satisfy his creditor. So, apparently, Servius had to
                    be content with regulating and ensuring the publicity of the contract, and
                    making a creditor’s right of self-redress by apprehension <hi rend="italic"
                    >(manus injeetio)</hi> and confinement of his debtor conditional on the
                    observance of the prescribed formalities of the <hi rend="italic">neχum.</hi>
                    These were the weighing of the copper that was being advanced in a pair of
                    scales held by an official <hi rend="italic">libripens</hi>; the reweighing of a
                    single piece in the presence of five citizen witnesses, and its delivery by the
                    lender as representing the wdιole; and the simultaneous recital of certain words
                    of style, which had the effect of imposing on the borrower an obligation to
                    repay the loan, usually with interest, by a certain day. The consequence of
                    this, the earliest independent contract of the <hi rend="italic">fies

                <p>before the time of Servius we know little that can be relied on. Antiquity used
                    to speak of the king as having been generally supreme in both. But this can be
                    accepted only with considerable reservation. For the <hi rend="italic"
                    >paterfamilias,</hi> aided by a council in cases of importance, was judge within
                    the family,—his jurisdiction sometimes excluding that of the state, at other
                    times concurring with it, and not to be stayed even by an acquittal pronounced
                    by it. He alone was competent in any charge against a member of the family for a
                    crime or offence against the domestic order,—adultery or unchastity of wife or
                    daughter, immorality of his sons, unduti-ful behaviour of children or clients;
                    while there are instances on record of his interference judicially where an
                    offence such as murder or theft had been committed by a member of his family
                    against a stranger, and even when his crime had been treason against the state.
                    Death, slavery, banishment, expulsion from the family, imprisonment, chains,
                    stripes, withdrawal of <hi rend="italic">peculkurn,</hi> were all at his command
                    as punishments; and it may readily be assumed that in imposing them he was freer
                    to take account of moral guilt than an outside tribunal. The indications of
                    criminal jurisdiction on the part of the <hi rend="italic">gens</hi> are slight;
                    but its organization was such that it is impossible not to believe that it must
                    occasionally have been called on to exercise such functions. And it must not be
                    lost sight of that, as murder seems to have been the only crime in regard to
                    which private revenge was absolutely excluded, the judicial office of the kings
                    must have been considerably lightened, public opinion approving and not
                    condemning self-redress so long as it was kept within the limits set by usage
                    and custom.</p>
                <p>The boundary between civil and criminal jurisdiction, if it existed at all, was
                    extremely shadowy. Theft and robbery, for example, if one may conclude from the
                    position they held in the later jurisprudence, were regarded not as public but
                    as private wrongs; and yet when a thief was caught plying his trade by night he
                    might be slain, and when taken in the act by day might be sold as a slave. But
                    in both cases it may also be assumed that a practice, afterwards formally
                    sanctioned by the XII. Tables—that of the thief compounding for his life or
                    freedom—was early admitted, and the right of self-redress thus made much more
                    beneficial to the party wronged than when nothing was attained but vengeance on
                    the wrongdoer. In assaults, non-manifest thefts, and other minor wrongs,
                    self-interest would in like manner soon lead to the general adoption of the
                    practice of compounding; what was originally a matter of option in time came to
                    be regarded as a right; and with it there would be occasional difficulty in
                    settling the amount of the composition, and consequent necessity of an appeal to
                    a third party. Here seems to be the origin of the king’s jurisdiction in matters
                    of this sort. He was the natural person to whom to refer such a dispute; for he
                    alone, as supreme magistrate, had the power to use coercion to prevent the party
                    wronged insisting on his right of selfredress, in face of a tender by the
                    wrongdoer of what had been declared to be sufficient reparation. But that
                    self-redress was not stayed if the reparation found due was withheld; as the
                    party wronged was still entitled at a much later period to wreak his vengeance
                    upon the wrongdoer by apprehending and imprisoning him, it cannot reasonably be
                    doubted that such also was the practice of the regal period.</p>
                <p>How the kings acquired jurisdiction in questions of quiritarian right, such as
                    disputes about property or inheritance, is by no means so obvious. Within the
                    family, of course, such questions were impossible, though between clansmen they
                    may have been settled by the <hi rend="italic">gens</hi> or its chief. The words
                    of style used in the sacramental real action <hi rend="italic">{infra,</hi> p.
                    682) suggest that there must have been a time when the spear was the arbiter,
                    and when the contending parties, backed possibly by their clansmen or friends,
                    were actual combatants, and victory decided the right. Such a procedure could
                    not long survive the institution of a state. In Rome there seems to have been
                    very early substituted for it what from its general complexion one would infer
                    was a submission of the question of right to the pontiffs as the repositories of
                    legal lore. Their proper functions, however, were sacred. So, to bring what was
                    a question of purely civil right within their jurisdiction, they engrafted on it
                    a sacral element, by requiring each of the parties to make oath to the verity of
                    his contention; and the point that in form they decided was which of the two
                    oaths was false and therefore to be made atonement for. In substance, however,
                    it was a finding on the real question at issue; and the party in whose favour it
                    was pronounced was free to make it effectual if necessary by self-redress in the
                    ordinary way.</p>
                <p>Of Servius, Dionysius says—using, as he often does, language more appropriate to
                    the republican than to the regal period—that he drew a line of separation
                    between public and private judicial</p>
                <p>I)rocesses, and that, while he retained the former in his own hands, ιe referred
                    the latter to private judges, and regulated the procedure to be followed in
                    causes brought before them. Something of the sort was absolutely necessary. He
                    was enormously increasing the number of the citizens,—that is to say, of those
                    who were to enjoy in future the privileges of quiritarian right,—and multiplying
                    the sources of future disputes that would have to be determined by the
                    tribunals. The nature of the provision made by him to meet the new aspect of
                    things is much controverted; but we are disposed to credit him alike with the
                    establishment of the collegiate court of the centumvirs and the institution of
                    the single judge <hi rend="italic">{uηus judex).</hi></p>
                <p>The centumviral court and centumviral causes are often referred to by Cicero, and
                    the .ange of their jurisdiction seems to have included every possible question
                    of <hi rend="italic">manus</hi> in the old sense of the word,—status of
                    individuals, property and its easements and burdens, inheritance whether testate
                    or intestate,—in other words, all questions of quiritarian right. By the time of
                    Gaius the only matters apparently that were brought before it were questions of
                    right to an inheritance of the j⅛is <hi rend="italic">civile</hi>; but the
                    spear, the emblem of quiritarian right generally, was still its ensign.</p>
                <p>That Servius should substitute for king and pontiffs a numerous court of
                    citizens, originally, as there is reason to assume, all patricians, to try
                    questions of quiritarian right on remit from himself, was quite in accordance
                    with the general spirit of his reforms. It was not mere matters of personal
                    dispute they had to decide, but they had to build up by their judgments a law
                    which was to be of general and permanent application; and, as it was beyond the
                    power of the king to overtake the task, what could be a more appropriate
                    substitute than a court of his counsellors acting under pontifical guidance?</p>
                <p>But there were many cases requiring judicial assistance in which no question of
                    quiritarian right had to be determined, but only one of personal claim—of
                    alleged indebtedness, whether arising out of a legal or illegal act, denied
                    either <hi rend="italic">in toto</hi> or only as to its amount. Matters of that
                    sort were supposed to involve no general principle of law, but to be rather mere
                    disputes or differences about facts, which could well be decided by a single
                    judge. To meet their case the <hi rend="italic">unus jτcdex</hi> was introduced;
                    he was appointed for each case as it arose, and acted really as the king’s
                    commissioner. This was the beginning of a system that bore wondrous fruit in
                    after years, and that, as will be shown in the sequel, eventually displaced
                    altogether the more imposing court of the centumvirs.</p>

                    during the first two centuries of the republic. Stage by stage they fought and
                    conquered in the uphill battle for social and political equality. In 260 u.c.
                    they got their own special protectors in their tribunes, with the aediles as
                    their assistants, and <hi rend="italic">judires decemviri</hi> to act under
                    their instructions as arbiters in disputes amongst themselves. In 283 they
                    obtained state sanction for their <hi rend="italic">concilium,</hi> and
                    recognition of its power to regulate purely plebeian interests. The XII. Tables
                    of 303 were the fruit of their agitation for a revision and written embodiment
                    of the law. It was in deference to their complaints of their practical
                    disfranchisement through the unduly preponderating influence of the patricians
                    in the comitia of the centuries that in 305 the comitia of the tribes was
                    instituted. Their repeated protests against the monopolization of the public
                    domain land by members of the higher order resulted at last in the definite
                    recognition of their right to participate in its occupation by one of the
                    Licinian laws of 387. The long course of cruel oppression of plebeian insolvents
                    by their patrician creditors was put an end to by the Poetilian law of 428
                    abolishing nexal contract, and prohibiting the use of chains and fetters on
                    persons incarcerated for purely civil debt. By the Hortensian law of 467 the
                    resolutions of the plebeian council <hi rend="italic">{plebiscita)</hi> were
                    declared binding not only on the plebeians themselves but on the whole body of
                    the citizens. And from 333, when a plebeian first reached the magistracy through
                    the quaestorship, down to 502, when they attained to the supreme pontificate,
                    they gradually vindicated their right as citizens to share in all the honours
                    and dignities of the state.</p>
                <p>The legislative bodies were thus three in number,—the comitia of the centuries,
                    the <hi rend="italic">concilvum plebis,</hi> and the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n702/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0702-0679"/>comitia of the tribes. The first, if not organized
                    by Servius Tullius, at all events grew out of his distribution of the populace
                    into classes and centuries according to the value of their freeholds as
                    appearing on the census-list. As just the national army assembled for a peaceful
                    purpose <hi rend="italic">{exerritus civilis),</hi> it could be convened and
                    presided over originally only by a magistrate possessing the military <hi
                    rend="italic">imperium, i.e.,</hi> a consul; but, after the creation of the
                    censorship in 311 and the praetorship in 387, the holders of those offices were
                    entitled to convoke it,—the former for its assent to arrangements for the
                    census, and the latter for state trials. It was the centuries that passed the
                    XII. Tables; but for the most part their legislation was upon questions
                    affecting public and constitutional rather than private interests. The procedure
                    in the centuriate comitia was somewhat cumbrous. There was publication of the
                    proposed law <hi rend="italic">(promulgatio rogationis)</hi> a fortnight before
                    the day appointed, sometimes one or more meetings <hi rend="italic"
                    >(conciones)</hi> being held in the interval for its consideration and
                    discussion. When the day arrived, the <hi rend="italic">auspicia</hi> were taken
                    by the presiding magistrate, assisted by an augur; if favourable, the citizens
                    were summoned anew by blast of trumpet, and on their assembling, which
                    originally they did under arms, prayer and sacrifice were offered by president,
                    pontiffs, and augurs. A final <hi rend="italic">concio</hi> might then be held
                    if thought necessary; and, after it was over, on the order to “proceed to the
                    comitia,” the citizens marched to the Campus Martius (the formal assembly being
                    incompetent within the city). There the <hi rend="italic">rogatio</hi> was read
                    and, if no sign from heaven indicated the dissent of the gods and warned the
                    assembly to disperse, was at once put to the vote—-“Is it your pleasure,
                    Quirites, to hold this as law ?” The vote was taken by centuries, those of the
                    knights and the freeholders of full valuation voting first; if they were
                    unanimous it went no further, for these formed more than a majority of the whole
                    <hi rend="italic">comitia.</hi> The resolution, if adopted, was <hi
                    rend="italic">populi jussum,</hi> but not yet law. It had still to run the
                    gauntlet of the “fathers,”—whether the senate or only its patrician members is
                    disputed; it was in their power to refuse to authorize it <hi rend="italic"
                    >(audores fieri),</hi> usually putting their dissent on the ground that the gods
                    willed it not; but if they ratified it, then it became a <hi rend="italic"
                    >lex,</hi> ordinarily getting the name of the magistrate by whom it had been
                    proposed. The power of veto, however, was considerably qualified by a Publilian
                    law of the year 415, which enacted that in future the “fathers” should grant (or
                    refuse) their <hi rend="italic">auctoritas</hi> before the vote was taken.</p>

                    rend="italic">comitia</hi> was an assembly of the whole body of the people,
                    voting according to tribes instead of centuries; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >concilium</hi> was an assembly of plebeians only, also voting <hi rend="italic"
                    >tributim.</hi> (2) The <hi rend="italic">comitia</hi> was convened and presided
                    over by a patrician magistrate, not necessarily, however, with military <hi
                    rend="italic">imperium,</hi> and therefore very frequently by the praetor;
                    whereas the <hi rend="italic">concilnιm</hi> could be convened and presided over
                    only by a plebeian official, either a tribune or an aedile. (3) In the <hi
                    rend="italic">comitia</hi> the <hi rend="italic">auspicia</hi> had to be taken
                    before the proceedings commenced; in the <hi rend="italic"> concilium</hi> the
                    will of the gods was not demanded, although listened to if communicated in a
                    thunder-storm or the like. (4) The resolution of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >comitia</hi> required to be confirmed by the “fathers”; while that of the <hi
                    rend="italic">concilium</hi> did not. (5) An enactment of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >comitia</hi> was a <hi rend="italic">lex,</hi> and bound the whole people; but
                    before the Hortensian law an enactment by the <hi rend="italic">concilium
                    plebis</hi> was in the ordinary case no more than a <hi rend="italic"
                    >plebiscitum,</hi> and of force only amongst the plebeians themselves. But there
                    was an exception when, because of some constitutional change proposed by it, the
                    senate had previously sanctioned the legislation, as in the case of the
                    Terentilian law, which paved the way for the XII. Tables, of the Canuleian law
                    authorizing the intermarriage of patricians and plebeians, of the Licinian laws
                    about the occupation of the public lands, &amp;c.; in such cases, although the
                    final vote was that of the <hi rend="italic">concilium,</hi> the enactment was
                    binding on the citizens generally, and was spoken of as a <hi rend="italic"
                    >lex</hi> rather than as a <hi rend="italic">plebiscitum.</hi> The latter name
                    seems practically to have been dropped after the Hortensian law had equalized
                    them so far as their effects were concerned. The greater part of the legislation
                    for amending the private law latterly fell to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >concilium,</hi> owing so far, perhaps, to the greater simplicity of its
                    procedure, but also to some extent to the fact that the praetors preferred
                    making their amendments tentatively by edicts (which were revocable), instead of
                    embodying them in statutes, which, as passed under divine <hi rend="italic"
                    >auspices</hi> and representing the divine will, could not easily be
                    repealed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The XII. Tables.—</hi> We have already shown the efforts made
                    by Servius Tullius to secure that the dispensation of justice should neither be
                    neglected nor left to caprice or haphazard, one rule to-day and another
                    to-morrow. With the consulate and the disregard of the “royal laws” and of
                    Servius’s instructions to the judges all this was changed. The consuls, with
                    their harassing military engagements, could have little time to devote to their
                    judicial functions or properly to instruct those to whom they delegated the duty
                    of investigating and adjudicating on the merits of a complaint; and the yearly
                    change of magistrates must itself have been a serious obstacle to uniformity
                    either of rule or practice so long as the law rested on nothing but unwritten
                    custom. One can well believe too, when feeling was so embittered between the
                    orders, that it was no rare thing for a consul to use his magisterial punitive
                    powers <hi rend="italic">(coercitio)</hi> with undue severity when a plebeian
                    was the object of them, or to turn a deaf ear to an appeal for justice addressed
                    to him from such a quarter. The state of matters had become so intolerable that
                    in the year 292 the demand was made by C. Terentilius Arsa, one of the tribunes,
                    that a commission should be appointed to define in writing the jurisdiction of
                    the magistrates, so that a check might be put on their arbitrary, highhanded,
                    and oppressive administration of what they were pleased to call the law. His
                    colleagues induced him for the moment not to press his demand, which he was
                    urging with a violence of invective that was unlikely to promote his object. But
                    next year they made common cause with him, requiring that the whole law, public
                    and private, should be codified, and its uncertainty thus as far as possible be
                    removed. After a few years’ resistance the senate was induced to give its assent
                    to a demand that in itself was too reasonable to be longer withstood.</p>
                <p>The first practical step towards its realization was the despatch of a mission to
                    Greece and the Greek settlements in southern Italy, to study their statute law
                    and collect any materials that might be of service in preparing the projected
                    code. On the return of the ambassadors in 302 all the magistracies were
                    suspended, and a commission of ten patricians <hi rend="italic">(decemviri
                    legibus scribundis)</hi> was appointed with consular powers, under the
                    presidency of Appius Claudius, for the express purpose of reducing the laws to
                    writing. Before the end of the ensuing year (303) the bulk of the code was
                    ready, and was at once passed into law by the comitia of the centuries, and
                    engraved or perhaps painted on ten tables of wood, which were exposed in the
                    Forum. Next year the decemvirate was renewed <pb break="no"

                    few months it had completed the supplemental matter, which was passed in due
                    form, and displayed on two other tables, thus bringing the number up to twelve
                    and giving the code its official name of <hi rend="italic">Lex XII.
                    Tabulamm.</hi></p>
                <p>There were provisions in them that were almost literal renderings from the
                    legislation of Solon; and others bore a remarkable correspondence to laws in
                    observance in Greece, but there is no authority for saying they were directly
                    borrowed. By far the greater proportion of them, however, were native and
                    original,—not that they amounted to a general formularization of the hitherto
                    floating customary law, for, notwithstanding Livy’s eulogium of them as the
                    “fountain of the whole law, both private and public,” it seems clear that many
                    branches of it were dealt with in the Tables only incidentally, or with
                    reference to some point of detail. The institutions of the family, the
                    fundamental rules of succession, the solemnities of such formal acts as
                    mancipation, ηexum, and testaments, the main features of the order of judicial
                    procedure, and so forth,—of all of these a general knowledge was presumed, and
                    the decemvirs thought it unnecessary to define them. What they had to do was to
                    make the law equal for all, to remove every chance of arbitrary dealing by
                    distinct specification of penalties and precise declaration of the circumstances
                    under which rights should be held to have arisen or been lost, and to make such
                    amendments as were necessary to meet the complaints of the plebeians and prevent
                    their oppression in the name of justice. Nothing of the customary law,
                    therefore, or next to nothing, was introduced into the Tables that was already
                    universally recognized, and not complained of as either unequal, indefinite,
                    defective, or oppressive. Only one or two of the laws ascribed to the kings
                    reappeared in them, and that in altered phraseology; yet the omission of the
                    rest did not mean their repeal or imply denial of their validity, for some of
                    them were still in force in the empire, and are founded on by Justinian in his
                    Digest. Neither were any of the laws of the republic anterior to the Tables
                    embodied in them, although for long afterwards many a man had to submit to
                    prosecution under them and to suffer the penalties they imposed. In saying,
                    therefore, that for the most part the provisions of the decemviral code were of
                    native origin, all that is meant is that they were the work of the decemvirs
                    themselves, operating upon the hitherto unwritten law in the directions already
                    indicated.</p>
                <p>The original Tables are said to have been destroyed when Rome was sacked and
                    burned by the Gauls. But they were at once reproduced, and transcripts of them
                    must have been abundant if, as Cicero says λvas still the case in his youth, the
                    children were required to commit them to memory as an ordinary school task. This
                    renders all the more extraordinary the fact that the remains of them are so
                    fragmentary and their genuineness in many cases so debatable. They were embodied
                    in the Tripertita of Sextus Aelius Paetus in the year 557; they must have formed
                    the basis of all the writings on the jus civile down to the time of Servius
                    Sulpicius Rufus (who first took the praetor’s edicts as a text); and they were
                    the subjects of monographs by a number of authors of distinction, amongst them
                    by M. Antistius Labeo in the early years of the empire and by Gaius probably in
                    the reign of Hadrian. Yet a couple of score or so are all that can be collected
                    of their provisions in what profess to be the ipsissima verba of the
                    Tables,—though in a form in most cases more modern than what we encounter in
                    other remains of archaic Latin. These are contained principally in the writings
                    of Cicero, the Noctes Attieae of A ulus Gellius, and the treatise De verborum
                    significations of Festus, the last two dealing with them rather as matters of
                    antiquarian curiosity than as rules of positive law. There are many allusions to
                    particular provisions in the pages of Cicero, Varro, Gellius, and the elder
                    Pliny, as well as in those of Gaius, Paul, Ulpian, and other ante-Justinianian
                    jurists; but these are not implicitly to be relied on, as we have evidence that
                    they frequently represent the (sometimes divergent) glosses of the interpreters
                    rather than the actual provisions of the statute. Reconstruction has therefore
                    been a work of difficulty, and the results far from satisfactory, that of the
                    latest editor, Voigt, departing very considerably from the versions generally
                    current during the last half century. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    literature of the subject from a philological point of view. His version has
                    been adopted substantially by Bruns in his Fontes juris romani antiqui, and by

                <p>In form the laws contained in the Tables were of remarkable brevity, terseness,
                    and pregnancy, with something of a rhythmical cadence that must have greatly
                    facilitated their retention in the memory. Here and there the rules they
                    embodied were potestative; but for the most part they were peremptory, running
                    on broad lines, surmounting instead of removing difficulties. Their application
                    might cause hardship in individual instances, as when a man was held to the
                    letter of what he had declared in a nexum or mancipation, even though he had
                    done so under error or influenced by fraudulent misrepresentations; the
                    decemvirs admitted no exceptions, preferring a hard-and-fast rule to any
                    qualifications that might cause uncertainty. The system as a whole is one of jus
                    as distinguished from fas. In the royal laws execration {saeratio capitis, sacer
                    esto) was not an uncommon sanction; but in the Tables it occurs only once pure
                    and simple, and that with reference to an offence that could be committed only
                    by a patrician,—material loss caused by a patron to his client (patrmιus, si
                    clienti fraudem, faxsit, sacer esto). In all other cases the idea that a crime
                    was an offence against public order, for which the community was entitled in
                    self-protection to inflict punishment on the criminal, is as prominent as the
                    older one that it was a sin against the gods, to be expiated by dedication of
                    the sinner to the divinity more especially outraged by his offence. Hanging and
                    beheading, flogging to death, burning at the stake, throwing from the Tarpeian
                    rock,— such are the secular penalties that are met with in the Tables; but
                    often, though not invariably, the hanging and so forth is at the same time
                    declared a tribute to some deity to whom the goods of the criminal are forfeited
                    tponseerαtio bononιm).</p>
                <p>It is not unworthy of notice that traces remained in the Tables of the old system
                    of self-help. The rnanus injeetio of the third Table—the execution done by a
                    creditor against his debtor—was essentially the same procedure as under the
                    kings, but with the addition of some regulations intended to prevent its abuse.
                    Against a thief taken in the act something of the same sort seems still to have
                    been sanctioned; while it was still lawful to kill him on the spot if the theft
                    was nocturnal, or even when it was committed during the day if he used arms in
                    resisting his apprehension. According to Cicero there was a provision in these
                    words—“si telum manu fugit magis quant jecit, arietem subicito”; this is just a
                    re-enactment in illustrative language of the law attributed to Numa, that for
                    homicide by misadventure—“if the weapon have sped from the hand rather than been
                    aimed”—a ram was to be tendered as a peace-offering to the kinsmen of him who
                    had been slain. The original purpose must have been to stay the blood revenge,
                    and it may even have been so with Numa; but in the Tables it can only have been
                    intended to stay the prosecution which it was incumbent on the kinsmen of a
                    murdered man to institute. So with talionic penalties: “si membrum rupit,ni cum
                    eo pacit, talio esto”—such, according to Gellius, were the words of one of the
                    laws of the Tables, and they undoubtedly contain a reminiscence of a time when
                    talion was recognized, “an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth”; but in the
                    mouths of the decemvirs they were nothidg more than a clumsy mode of enabling an
                    injured man to exact the greatest money recompense he could, and to have it
                    measured according to the position and fortune of the individual who had done
                    him injury.</p>
                <p>The structure of the provisions of the Tables was not such as to enable the plain
                    citizen to apply them to concrete cases, or know how to claim the benefit of
                    them in the tribunals, without some sort of professional advice. Pomponius
                    states that no sooner was the decemviral legislation published than the
                    necessity was felt for its interpretation, and for the preparation by skilled
                    hands of styles of actions by which its provisions might be made effectual. Both
                    of these duties fell to the pontiffs as the oιdy persons who, in the state of
                    civilization of the period, were well qualified to give the assistance required;
                    and Pomponius adds that the college annually appointed one of its members to be
                    the adviser of private parties and of thejwe‰es in those matters. The
                    interprétatif, commenced by the pontiffs and continued by the jurists during the
                    republic, which, Pomponius says, was regarded as part of the civile, was not
                    confined to explanation of the words of the statute, but was in some cases their
                    expansion, in others their limitation, and in many the deduction of new
                    doctrines from the actual jus scrip-turn, and their development and exposition.
                    An event that did much to diminish the influence of the pontiffs in connexion
                    with it was the divulgement in the year 450 by Cn. Flavius, secretary of Appius
                    Claudius Caecus, and probably at his instigation, of a formulary of actions and
                    a calendar of lawful and unlawful days, which got the name of J <hi

                    afterwards, which introduced a new form of process for actions of debt and

                    process they were five in number, each taking its name from its characteristic

                    capionem.</hi> The third was unknown in the decemviral period, and was
                    introduced by the Silian law alluded to in last paragraph. The other four were
                    all more or less regulated by the XII. Tables, but must in some form have been
                    anterior to them. It is utterly impossible, however, to say of any one of them
                    at what time it was introduced, or what was the statute (Zez) by which it was
                    sanctioned; it may well be that they were not of statutory introduction at all,
                    but were called <hi rend="italic">legis actiones</hi> simply because recognized
                    and indirectly confirmed by the Tables. In character and purpose they were very
                    different. The first three were directly employed for determining a question of
                    right or liability, which, if persistently disputed, inevitably resulted in a
                    judicial inquiry. The fourth and fifth might possibly result in judicial
                    intervention; but primarily they were proceedings in execution, in which the
                    party moving in them worked out his own remedy. As regards their comparative
                    antiquity there is much to be said for the opinion of Ihering and Bekker that
                    <hi rend="italic">manus injectio,</hi> as essentially nothing more than
                    regulated self-help, must have been the earliest of the five, and that the <hi
                    rend="italic">legis actio Sacramento</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">judicis
                    postulatio</hi> must have been introduced in aid of it, and to prevent too hasty
                    resort to it where there was room for doubt upon question either of fact or
                    law.</p>
                <p>In the three judicial legis actiones the first step was the in jus voeatio or
                    procedure for bringing the respondent into court, minutely regulated by the
                    provisions of the first of the XΠ. Tables. This duty was not committed to any
                    officers of the law; there was no writ of summons of any sort; the party moving
                    in the contemplated litigation had himself to do what was needed. Once before
                    the magistrate (consul or praetor), the plaintiff stated his contention. If
                    admitted unqualifiedly by the defendant, the magistrate at once pronounced his
                    decree, leaving the plaintifi' to work out his remedy as the law prescribed.
                    But, if the case presented was met either with a denial or a qualified defence,
                    and appeared to the magistrate to be one proper for trial, he remitted it for
                    that purpose either to the centumviral tribunal or to one or more private
                    citizens as judges or arbiters. The act of remit was technically litis
                    coentestatio or ordinatio judixvi, the first so named because originally the
                    parties called upon those present to be witnesses to the issue that was being
                    sent for trial. This was the ordinary practice under both the system of the
                    legis actiones and that of the formulae, and prevailed until the time of
                    Diocletian. In the first stage the proceedings were said to be in jure, and the
                    duties of the magistrate in reference to them made up his jurisdictiο; in the
                    second they were said to be in judirio, those presiding in it being styled
                    judixes. All that the judge or judges had to do was to pass judgment on the
                    question remitted to them. They were “right-declarers” only, not
                    “right-enforcers.” If their judgment was for the plaintiff, and he failed to
                    obtain an amicable settlement, he had himself to make it operative by subsequent
                    proceedings by manus injeetio, and that under the eye of the magistrate, not of
                    the judge.</p>
                <p>From an enumeration in Cicero of a variety of causes proper to the centumviral
                    court the conclusion seems warranted that it was its peculiar province to decide
                    questions of quiritary right in the strictest acceptation of the word. They were
                    all apparently real actions ipindicationes'),—claims of property in land or of
                    servitudes over it, of right as heir under a testament or in opposition to it,
                    of rights of tutory and succession ab intestalo as agnate or gentile, and so
                    forth. In all these it was a numerous court of Quirites, advised in the early
                    republic by a pontiff, that determined by its vote the question of quiritary
                    right submitted to it. Many such questions in course of time, and possibly at
                    first of express consent of parties, came to be referred to a single judge; but
                    some, and notably claims of inheritance under or in opposition to a testament,
                    were still remitted to the centumviral court in the classical period. Personal
                    actions, however, do not appear ever to have fallen within its cognizance: they
                    were usually sent to a single judge—a private citizen —selected by the parties,
                    but appointed by the magistrate, and to whom the latter administered an oath of
                    office. But, in a few cases in which an action involved not so much a disputed
                    question of right as the exercise of skill and discretion in determining the
                    nature and extent of a right that in the abstract was not denied, the remit was
                    to a plurality of private judges or arbiters, usually three.</p>

                    characteristic feature of this <hi rend="italic">legis actio,</hi> as described
                    by Gaius, was that the parties, after a somewhat dramatic performance before the
                    consul or praetor, each challenged the other to stake a certain sum, the amount
                    of which was fixed by the Tables, and which was to abide the issue of the
                    inquiry by the court or judge to whom the cause was eventually remitted. This
                    stake Gaius refers to indifferently as <hi rend="italic"> sacramentum, summa
                    sacramenti,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">poena sacramenti.</hi> The formal
                    question the court had to determine was,—whose stake had been justified, whose
                    not <hi rend="italic">(cujus sacramentum justum, cujus injustum)</hi>; the first
                    was returned to the staker, the second forfeited originally to sacred and
                    afterwards to public uses. But the decision on this formal question necessarily
                    involved a judgment on the matter actually in dispute, and, if it was for the
                    plaintiff, entitled him, failing an amicable arrangement, to take ulterior steps
                    for making it effectual. The procedure was still employed in the time of Gaius
                    in the few cases <pb break="no"

                    court, but otherwise it had been long in disuse.</p>
                <p>Gaius explains that it was resorted to both in real and personal actions.
                    Unfortunately the MS. of his <hi rend="italic">Institutes</hi> is defective in
                    the passage in which he described its application to the latter. We possess the
                    greater part of his account of the <hi rend="italic">actio in rem</hi> as
                    employed to raise and determine a question of ownership; but his illustration is
                    of vindication of a slave, and not so interesting or instructive as the
                    proceedings for vindication of land. These, however, can be reconstructed with
                    tolerable certainty with the aid derived from Cicero, Varro, and Gellius.</p>
                <p>The parties appeared before the magistrate, each armed with a rod (fiestuca)
                    representing his spear {quir or hαsta), the symbol, as Gaius says, of
                    quiritarian ownership. The first word was spoken by the raiser of the action,
                    and addressed to his opponent: “I say that the land in question [describing it
                    sufficiently for identification] is mine in quiritary right {meumesse ex jure
                    quiritium); wherefore I require you to go there and join issue with me in
                    presence of the magistrate {injure maηum eonserere}C Thereupon, according to the
                    earliest practice, the magistrate and the parties, accompanied by their friends
                    and backers, proceeded to the ground for the purpose: the court was transferred
                    from the forum to the land itself. As distances increased, however, and the
                    engagements of the consuls multiplied, this became inconvenient. Instead of it,
                    this course was adopted: the parties went to the spot without the magistrate,
                    but on his command, and there joined issue in the presence of their seconds, who
                    had been ordered to accompany them, and who probably made a report of the due
                    observance of formalities on their return. Still later the procedure was further
                    simplified by having a turf brought from the place beforehand— probably as time
                    advanced there would be no very particular inquiry as to where it had been
                    obtained—and deposited a few yards from the magistrate’s chair; and, when he
                    ordered the parties to go to the ground and join issue, they merely brought
                    forward the turf and set it before him, and proceeded to make their formal
                    vindications upon it, as representing the whole land in dispute.</p>
                <p>The ritual was as follows. The raiser of the action, addressing his adversary,
                    again affirmed his ownership, but this time with the significant addition—“As I
                    have asserted my right by word of mouth, look you, so do I now with my
                    viηdicta"∙, and therewith he touched the turf with his rod, which was called
                    vindieta when employed for this purpose. The magistrate then asked the other
                    party whether he meant to counter-vindicate. If he replied in the negative or
                    made no response, there was instant decree {addictw) in favour of the first
                    party, and the proceedings were at an end. If, however, he counter-vindicated,
                    it was by repeating the same words and re-enacting the same play as his
                    adversary :—“I say that the land is mine in quiritary right, and I too lay my
                    vindieta upon it” The verbal and symbolical vindication and counter-vindication
                    completed what was technically the manus consertio. The parties were now in this
                    position: each had asserted his ownership, and had figuratively had recourse to
                    arms in maintenance of his contention. But the matter was to be settled
                    judicially, so the magistrate once more intervened and ordered both to withdraw
                    from the land. The dialogue was then resumed, the vindicant demanding to know
                    from his opponent upon what pretence {eausa) he had counter-vindicated. In the
                    illustration in Gaius he avoided the question and pleaded the general issue, —“I
                    have done as is my right in laying my vindieta on the land.” But there can be
                    little doubt that in certain circumstances the counter-vindicant would deem it
                    expedient to disclose his title. This was very necessary where he attributed his
                    right to a conveyance upon which two years’ possession had not yet followed; in
                    such a case he had to name his author {auctοrem laudare) if he desired to
                    preserve recourse against the latter on the warranty implied in the mancipation.
                    That probably entailed a suspension of the proceedings to allow of the author’s
                    citation for his interest; and on their resumption, if he appeared and admitted
                    his auctοritae, he was formally made a party to the action.</p>
                <p>The proceedings had now reached the sacramental stage proper. The first challenge
                    came from the vindicant,—“Since you have vindicated unrightfully, I challenge
                    you with a sacrament of 500 assesto which the counter-vindicant responded,—“And
                    I you.” This was technically the Sacramento provocatio. The magistrate thereupon
                    remitted the matter for trial to the centumviral court, or possibly, in certain
                    cases, to a single judge, and in the presence of witnesses called by the parties
                    {litie cοntestαtiο) declared what exactly was the question put in issue which
                    the court or judge was to decide. At the same time, according to Gaius’s account
                    of the procedure, he required sureties from the parties for the eventual payment
                    by him who was unsuccessful of the sacrament he had offered to stake, and which
                    became a forfeit to the exchequer. (The original practice was for the stake to
                    be deposited by both parties in the hands of the pontiffs before they were heard
                    by the cen-tumviral court; after judgment that of the gainer was reclaimed by
                    him, while that of the loser was retained for religious uses.) The magistrate
                    also made arrangements for the interim possession of the land by one or other of
                    the litigants, taking security from him that, if he was eventually unsuccessful,
                    it should be returned to his opponent, along with all the fruits and profits
                    drawn in the interval. At the trial, as both parties were vindicants, there must
                    have been a certain burden of proof upon both sides. The vindicant, one may
                    believe, must have been required to establish in the first instance that the
                    thing he claimed had at some time been his; and then, but probably not till
                    then, the counter-vindicant would have to prove a later title in his person
                    sufficient to exclude that of his opponent. The judgment, as already observed,
                    necessarily involved a finding on the main question; but in form it was a
                    declaration as to the sacrament: that of the party who prevailed was declared to
                    be just, and that of his unsuccessful opponent unjust.</p>
                <p>Looking at this ritual as a whole the conviction is irresistible that it could
                    not have been so devised by one brain. It reveals and combines three distinct
                    stages in the history of procedure,— appeal to arms and self-help, appeal to the
                    gods and the spiritual power, appeal to the civil magistrate and his judicial
                    office. As Gellius says, the real and substantial fight for might, that in olden
                    days had been maintained at the point of the spear, had given place to a civil
                    and festucarian combat in which words were the weapons, and which was to be
                    settled by the interposition of the praetor. But this does not explain the
                    sacrarneηtum. Very various theories have been proposed to account for it.
                    According to Gaius, it was nothing more than the sum of money staked by each of
                    the parties, which was forfeited originally to sacred and afterwards to public
                    uses by him who was unsuccessful, as a penalty for his rashly running into
                    litigation; and substantially the same explanation is given by Festus in one of
                    his definitions of the word. But this is far from satisfactory; for it involves
                    the absurdity of declaring that a penalty imposed by law could be unjust
                    {iηjustιιm) in any case, and the still greater absurdity of declaring it just in
                    the case of the party who was in the right, and unjust in the case of him who
                    was in the wrong. There is another definition in Festus—“a thing is said to be
                    done Sacramento when the sanction of an oath is interposed ”—which lends support
                    to the opinion that there was a time when parties to a question of right were
                    required to take an oath to the verity of their respective assertions; that they
                    were also required concurrently to deposit five bullocks or five sheep,
                    according to the nature or value of the thing in dispute, to abide the issue of
                    the inquiry; <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It was the
                    Lex Aternia Tarpeia of the year 300 u.c. that commuted the five bullocks and
                    five sheep into 500 and 50 lb of copper respectively (Cic., De Rep., ii. 35, §
                    60, where the words usually printed “de multae Sacramento” should read “de multa
                    et Sacramento”); Fest., s.v. “Peculatus” ( Bruns, Font es, p. 279). For the
                    pounds’weight of raw metal the XII. Tables substituted the same number of asses,
                    declaring that 500 should be the summa sacrarnenti when the cause of action was
                    worth 1000 asses or more, 50 when worth less or the question one of freedom or
                    slavery (Gai., iv. 14). </p></note> that the question for determination was
                    whose oath was just and whose unjust; and that he who was found to have sworn
                    unjustly forfeited his cattle or sheep as a piamentum—a peace-offering to the
                    outraged deity— while the other party reclaimed his from the repository in which
                    they had been detained in the interval. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Varro, De L. L., v. 180 (Bruns, p. 303), says that, even
                    after the summa sacrarnenti had been converted into money, it was deposited ad
                    pontem,—some bridge, he does not say which, where there was a sacred “pound.”
                    (Curiously enough, the Irish spelling of “pound” is “pont Skeat’s Etym. Diet.,
                    s.v. “Pound.”) A most ingenious and plausible explanation was suggested by Danz
                    in 1867, in the Zeitsehr. f Reehtsgesch., vol. vi. p. 359. Recalling the facts
                    that there had been discovered in the Tiber Island saeella of Jupiter Jurarius
                    and Dius Fidius, the two deities to whom solemn oaths were usually addressed,
                    and that the island was spoken of as “inter duos pontes,” because connected with
                    both banks of the river by bridges bearing no particular names, he suggested
                    that the island may have been the place to which disputants resorted to make
                    their sacramentel, and that the cattle, sheep, or money were deposited in a
                    place for the purpose before the bridge was crossed. Much the same explanation
                    was offered by Huschke two years later in his book Das alte römische Jahr
                    (Breslau, 1869), p. 360, apparently without being aware of Danz’s speculation.
                    He adds, on the authority of the Iguvine Tables, that, while bullocks were
                    offered to Jupiter, only sheep were offered to Dius Fidius. The island, he
                    thinks, must have been selected as neutral ground to which all parties might
                    have access, and which obviated intrusion into the temples of the two gods on
                    the Capitol and Quirinal respectively. And it is to its use as the scene of the
                    sacramental procedure that he attributes its name of “holy island,” rather than
                    to the fact of its having been the seat of the temple of Aesculapius. Huschke
                    recurs to and enforces this view in his Mιdta und Saerαmeηtum (1874), p. 410,
                    where he does refer to Danz’s paper. </p></note></p>

                <p>The writers who adopt this view are far from being unanimous as to details. But
                    there seems to be enough to render it more than probable that, at an
                    intermediate stage between the vera solida vis of ancient times and the vis
                    civilis et festucaria which Gellius and Gaius depict, there was a procedure by
                    appeal to the gods through means of oaths of verity sworn by the parties, in the
                    manner and with the consequences that have been indicated. That in time it
                    should have dropped out of the ritual is quite in the order of things. Its
                    tendency was to become a mere form, imposing no real restraint on reckless
                    litigation. The restraint was rather in the dread of forfeiture of the
                    sacramental cattle, sheep, or money that would follow a verdict that an oath had
                    been unjust. And it must have been felt besides that it was unfair to brand a
                    man as a false-swearer, needing to expiate his offence by an offering to the
                    gods, whose oath had been perfectly honest. That he should suffer a penalty for
                    his imprudence in not having taken more care to ascertain his position, and for
                    thus causing needless annoyance to others, was reasonable, but did not justify
                    his being dealt with as one who had knowingly outraged the deity to whom he had
                    appealed. So the oath — the original sacramentum—disappeared, the name passing
                    by a natural enough process to the money which had been wont to be deposited
                    before the oath was sworn, but which now ceased to be an offering in expiation
                    by a false-swearer, and became a mere penalty of rash litigation (poena temere
                    litigantis).</p>
                <p>It may be assumed that in most cases the finding of the cen-tumvirs as to the
                    justness or unjustness of the respective sacraments of the parties was the end
                    of the case,—that it was at once accepted and loyally given effect to. Festus,
                    however, preserves a law of the XII. Tables which, according to Mommsen’s
                    rendering, declared that, when it turned out that interim possession had been
                    awarded to the wrong party, it was to be in the latter’s power to demand the
                    appointment of three arbiters who should ascertain the value of the object of
                    vindication and its fruits, and assess the damages due for non-restitution at
                    double the amount. This provision seems to have been intended to afford the
                    wrongful interim possessor, who was not in a position to make specific
                    restitution to his successful opponent, a means of avoiding the apprehension and
                    imprisonment which were the statutory consequences of failure to implement a
                    judgment. It is probable that in time this duplicated money payment came to be
                    regarded as the satisfaction to which the successful party in a vindication was
                    entitled in every case in which, no matter for what reason, he was unable to
                    obtain the thing itself and its fruits from their interim possessor; that
                    consequently an arbitrium litis aestimandae, or reference to arbiters to assess
                    their value, resulted in every such case; and that it was to assure its payment
                    that the praetor required the party to whom the interim possession was awarded
                    to give to his opponent the sureties (precedes litis et vindiciarum) to whom
                    Gaius alludes.</p>
                <p>After this explanation of the procedure in the sacramental action for vindication
                    of land it is unnecessary to enter into any detail of what was done when it was
                    a movable that was being vindicated, or when the action was a personal one for
                    payment of money. The real action about a movable was of course simpler than
                    that described; for the thing was always in prαesentia. As regards personal
                    actions, the ordinarily received opinion, which rests, however, on slender
                    foundations, is that from the first the parties met on equal terms; that, if it
                    was a case of money debt, the creditor commenced the proceedings with the
                    averment that the defendant owed him the sum in question,—“I say that you ought
                    to pay me (dare oportere) 1000 asses”; that this was met with a denial; and that
                    a sacramental challenge followed on either side. All are agreed that the remit
                    was to a single judex after an interval of thirty days from the proceedings in
                    jure; that where the claim was for a definite sum the plaintiff had to establish
                    his case to the letter; and that his sacrament was necessarily declared unjust
                    if he failed to prove his claim by a single penny. But there is considerable
                    diversity of opinion as to whether by this form of process a claim of uncertain
                    amount could be insisted on,—as, for example, for damages for breach of a
                    warranty of acreage of lands sold, or of their freedom from burdens. If it
                    could, then probably the question raised and dealt with Sacramento was the
                    abstract one of liability,—Was the warranty given, and has it failed? the sum
                    due in respect of the breach being left to be dealt with in a subsequent
                    arbitral process (arbitrium litis aestimandae').</p>

                    There is little elsewhere that can with any certainty be said to bear upon it.
                    The most important is a note in Valerius Probus— <hi rend="italic">T.PRH.A. V.P.
                    V.D.,</hi> which is generally interpreted— <hi rend="italic">te, praetor,
                    judicem arbi-trumve postulo uti des.</hi> This petition to the magistrate —king,
                    consul, praetor—to appoint a judge, arbiter, or arbiters (as the case might be)
                    in all probability was part of the procedure in the action, and that from which
                    it derived its distinctive name. Beyond this all is conjecture, alike as to the
                    nature and form of the action and the cases to which it was applicable. Gaius
                    says of the <hi rend="italic">legis actio Sacramento</hi> that it was general,
                    and that it was the procedure that was to be resorted to where no other was
                    prescribed by statute. The extant fragments of the XII. Tables contain no such
                    indications as this would lead us to expect; there is not a hint in them of an
                    express instruction that proceedings in any particular case were to be <hi
                    rend="italic">per judicis postulationem.</hi></p>
                <p>While it is impossible with certainty to trace the history of this procedure to
                    its first beginnings, yet the impression is general that it must have originated
                    in the regal period. There were three different positions in which an appeal for
                    aid might be made to a court of justice,—(1) when it was a question of civil
                    right that had to be decided in terms directly affirmative or directly negative
                    of the contention of the raiser of the action, and one in which questions of
                    both law and fact were involved; (2) when it was only a question of fact that
                    had to be ascertained,—the legal result of the fact, if established, being known
                    beforehand; (3) when facts had to be set against facts, and a result arrived at
                    that in the judgment of those who had to balance them was fair and reasonable in
                    the circumstances. In the first case, as when the contention was meum esse or
                    dari oportere (otherwise than under an obligationary nexum), the procedure was
                    sαcramento and the reference originally (in all probability) to the pontiffs,
                    although afterwards to the centumviral court or to a judex; in the second, as
                    when the question was—had or had not the defendant assaulted the plaintiff, and
                    so incurred the invariable statutory penalty, the reference was probably to a
                    judex without the intervention of a sacrament; in the third, as when the matter
                    in hand was the partitioning of an inheritance amongst co-heirs, or the
                    determining whether operations of the defendant were interfering with the
                    natural drainage of the plaintiff’s land and how the mischief was to be abated,
                    or the assessment of damages for injury to property, or of the sum sufficient to
                    relieve from talion or the statutory penalty of theft, the reference was to an
                    arbiter or arbiters. In the procedure Sacramento the pleadings opened directly
                    with an averment of right—“I say that this is mine,” “I say that the defendant
                    is bound to pay me so much”; but in that per judicis arbitrive postulatio there
                    is reason to surmise that they commenced with an averment of fact, followed by
                    the resulting demand of the plaintiff. The details, however, are quite
                    uncertain, with the exception that in some arbitria the plaintiff expressly
                    threw himself upon the discretion of the arbiters—quantum aeqius melius est ob
                    cam rem mihi dari.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Legis Actio per Condictioηem.—</hi> This the youngest
                    “action of the law” was introduced, Gaius says, by the Silian law as a means of
                    recovering a liquid money debt <hi rend="italic">lperta pecunia),</hi> and
                    afterwards made available by the Cal-purnian law for enforcing personal claims
                    (as distinguished from real rights) for anything else definite and certain <hi
                    rend="italic"> (pmηis res certa),</hi> and in both its forms, therefore,
                    essentially an action of debt. The date of both enactments is matter of
                    controversy, although there is no question that the Silian was the earlier.
                    Gaius says of it that its purpose was far from obvious, as there was no
                    difficulty in recovering money either by a sacramental action or one <hi
                    rend="italic"> per judicis postulationem.</hi> He overlooks the fact that money
                    due under a πexal contract was recoverable by neither of these processes, but by
                    the much more summary one of <hi rend="italic">manus injectio.</hi> By the
                    Poetilian law of 428 this was declared unlawful. We are disposed to regard the
                    <hi rend="italic">Lex Silia</hi> and the new procedure it authorized as a result
                    of the change. To have put off a creditor for money lent either with a
                    sacramental action or one <hi rend="italic">per judicis postulationem</hi> would
                    have been to deprive him of the advantages of <hi rend="italic">manus
                    injectio</hi> to a greater extent than was called for. So it was provided by the
                    Silian law that, when a man disputed his liability for what was called <hi
                    rend="italic">pecunia certa crédita,</hi> and forced his creditor to litigation,
                    not only was the defendant bound in the first place either to deny his <pb

                    claimed; but if he did deny it the plaintiff was entitled to require from him an
                    engagement to pay one-third more by way of penalty in the event of judgment
                    being against him, while the <hi rend="italic"> sσi-disant</hi> creditor had to
                    give an engagement to pay as penalty the same amount in case of judgment in
                    favour of the alleged debtor. These engagements <hi rend="italic">(sponsio et
                    resti-ρulatiο tertiae partis)</hi> were not allowed in every case in which a
                    definite sum of money was claimed <hi rend="italic">per condic-tioηem,</hi> but
                    only when it was technically <hi rend="italic">pecunia crédita.</hi> In Cicero’s
                    time <hi rend="italic"> creditum</hi> might arise either from loan, stipulation,
                    or literal contract <hi rend="italic">(expensilatio)</hi>; but the last dated at
                    soonest from the beginning of the 6th century, and stipulation apparently was a
                    result of the Silian law itself, so that the <hi rend="italic">pecunia
                    crédita</hi> of this enactment can have referred only to borrowed money. The
                    same phrase, according to Livy, was employed in the Poetilian law; it was
                    thereby enacted, he says, that for <hi rend="italic">pecunia crédita</hi> the
                    goods, not the body of the debtor, ought to be taken in execution. A connexion,
                    therefore, between the Poetilian law and the abolition of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >nexum</hi> on the one hand, and the Silian law and the introduction of the <hi
                    rend="italic">legis actio per condictionem</hi> on the other, can hardly be
                    ignored, and raises more than a probability that the latter statute was a
                    consequence of the former, and must have been passed immediately or soon after
                    the year 428. In the action for a money debt that was not technically <hi
                    rend="italic"> pecunia crédita,</hi> and in the action on the Calpurnian law, it
                    is probable that the defendant could be required to negative the claim under
                    oath <hi rend="italic">(jusjurandum in jure delatuιn)</hi> on pain of being held
                    as confessed; but there was no penalty of a third part on either side.</p>

                    the loss of a leaf in the Verona MS., we are without part of Gaius’s account of
                    it. It got its distinctive name, he says, from the condictio or requisition made
                    by the plaintiff on the defendant, whom he had brought into court in the usual
                    way, to attend again on the expiry of thirty days to have a judge appointed. It
                    was probably only on the reappearance of the parties, and after the defendant
                    had had time for looking into the facts, that the latter could be required to
                    make oath as to his defence of non-indebtedness. In the action for pecunia
                    credita it would be then also, and after the oath, if demanded, had been given,
                    that the sponsw et restipulatio tertiae partis were exchanged; and it is
                    probable that, if either party refused on the praetor’s command so to oblige
                    himself towards the other, judgment was at once pronounced in favour of the
                    latter without any remit to a judex. How the issue was adjusted when the
                    sponsion and restipulation were duly given we are not informed; but, judging by
                    analogy from the procedure in an action for breach of interdict under the
                    formulai· system, and on the broader ground that there must have been machinery
                    for a condemnation of the plaintiff on his restipulation in the event of his
                    being found in the wrong, it may reasonably be concluded that there were in fact
                    three concurrent issues sent to the same judex,—the first on the main question,
                    the second on the defendant’s sponsion, and the third on the plaintiff’s
                    restipulation. When a sum of money other than pecunia credita or a thing or
                    quantity of things other than money was sued for, those subsidiary issues were
                    unnecessary, as there was neither sponsion nor restipulation.</p>
                <p>As Baron has demonstrated, it was not the usual practice to introduce any words
                    explanatory of the ground of indebtedness when the action was either for money
                    (other than pecunia crédita} or for a thing or quantity of things. It might be
                    loan, or bequest, or sale, or purchase, or delict, or unjustifiable enrichment,
                    or any of a hundred causae; it would have to be condescended on of course before
                    the judge; but in the initial stage before the praetor and in the issue all that
                    was necessary was the averment that the defendant was owing such a sum of money
                    or such a thing. It was for the judge to determine whether or not the averment
                    was established and, in certain cases, that non-delivery was due to the fault of
                    the defendant; the plaintiff, however, was bound to make his averment good to
                    the letter of his claim. In the event of the plaintiff being successful in an
                    action for certapecunia, but delay was made by the defendant in satisfying the
                    judgment, execution followed in ordinary form. How the matter was arranged in an
                    action on the Calpurnian law for a certa res is not so obvious. What the
                    plaintiff wanted was specific delivery or damages, and by some the opinion is
                    entertained that he formulated his claim alternatively. Of this there is no
                    evidence; and Gaius’s statement that under the system of the legis actiones
                    condemnation was always in the ipsa res, ix., the specific thing sued for, leads
                    to the assumption that a judgment for the plaintiff, on which specific implement
                    failed, must have been followed by an arbitrium litis acstimarulae for
                    assessment of the damages in money, and that execution proceeded thereon as if
                    the judgment had been for a sum of money in the first instance. The general
                    opinion, however, is that the judge to whom the issue was remitted assessed the
                    damages himself and as a matter of course,—that the instruction to him was

                    of execution against the body of a judgment-debtor or one who had confessed
                    liability in the first stage of a process. But, in certain cases in which it was
                    thought proper that a creditor should have a more summary remedy than was

                    party on his behalf, for a stay of execution. It will simplify matters, however,
                    to confine our attention to it in the meantime as a means of execution against

                <p>Gaius’s description of it is very general; for details we are indebted
                    principally to the <hi rend="italic">Noctes Attiras</hi> of Aulus Gellius, in an
                    account which he gives (put into the mouth of Sext. Caecilius Africanus, a

                    own) of the provisions of the XII. Tables in reference to it. Africanus is made
                    to say that according to his belief <hi rend="italic">(opinor)</hi> the words of
                    the statute were these :—“For admitted money debts and in causes that have been
                    regularly determined by judgment <hi rend="italic">(aeris confessi rebusque jure
                    judicatis)</hi> there shall be thirty days’ grace. After that there may be <hi
                    rend="italic">mamus iηjectio.</hi> The apprehending creditor shall then bring
                    his debtor before the magistrate. If he still fail to satisfy the judgment, and
                    no <hi rend="italic">vindex</hi> come forward to relieve him, his creditor may
                    carry him home and put him in chains. He may live at his own cost; if not, his
                    creditor must give him daily a pound of spelt, or more if he please.” Africanus
                    continues <hi rend="italic">narrative:</hi> “There was still room for the
                    parties to come to terms; but, if they did not, the debtor was kept in chains
                    for sixty days. Towards the end of that time he was brought before the praetor
                    in the comitium on three consecutive market-days, and the amount of the
                    judgment-debt proclaimed. After the third <hi rend="italic">capite poenas

                    penalty, sanctioned in the hope of deterring men from unfaithfulness to their
                    engagements, was one to be dreaded because of its atrocity and of the new
                    terrors with which the decemvirs thought proper to invest it. For, if it was to
                    more creditors than one that the debtor had been adjudged, they might, if they
                    pleased, cut up and divide his body. Here are the words <pb break="no"

                    Si plus minusve secuerunt, se fraude esto.’”</p>
                <p>Such is Gellius’s account of the provisions of the XII. Tables in reference to
                    this legis actio. But it is to be borne in mind that he does not vouch for its
                    accuracy; the Tables were already in his time matter of antiquity, and even the
                    jurists knew nothing of them beyond what was still in observance. That he has
                    reproduced them only partially seems almost beyond question; for in another
                    chapter he himself quotes a couple of sentences that are to all appearance from
                    the same context. We have to face, therefore, the extreme probability that the
                    record is incomplete and the possibility besides that it is not literally
                    accurate. There is room for error, consequently, in two directions; but the
                    nature and effect of the procedure in its main features may be gathered from the
                    texts as they stand with reasonable certainty.</p>
                <p>It was competent only after thirty days from the date of judgment or confession.
                    It was apprehension of the debtor by the creditor himself,—in its first stage,
                    at least, an act of pure self-help. The debtor had at once to be brought before
                    the magistrate, in order that his creditor might obtain authority to carry him
                    away and provisionally confine him in the domestic lock-up. Such a course,
                    however, was avoided either (1) by instant payment or other implement of the
                    judgment, or (2) by the intervention of a vindex or champion. The position taken
                    by the latter was not exactly that either of a surety or of an attorney for the
                    judieatus demanding a rehearing of the case: he appeared rather as a
                    con-troverter in his own name of the right of the creditor to proceed further
                    with his execution, on the ground that the judgment was invalid. This
                    necessitated an action between the υiηdex and the creditor, in which the former
                    was plaintiff, but to which the debtor was not a party. If it failed, then the
                    vindex was liable for double the amount of the original debt, as a penalty on
                    him for having improperly interfered with the course of justice; but on payment
                    he had relief against the original debtor who had been liberated through his
                    intervention. Failing a vindex and failing payment, the creditor took his debtor
                    home and incarcerated him, dealing with him for sixty days in the manner above
                    described. On their expiry, without any arrangement, there was a magisterial
                    decree {αeldictio') awarding the debtor to his creditor.</p>
                <p>What right did this addietio confer upon the creditor? The debtor, says Gellius,
                    “capite poenas dabat,” which he interprets as meaning that his creditor might
                    put him to death, the alternative being his sale as a slave beyond the Roman
                    frontier. According to this view a man sentenced to twenty-five asses for a
                    petty assault, which he could not pay, might have to suffer death instead.
                    Manifest theft was considered a greater offence, or at least to merit a heavier
                    punishment, than non-manifest,—slavery for the former, a pecuniary penalty for
                    the latter; but, if it had been the case that every judieatus who failed within
                    three months to satisfy his creditor might be put to death, then the
                    non-manifest thief against whom a judgment had been obtained must often in the
                    end have suffered a penalty more serious than that which overtook him whose
                    theft had been manifest,—slavery for the graver offence, death for the lighter.
                    Capite poenas dabat, therefore, cannot have meant death. But it is just as
                    impossible that it can have meant slavery. And there is abundant evidence that
                    the addirdus, even after the completion of his two months of provisional
                    detention, was still de jure free,—that he was not capite minutus even as
                    regarded citizenship or family rights, and that any property he had still
                    remained his own. The only other explanation is that “he paid the penalty with
                    his person,” in contradistinction to “his means.” Caρτd is used in opposition to
                    bona. Under the law of the Tables, when the manus injectio was at the instance
                    of one creditor only, the extent of the latter’s right was to detain his debtor
                    in free bondage, making what use he could of his services, and exercising
                    discipline over him as if he were a slave. But for the mistaken notion that a
                    creditor was entitled after the expiry of the three months to put his debtor to
                    death—of which there is not a single instance on record—it is unlikely that any
                    one would have thought of imputing to the partis secanto such an inhuman meaning
                    as that a plurality of creditors might cut the body of their addictτcs in pieces
                    and each take a share.</p>
                <p>The opinion is entertained by many jurists that the partis secanto of the Tables
                    referred not to the body but to the belongings of the debtor,—that when there
                    were concurrent creditors they shared his familia amongst them. There are two
                    difficulties to face,—(1) that, once a debtor was in the hands of a creditor,
                    even provisionally, rnanus injectio by a second creditor was impossible; and (2)
                    that the debtor’s estate did not fall within the power of the incarcerating
                    creditor. The first is removed by a suggestion of Voigt’s, that the plurality of
                    creditors Gellius speaks of may have referred to tlιe case of co-heirs taking
                    proceedings against a debtor of their ancestor’s. The second disappears on a
                    slight rearrangement of the words of the Tables as Gellius records them. <note

                    hazardous. But, on the footing above explained, the provision of the Tables may

                    where there was but one creditor concerned, and the two months of provisional
                    detention expired without payment, or intervention of a vindex, or compromise of
                    some sort, the debtor definitively became his creditor’s free bondman in virtue
                    of the magisterial αMictiο; but, where co-heirs were concerned, as bondage and
                    service to all of them would have been inconvenient if not impossible when they
                    were not to continue to possess the inheritance in common, the debtor was sent
                    across the Tiber and sold as a slave, and the price got for him divided among
                    them. If one or other got more than his fair share, no harm was done; for the
                    disproportion could eventually be redressed in an action of partition {actio
                    familiae erciscundae').</p>
                <p>The disgraceful cruelties and indignities to which creditors subjected both their
                    judgment and nexal debtors led to many a commotion in the first two centuries of
                    the republic. The latter were probably much more numerous than the <hi
                    rend="italic">judicati,</hi> and, being in great part the victims of innocent
                    misfortune, it was the sufferings they endured at the hands of relentless
                    creditors that so often roused the sympathies and indignation of the populace.
                    But the judgment-debtors had suffered along with them; and some of the
                    provisions of the Poetilian law of 428 were meant to protect them against the
                    needless and unjustifiable severity that had characterized their treatment. The
                    <hi rend="italic">manus injectio</hi> itself was not abolished, nor the possible
                    intervention of a <hi rend="italic">vindex</hi>; neither were the <hi
                    rend="italic">domum ductio</hi> that followed, and the provisional imprisonment
                    with the light chains, authorized by the Tables while it lasted; nor was the
                    formal <hi rend="italic">addietio</hi> of the debtor to his creditor when the
                    sixty days had expired without arrangement. But after addiction, if it was for
                    nothing more than civil debt, there were to be no more dungeons and stripes,
                    fetters and foot-blocks; the creditor was to treat his debtor and his industry
                    as a source of profit that would in time diminish and possibly extinguish his
                    indebtedness, rather than as an object upon which he might perpetrate any
                    cruelty by way of punishment. Although the edict of P. Rutilius of 647 u.c.
                    provided a creditor with machinery for attacking the estate of his debtor, he
                    had still the alternative of incarceration. This might be avoided under the
                    Julian law of <hi rend="italic">cessio</hi> by the debtor’s making a complete
                    surrender of his goods to his creditor; but, failing such surrender,
                    incarceration continued to be resorted to even under the legislation of
                    Justinian. Latterly, however, it was not by <hi rend="italic">rnanus
                    injectio</hi> that the incarceration was effected; for it went out of use with
                    the definitive establishment of the formular system of procedure.</p>
                <p>It was as directed against judgment and nexal debtors (see infra, p. 693) that
                    manus injectio was of most importance and chiefly made its mark in history. But
                    there were other cases in which it was resorted to under special statutory
                    authority, where a remedy seemed advisable more sharp and summary than that by
                    ordinary action. In some of these it was spoken of as manus injectio pro
                    judicato {i.e., as if upon a judgment), in others as simple manus injectio
                    {manus injectio pwra). In the first the arrestee was not allowed to dispute his
                    alleged indebtedness in person; he could do so only through a vindex; and if no
                    one intervened for him in that character he was carried off and dealt with by
                    his arresting creditor as if a judgment had been obtained against him. In the
                    second he was not required to find a vindex, but might himself dispute the
                    verity of the charge made against him, under penalty, however, of a duplication
                    of his liability if he failed in his contention. By a Lex Vallia, probably in
                    the latter half of the 6th century of the city, this manus injectio para was
                    substituted for that pro judicato in all cases in which the ground of arrest was
                    neither judgment nor depensum, i.e., payment by a surety or other party on
                    account of the true debtor, who failed to relieve the former within six months
                    thereafter.</p>

                    vis</hi> with which men settled their disputes about property in the earliest
                    infancy of the commonwealth. <hi rend="italic">Manus ιnjectio</hi> was a
                    survival from times when the wronged was held entitled to lay hands upon the
                    λvrongdoer, and himself subject him to punishment; custom and legislation
                    intervened merely to regulate the conditions and mode of exercise of what
                    essentially was still self-help. In <hi rend="italic">pignons capio</hi>
                    self-help was likewise the dominant idea. It may be fairly enough described by
                    the single word distress,—the taking by one man of property belonging to another
                    in satisfaction of or in security for a debt due by the latter which he had
                    failed to pay. The taking did not proceed upon any judgment, nor did it require
                    the warrant of a magistrate; it might be resorted to even in the absence of the
                    debtor; but it required to be accompanied by certain words of style, spoken
                    probably in the presence of witnesses. It was only in a few exceptional cases
                    that it was competent, in some by force of custom, in others by statute. What
                    was the procedure, and what its effects, are far from certain. Ihering, founding
                    on some expressions of Cicero’s, conjectures that, whether the debt was disputed
                    or not, the distrainer could neither sell nor definitely appropriate his <hi
                    rend="italic"> pignus</hi> without magisterial authority,—that in every case he
                    was bound to institute proceedings in justification of his caption, and to take
                    in them the position of plaintiff. The idea is ingenious, and puts the <hi
                    rend="italic">joignons capio</hi> in a new and interesting light. It makes it a
                    summary means of raising a question of right for whose judicial arbitrament no
                    other process of law was open,—with the additional advantage that it secured
                    instant satisfaction to the raiser of it in the event of the question being
                    determined in his favour. If against him, the inevitable result, in substance at
                    least, must have been a judgment that he had no right to retain his pledge, with
                    probably a finding that he was further liable to its owner in the value of it,
                    as a punishment for his precipitancy. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    not altogether exclude other judicial or quasi-judicial agencies. The supreme
                    magistrate every now and then was called upon to intervene in matters brought
                    under his cognizance by petition or complaint, in which his aid was sought not

                    order, or to prevent the occurrence or continuance of a state of matters that
                    might prove prejudicial to family or individual interests. The process was not
                    an action, with its stages in jure and in judiciο, but an inquiry conducted from
                    first to last by the magistrate himself; and his finding, unless it was a
                    dismissal of the complaint or petition, was embodied in an order {dccretum,
                    unterdictum) which it was for him to enforce by such means as he thought
                    fit,—manu militari or by fine or imprisonment. Some jurists are disposed to give
                    a very wide range to this magisterial intervention. One of its most important
                    manifestations was in connexion with disputes about the occupancy of the public
                    domain lands. These did not belong in property to the occupants, so that an
                    action founded on ownership was out of the question. But, as the occupancy was
                    not only recognized but sanctioned by the state, it was right, indeed necessary
                    in the interest of public order, that it should be protected against
                    disturbance. In the measures resorted to for its protection Niebuhr recognized
                    the origin of the famous possessory interdict uti possidetis', and, although
                    opinions differ as to whether protection of the better right or prevention of a
                    breach of the peace was what primarily influenced the magistrate’s intervention,
                    there is a pretty general accord in accepting this view. Another illustration of
                    this magisterial intervention is to be found in the interdiction of a
                    spendthrift,—a decree depriving of his power of administration a man who was
                    squandering his family estate and reducing his children to penury; a third
                    presents itself in the removal of a tutor from office on the ground of
                    negligence or maladmmistration, brought under the notice of the magistrate by
                    any third party in what was called postulatio suspeeti tutoris; and a fourth in
                    the putting of a creditor in possession of the goods of an insolvent debtor,
                    which must have been common enough even before the general bankruptcy
                    regulations of the Rutilian edict. These are to be taken merely as examples of
                    this magisterial intervention, which manifested itself in very various
                    directions; and it is easy to see how largely such procedure might be utilized
                    for remedying the grievances of persons who, from defect of complete legal
                    title, want of statutory authority, or otherwise, were not in a position to
                    avail themselves of the “actions of the law.”</p>
                <p>In one of the Valerio-Horatian laws consequent on the second secession of the
                    plebeians there was mention of ten judges {judices decemviri'), whose persons
                    were declared as inviolable as those of the tribunes of the people and the
                    plebeian aediles. These were a body of judges elected to officiate on remit from
                    a tribune or aedile in questions arising between members of the plebeian body.
                    We are without details as to the institution of this plebeian judicatory, the
                    questions that fell under its cognizance, the forms of process employed, the law
                    administered by it, and the effect of its judgments. It is not much referred to
                    by the historians; and its decadence has been attributed to the fact that the
                    Lex Hortensia of 468 made the nundinae lawful court days {dies fasti), and so
                    made it possible for the country folks coming to the city to market to carry on
                    then· processes before the praetor.</p>
                <p>As all in a manner exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions must also be
                    mentioned the pontiffs, the consuls, and afterwards the censors as magistri
                    morum, the chiefs of the gentes within the gentile corporations, and heads of
                    families within their households. While it may be the fact that with the
                    enactment of the XII. Tables the jurisdiction of the pontiffs <note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Hüllmann, Jus pontificium
                    der Romer, Bonn, 1837; Cauvet, </p></note> was materially narrowed, it certainly
                    did not disappear,—witness the famous case in which Cicero made before them the
                    oration of which he was so proud, Pro domo sua. The action of the consuls and
                    afterwards of the censors as guardians of public morals, and the social and
                    political disqualifications and pecuniary penalties with which they visited
                    persons who had been guilty of perjury or gross perfidy, did not a little to
                    foster fidelity to engagements. Through the same agency the exercise of a
                    variety of rights whose abuse could not be made matter of action—the husband’s
                    power over his wife, the father’s over his children—was controlled and kept
                    within bounds. It was not on light grounds, indeed, that the majesty of the
                    paterfamilias within the household could be called in question; it was only when
                    he forgot that in the exercise of serious discipline within his family he was
                    bound to act judicially. For he also was a judge —judex domesticus, as he is
                    often called, though in all cases of gravity he was required to invoke the
                    advice of his kinsfolk in a family council. On him lay the duty of controlling
                    his family; if he failed to do so he was himself in danger of censorial
                    animadversion. That his gens also, if he were a patrician, had some supervision
                    and power of calling him to account is extremely probable; every corporation had
                    it more or less over its members; but neither historians nor jurists give us any
                    definite information.</p>
                <p>Between citizens and foreigners with whom Rome was in alliance by a treaty
                    conferring reciprocal right of action the proceedings took the form known as
                    recuperatio. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See

                    technical terms from, the fetial elarigatio. The action was always raised in the
                    forum contractus. The magistrate ordinarily presiding there heard what parties
                    had to say in plaint and defence, and then put in simple shape the points of
                    fact arising on them, authorizing the recuperators to whom the matter was
                    remitted to find for plaintiff or defendant according to circumstances. The
                    recuperators were sometimes three, sometimes five, sometimes still more
                    numerous, but always in odd number; whether the nationality of both parties
                    required to be represented we are not told. Expedition being in most cases a
                    matter of importance, recuperators were required to give judgment within ten
                    days. How execution proceeded upon it, if it were for the plaintiff, does not

                    concludes it must have been by something like pignoris eapio. This recuperatory
                    procedure in time came to be resorted to in some cases even where both parties
                    were citizens. There are numerous instances of it in Cicero; and it is
                    remarkable that in most of the praetorian actions ex delicto the remit was not
                    to a judex but to recuperators. The explanation may be in the comparative
                    summariness of the remedy.</p>
                <p>III. Development of the Substantive Institutions of the Law.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Citizen and his “Cαput"—</hi> The early law of Rome was
                    essentially personal, not territorial. A man enjoyed the benefit of its
                    institutions and of its protection, not because he happened to be within Roman
                    territory, but because he was a citizen,—one of those by whom and for whom its
                    law was established. The theory of the early <hi rend="italic">jus gentium</hi>
                    was that a man sojourning within the bounds of a foreign state was at the mercy
                    of the latter and its citizens, that he himself might be dealt with as a slave,
                    and all that belonged to him appropriated by the first comer; for he was outside
                    the pale of the law. Without some sort of alliance with Rome a stranger had no
                    right to claim protection against maltreatment of his person or attempt to
                    deprive him of his property; and even then, unless he belonged to a state
                    entitled by treaty to the international judicial remedy of <hi rend="italic"
                    >recuperatio,</hi> it was by an appeal to the good offices of the supreme
                    magistrate, or through the intervention of a citizen to whom he was allied by
                    the (frequently hereditary) bond of <hi rend="italic">hospitium,</hi> and not by
                    means of any action of the <hi rend="italic">jus civile</hi> set in motion by
                    himself. A non-oitizen—originally <hi rend="italic">hostis,</hi> and afterwards
                    usually called <hi rend="italic">peregrinus</hi><note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Neither “alien” nor “foreigner” is an
                    adequate rendering of peregrirnιs. For peregrini included not only citizens of
                    other states or colonies, independent or dependent, but also α7r0λtδes,—men who
                    could not call themselves citizens (cives) at all, as, for example, the
                    dediticii whom Rome had vanquished and whose civic organization she had
                    destroyed, offenders sent into banishment, &amp;c.; and until Caracalla’s
                    general grant of the franchise the greater proportion of her provincial subjects
                    were also spoken of as peregrins. This, though linguistically objectionable, is
                    a safer word than “non-citizen”; for the latter would include the Junian Latins
                    of the early empire, who, though not citizens, yet were not reckoned as
                    peregrini. </p></note> —in time came to be regarded as entitled to all the
                    rights the <hi rend="italic"> jus gentium</hi> recognized as belonging to a
                    freeman, and to take part as freely as a Roman in any transaction of the <hi
                    rend="italic">jus gentium;</hi> but that was not until Rome, through contact
                    with other nations and the growth of trade and commerce, had found it necessary
                    to modify her jurisprudence by the adoption of many new institutions of a more
                    liberal and less exclusive character than those of the <hi rend="italic">jus
                    civile.</hi></p>
                <p>A citizen’s civil personality was technically his <hi rend="italic">caput.</hi>
                    The extent of it depended on his family status. It was only among citizens that
                    the supremacy of the <hi rend="italic">paterfamilias</hi> and the subjection of
                    those <hi rend="italic">in manu, potestate,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >mαnwpio</hi> were recognized,—only among them therefore that the position of an
                    individual in the family was of moment. While in public life a man’s supremacy
                    or subjection in the family was immaterial, in private life it was the <hi
                    rend="italic">paterfamilias</hi> alone who enjoyed full jural capacity. Those
                    subject to him had a more limited personality; and, so far as capacity to take
                    part in transactions of the <hi rend="italic">jus civile</hi> was concerned, it
                    was not inherent in them but derived from their <hi rend="italic"
                    >paterfamilias</hi>: they were the agents of his will, representatives of his
                    <hi rend="italic">persona</hi> in every act whereby a right was acquired by them
                    for the family to which they belonged.</p>
                <p>Whenever a citizen either ceased altogether to be a member of a Roman family or
                    passed from one family into another, there was technically <hi rend="italic"
                    >capitis minutio</hi> or <hi rend="italic">deminutio,</hi> except in the cases
                    of <hi rend="italic">filiifamilias</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >filiaefamilias</hi> becoming flamens or vestals; for, though they changed their
                    family, yet it was by passing from a human into a divine one. When a citizen
                    forfeited his freedom, his <hi rend="italic">capitis deminutio</hi> was said to
                    be <hi rend="italic"> maxima</hi>; he lost all capacity, whether under the <hi
                    rend="italic"> jus civile</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">jus gentium.</hi> When,
                    retaining freedom, he went into exile or joined a Latin colony, or otherwise
                    became a peregrin, the diminution of his capacity was only <hi rend="italic">
                    media</hi> or <hi rend="italic">minor·,</hi> it was his rights and privileges
                    under the <hi rend="italic">jus civile</hi> that alone were affected. When both
                    freedom and citizenship remained, and no more occurred than the severance of his
                    connexion with a particular family <hi rend="italic">(familiae mutatio),</hi>
                    the diminution was said to be <hi rend="italic">minima.</hi> Very simple
                    illustrations present themselves in the case of a <hi rend="italic">paterf
                    amilias</hi> becoming <hi rend="italic">filiusfamilias</hi> by adrogation, or a
                    <hi rend="italic">materfamilias</hi> passing into the hand of a husband by
                    con-far reation or coemption; in both cases he or she who had been <hi
                    rend="italic">sui juris</hi> thereby became <hi rend="italic">alieni juris.</hi>
                    This was descent in the family scale. It almost appears as if some of the later
                    Roman jurists assumed, as do many moderns, that such descent or degradation was
                    essential to the idea of <hi rend="italic">minutio capitis</hi>; for Paul
                    accounts for its presence in the case of emancipation—which converted a <hi
                    rend="italic">filiusfamilias</hi> into a <hi rend="italic">paterfamilias,</hi>
                    and thus manifestly improved his status— by the observation that in the process
                    of release from his father’s <hi rend="italic">potestas</hi> a child had to
                    pass, for however brief a period, through a condition of quasi-slavery <hi
                    rend="italic">(mancvpium).</hi> But in reality degradation had nothing to do
                    with it. It was immaterial whether the change was from a higher family position
                    to a lower, or from a lower to a higher, <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Children who became sui juris by their parent’s death did

                    or to the same position in the new family that had been held in the old,—as when
                    a <hi rend="italic">filiusfamilias</hi> was transferred by his father into the
                    <hi rend="italic">potestas</hi> of an adopter, or when the <hi rend="italic"
                    >filiifamilias</hi> of a person giving himself in adrogation passed with him
                    into the <hi rend="italic">potestas</hi> of the adrogator: in every case there
                    was <hi rend="italic">capitis minutio.</hi> It was not the change of family
                    position that caused it, but the change of family itself,— the change from one
                    family to another. The civil personality of Titius while a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Jiliusfamilias</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">potestas</hi> of Sempronius,—the
                    expectancy of succession, the agnatic relationships, the derivative capacity for
                    being a party to a mancipation or a <hi rend="italic">sponsio</hi> that resulted
                    from the relationship,—all came to an end through the severance of the family
                    tie. He might acquire a new and independent capacity on becoming <hi
                    rend="italic">sui juris</hi> by emancipation, or a new derivative capacity on
                    passing into the <hi rend="italic">potestas</hi> of Maevius by adoption; but his
                    old personality <hi rend="italic">quoad civilia</hi> was extinguished. This is
                    what some of the jurists mean when they say that <hi rend="italic">capitis
                    deminutio</hi> was civil death.</p>
                <p>The most important consequence of <hi rend="italic">minima capitis deminutio</hi>
                    was that it not only extinguished <hi rend="italic">patria potestas</hi> where
                    it existed, but severed the bond of agnation between the <hi rend="italic"
                    >capite minutus</hi> and all those who had previously been related to him as
                    agnates. There was no longer any right of succession between them on intestacy;
                    their reciprocal prospective rights of tutory were defeated, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">minutio</hi> of either tutor or ward put an end to a subsisting

                    yet quite logical, was the doctrine that the <hi rend="italic">minutio</hi>

                    their debtor, the person with whom they had contracted, was civilly dead, and
                    dead without an heir, and therefore there was no one against whom an action of
                    the <hi rend="italic">jus civile</hi> could be directed in order to enforce
                    payment. But equity eventually provided a remedy, by giving the creditors a

                    rescinded, and which the new <hi rend="italic">paterfamilias</hi> was bound to

                    Relations.—</hi> So far as appears no serious inroad was made by the XII. Tables
                    on the law affecting husband and wife, unless in the recognition of the legality
                    of marriage entered into without any solemnity, and not involving that
                    subjection of the wife to the husband <hi rend="italic"> (gnanus)</hi> which was
                    a necessary consequence of the patrician confarreation and plebeian coemption.
                    These were left untouched. But it seems to have become a practice with some of
                    the plebeians to tie the marriage bond rather loosely in the first
                    instance,—possibly (as became quite general at a later period) in consequence of
                    objection by the women to renounce their independence and right to retain their
                    own property and earnings, more probably because taking a woman to be merely the
                    mother of their children <hi rend="italic"> (gnatrimoηium)</hi> had been forced
                    upon them before coemption had been introduced as a means of making her a lawful
                    wife, and so they had become in a manner habituated to it. But there seems also
                    to have been an idea that, as a man might acquire the ownership of a thing to
                    which his legal title was defective by prolonged possession of it, so he might
                    acquire <hi rend="italic"> manus,</hi> with all its consequences, over the woman
                    with whom he had thus informally united himself by prolonged cohabitation with
                    her as his wife. This had become customary law. The Tables accepted it; all that
                    was needed was to define the conditions under which <hi rend="italic">manus</hi>
                    should be held to have been superinduced, and the wife converted from a doubtful
                    <hi rend="italic">uxor</hi> into a lawful <hi rend="italic">rnaterfamilias.</hi>
                    Hence the provision that, if a woman, married neither by confarreation nor
                    coemption, desired to retain her independence, she must periodically absent
                    herself for three nights from her husband’s house <hi rend="italic">
                    {trinoctialis usutpatio),—</hi> twelve months’ uninterrupted cohabitation being
                    required to give him that power over her which would have been created instantly
                    had the marriage been accompanied by either of the recognized solemnities.</p>
                <p>Amongst the fragments of the Tables so industriously collected there is none that
                    refers to a wife’s marriage portion bdos); but it is hardly conceivable that it
                    was as yet unknown. Justinian says that in ancient times it was regarded as a
                    donation to the husband with his wife, rather than as a separate estate that was
                    to be used by him while the marriage lasted but to revert to her or her
                    representatives on its dissolution. And it is easy to see that, where there was
                    mαηus, the wife becoming a member of her husband’s family and everything of hers
                    becoming his, such must originally have been its character. Rut even then, when
                    a man gave his daughter {filiafamilias)—who could have nothing of her own—in
                    marriage, and promised her husband a portion with her, there must have been some
                    process of law for compelling him to pay it; and Voigt’s conjecture that an
                    actio dixtae dotis was employed for the purpose has much in its favour. As
                    regards divorce, Cicero alludes vaguely to a provision in the Tables about a man
                    depriving his wife of the house-keys and turning her out of doors, with some
                    such words as “take what is thine and get thee gone.” This cannot have applied
                    to confarreate marriages, which could be dissolved only by the religious
                    ceremony of diffarreation. And even as regards other marriages the statement of
                    the historians is that divorces were few and far between until the 6th century
                    of the city, and that, until the same date, any man who turned his wife away,
                    however serious the ground, without the cognition of the family council was
                    liable to penalties at the hands of the censors.</p>
                <p>Of the two or three provisions of the Tables that affected details of the ρatria
                    potestas, which itself was assumed to be so well established by customary law as
                    to need no statutory sanction or definition, one was in the words “si
                    paterfamilias ter filium venum duit, a patre filius liber esto.” This came to be
                    construed by the jurists as meaning that so powerful λvas the bond of the
                    ρotestas that it could not definitively be loosed until the father had three
                    times gone through the process of fictitious sale by which emancipation was
                    effected. But the conception of the law seems to indicate that its original
                    purpose must have been rather to confer a benefit on a son in potestate, by
                    declaring him ipso jure free from it on a certain event, than to place
                    difficulties in the way of his emancipation. “If a house-father have thrice sold
                    his son, the latter shall be free from his father.” It reads as if the intention
                    were to rescue the son from what, by its frequent repetition, was suggestive of
                    a total absence of parental affection rather than reluctant obedience to
                    overwhelming necessity. May not its object have been to restrain the practice,
                    which prevailed to a late period in the empire, of men giving their children to
                    their creditors in security for their loans,—a process that, at the time of the
                    Tables, could be effected only by an actual transfer of the child per aes et
                    libram as a free bondman (mancipii causa), under condition of reconveyance when
                    the loan was repaid?</p>
                <p>The nature of the relation between master and slave, like that of manus and
                    patria potestas, seems also to have been too notorious to require exposition in
                    the Tables. We find recorded only two references to it, one dealing with the
                    case of a slave who had a conditional testamentary gift of freedom (ptalu
                    liber), the other with noxal surrender jιoxαx deditw). The provision about noxal
                    surrender in all probability was not limited to a slave; it was to the effect
                    that, if a member of a man’s family (familiaris, i.e., a son or a daughter in
                    potestate or a slave) committed a theft from or did mischief to property
                    belonging to a third party, or a domestic animal belonging to one man did harm
                    to another, the father of the delinquent child, or the owner of the slave or
                    animal, should either surrender him or it to the person injured or make
                    reparation in damages. In course of time the surrender came to be regarded as a
                    means of avoiding the primary obligation of making reparation. But comparative
                    jurisprudence recognizes in the enactment of the Tables a modified survival of
                    the ancient right of an injured party to have the delinquent corpus,—man, beast,
                    or thing,—given up to him to wreak his revenge upon it privately, the
                    modification consisting in the alternative of reparation offered to the owner.
                    This noxal surrender, failing reparation, had gone out of use in the case of
                    daughters in potestate before the time of Gaius, and in the case of sons before
                    that of Justinian; but the law remained unchanged so far as slaves and domestic
                    animals were concerned even in that emperor’s legislation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Guardianship and the Introduction of the Order of Agnates.</hi>
                    —So long as Rome was patrician the <hi rend="italic">gens</hi> charged itself
                    with the guardianship of a clansman’s orphaned pupil children and his widow and
                    unmarried daughters above pupilarity after his decease <hi rend="italic">
                    {tutela),</hi> as well as with that of male members of his family who were <hi
                    rend="italic">sui juris,</hi> but above the age of pupilarity, when they chanced
                    to be lunatic, imbecile, prodigal, or helplessly infirm <hi rend="italic">{cura,
                    curatio, curatela).</hi> That was on the supposition, as regarded children,
                    widow, and unmarried daughters above pupilarity, that no testamentary
                    appointment of tutors by their deceased parent had displaced the <hi
                    rend="italic">gens,</hi> though whether testamentary nominations were then held
                    competent it is impossible to say. The <hi rend="italic"> gens</hi> in council,
                    in all probability, appointed one of its members to act as tutor or curator as
                    the case might be, itself prescribed his duties, and itself called him to
                    account for any failure in his administration.</p>
                <p>But, as this gentile tutory could not be extended to the plebeians, among whom
                    some law of guardianship was as much required as among their fellow-citizens of
                    the higher order, the decemvirs found it expedient to devise a new one of
                    universal application. The Tables contained no express authority for
                    testamentary nomination of tutors to the widow of the testator, or to his pupil
                    children and grown-up unmarried daughters; but such appointment, if unknown
                    previously, was soon held to be justified by a liberal interpretation of the
                    very inclusive provision, “uti legassit suae rei, ita jus esto.” In the absence
                    of testamentary appointment the nearest male agnates of lawful age were to be
                    tutors. This tutory of agnates was an invention of the decemvirs, just as was
                    the agnates’ right of succession on intestacy. The plebeians had no <hi
                    rend="italic"> gentes,</hi> at least until a much later period; so, to make the
                    law equal for all, it was necessary to introduce a new order of heirs and
                    tutors. “Tutores . . . ex lege XII. Tabularum in-troducuntur . . . agnati” is
                    the very notable language of Ulpian. And his words are very similar in speaking
                    of their right of succession; for, while he says of testamentary inheritances no
                    more than that they were <hi rend="italic">confirmed</hi> by the XII. Tables, he
                    explains that the <hi rend="italic">legitimae hereditates</hi> of agnates and

                    to any institution based on statute, yet in the ordinary case it indicated one

                <p>A man’s agnates were those of his kinsmen who were subject to the same <hi

                    >in pole state,</hi> therefore, whether the relationship was by birth or

                    >filiae loco)</hi> were each other’s agnates. But a wife not <hi rend="italic">
                    in manu</hi> was not their agnate; nor were children who had been emancipated or
                    otherwise <hi rend="italic">capite minuti</hi> the agnates of either their
                    brothers and sisters or their mother <hi rend="italic">in manu.</hi> A man was
                    an agnate of his brother’s children, assuming always that there had been no <hi
                    rend="italic">capitis deminutio</hi> on either side; but he was not an agnate of
                    his sister’s children, for they were not <hi rend="italic">ejusdem
                    familiae</hi>: they were agnates of their father’s family, not of their
                    mother’s. In like manner, and again assuming the absence of <hi rend="italic"
                    >minutio capitis,</hi> the children of brothers were each other’s agnates, but
                    not the children of a brother and a sister or of two sisters. Brothers and
                    sisters were agnates of the second degree; <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>To determine the degree of propinquity between two persons

                    related in the second degree, uncle and nephew in the third, first cousins in
                    the fourth, and so on: “tot gradus quot generationes.” </p></note> a man and his

                    however, that the kinship should always result either from lawful marriage or
                    from adoption in one or other of its forms.</p>
                <p>When, therefore, a man died leaving pupil male descendants or unmarried female
                    descendants who by his death became swi juris, they got their brothers of lawful
                    age as their tutors; if he was survived by his wife, and she had been in manu,
                    her sons, or it might be stepsons, acted for her in the same capacity; in either
                    case they took office as the nearest qualified male agnates. If the widow had no
                    sons or stepsons of full age, and the children consequently no brothers, the
                    tutory devolved on the agnates next in order,—ix., the brothers germane and
                    consanguinean of the deceased husband and father; for they were agnates of the
                    third degree. And so with agnates of the fourth and remoter degrees. Failing
                    agnates who could demonstrate their propinquity, the tutory probably passed to
                    the gens when the ward happened to belong to one. This is nowhere expressly
                    stated; but Cicero gives what he represents to be an enactment of the Tables,
                    making the fellow-gentiles of a lunatic his guardians on failure of agnates; and
                    analogy seems to justify the extension of the same rule to the case of sane
                    pupil and female wards.</p>
                <p>The curatory of minors above pupilarity was of much later date than the Tables.
                    The only curatories they sanctioned were those of lunatics and spendthrifts. A
                    lunatic <hi rend="italic">(juriosus)</hi> was committed to the care of his
                    agnates, and, failing them, of his fellow-gentiles; and a few words in Festus
                    seem to suggest that arrangements had to be made by them for his safe
                    custody.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mancipation and the Law of Property.—</hi> In the early law
                    there was no technical word for ownership of things; it was an element of the

                    to say when, the word <hi rend="italic">dominium</hi> came into use; but, so far
                    as can be discovered, it did not occur in the XII. Tables, and must have been of
                    later introduction. In those days, when a man asserted ownership of a thing, he
                    was content to say, “It is mine,” or, “It is mine according to the law of the
                    Quirites.” The distinction was this, that, while the first was sufficient to
                    entitle a man <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> holding a thing as his own to
                    protection against a thief or any one attempting forcibly to dispossess him, the
                    second was necessary when he appealed to a court of law to declare the legality
                    of his title and his right to oust an individual withholding the possession
                    neither theftuously nor by force. It is said by some jurists of eminence that
                    under the law of the Tables what afterwards came to be called “dominium ex jure
                    Quiritium” was competent only in the case of <hi rend="italic"> res
                    mancipi,—</hi> of a man’s house and farm, and the slaves and animals with which
                    he worked them. But the usucapion (or acquisition by prolonged possession) which
                    they confirmed and regulated undoubtedly conferred quiritarian right; and, as it
                    applied to all things ownable without exception, it seems impossible to maintain
                    that <hi rend="italic">res nee mancipi</hi> could not then be held in
                    quiritarian ownership as fully as <hi rend="italic">res mancipi.</hi></p>
                <p>The modes in which these two classes of things might be acquired in property were
                    very various. But there was this important difference,—that, while a natural
                    mode of acquisition sufficed in the case of <hi rend="italic">res nec
                    mancipi,</hi> some civil one was necessary for the derivative acquisition, at
                    all events, of <hi rend="italic">res mancipi.</hi> The most important λvere
                    mancipation, surrender in court, usucapion, and bequest as singular modes, and
                    inheritance, <hi rend="italic">in manum conventiο,</hi> adrogation, and purchase
                    of a confiscated estate as universal modes. All these, with the exception of
                    mancipation, applied equally to <hi rend="italic">res nec mancipi.</hi> But the
                    commonest of all the modes of transferring things of the latter class was simple
                    tradition. If the transfer was by the owner, with the intention of passing the
                    property, then the simple delivery of possession was enough, unless it was in
                    virtue of a sale; in such a case, and because a vendor had as yet no action for
                    the price, the Tables provided that the ownership should remain with him,
                    notwithstanding the change of possession, until the price was paid or security
                    given for it.</p>
                <p>The origin of the distinction between mancipable and non-man-cipable things, and
                    of the form of conveyance by mancipation applicable to the first, has been
                    explained in connexion with the reforms of Servius Tullius Gupra, p. 676). <note

                    introduced it, mancipation (then called mαηripiurn) was not the imaginary sale
                    that Gaius speaks of, but as real a sale as could well be conceived, —the
                    weighing in scales, held by an official, of the raw metal that was to be the
                    consideration for the transfer of a res mancipi, and the handing of it by the
                    transferee to the transferrer, with the declaration that thereby and therewith
                    the thing in question became his in quiritary right,—and all this in words of
                    style, and in the presence of certain witnesses who represented the people, and
                    thus fortified the conveyance with a public sanction. As already shown, there is
                    some reason to believe that, when large quantities of metal had to be weighed,
                    the practice crept in of having this done before the witnesses had assembled;
                    and in the formal act only a single pound was weighed as representing the whole
                    amount. This paved the way for the greater change that resulted from the
                    introduction by the decemvirs of coined money. From that moment weighing became
                    unnecessary. The price was counted out before the ceremony, and sometimes left
                    to be done afterwards; and, though, in that spirit of conservatism that was so
                    marked in the adhesion to time-honoured forms after their raison d' être was
                    gone, the scale-bearer and the scales were still retained as indispensable
                    elements of the mancipation, yet the scales were simply touched by the purchaser
                    with a single coin, in order that he might be able to recite the old formula—“I
                    say that this slave is mine in quiritary right, and that by purchase (for such
                    and such a price ?) with these scales and this bit of copper.” And that one
                    coin, says Gaius, was then handed by the transferee to the transferrer, as if it
                    were in fact the price of the purchase (quasi ρretii loco). Thus transformed,
                    the mancipation was undoubtedly an imaginary sale; for the real price might have
                    been paid weeks or months before, or might not be paid until weeks or months
                    afterwards. The mancipation had become nothing more than a conveyance, and in
                    this form it continued down to the end of the 3d century of the empire to be the
                    appropriate mode of transfer of a res mancipi, or at least of conferring on the
                    transferee of such a thing a complete legal title (dominium ex jure Quiritium).
                    After that, however, it seems gradually to have gone into disuse, being
                    inapplicable to lands out of Italy that did <pb corresp="pbn9689"

                    Italicum</hi>; and long before the time of Justinian it had entirely
                    disappeared.</p>
                <p>The effects of a mancipation, provided the price had been paid or security given
                    for it, were that the property passed instantly to the purchaser, and that the
                    transferrer was held to warrant the transferee against eviction from the moment
                    the price was received. In the absence of either payment or sureties for it, the
                    title still remained with the vendor, so that it was in his power, by means of a
                    real action, to get back what had been mancipated, even though it had passed
                    into the possession of the vendee. The vendor’s liability to the vendee in the
                    event of eviction is usually supposed to have arisen <hi rend="italic">ipso
                    jure,</hi> that is to say, without anything expressly said about it; the
                    acceptance by the transferrer of the coin with which the scales had been struck
                    was held to have imposed upon him an obligation to maintain the transferee in
                    possession, under a penalty of double the amount of the price, recoverable by
                    the latter by what is usually called an <hi rend="italic">actio
                    auctoritatis.</hi> But this <hi rend="italic">ipso jure</hi> obligation did not
                    arise when the mancipation was either really or fictitiously gratuitous,—really,
                    in the case of donations, &amp;c., fictitiously, when, on purpose to exclude the
                    warranty, the recital of the transferee was that the price was a single
                    sesterce.</p>
                <p>The right of a vendee to sue an <hi rend="italic">actio auctoritatis</hi> arose
                    only when eviction resulted from a decree in a regular judicial process at the
                    instance of a third party disputing his title, and was conditional on his having
                    done all that was necessary on his part to bring his vendor <hi rend="italic">
                    (auctor)</hi> into the field to defend his own interests. And the duration of
                    the <hi rend="italic">auctoritas</hi> was limited by statute to two years in the
                    case of lands and houses, to one year in the case of other things. As possession
                    for those periods was sufficient to cure any defect in the vendee’s title, it
                    was but reasonable that with their expiry the vendor's liability on his warranty
                    should be at an end.</p>
                <p>By a provision of the Tables in the very inclusive terms, “cum nexum faciet
                    mancipiumque, uti lingua nuncupassit, itajusesto,” the importance of mancipation
                    was immensely increased; for any sort of qualification germane to the
                    transaction might be superinduced upon it, and the range of its application thus
                    greatly extended. Such qualifications were spoken of as <hi rend="italic">leges
                    mancipii,—</hi> self-imposed terms, conditions, or qualifications of the
                    conveyance, which, as integral parts of the transaction <hi rend="italic">per
                    aes et libram,</hi> partook of its binding character and were law between the
                    parties. The matter of oral declaration might be the acreage of lands, their
                    freedom from burdens or right to easements, reservation of a usufruct,
                    limitation of their mode of use, undertaking to reconvey on a certain event, or
                    what not; the result was just so many obligations created <hi rend="italic">per
                    aes et libram,</hi> whose contravention or denial (Cicero tells us) was punished
                    with a twofold penalty. Ordinarily the words spoken in the hearing of the
                    witnesses fixed the beginning and the end of the liability; it was enough that
                    they were literally complied with, however much the other party might be injured
                    by something inconsistent with their spirit, or which he had not taken the
                    precaution to require should be made matter of declaration. But there was an
                    exception (although possibly not introduced until long after the Tables) in the
                    case of that particular mancipatory agreement which was known by the name of <hi
                    rend="italic"> Jiducia, i.e.,</hi> where the mancipation was to a creditor in
                    security or to a friend for safe custody, and the engagement was to return the
                    thing mancipated in the one case when the debt secured by it was paid and in the
                    other on demand. In such cases the transferee took the conveyance more in the
                    transferrer’s interest than his own; he became a trustee, entitled to be treated
                    with consideration, and neither mulcted in a twofold penalty when his inability
                    to reconvey was due to no fault of his, nor forced to reconvey until relieved of
                    charges incurred by him in reference to the property. Accordingly it became the
                    practice to import into the mancipation a reference to <hi rend="italic">
                    fides—</hi> “fidei fiduciae meum esse aio,” with explanation of the purpose,
                    &amp;c., of the <hi rend="italic">fiducia</hi> in the relative <hi rend="italic"
                    >lex mancipii</hi>; this had the effect of freeing alike the right of the vendor
                    and the obligation of the vendee from the hard-and-fast lines of they ms <hi
                    rend="italic">strichim,</hi> and subordinating them to the principles of <hi
                    rend="italic">bona fides.</hi><hi rend="italic">Of</hi> the civil modes of
                    acquiring property on singular title applicable to both <hi rend="italic">res
                    mancipi</hi> and <hi rend="italic"> res nee mancipi</hi> surrender in court <hi
                    rend="italic">{injure cessio)</hi> was just a <hi rend="italic">rei
                    vindicatio</hi> arrested in its initial stage. The parties, cedent and
                    cessionary, appeared before the magistrate; the cessionary, taking the position
                    of plaintiff, declared the thing his in quiritary right; the cedent, as
                    defendant, was asked what he had to say in answer; and, on his admission or
                    silence, the magistrate at once pronounced a decree <hi rend="italic"
                    >(addictio)</hi> which completed the transfer, but which might be subject to a
                    condition or other limitation, or even to a fiduciary reservation. It was
                    probably more resorted to for the constitution of servitudes, both real and
                    personal, and transfer of such rights as <hi rend="italic">patria potestas,</hi>
                    tutory-at-law of a woman, or an inheritance that had already vested, than for
                    conveyance of property. For it was not only inconvenient, inasmuch as it
                    required the parties to appear before the supreme magistrate in Rome, and could
                    not be carried through by a slave on his owner’s behalf (as mancipation might),
                    but it had the serious disadvantage that it did not <hi rend="italic">ipso
                    jure</hi> imply any warranty of title by the cedent or afford the cessionary any
                    action against him in the event of eviction. The reason was that in form the
                    right of the cessionary flowed from the magisterial decree,—“Since you say the
                    thing is yours, and the cedent does not say it is his,, I declare it yours,”—and
                    not from any act or word of the cedent’s, who was passive in the matter.</p>
                <p>Adjudication was the decree of a judge in a divisory action, such as one for
                    partition of an inheritance amongst co-heirs; it conferred upon each of them a
                    separate and independent right in a part of what as a whole had previously been
                    joint property.</p>

                    Tables, but not improbably recognized previously in a vague and uncertain way,
                    converted uninterrupted possession (ws«s) into quiritary property by efflux of
                    time. The provision in the Tables was to this effect—“usus auctoritas fundi
                    biennium esto, ceterarum rerum annuus esto.” The relation in which the words <hi
                    rend="italic">usus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">auctoritas</hi> stand to each
                    other has been a subject of much discussion: the prevailing opinion amongst
                    modern civilians is that the first alone refers to usucapion, and the second to
                    the warranty of title incumbent on the vendor in a mancipation, and that both
                    were limited to two years in the case of lands (and, by extensive
                    interpretation, houses), and to one year in the case of anything else. In the
                    later jurisprudence the possession required to be based on a sufficient title
                    and the possessor to be in good faith. But the decemviral code, as is now
                    generally admitted, contained no such requirements; any citizen occupying
                    immovables or holding movables as his own, provided they were usucaptible and he
                    had not taken them theftuously, acquired a quiritary right in two years or one,
                    as the case might be, simply on the strength of his possession. Originally,
                    therefore, it was simply the conversion of <hi rend="italic"> de facto</hi>
                    possession, no matter how acquired so long as not by theft, into legal ownership
                    when prolonged for the statutory period,—too often the maintenance of might at
                    the cost of right. But in time it came to be regarded rather as a remedy for
                    some defect of title, arising either from irregularity of conveyance or
                    incapacity of the party from whom a transfer had been taken; and with the
                    progress of jurisprudence it developed into the carefully regulated positive
                    prescription which has found a place in every modern system.</p>
                <p>The conception of the abstract notion of a real right in (or over) the property
                    of another person <hi rend="italic">(jus in re aliena)</hi> is not to be looked
                    for at so early a period in the history of the law as that now under
                    consideration. The rural servitudes of way and water were no doubt very early
                    recognized, for they ranked as <hi rend="italic">res mancipi,</hi> and the XII.
                    Tables contained various regulations in reference to the former. Usufruct, too,
                    was probably not unknown; but the urban praedial servitudes bear the impress of
                    a somewhat later jurisprudence. Pignorate and hypothecary rights were unknown as
                    rights protected by action at the time now being dealt with.Between private
                    parties the only thing legally recognized of the nature of a real security was
                    the <hi rend="italic">fiducia</hi> that is described above. Approaching more
                    nearly to the modern idea of a mortgage was the security <hi rend="italic">
                    praedibus praediisque</hi> required by the state from those indebted to it in
                    assurance of their obligations. Here there was the double guarantee of sureties
                    <hi rend="italic">(jpraedes')</hi> and mortgaged lands of theirs <hi
                    rend="italic">(praedia subsig-</hi><hi rend="superscript">2</hi> Hypothecary
                    rights were certainly unknown until near the end of the republic. But Festus
                    (s.v. “Nancitor ;” see Bruns, <hi rend="italic"> Fontes,</hi> p. 274) speaks of
                    a provision in the Cassian league between Rome and the Latin states of the year

                    remained in use in the early republic; but in course of time they were displaced
                    by the general adoption of that executed with the copper and the scales <hi
                    rend="italic">(testamentum per aes et libram).</hi> It seems to be the general
                    opinion that it was to the first two that the words applied which stood in the
                    forefront of the provisions of the XII. Tables about inheritance,—“uti legassit
                    suae rei, ita jus esto.” Whether resort was to the comitia or to the army, the
                    testator’s own will in the matter was henceforth to be supreme. There was to be
                    no more reference to the pontiffs as to the expediency of the testament in view
                    of the interests of the family <hi rend="italic"> sacra</hi> and of creditors of
                    the testator’s; from legislators, sanctioning a departure from the ordinary
                    rules of succession, the assembled Quirites became merely witnesses,—recipients
                    of the oral declaration of the testator’s will in regard to his inheritance.</p>
                <p>The testament with the copper and the scales is depicted by Gaius as a written
                    instrument. But he presents it in what was apparently the third stage of its
                    history. Its probable origin has been explained in describing the result of the
                    Servian reforms upon the private law. It was then not a testament but only a
                    makeshift for one. A plebeian was not qualified in the regal period to make a
                    testament in the comitia; so, instead, he transferred his estate to a friend on
                    whom he could rely with instructions how to distribute it on his death. The
                    transferee was called <hi rend="italic">familiae emptor,</hi> because the
                    conveyance was in form a mancipation for a nominal price.</p>
                <p>It is not at all unlikely that the same device may occasionally have been
                    resorted to by a patrician who had neglected to make a regular testament, and
                    was seized with mortal illness before he had an opportunity of appealing to the
                    curies. But such a disposition was not a testament, and may not have been so
                    called. A testament was the nomination of a person as the testator’s
                    heir,—sometimes the substitution of an individual of the testator’s choice for
                    the heir assigned to him by law, sometimes the acceptance of the latter but in
                    the character of testamentary heir, so that the testator might be able to impose
                    upon him what burdens he pleased as the tacit condition of heirship. It made the
                    person instituted as fully the representative of the testator after his death as
                    his heir-at-law would have been had he died intestate. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >mortis causa</hi> mancipation that opened the way for the testament <hi
                    rend="italic"> per aes et libram</hi> conferred upon the <hi rend="italic"
                    >familiae emptor</hi> no such character. Gaius says that he stood in place of an
                    heir <hi rend="italic">ifieredis loco),</hi> inasmuch as he had such of an
                    heir’s rights and duties as the <hi rend="italic">familiae venditor</hi> had it
                    in his power to confer and impose; but the transaction was but a conveyance of
                    estate, -with a limitation of the right of the grantee. It has been argued that,
                    as the law did not recognize conditional mancipation, the conveyance must have
                    operated as a complete and immediate divestiture of the grantee. But this does
                    not follow. For it was quite competent for a man, in transferring property by
                    mancipation, to reserve to himself a life interest; and apparently it was
                    equally competent for him to postpone delivery of possession, without infringing
                    the rule that the mancipation itself could not be «c <hi rend="italic"> cerlo
                    tempore.</hi> So far as one can see, therefore, there was nothing to prevent the
                    grantee of the conveyance (or quasi-testator) bargaining that he was to retain
                    the possession till his death; and, as the/aww'Zia was an aggregate of estate
                    <hi rend="italic">(universitas rerum)</hi> which retained its identity
                    notwithstanding any change in its component elements, he must in such case have
                    been as free to operate on it while he survived as if he had never conveyed it
                    by mancipation.</p>
                <p>Cicero incidentally remarks—what indeed the nature of the business of itself very
                    distinctly suggests—that the true testament with the copper and the scales had
                    its statutory warrant, not in the <hi rend="italic">uti legassit suae rei</hi>
                    of the XII. Tables, but in the provision contained in the words,—“cum nexum
                    faciet mancipiumque, uti lingua nuncupassit, ita jus esto.” Reflexion on the
                    import and comprehensiveness of these words led the interpreters to the
                    conclusion that there was nothing in them to prevent the direct institution of
                    an heir in the course of the <hi rend="italic">verba nuncupata</hi> engrafted on
                    a mancipation. From the moment this view was adopted and put in practice the <hi
                    rend="italic">familiae mancipatio</hi> ceased to be a transfer of the testator’s
                    estate to the <hi rend="italic">familiae emptor;</hi> the latter’s purchase was
                    now for form’s sake only, though still an indispensable form, since it was it
                    alone that, according to the letter of the statute, imparted efficacy to the <hi
                    rend="italic">nuncupatio.</hi> But it was the <hi rend="italic">nuncupatio—</hi>
                    the oral declaration addressed to the witnesses—that really contained the
                    testamentary disposition, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the institution of an
                    heir, with such other provisions as the testator thought fit to embody in it.
                    This was the second stage in the history of the testament <hi rend="italic">per
                    aes et libram.</hi> The third was marked by the introduction of tablets in which
                    the testamentary provisions were set out in writing, and which the testator
                    displayed to the witnesses, folded and tied up in the usual manner, declaring
                    that they contained the record of his last will.</p>
                <p>Gaius narrates the words spoken by the <hi rend="italic">familiae emptor</hi> and
                    addressed to the testator as follows :—“Your estate and belongings <hi
                    rend="italic"> (familia pecuniaque tua),</hi> be they mine by purchase with this
                    bit of copper and these copper scales, subject to your instructions, but in my
                    keeping, that so you may lawfully make your testament according to the statute
                    <hi rend="italic">{quo tujure testamentum faccrepossis secundum legem
                    publicam).”</hi> The meaning of the words “in my keeping <hi rend="italic">
                    {endo custodelam meam)</hi>” is not quite obvious; they may have been remnants
                    of an older style, or may be due to a clerical error of the writer of the Verona
                    MS. Certain it is that they no more imported a real custody than a real property
                    in the <hi rend="italic">familiae emptor</hi>; for the testator remained so
                    entirely master of his estate that the very next day if he pleased he might
                    mancipate it anew to a different purchaser, and nuncupate fresh testamentary
                    writings. The nuncupation was in these terms: “As is written in these tablets so
                    do I give, so do I legate, so do I declare my will; therefore, Quirites, grant
                    me your testimony”; and, adds Gaius, “whatever the testator had set down in
                    detail in his testamentary tablets he was regarded as declaring and confirming
                    by this general statement.” To the appeal of the testator the witnesses
                    responded by giving their testimony in words which unfortunately are not
                    preserved; and then the testament was sealed by testator, officials, and
                    witnesses, the seals being outside according to the early fashion.</p>
                <p>Although this testament with the copper and the scales was justified in the first
                    instance by the provision of the XII. Tables as to the effect of nuncupative
                    words annexed to a mancipation, yet in course of time it came to be subordinated
                    to that other one which dealt directly with testamentary dispositions, — <hi
                    rend="italic">uti legassit suae rei, ita jus esto.</hi> Upon the words <hi
                    rend="italic">riti legassit</hi> the widest possible meaning was put by the
                    interpreters: not only was a testator held entitled on the strength of them to
                    appoint tutors to wife and children, to enfranchise slaves, and make bequests to
                    legatees, but he might even disinherit his proper heir <hi rend="italic">{suus
                    heres)</hi> in favour of a stranger, so long as he did so in express terms.
                    Institution of a stranger without mention of the proper heir, however, was
                    fatal, at least if the latter was a son; for without express disherison <hi
                    rend="italic">{exheredatio)</hi> his father could not deprive him of the
                    interest he had in the family property as in a manner one of its joint owners.
                    It can hardly be supposed that disherison was contemplated by the compilers of
                    the Tables: it was foreign to the traditional conception of the family and the
                    family estate. But it was a right whose concession could not be resisted when
                    claimed as embraced in the <hi rend="italic">uti legassit,</hi> although
                    generally discountenanced, and as far as possible restrained by the strictness
                    of the rules imposed on its exercise.</p>
                <p>In the absence of a testament, or on its failure from any cause, the succession
                    opened to the heirs <hi rend="italic">ab intestato.</hi> So notoriously were the
                    <hi rend="italic">sui heredes</hi> entitled to the first place—and that not so
                    much in the character of heirs as of persons now entering upon the active
                    exercise of rights hitherto existing, though in a manner dormant—that the
                    compilers of the XII. Tables thought it superfluous expressly to declare it. “If
                    a man die intestate, leaving no <hi rend="italic">suus heres,</hi> his nearest
                    agnate shall have his estate. If the agnate also fail, his gentiles shall have
                    it.” It has been pointed out, in dealing with the tutory of agnates, that the
                    notion of agnation, as a bond distinct from that which connected the gentile
                    members of a clan, was due to the decemvirs. They had to devise a law of
                    intestate tutory and succession suitable alike to the patricians who had <hi
                    rend="italic"> gentes</hi> and to the plebeians who had none. To put the latter
                    in exactly the same position as the former was beyond their power <hi
                    rend="italic">; for</hi> the fact had to be faced that the plebeians had no
                    gentile institutions, and to create them was impossible.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n715/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0715-0692"/>
                <p>The difficulty was overcome by accepting the principle of agnation upon which the
                    patrician <hi rend="italic">gens</hi> was constructed, and establishing an
                    agnatic circle of kinsmen within the sixth degree, to which the <hi
                    rend="italic"> gens</hi> as a corporation should be postponed in the case of the
                    patricians, and which should come in place of it in the case of the plebeians.
                    It was not perfect equalization, but the nearest approach to it that the
                    circumstances permitted. The difference was that, when the agnates of a plebeian
                    intestate failed, his inheritance was vacant, whereas, on failure of those of a
                    patrician, there was devolution to his <hi rend="italic">gens</hi> in its
                    collective capacity. And this devolution was rendered all the more frequent by
                    two “interpretations” put upon the statute,—(1) that, if the nearest agnates in
                    existence declined the succession, those next in degree were not allowed to take
                    it • and (2) that no female agnate could take it except a sister of the deceased
                    intestate. The division among two or more agnates was always <hi rend="italic">
                    per capita,</hi> not <hi rend="italic">per stirpes.</hi></p>
                <p>The order of intestate succession thus established by the XII. Tables, which
                    prevailed until amended by the praetors probably in the 8th century of the city,
                    was first to the <hi rend="italic">sui heredes</hi> of the deceased, next to
                    liis nearest agnate or agnates, and finally, if the deceased was a patrician, to
                    his <hi rend="italic">gens.</hi> His <hi rend="italic">sui heredes</hi> included
                    those of his descendants in his <hi rend="italic">potestas</hi> when he died who
                    by that event (or even after it, but before his intestacy became manifest)
                    became <hi rend="italic">sui juris,</hi> together with his wife <hi
                    rend="italic"> in manu</hi> (who, as regarded his succession, was reckoned as a
                    daughter); but they did not include children whom lie had emancipated or
                    daughters who had passed <hi rend="italic">in manum</hi> of a husband.
                    Emancipated children did not even come in as agnates on failure of <hi
                    rend="italic"> sui;</hi> for emancipation severed the tie of agnation as well as
                    that of <hi rend="italic">potestas.</hi> For the same reason no kinsman who had
                    been emancipated, and so cut off from the family tree, could claim as an agnate;
                    for those only were agnates who were subject to the same <hi rend="italic">
                    patria potestas,</hi> or would have been had the common family head been still
                    alive.</p>
                <p>The opening of a succession (technically <hi rend="italic">dclatio
                    hereditatis)</hi> in favour of <hi rend="italic">sui heredes,</hi> whether in
                    virtue of a testamentary institution or by operation of law on intestacy, at
                    once invested them with the character, rights, and responsibilities of heirs. No
                    acceptance was necessary, nor, according to the rules of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >jus civile,</hi> was any declinature competent. They had been all along in a
                    manner joint owners with their parent of the family estate, which by his death
                    had become, nominally at least, an inheritance; and, as he had not thought fit
                    to terminate their interest in it by emancipating or disinheriting them, they
                    were not now allowed to disown it. Hence they were spoken of as necessary heirs
                    <hi rend="italic"> {heredes sui et necessarii).</hi> A slave, too, whom his
                    owner had instituted in his testament was a necessary heir: he could not
                    decline, and was invested with the character of heir the moment the testator
                    died. Not so with stranger institutes or agnates taking on intestacy: they were
                    free to take or reject the inheritance as they saw fit; consequently an act of
                    acceptance <hi rend="italic">{aditio)</hi> was necessary on their part to make
                    them heirs. It was not unusual for a testator, in instituting an heir, to
                    require that he should make a formal declaration of acceptance within a limited
                    time, failing which his right should pass to a substitute, who in turn was
                    required to enter within a certain time; and so on with any number of
                    substitutes, the series ending with one of his slaves, who became heir without
                    entry, and thus saved the testator from the disgrace of <hi rend="italic">post
                    mortem</hi> bankruptcy in the event of the inheritance proving insolvent. The
                    <hi rend="italic">uli leyassit</hi> of the Tables, as already remarked,
                    conferred upon a testator very great latitude of testamentary disposition, even
                    to the extent of disherison of <hi rend="italic">sui heredes.</hi> This was a
                    course, however, that was rarely resorted to unless when a child had been guilty
                    of gross ingratitude, or when the parent had reason to believe his estate was
                    insolvent and desired to protect his children from the responsibilities of
                    inheritance. Usually his <hi rend="italic">sui,</hi> if he had any, would be his
                    institutes, and the purpose of the testament either to apportion the estate
                    amongst them as he thought expedient, or to give him an opportunity of
                    appointing tutors, bequeathing legacies, or enfranchising slaves. On intestacy
                    the <hi rend="italic">sui</hi> took equally, but <hi rend="italic">per

                    emancipated, but who themselves had been retained in their grandfather’s <hi
                    rend="italic">potestas,</hi> took amongst them the share to which their father
                    would otherwise have been entitled, instead of taking equal shares with their
                    surviving uncles. It was by no means uncommon, when the whole inheritance
                    descended to sons, for them to hold it in common for many years as partners <hi
                    rend="italic">{consortes}</hi>; but any one of them was entitled at any moment
                    to claim a partition, which was effected judicially, by an arbitral procedure
                    introduced, termed a <hi rend="italic">judicium</hi> (or <hi rend="italic"
                    >arbitrium) familias erciscundae.</hi> Where two or more strangers were
                    instituted testamentarily, whether to equal or unequal shares, if one of them

                    ipso jure</hi> to the others; for it was a rule that very early became
                    proverbial that a man could not die partly testate and partly intestate. There
                    was the same accrual among agnates on intestacy; and both they and stranger
                    testamentary institutes had the same action for division of the inheritance that
                    was made use of by <hi rend="italic">sui heredes.</hi></p>
                <p>According to Gaius it was as a stimulus to heirs to enter as soon as possible to
                    an inheritance that had opened to them, and thus make early provision alike for
                    satisfying the claims of creditors of the deceased and attending to his family
                    <hi rend="italic">sacra,</hi> that the law came to recognize the somewhat
                    remarkable institution of usucapion or prescriptive acquisition of the
                    inheritance in the character of heir <hi rend="italic">{ usucapió pro
                    herede}.</hi> Such usucapion was impossible—there was no room for it—if the
                    deceased had left <hi rend="italic">sui heredes</hi>; for the inheritance vested
                    in them the moment he died. But, if there were no <hi rend="italic">sui
                    heredes,</hi> then any person taking possession of the property that had
                    belonged to the deceased, and holding it for twelve months without interruption,
                    thereby acquired it as if he were heir: in fact, according to the views then
                    held, he acquired the inheritance itself. Gaius characterizes it as a dishonest
                    acquisition, inasmuch as the usucapient knew that what he had taken ytossession
                    of was not his. But, as already explained, the usucapion of the XII. Tables did
                    not require <hi rend="italic">bona fidcs</hi> on the part of the usucapient; he
                    might acquire ownership by prolonged possession of what he knew did not belong
                    to him so long as he did not appropriate it theftu-ously, <hi rend="italic">
                    i.e.</hi> , knowing that it belonged to another. But an inheritance
                    unappropriated by an heir who had nothing more than a right to claim it belonged
                    in strictness to no one; and there was no theft, therefore, when a person took
                    possession of it with a view to usucapion in the character of heir. There can be
                    little doubt that on the completion of his possession he was regarded as heir
                    just as fully as if he had taken under a testament or as heir-at-law on
                    intestacy,—that is to say, that he was held responsible to creditors of the
                    deceased and required to charge himself with the family <hi rend="italic">
                    sacra.</hi> Gaius does not say as much; but both the Coruncanian and the Mucian
                    edict imposed the latter burden upon him who had usucapted by possession the
                    greater part of a deceased person’s estate; and it is but reasonable to suppose
                    that the burden of debts must in like manner have fallen on the usucapient or
                    usucapients in proportion to the shares they had taken of the deceased’s
                    property.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Lau) of Obligations.—</hi> The jurists of the classical
                    period attribute obligation either to contract, or delict, or miscellaneous
                    causes <hi rend="italic">(variae causarum figurad)</hi>; and those arising from
                    contract fill a place in the later jurisprudence vastly greater than those
                    arising from delict. In the XII. Tables it was very different. In them delicts
                    were much more prominent than contracts,—wrongs entitling the sufferer to demand
                    the imposition of penalties upon the wrongdoer that in most cases covered both
                    reparation and punishment. The disproportion in the formulated provisions in
                    reference to the two sources of obligation, however, is not surprising. For,
                    first of all, the purpose of the decemviral code was to remove uncertainties and
                    leave as little as possible to the arbitrariness of the magistrates. In nothing
                    was there more scope for this than in the imposition of penalties; and, as
                    different offences required to be differently treated, the provisions in
                    reference to them were necessarily multiplied. In the next place, the
                    intercourse that evokes contract was as yet very limited. Agriculture was the
                    occupation of the great majority; trade and commerce were more backward than in
                    the later years of the regal period; coined money was just beginning to be used
                    as a circulating medium. Lastly, the safeguards of engagement then lay to a
                    great extent in the sworn oath or the plighted faith, of which the law had
                    hardly begun to take cognizance, but which found a protection quite as potent in
                    the religious and moral sentiments that had so firm a hold on the people.</p>
                <p>It may be asked—If a man purchased sheep or store cattle, a plough, a toga, a jar
                    of wine or oil, had he no action to compel delivery, the vendor no action for
                    payment of the price? Did the hire of a horse or the loan of a bullock create no
                    obligation? "Was partnership unknown and deposit and pledge and suretyship in
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n716/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0716-0693"/>any other form than that of <hi rend="italic"
                    >vadimonium i</hi> One can have no hesitation in answering that, as transactions
                    of daily life, they must all have been more or less familiar. It does not
                    follow, however, that they were already regulated by law and protected by the
                    ordinary tribunals. The historical jurists are pretty well agreed that not only
                    the real contracts of loan <hi rend="italic"> (mutuum</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >commodatum),</hi> deposit, and pledge, but also the consensual ones of sale,
                    location, partnership, and mandate, and the verbal one of suretyship, were as
                    yet very barely recognized by law. Sale was the offspring of barter,—of instant
                    exchange of one thing for another. With such instant exchange there was no room
                    for obligation to deliver on either side, even when the ware <hi rend="italic"
                    >(merx)</hi> given by one of the parties was so much rough copper weighed in the
                    scales. The substitution of coined money for the raw metal can hardly have
                    effected any radical change: the ordinary practice of those early times must
                    still have been ready-money transaction,—an instant exchange of ware for price;
                    and it can only have been when, for some reason or other, the arrangement was
                    exceptionally for delivery or payment at a future date, say next market day,
                    that obligation was held to have been created. Was that obligation enforcible by
                    the civil tribunals? Some jurists hold that it was,—that at no time were the <hi
                    rend="italic">jus gentium</hi> contracts outside the protection of judicial
                    remedies, although by a simpler procedure than that resorted to for enforcement
                    of the contracts of the jus <hi rend="italic">civile.</hi> But two provisions in
                    the XII. Tables seem to prove very clearly that it was not so enforcible. The
                    first is one recorded by Justinian,— that, where a thing was sold and delivered,
                    the property, nevertheless, was not to pass until the price had been paid or
                    sureties <hi rend="italic">(nodes)</hi> for it accepted by the vendor. Far from
                    being a recognition of the obligatory nature of the transaction, this provision
                    is really a recognition of the inability of the law to enforce payment of the
                    price by the vendee; it is a declaration that, on the latter’s failure to pay,
                    the vendor, unprotected by any personal action, should be entitled to get back
                    the thing sold as still his own, no matter in whose hands he found it. The
                    second related to the case of a person who had bought a victim for sacrifice,
                    but had failed to pay for it. A real action for its revindication by the seller
                    after it had been consumed on the altar was out of the question; so he was
                    authorized by the Tables, by the process of <hi rend="italic"> pignoris capio
                    (supra,</hi> p. 686), at his own hand to appropriate in satisfaction a
                    sufficient equivalent out of the belongings of the purchaser, against whom he
                    had no personal action.</p>
                <p>It was a principle of the law of Rome through the whole of its history, though in
                    course of time subject to an increasing number of exceptions, that mere
                    agreement between two persons did not give him in whose favour it was conceived
                    a right to demand its enforcement. To entitle a man to claim the intervention of
                    the civil tribunals to compel implement of an engagement undertaken by another,
                    it was necessary (subject to those exceptions) either that it should be clothed
                    in some form prescribed or recognized by the law, or that it should be
                    accompanied or followed by some relative act which rendered it something more
                    than a mere interchange of consent. Under the jurisprudence of the XII. Tables
                    the formalities required to elevate an agreement to the rank of contract and
                    make it civilly obligatory sometimes combined ceremonial act and words of style,
                    sometimes did not go beyond words of style, but ill all cases took place before
                    witnesses. <hi rend="italic">Dotis dictio,</hi> the undertaking of a parent to
                    provide a dowry with his daughter whom he was giving in marriage, and <hi

                    of the undertaking either of a party to a contract or a party to a litigation,
                    probably required nothing more than words of style before persons who could if
                    necessary bear witness to them; whereas an engagement incident to a mancipation,
                    or an undertaking to repay borrowed money, required in addition a ceremony with
                    the copper and the scales. This undertaking to repay arose from the contract of
                    <hi rend="italic">nexum,</hi> which was older than the Tables; both it and the
                    verbal contract by <hi rend="italic">sponsio</hi> or stipulation, which was
                    younger, merit further consideration. <hi rend="italic">The Nexal

                    tumults and seditions so frequent in Rome during the first two centuries of the
                    republic are more frequently attributed by the historians to the abuses of the
                    law of debt than to any other cause, social or political. The circumstances of
                    the poorer plebeians were such as to make it almost impossible to avoid
                    borrowing. Their scanty means were dependent on the regular cultivation of their
                    little acres, and on each operation of the agricultural year being performed in
                    proper rotation and at the proper season. But this was every now and again
                    interfered with by wars which detained them from home at seed-time or harvest,
                    practically rendering their farms unproductive and leaving them and their
                    families in straits for the commonest necessaries of life. A poor peasant, in
                    such a case, had no alternative but to apply to a capitalist for a loan. But it
                    was not to be had without security, and rarely without interest. It was not that
                    the lender doubted the borrower’s honesty and willingness to repay his debt; it
                    was rather that there was every chance that next year a fresh war might again
                    interfere with the latter’s agricultural operations, leave him again without a
                    crop, and thus render repayment impossible. And so, while interest accumulated
                    and was periodically added to capital, new loans had year after year to be
                    contracted as long as any acres remained that could serve as a security; failing
                    all things, the debtor had to impledge or hypothecate <hi rend="italic"

                    been burned, his cattle driven off, everything plundered, and at the same time,
                    unhappily for him, a tribute imposed; how first his ancestral lands had gone,
                    then his other property, and at last, like a wasting disease, it had come to his
                    body; how his creditor, instead of putting him to work <hi rend="italic"> (in

                    23). </p></note> for, phrase it how we may, this was substantially the result of
                    the contract of <hi rend="italic">nexum.</hi></p>
                <p>The practice of lending <hi rend="italic">per libram</hi> was doubtless of great
                    antiquity,—indeed the intervention of the scales was a necessity when money or
                    what passed for it had to be weighed instead of counted; and not improbably old
                    custom conceded to a lender who had thus made an advance in the presence of
                    witnesses some very summary and stringent remedy against a borrower who failed
                    in repayment. How Servius subjected it to much the same formalities as he
                    appointed for mancipation—the state scales, the official <hi rend="italic">
                    libripens,</hi> the five witnesses representing the nation—has been shown
                    already. With the introduction of a coinage the transaction, instead of being
                    <hi rend="italic">per libram</hi> simply, became one <hi rend="italic">per aes
                    et libram</hi>; the scales were touched with a single piece, representing the
                    money which had already been or was about to be paid, a formula recited whereby
                    the obligation of repayment was imposed on the borrower, and an appeal made to
                    the witnesses for their testimony. Unfortunately this formula is nowhere
                    preserved. Huschke and Giraud, assuming that the lender was the only speaker,
                    formulate it thus—“quod ego tibi mille libras hoc aere aeneaque libra nexas
                    dedi, eas tu mihi post annum jure nexi dare damrtas esto”—“whereas with this
                    coin and these copper scales I have given thee a thousand <hi rend="italic">
                    asses,</hi> be thou therefore bound <hi rend="italic">jure nexi</hi> to repay
                    them to me a year hence.” The phrase <hi rend="italic">damnas esto,</hi> like
                    the rest of the formula, is unsupported by any conclusive authority; but, as it
                    was that most frequently employed in the republic for imposing by a public act
                    liability to pay a fixed and definite sum, it may not be wide of the mark.</p>
                <p>What was the effect of this procedure? The question is one not easily answered.
                    Brinz has expressed the opinion that the creditor was entitled in virtue of the
                    <hi rend="italic">nexum</hi> to take his debtor into custody at any time when he

                    repayment,—that the debtor was in bonds, virtually a pledge, from the very
                    first, and the tightness or looseness of them a matter in the discretion of his
                    creditor. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Brinz, in

                    position of the <hi rend="italic">nexus</hi> to that of a thing—land,
                    say—mortgaged to a creditor in security of a claim. Such security the Roman
                    jurists constantly speak of as <hi rend="italic">res obligata,</hi> and
                    sometimes as <hi rend="italic">res nexa.</hi> As Brinz observes, the thing was
                    <hi rend="italic">obligata</hi> from the first, and continued so as long as the
                    debt it secured was unpaid, even though the creditor found it unnecessary to
                    reduce it into possession or interfere with it in any way. </p></note> Voigt
                    holds that the <hi rend="italic">ncxum</hi> did not give the creditor any
                    peculiar hold over his debtor, and that on the latter’s failure to repay an
                    ordinary action was necessary, to be followed by the usual proceedings in
                    execution if judgment was in favour of the former. These views may be said to be
                    the two extremes; and between them lie a good many others, more or less
                    divergent. The difficulty of arriving at a conclusion is caused to some extent
                    by the ambiguity of the words <hi rend="italic">nexus</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    > ncxum.</hi> The transaction itself was called b«k»»; the money advanced was
                    <hi rend="italic">ncxum acs</hi> (hence <hi rend="italic">ncxi, i.e., aeris
                    datio);</hi> the bond was <hi rend="italic">nexus</hi> (of the fourth
                    declension); and the debtor on whom the bond was laid was also <hi rend="italic"
                    >nexus</hi> (of the second). All this is simple enough. But we find the same
                    word <hi rend="italic">nexus</hi> employed by the historians as almost
                    synonymous with <hi rend="italic">vinctus,</hi> —to denote the condition of a
                    debtor put in fetters by his creditor. That might be the condition either of a
                    nexal borrower or of an ordinary judgment-debtor. The former in such a case was
                    doubly <hi rend="italic">nexus</hi>; he was at once in the bonds of legal
                    obligation and in those of physical constraint. In many passages in which Livy
                    and others speak of the <hi rend="italic">nexi</hi> it is extremely difficult,
                    sometimes impossible, to be sure in which sense they use the word. It is
                    therefore not surprising that there should be considerable diversity of opinion
                    on the subject, and such frequent identification of the legal status of a nexal
                    debtor <hi rend="italic">{nexus)</hi> with that of a judgment-debtor <hi

                    exception—concur in opinion that the nexal contract entitled the creditor, after
                    expiry of thirty days from the conventional date of repayment of the loan, to
                    proceed against his debtor by <hi rend="italic">manus injectio</hi> without any
                    antecedent action or judgment, and failing settlement to detain him, and put him
                    to servile labour and subject him to servile treatment, until the loan was
                    repaid. The parallel of such a course is to be met with amongst all ancient
                    nations,—Jews, Greeks, Scandinavians, Germans, &amp;c <note anchored="true"

                    services so many days a week, and shall have power to inflict corporal
                    punishment if there be dilatoriness in rendering them. </p></note> And it was
                    not altogether unreasonable. If a borrower had already exhausted all available
                    means of raising money, had sold or mortgaged everything he possessed of any
                    value, what other course was open to him in his necessity except to im-pledge
                    himself? That the creditor should have been entitled to realize the right he had
                    thus acquired without the judgment on it of a court of law is equally
                    intelligible: The nexal contract was a public act, carried out in the presence
                    of the representatives of the people, who Were witnesses alike of the
                    acknowledgment of indebtedness and of the tacit engagement of the debtor. The
                    only valid objection that could be stated against the creditor’s apprehension of
                    his debtor in execution was that the indebtedness no longer existed, —that the
                    loan had been repaid. But a nexal debt could be legally discharged only by <hi
                    rend="italic">nexi liberatio,</hi> which also was a solemn procedure <hi
                    rend="italic">per acs et libram</hi> in the presence of five citizen witnesses.
                    What need for a judicial inquiry in the presence of facts so notorious? A
                    creditor would rarely be daring enough to proceed to <hi rend="italic">manus
                    injectio</hi> if his loan had been repaid; if he did, the testimony of the
                    witnesses to the discharge would at once procure the release of his alleged
                    debtor. It was probably to give opportunity for such proof, if there was room
                    for it, that the XII. Tables required that a creditor who had apprehended a
                    nexal debtor should bring him into court before carrying him off into
                    detention.</p>
                <p>But there was no room for the intervention of a <hi rend="italic">vindex</hi> or
                    champion, for there was no judgment whose regularity he could impugn. Nor was
                    there any room for a magisterial <hi rend="italic">addictio</hi> of the debtor
                    to his creditor; for the latter’s right of detention was founded on contract,
                    and needed no decree to strengthen it. The creditor was entitled at once, after
                    apprehension of his debtor and production of him in court in terms of the
                    statute, to carry him home with him, take such steps as were necessary to ensure
                    his safe custody, and employ his services in profitable industry. But that he
                    could kill him or sell him, as some suppose, is a proposition that is destitute
                    of any authority to support it. Equally untenable is the notion that the <hi
                    rend="italic">nexus</hi> became a slave, or that, while retaining his freedom,
                    his wife, children, and belongings fell with him into the hands of his creditor.
                    He certainly was not in a worse position than an <hi rend="italic">
                    addictus,</hi> of whom Quintilian states distinctly that he still retained his
                    position in the census and in his tribe. Many a time, when the exigencies of the
                    state required it, were the <hi rend="italic">ncxi</hi> temporarily released in
                    order to obey a call to arms,—to fulfil the duty incumbent on them as citizens.
                    In fact a nexal debtor suffered no <hi rend="italic"> capitis demin-•utio</hi>
                    at all because of his detention. If he was a house-father he still retained his
                    <hi rend="italic">manus</hi> over his wife and <hi rend="italic">potestas</hi>
                    over his children. But they did not share his quasi-servitude. Their earnings
                    legally belonged to him, but were no doubt retained by them with his consent for
                    their own support. They certainly did not fall to his creditor. It was the body
                    of his debtor that he was entitled to, and too often he wreaked his vengeance on
                    it by way of punishment; there was as yet no machinery for attaching the
                    debtor’s goods in substantial reparation for the loss caused by his breach of
                    contract.</p>
                <p>The abuses to which the system gave rise alike in the case of nexal and of
                    judgment debtors have already been alluded to. In the year 428 a more than
                    ordinarily flagrant outrage committed by a creditor upon one of his young <hi
                    rend="italic"> nexi,</hi> who, Livy says, had given himself up as responsible
                    for a loan contracted by his deceased father, roused the populace to such a
                    pitch of indignation as to necessitate instant remedial legislation. The result
                    was the Poe-tilian law <hi rend="italic">{Lex Poetilia Papiria).</hi> So far as
                    can be gathered from the meagre accounts of it we possess, it contained at least
                    these three provisions—(1) that fetters and neck, arm, or foot blocks should in
                    future be applied only to persons undergoing imprisonment for crime or delict;
                    (2) that no one should ever again be the <hi rend="italic"> nexus</hi> of his
                    creditor in respect of borrowed money; and (3) that all existing <hi
                    rend="italic">nexi qui bonam copiami jurarent</hi> should be released. The first
                    was intended to prevent unnecessary restraint upon judgment-debtors formally
                    given over to their creditors. The second did not necessarily abolish the
                    contract of loan <hi rend="italic">per acs et libram,</hi> but only what had
                    hitherto been an <hi rend="italic">ipso jure</hi> consequence of it,—the
                    creditor’s right to incarcerate his debtor without either the judgment of a
                    court or the warrant of a magistrate. For the future, execution was to be done
                    against a borrower only as a judgment-debtor formally made over to his creditor
                    by magisterial decree, and under the restrictions and limitations imposed by the
                    Poetilian law itself. This very soon led to the disuse of nexal obligation; once
                    it was deprived of its distinctive processual advantages it rapidly gave place
                    to the simpler engagement by stipulation enforceable <hi rend="italic">per
                    con-dictionem.</hi> As for the release of the then existing <hi rend="italic"
                    >nexi,</hi> Cicero, Livy, and Dionysius say nothing of any condition annexed to
                    the boon the statute conferred upon them; it is only'Varrò who limits it to
                    those <hi rend="italic">qui bonam copiam jurarunt,—</hi> those apparently who
                    were able to declare on oath that they had done their best and could do no more
                    to meet their creditors’ claims. Such a limitation can hardly be called
                    unreasonable, even were we to assume—as probably we ought to do—that the release
                    spoken of was only from the bonds of physical restraint, not from those of legal
                    obligation.</p>

                    history of the private law were followed by more far-reaching consequences than
                    the introduction of the stipulation. It exercised an enormous influence on the
                    law of contract; for by means of it there was created a unilateral obligation
                    that in time became adaptable to almost every conceivable undertaking by one man
                    in favour of another. By the use of certain words of style in the form of
                    question and answer any lawful agreement could thereby be made not only morally
                    but legally binding, so that much which previously had no other guarantee than a
                    man’s sense of honour now passed directly under the protection of the tribunals.
                    Stipulations became the complement of engagements which without them rested
                    simply on good faith, as when a vendor gave his stipulatory promise to his
                    vendee to guarantee peaceable possession of the thing sold or its freedom from
                    faults, and the vendee in turn gave his promise for payment of the price. The
                    question and answer in the form prescribed by law made the engagement fast and
                    sure. Hence the generic name of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n718/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0718-0695"/>contract; for Paul’s derivation of it from <hi
                    rend="italic">stipulum, “</hi> firm,” is much to be preferred to the earlier and
                    more fanciful ones from <hi rend="italic"> stips</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >stipula.</hi> It was round the stipulation that the jurists grouped most of
                    their disquisitions upon the general doctrines of the law of contract,—capacity
                    of parties, requisites of consent, consequences of fraud, error, and
                    intimidation, effects of conditions and specifications of time, and so forth. It
                    may well be said, therefore, that its introduction marked an epoch in the
                    history of the law.</p>
                <p>There is, however, no certainty either as to the time or as to the manner of its
                    introduction. So far as appears it was unknown at the time of the compilation of
                    the XII. Tables, at least in private life; one of the first unmistakable
                    allusions to it is in the Aquilian law of 476 u.c. The mention of it in that
                    enactment, however, is with regard to a phase of it which cannot have been
                    reached for many years after it had come into use; and the probability is that
                    it originated before the middle of the 5th century, its first statutory
                    recognition being in the Silian law introducing the <hi rend="italic">legis
                    actio per condictionem {supra,</hi> p. 683). In its earliest days it bore the
                    name not of <hi rend="italic">stipulatio</hi> but of <hi rend="italic"
                    >sponsio,</hi> for the reason that the interrogatory of the party becoming
                    creditor was invariably formulated with the word <hi rend="italic">spondes—c.g.,
                    centum dare spondes t—</hi> while the answer was simply <hi rend="italic">
                    spondeo.</hi></p>
                <p>There has been much speculation as to the origin of the contract. Modern
                    criticism has three theories,—(1) that it was the verbal remnant of the <hi
                    rend="italic"> nexum,</hi> after the business with the copper and the scales had
                    gone into disuse; (2) that it was evolved out of the oath at the great altar of
                    Hercules and the appeal to Fides <hi rend="italic">{supra,</hi> p. 675); (3)
                    that it was imported from Latium, which it had reached from some of the Greek
                    settlements farther south. The last view is the most probable. Verrius Flaccus,
                    as quoted by Festus, connects it with the Greek <hi rend="italic"
                    >anevbeu&gt;</hi> and <hi rend="italic">airovSn</hi>; and Gaius incidentally
                    observes that it was said to be of Greek origin. A libation <hi rend="italic">
                    {trirovS-ti)</hi> is frequently referred to by Homer and Herodotus as an
                    accompaniment of treaties and other solemn covenants,— a common offering by the
                    parties to the gods which imparted sanctity to the transaction. Leist <note

                    </p></note> is of opinion that the practice passed into Sicily and Lower Italy,
                    but that gradually the libation and orher religious features were dropped,
                    although the word <hi rend="italic">airouSg</hi> was retained in the sense of an
                    engagement that bound parties just as if the old ritual had been observed, and
                    that it travelled northward into Latium and thence to Home under the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">sponsio,</hi> being used in the first instance in public life for
                    the conclusion of treaties, and afterwards in private life for the conclusion of
                    contracts. The meaning of <hi rend="italic"> spondes</hi> as a question by a
                    creditor to his debtor (although latterly, we may well believe, unknown to them)
                    thus came to be—“Do you engage as solemnly as if the old ceremonial were gone
                    through between us?” There are many examples of such simplification of terms,
                    none more familiar than when a man says—“I give you my oath upon it,” without
                    either himself or the individual addressed thinking it necessary to go through
                    the form.</p>
                <p>It is not a little remarkable that, although the idea was derived from abroad,
                    the use of the words <hi rend="italic">spondes</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >spondeo</hi> in contracting were, down at least to the time of Gaius, confined
                    in Rome to Roman citizens. The <hi rend="italic">sponsio</hi> as a form of
                    contract was essentially <hi rend="italic">juris civilis.</hi> So at first were
                    the later and less solemn forms of stipulation,— <hi rend="italic">promittisne?
                    promitto, dabisne 1 dabo,</hi> and the like. Gaius speaks of these <hi
                    rend="italic">as juris gentium, i.e.,</hi> binding even between Romans and
                    peregrins. Such they became eventually, but not until towards the end of the
                    republic. Yet, although <hi rend="italic">juris civilis,</hi> both the <hi
                    rend="italic">sponsio</hi> and the later forms were from the first free from
                    many of the impediments of the earlier <hi rend="italic">actus legitimi.</hi> No
                    witnesses were required to assist at them; and they were always susceptible of
                    qualification by conditions and terms. It was very long, however, before parties
                    had much latitude in their choice of language <hi rend="italic">; spondeo</hi>
                    was so peculiarly solemn that no equivalent could be admitted; and even the
                    later styles may be said to have remained stereotyped until well on in the
                    empire. And it was the use of the words of style that made the contract. It was
                    formal, not material; that is to say, action lay upon the promise the words
                    embodied, apart from any consideration whether or not value had been given for
                    it. In time this serious disadvantage was abated; first by introducing in
                    certain cases words that excluded action in presence of fraud, antecedent or
                    subsequent, on the part of the creditor, and afterwards by praetorian
                    exceptions, such as a plea of “no value,” or by having the contract set aside on
                    the motion of the nominal debtor before proceedings had been taken upon it by
                    the creditor. Originally the stipulation was employed only in regard to
                    engagements whose terms were in every respect definite and certain, and was
                    enforced by the <hi rend="italic">legis actio per condictionem.</hi> But in time
                    it came to be employed in engagements that were from the first indefinite. This
                    seems to have been due to the intervention of the praetors, and to have
                    originated after the system of the <hi rend="italic"> legis actiones</hi> had
                    begun to give place to that <hi rend="italic"> per formulas.</hi> The remedy in
                    such a case was not spoken of as a condiction but as an <hi rend="italic">actio
                    ex stipulate.</hi></p>

                    be admitted that commerce was beginning to take root in Rome in the 5th century,
                    yet it was not until the 6th that it really became of importance. The campaigns
                    in which Rome was engaged until the end of the First Punic War absorbed all its
                    energies. But after that time the influx of strangers, and their settlement in
                    the city for purposes of trade, became very rapid,—first Latins and other
                    allies, and afterwards Greeks, Carthaginians, and Asiatics. For them and the
                    regulation of their affairs the <hi rend="italic">jus civile—</hi> the law
                    peculiar to Rome and its citizens— was applicable only if they were members of

                    >recuperatio</hi> were guaranteed by treaty. But multitudes were not in this
                    favoured position; and even those who were soon found the range of Roman modes
                    of acquiring property and contracting obligations too narrow for their
                    requirements. Hence a <hi rend="italic">jus gentium</hi> was gradually developed

                    non-citizens or between citizens and non-citizens, but it was eventually
                    accepted in the dealings of citizens <hi rend="italic"> inter se</hi> and became

                    or institution after another that was found to be generally current elsewhere.
                    In the earliest stages of its recognition it was “an independent international
                    private law, which, as such, regulated intercourse between peregrins or between

                    year 387 u.c. Down to the end of the 5th century the praetor then appointed
                    superintended single-handed the administration of justice, alike between
                    citizens and foreigners. But with the altered condition of things in the
                    beginning of the 6th century, and the influx of strangers which has already been
                    alluded to, the "work seems to have been found too onerous for a single
                    magistrate, and a second praetor was appointed. The date is not absolutely
                    certain, although generally assumed to have been about the year 512 u.c.; but
                    Pomponius says distinctly that the creation of the new office was rendered
                    necessary by the increase of the peregrin population of Rome, and that the new
                    magistrate got the name of <hi rend="italic">praetor peregrinus</hi> because his
                    principal duty was to dispense justice to this foreign element. After the
                    submission of Sicily and Sardinia the number of the praetors was increased to
                    four and after the conquest of Spain to six; Sulla raised the number to eight,
                    and Caesar eventually to sixteen. But all the later creations were for special
                    purposes; the ordinary administration of justice within the city was left with
                    the representatives for the time of the two earliest, who came to be
                    distinguished as <hi rend="italic">prraetor urbanus (qui jus inter cives
                    dicit)</hi> and <hi rend="italic">praetor peregrinus.</hi> It would be going too
                    far to speak of the latter as the principal author of the <hi rend="italic">jus
                    gentium;</hi> for a large proportion of the actions for enforcing <hi
                    rend="italic">jus gentium</hi> rights were civil, not honorary,—a fact which
                    proves that the rights they were meant to protect and enforce had their origin
                    in the <hi rend="italic">jus civile,</hi> although moulded to meet new
                    requirements by tacit consuetude and the agency of the jurists. But even in this
                    view the peregrin praetor must have had a powerful influence in giving shape and
                    consistency to the rising jurisprudence, by means of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >formulae</hi> he adjusted for giving it practical effect.</p>

                    twice mentioned by ancient writers, and we know neither its precise date nor its
                    specific provisions. And yet, to judge by its effects, it must have been one of
                    the most important pieces of comitial legislation in the latter half of the
                    republic; for Gellius speaks of it as having given the deathblow to many of the
                    institutions of the XII. Tables, and Gaius couples it with two Julian law’s as
                    the statutory instruments whereby the formular system of procedure was
                    substituted for that <hi rend="italic">per legis actiones.</hi> The probability
                    is that it was enacted immediately or soon after the institution of the peregrin
                    prsetorship. Its purpose, whatever may have been its terms, seems to have been
                    to empower the prsetors to adapt existing remedies to altered circumstances, and
                    to fashion new actions on the <hi rend="italic">jus civile</hi> for the use of
                    the peregrins to whom the procedure of the <hi rend="italic"> legis
                    actiones</hi> was incompetent; while it may possibly at the same time have
                    expressly authorized the insertion in the styles to be devised by them of
                    clauses that would give protection when required against claims that in law were
                    well founded but in fact inequitable. But, whatever may have been the actual
                    provisions of the statute, the result was the introduction of a procedure which
                    gradually supplanted that by the “actions of the law,” which was much more
                    pliant than the latter, and whose characteristic was this,—that, instead of the
                    issue being declared by w’ord of mouth by the parties, and requiring in many
                    cases to embody with perfect accuracy the statutory provision upon which it was
                    based, it was now formulated in writing by the praetor, in the shape of an
                    instruction to the judge to inquire and consider, with power to condemn or
                    acquit according to his finding (see <hi rend="italic">infra,</hi> p. 707).</p>

                    unknown, and which thus helped to foster the <hi rend="italic">jus gentium,</hi>
                    was no doubt due to a large extent to provincial conquests. But these operated
                    also in other directions. The authorities who ftroceeded to the conquered
                    provinces as governors found themselves ace to face with laws and institutions
                    in many respects differing from those of Rome. Political considerations dictated
                    how far these were to be respected, how far subverted. In some provinces, more
                    especially the Eastern ones, it was thought unnecessary to do more than
                    supplement the existing system by the importation of doctrines of the <hi
                    rend="italic">jus gentium</hi> and the procedure of the praetor’s edicts; while
                    in others, in which it was deemed expedient to destroy as rapidly as possible
                    all national feeling and every national rallying point, a Romanizing of all
                    their institutions was resorted to, even to the extent of introducing some of
                    the formal transactions which previously had been confined to citizens. But in
                    either case there was a reflex action. The native institution had to be studied,
                    its advantages and disadvantages balanced, the means considered of adapting it
                    to the preetorian procedure, and the new ideas so presented as to make them
                    harmonize as far as possible with the old. All this was a training of no small
                    value for those who, on their return to Rome, were to exercise an influence on
                    legislation and the administration of the law. They brought back with them not
                    merely an experience they could not have obtained at home, but sometimes a
                    familiarity with foreign institutions that they were very willing to acclimatize
                    in Italy. Rome thus enriched its law from the provinces, deriving from them its
                    emphyteutic tenure of land, its hypothec, its Rhodian law of general average,
                    and a variety of other features that were altogether novel. Some of them were
                    sanctioned by tacit recognition, others by edicts of the prsetors; but, in
                    whatever way received, they were indirectly fruits of provincial conquest.</p>

                    conscientiously undertaken, contributed greatly to promote a new departure in
                    jurisprudence that became very marked in the time of Cicero—the desire to
                    subordinate form to substance, the word spoken to the will it was meant to
                    manifest, the abstract rule to the individual case to which it was proposed to
                    apply it. This was the first effort of what then was called equity to temper and
                    keep within bounds the rigour of the <hi rend="italic"> jus strictum.</hi> The
                    prsetors, the judges, and the jurisconsults all had their share in it. Although
                    modern jurists are prone to speak of praetorian equity as if it were a thing
                    apart, yet the same spirit was leavening the law in all directions and in the
                    hands of all who had to deal with it, the difference being that the form and
                    publicity of the edict gave to its applications by the prsetors a more prominent
                    and enduring record than was found in the decisions of <hi rend="italic">private
                    judices</hi> or the opinions of counselling jurisconsults.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Decline of Religion and Morals.—</hi> It would be equally out
                    of place to enlarge here on the causes and manifestations of that decline in
                    religious sentiment and public and private virtue which was fraught with such
                    disastrous results in the later days of the republic. The private law was
                    influenced by it to a considerable extent, alike in those branches which
                    regulated the domestic relations and those which dealt with property and
                    contract.</p>
                <p>The ever-increasing disregard of the sanctity of the marriage tie is one of those
                    features in the history of the period which strikes even the most unobservant.
                    While from the first the law had denounced causeless separation and visited it
                    with penalties, in principle it maintained the perfect freedom of divorce,—that
                    it was improper to force persons to continue in the bonds of matrimony between
                    whom matrimonial affection no longer existed. With the simple and frugal habits
                    of the first five centuries <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0720-0697"/>of Rome, and the surveillance of the <hi
                    rend="italic">consilium domesticum,</hi> the recognition of this principle
                    produced no evil results; family misunderstandings were easily smoothed over,
                    and divorces were of rare occurrence. But from the time of the enactment of the
                    Maenian law in 586 there seems to have been a change for the worse. It <hi
                    rend="italic">inter alia</hi> displaced the family council as a divorce court
                    and transferred its functions in that matter to <hi rend="italic">a, judicium de
                    moribus,—a</hi> court of inquiry nominated by the praetor, and having as its
                    duty to decide to what extent there should be forfeiture of the nuptial
                    provisions in case of separation or repudiation. The motives of the statute may
                    have been of the best; but its tendency was injurious, for not only did it
                    indirectly facilitate divorce, but it rendered the idea of it familiar, and
                    overthrew that respect for the domestic council which had hitherto been a check
                    upon it. What wonder that with increasing luxury and licentiousness divorce
                    became so common!</p>
                <p>This looseness of the marriage bond, as was naturally to be expected, had its
                    effect on the other family relations. The obligation of a father to provide for
                    his children began to be lightly esteemed. The law—possibly only the
                    interpretation put upon the <hi rend="italic">uti legassit</hi> of the XII.
                    Tables— had empowered him testamentarily to disinherit them, or in instituting
                    them to limit their right to a mere fraction of the inheritance; but it was
                    assumed that this power would be exercised with discretion and only when
                    justified by circumstances. But in the latter days of the republic, amid the
                    slackened ties of domestic life, paternal as well as conjugal duty seems to have
                    often been lost sight of, and children disinherited or cut off with a nominal
                    share of the inheritance in order that a stranger might be enriched. This led to
                    the introduction by the centumviral court, without any legislative enactment or
                    praetor’s edict to warrant it, of what was called the <hi rend="italic">querela
                    inofficiosi testamenti,—</hi> challenge of a testament by a child whose natural
                    claims had been capriciously and causelessly disregarded. While the practice may
                    for a time have been hesitating and uncertain, yet before long, through means of
                    this <hi rend="italic">querela,</hi> the rule came to be established that every
                    child was entitled, notwithstanding the terms of his father’s testament, to at
                    least a fourth <hi rend="italic">(gportio legitima, quarta legitima,</hi> the
                    legitim of the law of Scotland and various Continental countries) of what would
                    have come to him had his parent died intestate, unless it appeared that the
                    latter had had adequate grounds for excluding him or limiting him to a smaller
                    share. A parent might in like manner challenge an undutiful testament made by
                    his child to his prejudice; and in certain cases so might brothers and sisters
                    <hi rend="italic">inter se.</hi></p>
                <p>The decline of morals had an equally marked effect on the transactions of daily
                    life, calling for precautions and remedies that had not been found requisite in
                    the hey-day of the <hi rend="smallcaps">twv ' Pw/zatwr. Men no longer relied on
                    each other’s good faith unless backed by stipulations, cautions</hi><hi

                    arrangements and the <hi rend="italic">actio Pauliana</hi> for setting aside
                    alienations in fraud of creditors indicate a laxity in mercantile dealings that
                    was perhaps an inevitable consequence of the growth of trade and commerce. But,
                    that such remedies as, for example, the <hi rend="italic">exceptio rei venditae
                    et traditae</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">exceptio non numeratae pecuniae</hi>
                    should have been found necessary—the one an answer to a vendor (with the price
                    in his pocket) who attempted to dispossess his vendee because some of the
                    formalities of conveyance had been neglected, the other an answer to an action
                    on a bond for repayment of money that by some accident had never been
                    advanced—proves that the law had now to encounter fraud in all directions, and
                    that <hi rend="italic">Graeca fides</hi> had to a great extent displaced the old
                    Roman probity.</p>
                <p>II. Factors of the Law.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Legislation.—</hi> It cannot be said that during the period of
                    nearly two centuries and a half embraced within the present chapter the private
                    law owed much to legislation. The vast majority of the enactments of the time
                    referred to by the historians dealt with constitutional questions, municipal and
                    colonial government, agrarian arrangements, fiscal policy, sumptuary
                    prohibitions, criminal and police regulations, and other matters that affected
                    the public law rather than the private. Those of the latter class mentioned by
                    Gaius and Ulpian in their institutional works barely exceed a score in number;
                    and of these not above half a dozen can be said to have exercised a permanent
                    influence on the principles (as distinguished from the details) of the law. Most
                    of them were enactments of the <hi rend="italic">concilium plebis or of</hi> the
                    comitia of the tribes, to which ordinary legislation had passed as more readily
                    convened and more easily worked than the comitia of the centuries.</p>

                    rend="italic">1 —</hi> The practice of propounding edicts was very ancient, and
                    had been followed by kings and consuls long before the institution of the
                    praetorship. It was one of the most obvious ways of exercising the <hi
                    rend="italic"> imperium</hi> with which the supreme magistrate was invested,—to
                    lay an injunction upon a citizen and enforce his obedience, or to confer upon
                    him some advantage and maintain him in its enjoyment. It was one of the ways in
                    which public order was protected where there had been no invasion of what the
                    law regarded as a right, and where, consequently, there was no remedy by action.
                    That the earlier edicts of the praetors were of this character—issued, that is
                    to say, with reference to particular cases, and what afterwards came to be
                    called <hi rend="italic">edicta repentina</hi> or <hi rend="italic"> prout res
                    incidit posita—</hi> there is little reason to doubt. In time a new class of
                    edicts appeared which got the name of <hi rend="italic"> edicta perpetua</hi>
                    (or <hi rend="italic">perpetuae jurisdictionis causa proposita),—</hi>
                    announcements by the praetor, published on his album (as the white boards
                    displayed for the purpose in the forum were called), of the relief he would be
                    prepared to grant on the application of any one alleging that the state of facts
                    contemplated had arisen. The next year’s praetor was free to adopt the edicts of
                    his predecessor or not; but it was usual for him to do so if they had been found
                    beneficial in practice, he adding to them new provisions suggested by demands
                    made upon past praetors for <hi rend="italic">edicta repentina</hi> but which
                    they had not generalized, or even proposing for acceptance some remedy entirely
                    of his own devising. As each new praetor entered upon office he announced his
                    jurisdictional programme,—his <hi rend="italic">lex annua,</hi> as it was called
                    from this particular point of view, by far the greater part of it <hi
                    rend="italic"> tralaticiivm, i.e.,</hi> transmitted from his predecessors, and
                    only a few paragraphs, diminishing in number as time progressed, representing
                    his own contribution. And so it went on in the first years of the empire, until
                    the praetorian function was eclipsed by the imperial; and at last, after having,
                    by instruction of Hadrian, been subjected to revision, and consolidated with the
                    edicts of the peregrin praetors and provincial governors, it was sanctioned as
                    statute law for the empire through the medium of a senatusconsult.</p>
                <p>There is some reason for supposing that the edict attained considerable
                    proportions in the time of Cicero; for he mentions that, whereas in his youth
                    the XII. Tables had been taught to the boys in school, in his later years these
                    were neglected, and young men directed instead to the praetor’s edicts for their
                    first lessons in law’. Of a few of them the date and authorship are known with
                    tolerable precision; but of the history of the majority, including some of the
                    most important, such as those introducing <hi rend="italic">restitutio in
                    integrum</hi> on the ground of lesion through error, absence, minority, and the
                    like, and those revolutionizing the law of succession, we are to a great extent
                    in the dark. It is not necessary to assume either that the Julian consolidation
                    exhibits all the provisions that from first to last appeared on the album, or
                    that those preserved in it were originally in the shape in which they are there
                    presented. It is much more likely that we have in it only those that had stood
                    the test of generations, and that many of them are the result of the combined
                    wisdom and experience of a series of praetors. It was one of the great
                    advantages the edicts had over legislative enactments that they might be
                    dropped, resumed, or amended by a new praetor according to his judgment of
                    public requirements. For the edict w’as <hi rend="italic">viva vox juris
                    civilis,—</hi> intended to aid, supplement, and correct it in accordance with
                    the ever-changing estimate of public necessities; and this would have been
                    impossible had its provisions from the first been as stereotyped as they became
                    by the consolidation in the time of Hadrian.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Edict</hi> seems to have contained two parts,—the first
                    what may be called the edict or edicts proper, and the second an appendix of
                    styles of actions, &amp;c., whether derived from the <hi rend="italic">jus
                    civile</hi> or from the <hi rend="italic">jus praetorium.</hi> The contents of
                    the edict proper were in detail very various, but all devoted to an exposition
                    of the ways in which the praetor meant to exercise his jurisdiction during his
                    year <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n721/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0721-0698"/>of office. They were not didactic or dogmatic
                    formulations of law, but rather announcements or advertisements of what remedy
                    he would grant in such and such circumstances, or direct orders to do or
                    prohibitions against doing certain things. A party claiming an action or
                    whatever else it might be under any of them did so not of right, as he would
                    have done had his claim had a statutory or customary foundation, but of
                    grace,—on the strength of the praetor’s promise to grant him what he claimed and
                    make the grant effectual. That was why originally such an action had to be
                    raised and concluded within the particular praetor’s year of office,—a rule
                    which in time, by abuse, was converted into the somewhat different one that a
                    purely praetorian action <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> not originally of the <hi
                    rend="italic">jus civile,</hi> even though remodelled and regulated by the
                    praetor) had to be raised within a year of the occurrence to which it
                    referred.</p>
                <p>As already observed, the praetors’ edicts proceeded to a greater extent than the
                    earlier legislation of the comitia upon lines of equity; that is to say, they
                    set themselves against the strictness and formalism of the jurisprudence of the
                    XII. Tables. Such may be said to have been the general tendency of the edicts as
                    a whole. But it was the tendency of the whole jurisprudence of the time, and by
                    no means peculiar to the praetorian creation. Nowhere in the texts are the
                    praetors spoken of as the mouthpieces of equity as distinguished from law. Such
                    a distinction recurs frequently in Cicero; he identifies <hi rend="italic"
                    >aequitas</hi> with the spirit of a law or agreement, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >jus</hi> with its letter, but it is in order to sing the praises not of the
                    praetors but of the pleaders who maintained the former as against the latter,
                    and of the judges who were persuaded by their arguments. Much of what was
                    contained in the <hi rend="italic">Edict</hi> might quite as well have been
                    embodied in statute, and we know that in time statute came to its aid; witness a
                    very remarkable provision of it,—“I will give <hi rend="italic">bonorum
                    posscssio</hi> as may be enjoined by statute, whether comitial enactment or
                    senatusconsult.”</p>
                <p>Of the edicts of the peregrin praetor and their relation to that of his urban
                    colleague little is known. That they differed in some respects there can be no
                    doubt, for in the <hi rend="italic">Lex Rubria</hi> (of 706 ?) for settling the
                    government of Cisalpine Gaul the magistrates are directed, with reference to a
                    certain action, to formulate it in the way prescribed in the edict of the
                    peregrin praetor. The latter, therefore, must to some extent have been in
                    advance of that of the urban praetor, probably in this respect, that, being
                    prepared primarily for the regulation of questions affecting non-citizens, it
                    more thoroughly than the other avoided formalities that were competent only to
                    citizens, and thus to a greater extent simplified procedure. The edicts of the
                    provincial governors must have varied according to circumstances, being in all
                    cases composites of provisions, more or less numerous, borrowed from the edicts
                    of the praetors and additions suggested by the peculiar wants of the different
                    provinces for which they were framed <hi rend="italic">(provinciate genus

                    were charged with the supervision of markets, their range was very limited,
                    their most important provisions having reference to open sales of slaves,
                    horses, and cattle, and containing regulations about the duties of vendors
                    exposing them, and their responsibility for latent faults and vices.</p>

                    Judicatae.—</hi> Great as may be the difficulty experienced by philosophical
                    jurists in defining the ground of the authority of consuetudinary law, there is
                    no room to dispute the importance of its contributions to every system of
                    jurisprudence ancient and modern. The men who first drew, accepted, and endorsed
                    a bill of exchange did as much for the law as any lawgiver has ever
                    accomplished. They may or may not have acted on the advice of jurists; but,
                    whether or not, they began a practice which grew into custom, and as such was
                    recognized by the tribunals as a law-creating one,—one conferring rights and
                    imposing obligations. There is much of this—far more probably than is commonly
                    imagined—in the history of every system of law.</p>
                <p>In Rome the process was sometimes wonderfully expeditious; witness what Justinian
                    narrates of the introduction and recognition of testamentary trusts and of
                    codicils to last wills, both in the time of Augustus. It can hardly be doubted
                    that the literal contract <hi rend="italic">per expensilationem</hi> originated
                    in the same way, probably in the end of the 5th or the beginning of the 6th
                    century. The keeping of domestic account-books may have been enjoined and
                    enforced by the censors; but it was custom, and neither statute nor praetor’s
                    edict, that made an entry in them to another person’s debit creative of a claim
                    against the latter <hi rend="italic">ior certa pecunia crcdita,</hi> that might
                    be made effectual by an action under the Silian law. It must have been in
                    exactly the same way that <hi rend="italic">mutuum,</hi> formless loan of money,
                    came to be regarded as the third variety of <hi rend="italic">certa credita
                    pecunia,</hi> and to be held recoverable under the same action. True, this could
                    not have been attained without the co-operation of the courts. But then those
                    courts were composed each of a single private citizen, whose office ended with
                    his judgment in the particular case remitted to him, and who was untrammelled by
                    the authority of any <hi rend="italic">series rerum judicalarum.</hi><note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It was not until the empire
                    that a “series reruni perpetuo similiter juiliea-taruni," a uniform series of
                    precedents, was held to be law. During the republic a judge was much freer, and
                    not only entitled but bound to decide according to his own notion of what was
                    right, taking the risk of consequences if his judgment was knowingly contrary to
                    law. </p></note> He had simply to decide whether in his view expensilation or
                    formless loan created such an obligation as was covered by the words <hi
                    rend="italic">pecuniam dari oportere.</hi> There may for a time have been a
                    divergent practice, contradictory findings, as Cicero says there were in his day
                    upon the question whether <hi rend="italic">aequitas</hi> or <hi rend="italic">
                    jus strictum</hi> was to be applied to the determination of certain matters; but
                    the gradual ascendency and eventual unanimity of judicial opinion in the
                    affirmative was but the expression of the general sentiment of the citizens, of
                    whom the <hi rend="italic">judiccs</hi> were the representatives.</p>
                <p>These are but examples of the way in which consuetudinary law was constructed. It
                    required the combined action of the laity and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >judiccs,</hi> both at times acting under professional advice; in some cases
                    even that of the praetors was necessary. It would have been impossible, for
                    instance, to have introduced the consensual contracts into the Roman system and
                    determined what were the obligations they imposed on either side, without
                    magisterial cooperation in framing the <hi rend="italic">formulae</hi> that were
                    to be submitted to the judges. Taking the action on sale as an illustration, the
                    formula substantially was this :—“It being averred that the defendant sold such
                    or such a thing to the plaintiff, whatever, judge, it shall appear that the
                    defendant ought in good faith to give to or do for the plaintiff in respect
                    thereof, in the money equivalent thereof condemn the defendant; otherwise,
                    acquit him.” It is very manifest that the free hand here given to the judge must
                    immensely have facilitated the reception of customary doctrine into the law. The
                    judge was to a great extent the spokesman of the forum; his judgment was formed
                    in accordance with current public opinion, which he had ample opportunity of
                    gauging; it was the reflexion of that general sentiment of right, which, phrase
                    it how we may, is the real basis of all customary law. And so in an action for
                    establishing a right of property in a <hi rend="italic">res nec mancipi.</hi>
                    The formula was very simple :—“If it appear that such or such a thing belongs to
                    the plaintiff in quiritary right, then, judge, whatever be its value for the
                    plaintiff, in that condemn the defendant; should it appear otherwise, acquit
                    him.” The primary duty of a judge on such a remit was to determine whether the
                    title on which the plaintiff founded his pretensions gave him a right that came
                    up to property; and it can hardly be disputed that it was by the decisions of a
                    series of judges, in a series of such actions, that the long list of natural
                    modes of acquiring property given by Justinian under technical names was
                    gradually brought into view. Those decisions, whether upon the obligations of a
                    vendor, direct or indirect, or upon the sufficiency of a title founded on by a
                    party averring a right of property by natural acquisition, may in many cases
                    have been arrived at under professional advice, and were in all cases embodied
                    in judgments. But that does not in the least deprive the doctrine deduced from
                    them of its character of customary law. It was not until the empire that the
                    opinions of the jurists submitted to a judge <hi rend="italic">(responsa
                    prudentium,</hi> see p. 705) were invested with quasi-legislative authority.
                    During the republic, if a judge deferred to them, it was simply because he
                    regarded them as in consonance with well-qualified public opinion; and what a
                    series of consistent judgments <hi rend="italic">of this sort</hi> built up was
                    in the strictest sense a law based on consuetude. <note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The doctrines of the classical jurists as to
                    the necessity of <hi rend="italic">longa, inveterata consuetude,</hi> and so

                    fact refer not to general consuetude but to particular custom when founded on in
                    derogation of the common law. </p></note></p>
                <p>As regards the professional jurists in particular it has already been observed
                    that, according to the testimony of the historians, the law was a monopoly of
                    the patricians down at least to the middle of the 5th century of the city. Livy
                    goes so far as to speak of it as <hi rend="italic">penetralibus pontificum
                    repositum,—</hi> among the secrets of the pontifical college. It was so to a
                    very great extent in the regal period. But after the publication of the XII.
                    Tables this could be the case only in a qualified sense, the pontiffs becoming
                    the official interpreters of that which in the letter was patent to the world.

                    fifty years later, put an end not only to pontifical but to patrician monopoly.
                    From this time onwards there was a series of jurists <hi rend="italic">
                    (prudentes),</hi> gradually increasing in number and eminence, of whom a list is
                    given by Pomponius, and many of whom are signalized by Cicero, particularly in
                    his <hi rend="italic">Orator</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Brutus.</hi> They
                    occupied themselves in giving advice to clients (see Patron and Client, vol.
                    xviii. p. 412), teaching, pleading at the bar, framing styles of contracts,
                    testaments, and various other deeds of a legal character, or writing
                    commentaries or shorter treatises on different branches of the law. <note

                <p>III. Substantive Changes in the Law during the Period.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Publician Edict.—</hi> There were necessarily many changes
                    during the period in the law of property and of minor real rights, several of
                    them of no mean importance. But the greatest of all was that effected by the
                    Publician edict <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See

                    recognizing the validity (1) of what Theophilus calls <hi rend="italic">
                    dominium bonitarium</hi> as an actual though inferior ownership of <hi
                    rend="italic">res mancipi,</hi> and (2) of what got the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">bonae fidci possessio</hi> as a fictitious ownership of either <hi
                    rend="italic">res mancipi</hi> or <hi rend="italic">res nec mancipi,</hi> valid
                    against all the world except the true <hi rend="italic"> dominus.</hi> The
                    accounts we possess of this edict are somewhat inconsistent and even
                    contradictory; the explanation may be that it went through a process of
                    amendment and expansion at the hands of successive praetors, and that eventually
                    it may have had more than one section, without our always being able to say to
                    which of them the criticism of a particular commentator is directed. But there
                    is no doubt of its general tendency,—of the defects it was meant to correct and
                    of the way in which the correction was accomplished.</p>
                <p>One of the defects was this: if a man had taken a transfer of a <hi rend="italic"
                    > res mancipi</hi> from its rightful owner, but simply by tradition instead of
                    by mancipation or cession in court, he did not acquire <hi rend="italic">
                    dominium ex jure Quiritium,</hi> and the transferrer remained undivested. The
                    result was that the latter was in law entitled to raise a <hi rend="italic">rei
                    vindicatio</hi> and oust the transferee whose money he might have in his pocket,
                    while if a third party had obtained possession of the thing, but in such a way
                    as not to be amenable to an interdict, the transferee could have no effectual
                    vindication against him, as he was not in a position to prove <hi rend="italic"
                    >dominium ex jure Quiritium.</hi> The first difficulty was overcome by the <hi
                    rend="italic">exceptio rei venditae et traditae,</hi> also a praetorian remedy,
                    and probably older than the Publician; to the transferrer’s vindication on the
                    strength of his unextinguished quiritary right the transferee pleaded sale and
                    delivery as an effectual praetorian defence. But, when a third party was in
                    possession, and the transferee by simple delivery had to take the initiative,
                    the position was more complicated. Such third party might be in perfect good
                    faith; he might even have acquired from the original transferrer and fortified
                    his acquisition with a formal conveyance. But that was no sufficient reason in
                    equity why he should be allowed to defeat the prior right of the original
                    transferee, who, if he had possessed for the requisite period of usucapion
                    before the third party came upon the scene, would have cured the defect of the
                    informal delivery and acquired an unassailable quiritary right. So the praetor
                    announced in his edict that, if a man came to him and represented that he had
                    bought a <hi rend="italic">res mancipi</hi> from its owner, and had had it
                    delivered to him, but had lost possession within the period of usucapion, he
                    (the praetor) would allow him a vindication embodying a fiction of completed
                    usucapion <hi rend="italic">(infra,</hi> p. 708), with which he might proceed
                    either against the transferrer or any third party withholding the thing in
                    question.</p>
                <p>The publication of such an edict and the formula of the action based upon
                    it—which, though of praetorian origin, was in many respects dealt with as an <hi
                    rend="italic"> actio juris civilis</hi> and just a variety of the <hi
                    rend="italic"> rei vindicatio—</hi> had the same effect as if the legislature
                    had directly enacted that in future delivery of a <hi rend="italic">res
                    mancipi</hi> in pursuance of a sale or other good cause would confer a right of
                    ownership in it even before usucapion had been completed. Till completed,
                    however, the transferee was not quiritary owner: the thing in question was only
                    mi <hi rend="italic">bonis,</hi> “of his belongings,” and the legal title,
                    though a very empty one— <hi rend="italic">nudum jus Quiritium—</hi> remained in
                    the transferrer; it was only with the completion of the usucapion that it became
                    the transferee’s <hi rend="italic">pleno jure.</hi> The inevitable result of the
                    recognition of this tenure <hi rend="italic">in bonis</hi> was that mancipation
                    came to be regarded in many cases as an unnecessary formality; and the marvel is
                    that it continued to hold its ground at all. The explanation may be that it
                    afforded a substratum for and gave force of law to the <hi rend="italic">verba
                    nuncupata</hi> that accompanied the <hi rend="italic">negotium per aes et
                    libram</hi>; and, although many of these might quite well be thrown into the
                    form of stipulations, yet there were others that it may have been thought safer
                    to leave to take effect under the provisions of the earlier law.</p>
                <p>The second case that was met by the Publician edict—whether - as originally
                    published or by an amendment of it cannot be determined—was that of the <hi
                    rend="italic"> bona fide</hi> transferee of a thing by purchase or other
                    sufficient title who, having lost possession of it before usucapion, found to
                    his cost that the transferrer had not been its owner, that no ownership
                    therefore had been transmitted to him (the transferee), and that consequently he
                    was not in a position to raise a vindication with its averment of <hi
                    rend="italic"> dominium ex jure Quiritium.</hi><note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This case is the only one alluded to by
                    Justinian (Hist., iv. 6, 4). He had abolished the distinction between
                    quiritarian and bonitarian property, and so it was unnecessary for him to
                    mention the other. ‘ </p></note> As against the true owner, whose property had
                    been disposed of by a stranger behind his back, there would have been no equity
                    in giving him an action; but as against all the world except the true owner his
                    “better right” was recognized by the praetor, who accorded to him also a
                    vindication proceeding on a fiction of completed usucapion, for usucapion cured

                    Justinianian law when the term of prescription had been greatly extended, and
                    the difficulty of proving property (as distinguished from <hi rend="italic">bona

                    every branch of it there was an advance not by steps but by strides,—in that of
                    obligations arising from contract, of those arising from delict, and of those
                    arising from facts and circumstances, such as unjustifiable enrichment at
                    another person’s cost. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Such obligations—usually imposing the duty of restitution of unjustifiable

                    and early gave rise to a variety of brocards, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> “Nemo
                    cum alterius damno lucrari debet,” “Nemo damnum sentire debet per lucrum
                    alterius,” &amp;c. </p></note> The law of suretyship, in its three forms of <hi
                    rend="italic">sponsio, fidepromissio,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >fidejussio,</hi> received considerable attention, and formed the subject of a
                    series of legislative enactments for limiting a surety’s liability; while that
                    of agency, which was sparingly admitted in Rome, had a valuable contribution
                    from the praetorian edict in the recognition of a man’s liability, more or less
                    qualified, for the contractual debts of his <hi rend="italic">filiifamilias</hi>
                    and slaves, as also, and without qualification, for the debts properly
                    contracted of persons, whether domestically subject to him or not, who were
                    managing a business on his account, or whom he had placed in command of a ship
                    belonging to him. The development of the law in the matter of obligations
                    generally was greatly facilitated by the praetorian simplification of procedure
                    and the introduction of new forms of actions,—the instruction to a judge,
                    “Whatever in respect thereof the defendant ought to give to or do for the
                    plaintiff, in that condemn him,” preceded by a statement of the cause of action,
                    giving wide scope for the recognition of new sources of liability.</p>
                <p>The origin of the verbal contract of stipulation and its actionability under the
                    Silian and Calpurnian laws have already been explained (pp. 694, 684). It was
                    theoretically a formal contract, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> creative of
                    obligation on the strength of the formal question and answer interchanged by the
                    parties, even though no substantial ground of debt might underlie it; but in
                    time it became the practice to introduce words—the single word <hi rend="italic"
                    > recte</hi> was enough—excluding liability in case of malpractice <hi
                    rend="italic"> (clausula doli);</hi> and finally even that became unnecessary
                    when the praetors had introduced the general <hi rend="italic">exceptio
                    doli,</hi> pleadable as an equitable defence to any personal action. And it was
                    essentially productive only of unilateral obligation, <hi rend="italic">
                    i.e.,</hi> the respondent in the interrogatory alone incurred liability; if
                    mutual obligations were intended it was necessary that each should promise for
                    his own part, with the result that two contracts were executed which were
                    perfectly independent. Originally the only words that could be employed were <hi
                    rend="italic">spondesl</hi> on the one side, <hi rend="italic"> spondco</hi> on
                    the other; and in this form the contract was yurts <hi rend="italic"
                    >civilis</hi> and competent only to citizens (and noncitizens enjoying <hi
                    rend="italic">commercium ?).</hi> In time the words <hi rend="italic">promittis
                    I promitto,</hi> came to be used alternatively. They seem, eventually at least,
                    to have been competent to peregrins as W’ell as to citizens, although that may
                    not have been until the stipulation had become of daily use amongst the former
                    in the still simpler phraseology <hi rend="italic">dabis I dabo, facies I
                    faciam.</hi> Originally competent only for the creation of an obligation to pay
                    a definite sum of money, and afterwards one for delivery of a specific thing
                    other than money, the contract came in time, by the simplification of the w’ords
                    of interrogatory and response—the substitution of the condictions of the
                    formular system for the <hi rend="italic"> legis actiones</hi> of the Silian and
                    Calpurnian laws, and the introduction of the <hi rend="italic">actio ex
                    stipulatu</hi> to meet cases of indefinite promise—to be adaptable to any sort
                    of unilateral engagement, whether initiated by it or only confirmed. It was of
                    immense service too outside the ordinary range of contract in what were called
                    necessary (in contradistinction to voluntary) stipulations, of which a variety
                    of illustrations are given <hi rend="italic">infra,</hi> p. 709. In all
                    directions advantage was taken of it to bind a man by formal contract either to
                    do or to refrain from doing what in many cases he might already be bound <hi
                    rend="italic"> ipso jure</hi> to do or to abstain from doing, and that because
                    of the simplicity of the remedy—an action on his stipulation—that would lie
                    against him in the event of his failure.</p>

                    subject, it must be admitted that in many points our knowledge of it is
                    incomplete and uncertain. The prevalent opinion, formed before the discovery of
                    the Verona MS. had made known Gaius’s description of it, and almost universally
                    adhered to ever since, is that such contracts were created by entries in the
                    account-books which the censors insisted that all citizens of any means should
                    keep with scrupulous regularity. They are often alluded to by the lay writers;
                    but the text principally relied on is what remains of Cicero’s speech for the
                    player Roscius. From the tenor of the argument in that case, and incidental
                    remarks elsewhere, the conclusion has been formed that a citizen who made an
                    entry in his <hi rend="italic">codex—</hi> whether of the nature of a cash-book
                    or a ledger is much disputed—to the debit of another, thereby made the latter
                    his debtor for a sum recoverable by an <hi rend="italic"> actio certae crcditae
                    pecuniae.</hi> Gaius in his description of the contract does not mention the <hi
                    rend="italic">codices</hi>; but his account is not inconsistent with the notion
                    that the entries <hi rend="italic"> {nomina)</hi> of which he speaks were made
                    in them. He says that those entries were of two sorts, <hi rend="italic">nomina
                    arcaria</hi> and <hi rend="italic">nomina transscripticia.</hi> The former were
                    entries of cash advances; and of them lie observes that they did not create
                    obligation, but only served as evidence of one already created by payment to and
                    receipt of the money by the borrower. Of the latter he says that there were two
                    varieties, the entry transcribed from thing to person and that transcribed from
                    one person to another, and that both of them were not probative merely but
                    creative of obligation. The first was effected by a creditor (A) entering to the
                    debit of his debtor (B) the liquidated amount of what the latter was already
                    owing as the price of something purchased, the rent of a house leased, the value
                    of work done, or the like. The second was effected by A transcribing B’s debt to
                    the debit of a third party (C), hitherto a debtor of B’s, and who consented to
                    the transaction, —A at the same time crediting B with the sum thus booked
                    against C, and B in his books both crediting C with it <hi rend="italic"
                    >{acceptilatio)</hi> and debiting A <hi rend="italic">{expensilatio). </hi></p>
                <p>All this at first sight seems just a series of bookkeeping operations. But it was
                    much more than that for the Roman citizens who first had recourse to it. There
                    was a time when sale, and lease, and the like, so long as they stood on their
                    own merits, created no obligation enforcible at law, however much it might be
                    binding as a duty to Fides or (as moderns would say) in the forum of conscience;
                    to found an action it required to be clothed in some form approved by the <hi
                    rend="italic">jus civile.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">nexum</hi> may have been
                    one of those forms, the vendee or tenant being fictitiously dealt with as
                    borrower of the price or rent due under his purchase or lease; the stipulation
                    was another, the obligation to pay the price or rent being made legally binding
                    by its embodiment in formal question and answer. But stipulation was competent
                    only between persons who were face to face, whereas expensilation was competent
                    also as between persons at a distance from each other. This of itself gave
                    expensilation—which, originally at least, was as much a <hi rend="italic">
                    negotiant juris civilis</hi> as the <hi rend="italic">sponsio—</hi> an advantage
                    in some cases over stipulation. But it had also a further advantage, which was
                    not affected by the subsequent recognition of the real and consensual contracts
                    as productive of legal obligation on their own merits: it paved the way for
                    subsequent transcription from one person to another. This last must have been of
                    infinite convenience in commerce, not only by enabling traders to dispense with
                    a reserve of coin, but by obviating the risks attending the transit of money
                    over long distances. It was this that led, as Theophilus says was the case, to
                    the conversion even of stipulatory obligations into book-debts; it was not that
                    thereby the creditor obtained a tighter hold over his debtor, but that an
                    obligation was obtained from him which in a sense was negotiable and therefore
                    more valuable.</p>
                <p>The evolution of the four purely consensual contracts—sale, location,
                    partnership, and mandate—supplies matter for one of the most interesting
                    chapters in the whole history of the law. But, as it is impossible in such an
                    article as this to attempt to mark the successive stages in the progress of all
                    of them, we shall confine ourselves to sale. The others did not and could not
                    follow identically the same course: location ran most nearly parallel with sale;
                    but partnership and mandate, from their nature, not only started at a different
                    point from the other two, but reached the same goal with them—tliat of becoming
                    productive of obligation simply on the strength of consent interchanged by the
                    parties—by paths that were sometimes far apart. Nevertheless a sketch of the
                    history of the origin of the contract of sale may be sufficient to indicate
                    generally some of the milestones that were successively passed by all four.

                <p>Going back as far as history carries us we meet with it under the names of <hi
                    rend="italic"> emptio</hi> and <hi rend="italic">venditio,</hi> but meaning no
                    more than barter; for <hi rend="italic">cmcrc</hi> originally signified simply

                    <hi rend="italic">pccunia)</hi> may for a time have been a very usual article of
                    exchange on one side, and then came raw metal weighed in the scales. But it was
                    still exchange, instant delivery of goods on one side against simultaneous
                    delivery of so many pounds weight of copper on the other. With the reforms of
                    Servius Tullius came the distinction between <hi rend="italic"> res mancipi</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">res nec mancipi,</hi> and with it a regulated mancipation
                    for sale and conveyance of the former. It was still barter; but along with it
                    arose an obligation on the part of the transferrer of the <hi rend="italic">res
                    mancipi</hi> to warrant the transferee against eviction,—a warranty that was
                    implied in the mancipation. Whether this rule obtained from the first or was the
                    growth of custom it is impossible to say; but it is in the highest degree
                    probable that it was the XII. Tables which fixed that the measure of the
                    transferrer’s liability to the transferee in the event of eviction should be
                    double the amount of the price. Equally impossible is it to say when the
                    practice arose of embodying declarations, assurances, and so forth in the
                    mancipation <hi rend="italic">(leges mancipii),</hi> which were held binding on
                    the strength of the <hi rend="italic"> negotium juris civilis</hi> in which they
                    were clothed. They received statutory sanction in the Tables, in the words
                    already referred to more than once—“cum nexum faciet mancipiumque, uti lingua
                    nuncupassit, itajus esto,” substantially “whatever shall by word of mouth be

                    el libram</hi> in definition of its terms shall be law as between them.”</p>
                <p>The substitution by the decemvirs of coined money, that was to be counted for
                    rough metal that had been weighed, converted the contribution on one side into
                    price <hi rend="italic">{pretium),</hi> as distinguished from article of
                    purchase <hi rend="italic">{merx)</hi> on the other; and sale thus became
                    distinct from barter. In contemplation of the separation of the mancipation and
                    the price-paying, and the degeneration of the former into a merely imaginary
                    sale, they enacted that, mancipation notwithstanding, the property of what was
                    sold should not pass to the purchaser until the price had been paid or security
                    by sureties <hi rend="italic">{vades)</hi> given for it to the vendor; and it
                    was probably by the interpretation of the pontiffs that this was added to the
                    rule,— that until the price was paid no liability for eviction should attach to
                    the transferrer (or <hi rend="italic">auctor).</hi> The reason of the provision
                    in the XII. Tables was that a vendor who had mancipated or delivered a thing
                    sold by him before receiving the price had no action to enforce payment of the
                    latter; and in such circumstances it was thought but right to give him the
                    opportunity of getting back the thing itself by a real action. It might be,
                    however, that the price had been paid, and yet the vendor refused to mancipate.
                    It was long, apparently, before the purchaser could in such a case compel him to
                    do so. With the introduction of the <hi rend="italic">legis actio per
                    condic-tionem</hi> he (the purchaser) had undoubtedly the power to recover the
                    money on the ground of the vendor’s unjustifiable enrichment, —that the latter
                    had got it for a consideration which had failed <hi rend="italic">{causa data,
                    causa non secuta)</hi>; and it is possible that before that he liacl a similar
                    remedy <hi rend="italic">per judicis poslulationem.</hi></p>
                <p>Down to this point, therefore, say the beginning of the 6th century, there were
                    several obligations consequent on sale of a <hi rend="italic">res mancipi</hi>;
                    but not one of them arose directly out of the sale itself, or could be enforced
                    simply on the ground that it had taken place. The vendor was bound to support
                    the purchaser in any action by a third party disputing his right, and to repay
                    him the price twofold in the event of that third party’s success; and he was
                    bound, moreover, to make good to him any loss he had sustained through a
                    deficiency of acreage he had guaranteed, non-existence of servitudes he had
                    declared the lands enjoyed, existence of others from which he had stated they
                    were free<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Cicero says
                    <hi rend="italic">(De Off.,</hi> iii. 16, § 65) that, though by the XII. Tables
                    it was enough if a vendor <hi rend="italic">per aes et libram</hi> made good his
                    positive assurances (id <hi rend="italic">i lingua nuncupassit, itajus
                    esto),</hi> the jurists held him responsible for reticence about burdens or

                    these obligations were binding, not in virtue of the sale <hi rend="italic">per
                    se,</hi> but of the transaction <hi rend="italic">per aes et libram</hi>
                    superinduced upon it; and, if the vendor had at any time to return the price on
                    failure to mancipate what he had sold, it was not because he had committed a
                    breach of contract, but because he had unjustly enriched himself at the
                    purchaser’s expense.</p>
                <p>In sales of <hi rend="italic">res nec mancipi,</hi> just as in those of <hi
                    rend="italic"> res mancipi,</hi> a vendor who had been incautious enough to
                    deliver his wares before he had been paid, or had got stipulatory security for
                    the price, or ha I converted it into a book-debt, might recover them by a real
                    action if payment was unduly delayed; while the purchaser who had paid in
                    advance but failed to get delivery might also get back his money from the vendor
                    on the plea of unwarrantable enrichment. But, as <pb break="no"

                    property (and, as some think, incompetent), some other machinery had to be
                    resorted to than that of the copper and the scales for imposing upon the vendor
                    an obligation of warranty against eviction, defects, and so forth. It may be
                    that, until trade began to assume considerable proportions, and when a
                    transaction was between citizens, a purchaser was content to rely partly on the
                    honesty of his vendor, partly on the latter’s knowledge that he ran the risk of
                    an action for theft if what he sold belonged to another <note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In rebus mobilibus . . . qui alienam rem

                    the maxim common in all ages and climes, <hi rend="italic">caveat emptor.</hi>
                    When it was one between a citizen and a peregrin, a different set of rules may
                    have come into play; for between them disputes were settled by recuperators
                    whose decisions were arrived at very much on considerations of natural equity.
                    It was the popularization of the stipulation that facilitated a further advance,
                    rendered all the more necessary by the expansion of intercourse with foreigners
                    and the cessation of recuperation.</p>
                <p>We read of a <hi rend="italic">satisdatio secundum mancipium,</hi> a <hi
                    rend="italic"> stipulatio habere licere,</hi> and a <hi rend="italic">stipulatio
                    duplae.</hi> The nature of the first is obscure; it seems to have been connected
                    with mancipatory sales, and probably to have been the guarantee of a <hi
                    rend="italic">sponsor for</hi> the liabilities imposed upon the vendor by the
                    transaction <hi rend="italic">per aes et libram</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >verba nuncupata</hi> that were covered by it. The stipulation <hi rend="italic"
                    >habere licere</hi> occurs in Varro, in a collection of styles of sales of
                    sheep, cattle, &amp;c., some of which he says were abridgments of those of M.
                    Manilius, who was consul in the year 605. It was the guarantee of the vendor of
                    a <hi rend="italic">res nee mancipi,</hi> or even of a <hi rend="italic">res
                    mancipi</hi> sold without mancipation, that the purchaser should be maintained
                    in possession of what he had bought; it entitled him to reparation on eviction,
                    measured not by any fixed standard but according to the loss he had sustained.
                    It cannot have been introduced, therefore, until after the <hi rend="italic">Lex
                    Aebutia</hi> and the formulation by the praetor of the <hi rend="italic">actio
                    ex stipulatu.</hi> The idea of the <hi rend="italic">stipulatio duplae</hi> may
                    have been borrowed from the <hi rend="italic">duplurn</hi> incurred by a vendor
                    on the eviction of a purchaser acquiring a thing by mancipation; for one of its
                    earliest manifestations was in the edict of the curule aediles, who insisted on
                    it from persons selling slaves, probably because the dealers were for the most
                    part foreigners, and therefore unable to complete their sales <hi rend="italic"
                    >per aes ct libram.</hi> Judging from Varro, it was a form of stipulation
                    against eviction that in his time was used only in sales of slaves, although he
                    adds that by agreement of parties it might be limited to a <hi rend="italic"
                    >simplum.</hi></p>
                <p>We learn from the same writer—what is also indicated in various passages of
                    Plautus—that the vendor at the same time and in the body of the same stipulation
                    guaranteed that the sheep or cattle he was selling were healthy and of a heal
                    thy stock and free from faults, and that the latter had not done any mischief
                    for which their owner could be held liable in a noxal action; and similarly that
                    a slave sold was healthy and not chargeable for any theft or other offence for
                    which the purchaser might have to answer. If any of these guarantees turned out
                    fallacious the purchaser had an <hi rend="italic">actio ex stipulatu</hi>
                    against the vendor: ‘ ‘ Whereas the plaintiff got from the defendant a
                    stipulation that certain sheep he bought from him were healthy, &amp;c.
                    [repeating the words of guarantee], and that he, the plaintiff, should be free
                    to hold them <hi rend="italic">{habere licere'),</hi> whatever it shall appear
                    that the defendant ought in respect thereof to give to or do for the plaintiff,
                    in the value thereof, judge, condemn him; otherwise, acquit him.” It is an
                    observation of Bekker’s <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Bekker, <hi rend="italic">Aktionen,</hi> vol. i. p. 158. </p></note> ' that
                    the <hi rend="italic">actio empti</hi> in its original shape was just a
                    simplification of the <hi rend="italic">actio ex stipulatu</hi> on a vendor’s
                    guarantees; the stipulations to which we have been alluding had become such
                    unfailing accompaniments of a sale as to be matters of legal presumption, the
                    result being that the words “whereas the plaintiff <hi rend="italic">bought</hi>
                    from the defendant the sheep about which this action has arisen” were
                    substituted in the <hi rend="italic">demonstratio</hi> (as the introductory
                    clause of the <hi rend="italic">formula</hi> was called) for the detailed
                    recital of what had been stipulated. Bekker justifies this by reference to the
                    language of Varro, who seems to include under the words <hi rend="italic"
                    >emptio, venditio</hi> not merely the agreement to buy and sell but also the
                    stipulations that usually went with it.</p>
                <p>The introduction of an <hi rend="italic">actio empti</hi> in this shape, however,
                    was far from the recognition of sale as a purely consensual contract. If the
                    price was not paid at once, the purchaser gave his stipulatory promise for it,
                    or got some one on whom the vendor placed more reliance to do so for him, or
                    else made a book-debt of it; and, if it had to be sued for, it was in all these
                    cases by a <hi rend="italic">condictio ccrti</hi> and not by an action on the
                    sale. If the price was paid but the thing purchased not delivered, the only
                    remedy open to the purchaser was to get back his money by the same condiction,
                    unless, indeed, the guarantee <hi rend="italic">habere licere</hi> was held to
                    cover delivery, in which case the purchaser might obtain damages in an <hi
                    rend="italic">actio ex stipulatu,</hi> under the name of <hi rend="italic">
                    actio empti.</hi> But this <hi rend="italic">actio empti,</hi> whether insisted
                    on on the ground of non-delivery, eviction, or breach of some other warranty,
                    was really an action on the verbal contracts that had accompanied the sale,—a
                    <hi rend="italic">strictum fus</hi> action in which the judge could not travel
                    beyond the letter of the engagements of the purchaser. In the latter years of
                    the republic, and probably from the time of Q. Mucius Scsevola, it was a <hi
                    rend="italic">bonae fidei</hi> action. How had the change come about? A single
                    case of hardship may have been sufficient to induce it, such as the defeat of a
                    claim for damages for eviction on the ground that the stipulatory guarantee had
                    been accidentally overlooked. Ulpian says, “As the <hi rend="italic">stipulatio
                    duplae</hi> is a thing of universal observance, action on the ground of eviction
                    will lie <hi rend="italic">ex empto</hi> if perchance the vendor of a slave have
                    failed to give his stipulatory guarantee, for everything that is of general
                    custom and practice ought to be in view of the judge in a <hi rend="italic"
                    >bonae fidei judicium.”</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Very little was required to convert the <hi rend="italic">stricti juris actio
                    empti,</hi> really nothing more than an <hi rend="italic">actio ex

                    rend="italic"> {ex fide bona)</hi> to the “whatever the defendant ought to give
                    to or do for the plaintiff.” The effect, however, was immeasurable,—not that it
                    did away with the practice of stipulatory guarantees, for Varro wrote after the
                    time of Q. Mucius (who speaks of the action on sale as a <hi rend="italic">
                    bonae fidei</hi> one), and references to them are abundant in the pages of the
                    classical jurists; but it rendered them in law unnecessary. It made sale a
                    purely consensual contract in which, in virtue of the simple agreement to buy
                    and sell, all the obligations on either side that usually attended it were held
                    embodied without express formulation or (still less) stipulatory or literal
                    engagement. And, in instructing the judges to decide in every case between buyer
                    and seller suing <hi rend="italic">ex empto</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ex
                    vendito</hi> on principles of good faith, it really empowered them to go far
                    beyond “general custom and practice,” and to take cognizance of everything that
                    in fairness and equity and common sense ought to influence their judgment, so as
                    to enable them freely to do justice between the parties in any and every
                    question that might directly or indirectly arise out of their relation as seller
                    and buyer.</p>

                    </p></note> Down to the time of the Pcetilian law loan of money, corn, &amp;c.,
                    was usually contracted <hi rend="italic">per aes et libram',</hi> and it is
                    probable that after the abolition of the <hi rend="italic">nexum</hi> the
                    obligation on a borrower to repay the money or corn advanced to him was made
                    actionable, under the Silian and Calpurnian laws respectively, by a stipulation
                    contemporaneous with the loan. With the rise of the/its <hi rend="italic"
                    >gentium</hi> loan became actionable on its own merits,—that i3 to say, the
                    advance and receipt of money as a loan of itself laid the borrower under
                    obligation to repay it, even though no stipulatory engagement had intervened;
                    the <hi rend="italic">res</hi> (in this case the giving and receiving <hi
                    rend="italic"> mutui causa)</hi> completed the contract. The obligation that
                    arose from it was purely unilateral, and enforcible, where the loan was of
                    money, by the same action as stipulation and literal contract; and so strictly
                    was it construed that interest on the loan was not claimable along with it, the
                    <hi rend="italic">res</hi> given and received being the full measure of the
                    obligation of repayment. The other three— commodate, deposit, and pledge—became
                    independent real contracts very much later than <hi rend="italic">mutuum,</hi>
                    possibly not all at the same time, and none of them apparently until very late
                    in the republic. All of them, of course, had been long known as transactions of
                    daily life; the difficulty is to say when they first became actionable, and
                    under what guise.</p>
                <p>It is impossible within the space at our command to criticize the various
                    theories entertained of their vicissitudes, for they necessarily vary to some
                    extent in regard to each. We must content ourselves, therefore, with the simple
                    statement that eventually, and within the period with which we are now dealing,
                    they came to be recognized as independent real contracts, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >res</hi> by which they were completed being the delivery of a thing by one
                    person to another for a particular purpose, on the understanding that it was to
                    be returned when that purpose was served. And it is to be noted that, while <hi
                    rend="italic"> mutuum</hi> transferred the property of the money lent, the
                    borrower being bound to return not the identical coins but only an equal
                    amount," in pledge it was only the possession that passed, while in commodate
                    and deposit the lender or depositor retained both property and (legal)
                    possession, the borrower or depositary having nothing more than the natural
                    detention. In all but <hi rend="italic">mutuum,</hi> therefore, there was trust;
                    the holder was bound, to an extent varying according to circumstances, to care
                    for what he held as if it were his own, and entitled to be reimbursed for outlay
                    on its maintenance,—bound to return it, yet excused if his failure to do so was
                    due to a cause for which in fairness he could not be held responsible.
                    Consequently the actions on these three contracts, differing from that on <hi
                    rend="italic"> mutuum,</hi> were all <hi rend="italic">bonae fidei,</hi> the <pb

                    enjoyment of the estate of a deceased person without the legal title of
                    inheritance. There is much to lead to the conclusion that the series of
                    provisions in regard to it which we find in the Julian consolidation of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Edici</hi> were the work of a succession of praetors, some of them
                    probably not under the republic but under the empire; but it will be convenient
                    to give here a general view of the subject as a whole, disregarding the
                    consideration that some of its features may not have Deen given to it within the
                    period now under notice.</p>
                <p>J ustinian, speaking of the origin of <hi rend="italic">bonorum possessio,</hi>
                    observes that in promising it to a petitioner the praetors were not always
                    actuated by the same motives; in some cases their object was to facilitate the
                    application of the rules of the <hi rend="italic">jus civile,</hi> in some to
                    amend their application according to what they believed to be the spirit of the
                    XII. Tables, in others, again, to set them aside as inequitable. It is not
                    unreasonable to assume that it was with the purpose of aiding thejits <hi
                    rend="italic"> civile</hi> that the first step was taken in what gradually
                    became a momentous reform; and it is extremely probable that this first step was
                    the announcement by some praetor that, where there was dispute as to an
                    inheritance, and a testament was presented to him bearing not fewer seals than
                    were required by law, lie would give possession of the goods of the defunct to
                    the heir named in it. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Cic., <hi rend="italic">In Verr.</hi> II., i. 45, § 117. He says (writing in
                    684) that an edict to that effect was already <hi rend="italic">tralaticium,
                    i.e.,</hi> had been adopted year after year by a series of praters. Gaius (ii.
                    119) speaks of seven at least as the requisite number of seals; <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> those of the <hi rend="italic">libripens</hi> and the

                    whose functions are not well understood, but whose official designation appended
                    to his seal recurs so regularly in inscriptions as to leave no doubt that his
                    was the seventh. </p></note> In this as it stands there is nothing but a
                    regulation of possession of the <hi rend="italic">bona</hi> of the inheritance
                    pending the question of legal right. Just as between two parties contending
                    about the ownership of a specific thing in a <hi rend="italic">rei
                    vindicatio</hi> the praetor first settled the question of interim possession, so
                    did he promise to do here when a question was about to be tried about the right
                    to an inheritance <hi rend="italic"> (si de hereditate ambigitur).</hi> It was a
                    provisional arrangement merely, and very necessary in view of the state of the
                    law which permitted a third party, apart from any pretence of title, to step in
                    and complete a <hi rend="italic">usucapio pro herede</hi> by a year’s possession
                    of the effects of the inheritance <hi rend="italic">(supra,</hi> p. 692). Even
                    at the time when the <hi rend="italic">Edict</hi> was closed it was not
                    necessarily more than a provisional grant; for, if heirs-at-law of the deceased
                    appeared and proved that, although the testament bore on the outside the
                    requisite number of seals, yet in fact some solemnity of execution, such as the
                    <hi rend="italic">familiae venditio</hi> or <hi rend="italic">testamenti
                    nuncupalio,</hi> had been omitted, the grantee had to yield them up the
                    possession that had been given him pending inquiry. It was only by a rescript of
                    Marcus Aurelius’s that it was declared that a plea by the heir-at-law of
                    invalidity of a testament on the ground of defect of formalities of execution
                    might be defeated by an <hi rend="italic">cxceptio doli,</hi> on the principle
                    that it was contrary to good faith to set aside the wishes of a testator on a
                    technical objection that was purely formal. Thus was the <hi rend="italic"
                    >bonorum possessio secundum tabulas, i.e.,</hi> in accordance with a testament,
                    from being originally one in aid of thejui <hi rend="italic">civile,</hi> in
                    course of time converted into one in contradiction of it. That the motives and
                    purposes of the series of praetors who built up the law of <hi rend="italic">
                    bonorum possessio</hi> must have varied in progress of years is obvious; and,
                    once the machinery had been invented, nothing was easier than to apply it to new
                    ideas. The praetor could not make a man heir,—that he always disclaimed; but he
                    could give a man, whether heir or not, the substantial advantages of
                    inheritance, and protect him in their enjoyment by praetorian remedies. He gave
                    him possession of the goods of the deceased, with summary remedies for
                    ingathering them, which, once in his hands, would become his in quiritarian
                    right on the expiry of the period of usucapion; and, by interpolation into the
                    <hi rend="italic">formula</hi> of a fiction of heirship, he gave him effectual
                    personal actions against debtors of the deceased, rendering him liable in the
                    same way to the deceased’s creditors.</p>
                <p>Another variety of the <hi rend="italic">bonorum possessio</hi> was that <hi
                    rend="italic"> contra tabulas,</hi> —in opposition to the terms of a testament.
                    If a testator had neither instituted nor expressly disinherited a son who was
                    one of his <hi rend="italic">sui heredes,</hi> then his testament was a nullity,
                    and the child passed over had no need of a praetorian remedy. Where <hi
                    rend="italic">sui heredes</hi> other than sons were passed over the <hi
                    rend="italic">jus civile</hi> allowed them to participate with the instituted
                    heirs by a sort of accrual. But the <hi rend="italic">Edict</hi> went further;
                    for, if the institute was a stranger, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> not brother
                    or sister of the child passed over, then, on the petition of the latter, the
                    praetor gave him and any other <hi rend="italic">sui</hi> concurring with him
                    possession of the whole estate of the deceased, the institute being left with
                    nothing more than the empty name of heir. Another application of the <hi
                    rend="italic">bonorum possessio contra tabulas</hi> was to the case of
                    emancipated children of the testator’s. By the <hi rend="italic">jus civile</hi>
                    he was not required to institute or disinherit them; for by their emancipation
                    they had ceased to be siri <hi rend="italic">heredes,</hi> and had lost that
                    interest in the family estate which was put forward as the reason why they had
                    to be mentioned in the testament of their <hi rend="italic"> paterfamilias.</hi>
                    The praetors—although probably not until the empire, and when the doctrines of
                    the Jits <hi rend="italic">naturalc</hi> were being more freely recognized— put
                    them on the same footing as unemancipated children, requiring that they also
                    should be either instituted or disinherited, and giving them <hi rend="italic"
                    >bonorum possessio</hi> if they were not. It was <hi rend="italic">contra
                    tabulas</hi> in the sense that it displaced the instituted heirs either wholly
                    or partially,—wholly when the institutes were not children of the deceased,
                    partially when they were. In the latter case, at least when <hi rend="italic"
                    >sui</hi> were affected by it, the grant of <hi rend="italic"> bonorum
                    possessio</hi> was under the very equitable condition that the grantees should
                    collate or bring into partition all their own acquisitions since their
                    emancipation.</p>
                <p>The third variety of <hi rend="italic">bonorum possessio</hi> was that granted
                    <hi rend="italic">ab intestato.</hi> As has been shown on a previous page (p.
                    692), the rules of the jws <hi rend="italic">civile</hi> in reference to
                    succession on intestacy were extremely strict and artificial. They admitted
                    neither emancipated children nor agnates who had undergone <hi rend="italic"
                    >capitis deminutio</hi>; they admitted no female agnate except a sister; if the
                    nearest agnate or agnates declined, the right did not pass to those of the next
                    degree; mere cognates, kinsmen of the deceased who were not agnates, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> grandchildren or others related to him through females
                    and agnates <hi rend="italic">capitc minuti,</hi> were not admitted at all;
                    while a wife had no share unless she had been <hi rend="italic"> in manu</hi> of
                    the deceased and therefore <hi rend="italic"> fliae loco.</hi> All these matters
                    the praetors amended, and so far paved the way for the revolution in the law of
                    intestate succession which was accomplished by Justinian.</p>
                <p>The classes they established were four. (1) Displacing the <hi rend="italic">sui
                    heredes</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">jus civile,</hi> they gave the first place
                    to descendants <hi rend="italic">(liberi),</hi> including in the term all those
                    whom the deceased would have been bound either by the <hi rend="italic"> jus
                    civile</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">Edict</hi> to institute or disinherit had
                    he made a will, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> his wife <hi rend="italic">in
                    manu,</hi> his natural (as distinguished from adopted) sons and daughters
                    whether <hi rend="italic">in potestate</hi> at his death or emancipated, the
                    representatives of sons who had predeceased him, and adopted children in his <hi
                    rend="italic">potestas</hi> when he died. (2) On failure of <hi rend="italic"
                    >liberi</hi> the right to petition for <hi rend="italic"> bonorum possessio</hi>
                    opened to the nearest collateral agnates of the intestate, under their old name
                    of <hi rend="italic">legitimi heredes.</hi> (3) Under the <hi rend="italic">jus
                    civile,</hi> on failure of agnates (and of the <hi rend="italic">gens</hi> where
                    there was one), the succession was vacant and fell to the fisc, unless perchance
                    it was usucapted by a stranger possessing <hi rend="italic">pro herede.</hi> The
                    frequency of such vacancies was much diminished by the recognition by the
                    praetors of the right of cognates to claim <hi rend="italic">bonorum
                    possessio</hi> in the third place. Who they had primarily in view under the name
                    of “cognates” it is impossible to say. The epithet is most frequently applied by
                    modern writers to kinsmen related through females; but in its widest sense it
                    included all kinsmen without exception, and in a more limited sense all kinsmen
                    not entitled to claim as agnates. There were included amongst them
                    therefore—although it is very probable that the list was not made up at once,
                    but from time to time by the action of a series of praetors—not merely kinsmen
                    related through females (who were not agnates), but also agnates of a remoter
                    degree who were excluded as such because the nearest agnates in existence had
                    declined, persons who had been agnates but by reason of <hi rend="italic"
                    >capitis minutio</hi> had lost that character, female agnates more distantly
                    related than sisters, and children of the intestate’s who at the time of his
                    death were in an adoptive family. All these took according to proximity. (4)
                    Finally, the claim passed to the survivor of husband and wife, assuming always
                    that their marriage had not involved <hi rend="italic"> manus.</hi> This list
                    constituted the prsetorian order of succession on intestacy.</p>
                <p>All these <hi rend="italic">bonorum possessions</hi> had to be formally
                    petitioned for. In that <hi rend="italic">ab intestato</hi> descendants were
                    allowed a year for doing so, while other persons were limited to 100 days, the
                    period for those entitled in the second place beginning when that of those
                    entitled in the first had expired, and so on. The grant was always made at the
                    risk of the petitioner; nothing was assured him by it; it might turn out real
                    and substantial <hi rend="italic">(cum re)</hi> or merely nominal <hi
                    rend="italic"> (sine re),</hi> according as the grantee could or could not
                    maintain it against the heir of <hi rend="italic">the jus civile.</hi> For the
                    latter was entitled to stand on his statutory or testamentary right, without
                    applying for <hi rend="italic">bonorum possessio,</hi> although in fact he often
                    did so for the sake of the summary procedure it supplied him for ingathering the
                    effects of the deceased.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Law of Procedure.—</hi> The substitution of the formular
                    system of procedure for that by the “actions of the law” commenced long before
                    the end of the period now under consideration; and we have had occasion more
                    than once to observe how greatly it facilitated the development of the
                    institutions of property and contractual obligation. But as the change was only
                    completed in the early empire it will be more convenient to defer explanation of
                    the nature of the new procedure in the meantime. (See <hi rend="italic"

                <p>CHAPTER IV.—THE JUS NATURALE AND MATURITY OF ROMAN JURISPRUDENCE.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">{The Empire until the time of Diocletian.}</hi></p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Characteristics and Formative Agencies of the</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Law during the Period.</hi><hi rend="italic">Characteristics
                    generally and Recognition of a Jus Naturale in particular.—</hi> The first three
                    centuries of the empire witnessed the perfection of Roman jurisprudence and the
                    commencement of its decline. During that time the history of the law presents no
                    such great landmarks as the enactment of the XII. Tables, the commencement of a
                    praetor’s edict, the recognition of simple consent as creative of a contractual
                    bond, or the introduction of a new form of judicial procedure; the establishment
                    of a class of patented jurists speaking as the mouthpieces of the prince, and
                    the admission of all the free subjects of the empire to the privileges of
                    citizenship, are about the only isolated events to which one can point as
                    productive of great and lasting results. There were, indeed, some radical
                    changes in particular institutions, such as the caduciary legislation of
                    Augustus, intended to raise the tone of domestic morality and increase fruitful
                    marriages, and the legislation of the same emperor and his immediate successor
                    for regulation of the status of enfranchised slaves; but these, although of vast
                    importance in themselves, and the first of them influencing the current of the
                    law for centuries, yet left upon it no permanent impression. It was by much less
                    imposing efforts that it attained the perfection to which it reached under the
                    sovereigns of the Severan house,—a steady advance on the lines already marked
                    out in the latter years of the republic. The sphere of the <hi rend="italic">jus
                    Quiritium</hi> became more and more circumscribed, and one after another of the
                    formalities of the jus <hi rend="italic">civile</hi> was abandoned. The <hi
                    rend="italic">manus</hi> of the husband practically disappeared; the <hi
                    rend="italic">patria potestas</hi> of the father lost much of its significance
                    by the recognition, notwithstanding it, of the possibility of a separate and
                    independent estate in the child; slaves might be enfranchised by informal
                    manumission; <hi rend="italic">res mancipi</hi> constantly passed by simple
                    tradition, the right of the transferee being secured by the Publician action;
                    servitudes and other real rights informally constituted were maintained as
                    effectual <hi rend="italic">tuitione praetoris;</hi> an heir’s acceptance of a
                    succession could be accomplished by any indication of his intention, without
                    observance of the formal <hi rend="italic">cretio</hi> of the earlier law; and
                    many of the incidental bargains incident to consensual contract, but varying
                    their natural import, that used to be embodied in words of stipulation, came to
                    be enforcible on the strength of formless contemporaneous agreements.</p>
                <p>The preference accorded by jurists and judges to the <hi rend="italic">jus
                    gentium,</hi> over thejws <hi rend="italic">civile</hi> is insufficient to
                    account for these and many other changes in the same direction, as well as for
                    the ever-increasing tendency evinced to subordinate word and deed to the <hi
                    rend="italic"> voluntas</hi> from which they arose. They are rather to be
                    attributed to the striving on the part of many after a higher ideal, to which
                    they gave the name of <hi rend="italic">jus naturale.</hi><note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Voigt, <hi rend="italic"> Das Jus
                    naturale . . . der Romer,</hi> particularly vol. i. §§ 52-64, 89-96; Maine, <hi
                    rend="italic">Ancient Law,</hi> chap. iii. </p></note> It is sometimes said that
                    the notion of a <hi rend="italic">jus naturale</hi> as distinct from the <hi
                    rend="italic">jus gentium</hi> was peculiar to Ulpian, and that it found no
                    acceptance with the Roman jurists generally. But this is inaccurate. Justinian,
                    indeed, has excerpted in the <hi rend="italic"> Digest</hi> and put in the
                    forefront of his <hi rend="italic"> Institutes</hi> a passage from an elementary
                    work of Ulpian’s, in which he speaks of a <hi rend="italic">jus naturale</hi>
                    that is common to man and the lower animals, and which is substantially
                    instinct. This is a law of nature of which it is quite true that we find no
                    other jurist taking account.</p>
                <p>But many of them refer again and again to the <hi rend="italic">jus
                    naturale-,</hi> and Gaius is the only one (Justinian following him) who
                    occasionally makes it synonymous <hi rend="italic">jus gentium.</hi> There can
                    be no question that the latter was much more largely imbued with precepts of
                    natural law than was the <hi rend="italic">jus civile,</hi> but it is impossible
                    to say they were identical; it is enough to cite but one illustration, pointed
                    out again and again in the texts: while the one admitted the legality of
                    slavery, the other denied it. While the <hi rend="italic">jus civile</hi>
                    studied the interests only of citizens, and the <hi rend="italic">jus
                    gentium</hi> those of freemen irrespective of nationality, the law of nature had
                    theoretically a wider range and took all mankind within its purview. We have no
                    hint that the doctrine of the <hi rend="italic">jus gentium</hi> differed in
                    this respect from the <hi rend="italic"> jus civile—</hi> that a slave was
                    nothing but a chattel; yet we find the latter, -when tinctured with the <hi
                    rend="italic">jus naturale,</hi> recognizing many rights as competent to a
                    slave, and even conceding that he might be debtor or creditor in a contract,
                    although his obligation or claim could be given effect to only indirectly, since
                    he could neither sue nor be sued.</p>
                <p>Voigt thus summarizes the characteristics of this speculative Roman <hi
                    rend="italic"> jus naturale</hi> :—(1) its potential universal applicability to
                    all men, (2) among all peoples, (3) at all times, and (4) its correspondence
                    with the innate conviction of right <hi rend="italic">{innere
                    Rechtsuber-zeugung}.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Voigt, <hi rend="italic"> l.c.,</hi> p. 304. </p></note> Its propositions,
                    as gathered from the pages of the jurists of the period, he formulates thus
                    :—(1) recognition of the claims of blood <hi rend="italic">{sanguinis vel
                    cognationis ratio'}</hi>; (2) duty of faithfulness to engagements,— <hi
                    rend="italic">is natura debct . . . cujus fidem secuti sumus;</hi> (3)
                    apportionment of advantage and disadvantage, gain and loss, according to the
                    standard of equity; (4) supremacy of the <hi rend="italic">voluntatis ratio</hi>
                    over the words or form in which the will is manifested. <note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Voigt, pp. 321-23. </p></note> It was regard
                    for the first that, probably pretty early in the principate, led the prsetors to
                    place emancipated children on a footing of perfect equality with unemancipated
                    in the matter of succession, and to admit collateral kindred through females as
                    well as those related through males; and that, in the reigns of Hadrian and
                    Marcus Aurelius respectively, induced the senate to give a mother a pre ferred
                    right of succession to her children, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> It
                    was respect for the second that led to the recognition of the validity of what
                    was called a natural obligation,—one that, because of some defect of form or
                    something peculiar in the position of the parties, was ignored by the <hi
                    rend="italic"> jus civile</hi> and incapable of being made the ground of an
                    action for its enforcement, yet might be given effect to indirectly by other
                    equitable remedies. Regard for the third was nothing new in the jurisprudence of
                    the period; the republic had already admitted it as a principle that a man was
                    not to be unjustifiably enriched at another’s cost; the jurists of the empire,
                    however, gave it a wider application than before, and used it as a key to the
                    solution of many a difficult question in the domain of the law of contract. As
                    for the fourth, it was one that had to be applied with delicacy; for the <hi
                    rend="italic"> voluntas</hi> could not in equity be preferred to its
                    manifestation to the prejudice of other parties who in good faith had acted upon
                    the latter. We have many evidences of the skilful way in which the matter was
                    handled, speculative opinion being held in check by considerations of individual
                    interest and general utility.</p>
                <p>A remark of Voigt’s on the subject is well worthy of being kept in view, that the
                    risk which arose from the setting up of the precepts of a speculative <hi
                    rend="italic"> jus naturale,</hi> as derogating from the rules of the <hi
                    rend="italic"> jus civile,</hi> was greatly diminished through the position held
                    by the jurists of the early empire. Their <hi rend="italic">jus respondendi
                    {infra,</hi> p. 705) made them legislative organs of the state, so that, in
                    introducing principles of the <hi rend="italic">jus naturale,</hi> or of <hi
                    rend="italic">acquum et bonum,</hi> they at the same moment positivized them and
                    gave them the force of law. They were, he says, “philosophers in the sphere of
                    law, searchers after the ultimate truth; but, while they—usually in reference to
                    a concrete case—sought out the truth and applied what they had found, they
                    combined with the freedom and untrammelledness of speculation the life-freshness
                    of practice and the power of assuring the operativeness of their abstract
                    propositions.” <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Voigt,
                    p. 341. </p></note><hi rend="italic">Influence of Constitutional Changes.—</hi>
                    The changes in the constitution aided not a little the current of the law. Men
                    of foreign descent reached the throne and recruited the senate,—proud indeed of
                    the history and traditions of Rome, yet in most cases free from prejudice in
                    favour of institutions that had nothing to recommend them but their antiquity.
                    Military life had not the same attractions as during the republic; there was no
                    longer a tribunate to which men of ambition might aspire; the comitia soon
                    ceased to afford an outlet for public eloquence; so that men of education and
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n727/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0727-0704"/>position had all the more inducement to devote
                    themselves to the conscientious study and regular practice of the law. This was
                    fjreatly encouraged by the action of Augustus in creating a class of icensed or
                    patented jurists, privileged to give answers to questions submitted to them by
                    the judges, and that <hi rend="italic">ex auctoritate principis,</hi> and still
                    more so, perhaps, by Hadrian’s reorganization of the imperial privy council,
                    wherein a large proportion of the seats were assigned to jurists of distinction.
                    With several of the emperors lawyers were amongst their most intimate and
                    trusted friends. Again and again the office of privtorian prefect, the highest
                    next the throne, was filled by them; Papinian, Ulpian, and Paul all held it in
                    the reigns of Septimius Severus and Alexander. Jurisprudence, therefore, was not
                    merely an honourable and lucrative profession under the new arrangements, but a
                    passport to places of eminence in the state; and till the death of Alexander the
                    ranks of the jurists never failed to be recruited by men of position and
                    accomplishment.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Extension of Citizenship to the Empire generally. —</hi> It
                    must have been between the years 212 and 217 that Caracalla published his
                    constitution conferring citizenship on all the free inhabitants of the empire.
                    Far-reaching as were its consequences, the primary purpose was purely fiscaL
                    Augustus had imposed a tax of five per cent, on inheritances and bequests,
                    except where the whole succession was worth less than 100,000 sesterces or the
                    heir or legatee was a near kinsman of the deceased. It was continued by his
                    successors, and was very profitable, thanks to the propensity of the well-to-do
                    classes for single blessedness, followed by testamentary distribution of their
                    fortunes amongst their friends. But it affected only the successions of Roman
                    citizens, so that the great mass of the provincials escaped it. Caracalla, being
                    needy, not only increased it temporarily to ten per cent., but widened the area
                    of its operation by elevating all his free subjects to the rank of citizens. The
                    words of Ulpian are very inclusive,—“in urbe Romano qui sunt . . . cives Romani
                    effecti sunt ”; but there is considerable diversity of opinion as to their
                    meaning, caused by the fact that peregrins are still mentioned by some of
                    Caracalla’s successors. Limit the constitution, however, as we may, there can be
                    no question of its immense importance. By conferring citizenship on the
                    provincial peregrins it subjected them in all their relations to the law of
                    Rome, and qualified them for taking part in many transactions both <hi
                    rend="italic"> inter vivos</hi> and <hi rend="italic">mortis causa</hi> which
                    previously had been incompetent for them. It did away with the necessity for the
                    <hi rend="italic">jus gentium</hi> as a separate positive system. Its principles
                    and its doctrines, it is true, survived, and were expanded and elaborated as
                    freely and successfully as ever; but they were so dealt with as part and parcel
                    of the civil law of Rome, which had ceased to be Italian and become
                    imperial.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Legislation of Comitia and Senate.—</hi> Augustus, clinging as
                    much as possible to the form of republican institutions, thought it ex-</p>
                <p>fiedient not to break with the old practice of submitting his legis-ative
                    proposals to the vote of the comitia of the tribes. Some of them were far from
                    insignificant. Besides various measures for the amendment of the criminal law,
                    three groups of enactments of considerable importance owed their authorship to
                    him, the first to improve domestic morality and encourage fruitful marriage, the
                    second to abate the evils that had arisen from the too lavish admission of
                    liberated slaves to the privileges of citizenship, and the third to regulate
                    procedure in public prosecutions and private litigations.</p>
                <p>The first group included the <hi rend="italic">Lex Julia de adultcriis
                    coercendis</hi> of</p>
                <p>736 and the <hi rend="italic">Lex Julia et Papia Poppaea,—</hi> the latter a
                    voluminous matrimonial code, which for two or three centuries exercised such an
                    influence as to be regarded as one of the sources of Roman law almost quite as
                    much as the XII. Tables or Julian’s consolidated <hi rend="italic">Edict.</hi>
                    It was often spoken of as the <hi rend="italic">Lex Caducaria,</hi> one of its
                    most remarkable provisions being that unmarried persons (within certain ages and
                    under certain qualifications) should forfeit entirely anything to which they
                    were entitled under a testament, and that married but childless persons should
                    forfeit one-half, the lapsed provisions <hi rend="italic">(caduca')</hi> going
                    to the other persons named in the will who were qualified in terms of the
                    statute, and failing them to the fisc. However well intended, the language of
                    Juvenal and others raises doubts whether the law did not really do more harm
                    than good. By the Christian emperors many of its provisions were repealed, while
                    others fell into disuse; and in tne Justinianian books hardly a trace is left of
                    its distinctive features.</p>
                <p>The second group included the zElia-Sentian law of the year 4 a.d., the
                    Fufia-Caninian law of the year 8, and the Junia-Norban law of the year 19,—the
                    last passed in the reign of Tiberius, but was probably planned by Augustus. The
                    JElia-Sentian law regulated the matter of manumission, with the result that a
                    manumittee might on that event, and according to circumstances minutely
                    described, become (1) either a citizen, or (2) a freedman with the possibility
                    of attaining citizenship by a process indicated in the statute, or (3) a
                    freedman who, because of his bad character, was forbidden to reside within a
                    hundred miles of Rome and denied the hope of ever becoming a citizen <hi
                    rend="italic"> (libertus dediticius).</hi> The Junian law was passed in order to
                    define more precisely the status in the meantime of those freedmen who had a
                    potentiality of citizenship. It did so by assimilating them to the colonial
                    Latins, denying to them the rights of a citizen proper so far as concerned
                    family and succession, but conceding to them all the patrimonial rights of a
                    citizen and the fullest power of dealing with their belongings so long as not
                    <hi rend="italic">mortis causa</hi> and to the prejudice of their patrons. This
                    was the Junian Latinity so prominent in the pages of Gaius, but of which our
                    limits exclude any detailed description.</p>
                <p>The third group of enactments referred to included the two <hi rend="italic"
                    >Leges Juliac judiciariae, of</hi> which we know but little. That regulating
                    procedure in private litigations is the same that is mentioned by Gaius as
                    having completed the work of the Aebutian law in substituting the formular
                    system for that <hi rend="italic">per legis actiones.</hi> It must have been a
                    somewhat comprehensive statute, as a passage in the <hi rend="italic">Vatican
                    Fragments</hi> refers to a provision of its 27th section; and our ignorance of
                    its contents therefore, beyond one or two trifling details, is the more to be
                    regretted.</p>
                <p>From the time of Tiberius onwards it was the senate that did the work of
                    legislation, for the simple reason that the comitia were no longer fit for it.
                    And very active it seems to have been. This may have been due to some extent to
                    the fact that so many professional jurists, aware from their practice of the
                    points in which the law required amendment, possessed seats in the imperial
                    council, where the drafts of the senatusconsults were prepared. It was the
                    senatusconsults that were the principal statutory factors of what was called by
                    both emperors and jurists the <hi rend="italic">jus novum,—</hi> law that
                    departed often very widely from the principles of the old <hi rend="italic">jus
                    civile,</hi> that was much more in accordance with those of the <hi
                    rend="italic"> Edict,</hi> and that to a great extent might have been introduced
                    through its means had not the authority of the praetors been overshadowed by
                    that of the prince. In the end of the 2d and the beginning of the 3d century the
                    supremacy of the latter in the senate became rather too pronounced, men quoting
                    the <hi rend="italic">oratio</hi> in which he had submitted to it a project of
                    law instead of the resolution which gave it legislative effect. No doubt it must
                    have been carefully considered beforehand in the imperial council, and rarely
                    stood in need of further discussion; but the ignoring of the formal act that
                    followed it tended unduly to emphasize the share borne in it by the sovereign,
                    and made it all the easier for the emperors after Alexander Severus to dispense
                    altogether with the time-honoured practice.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Consolidated Edictum Perpetuum. —</hi> The edicts of the
                    praetors, which had attained very considerable proportions before the fall of
                    the republic, certainly received some additions in the early empire. But those
                    magistrates did not long enjoy the same independence as of old; there was a
                    greater <hi rend="italic">imperium</hi> than theirs in the state, before which
                    they hesitated to lay hands on the law with the boldness of their predecessors.
                    They continued as before to publish annually at entry on office the edicts that
                    had been handed down to them through generations; but their own additions were
                    soon limited to mere amendments rendered necessary by the provisions of some
                    senatusconsult that affected the <hi rend="italic">jus honorarium.</hi> They
                    ceased to be that <hi rend="italic">viva vox juris civilis</hi> which they had
                    been in the time of Cicero; the emperor, if any one, was now entitled to the
                    epithet; the annual edict had lost its <hi rend="italic">raison d'être.</hi>
                    Hadrian was of opinion that the time had come for writing its “explicit,” and
                    giving it another and a more enduring and authoritative shape,— for so
                    fashioning and so sanctioning it that it might be received as law, and not
                    merely as edict, throughout the length and breadth of the empire. He accordingly
                    commissioned Salvius Julianus, urban praetor at the time, to revise it, with a
                    view to its approval by the senate as part of the statute law.</p>
                <p>The révisai, unfortunately, like the XII. Tables, is no longer extant. It is only
                    a very slight account we have of the revision,— a line or two in Eutropius and
                    Aurelius Victor, and a few lines in two of Justinian’s prefaces to the <hi
                    rend="italic"> Digest.</hi> We may assume, from what is said there, that there
                    were both abridgment and rearrangement of the edicts of the urban praetor; but
                    the question remains how far Julian consolidated with them those of the peregrin
                    praetor and other officials who had contributed to the <hi rend="italic"> jus
                    honorarium.</hi> Those of the curule aediles, we are told, were included;
                    Justinian says that they formed the last part of Julian’s work, and may have
                    been a sort of appendix. There is reason to believe that so much of the edicts
                    of the provincial governors as differed from those of the praetors were also
                    incorporated in it, and that the edicts of the peregrin praetors, in so far as
                    they contained available matter not embodied in those of their urban colleagues
                    or the provincial governors, were dealt with in the same way. The consolidation
                    got the name of <hi rend="italic">Edictum Perpetuum</hi> in a sense somewhat
                    different from that formerly imputed to <hi rend="italic">édicta perpétua</hi>
                    as distinguished from <hi rend="italic">edicta repentina,</hi> and, after
                    approval by Hadrian,' seems to have been formally sanctioned by senatusconsult.
                    It was thus a closed chapter so far as the praetors were concerned; for, though
                    it may have continued for a time to hold its place on their album with its
                    formularies of actions, they had no longer any power to alter or make additions
                    to it. It liad ceased to be a mere efflux of their <hi rend="italic">

                    but in those of the emperor.</p>
                <p>The Julian <hi rend="italic">Edict</hi> does not seem to have been divided into
                    books, but only into rubricated titles; and the general impression is that the
                    formularies of actions were split up and distributed in their appropriate
                    places. The arrangement is not difficult to discover by comparison of the
                    various commentaries upon it, particularly those of Ulpian and Paul, which each
                    contained over eighty books. First came a series of titles dealing with the
                    foundations and first steps of all legal procedure,—jurisdiction, summons,
                    intervention of attorneys or procurators, &amp;c.; secondly, ordinary process in
                    virtue of the magistrate’s <hi rend="italic">jurisilictio</hi>; thirdly,
                    extraordinary process, originally in virtue of his <hi rend="italic"
                    >imperium</hi>; fourthly, execution against judgment-debtors, bankrupts,
                    &amp;c.; fifthly, interdicts, exceptions, and praetorian stipulations; and
                    lastly, the aedilian remedies. From the quotations from the Julian <hi
                    rend="italic"> Edict</hi> embodied in the fragments of the writings of the
                    commentators preserved by Justinian repeated attempts have been made to
                    reproduce it. Most of them are nothing.more than transcripts or attempted
                    reconstructions of passages in the <hi rend="italic">Digest</hi> which are
                    supposed to have been borrowed from it, and are of comparatively little value.

                    The right of responding under imperial authority (jms <hi rend="italic"
                    >respondendi ex auctoritate principis),</hi> first granted by Augustus and
                    continued by his successors down to the time of Alexander Severus, did not imply
                    any curtailment of the right of unlicensed jurists to give advice to any one who
                    chose to consult them. What it did was to give an authoritative character to a
                    response, so that the judge who had asked for it and to whom it was
                    presented—for the judges were but private citizens, most of them unlearned in
                    the law—was bound to adopt it as if it had emanated from the emperor himself. It
                    may be that Augustus was actuated by a political motive,—that he was desirous by
                    this concession to attach lawyers of eminence to the new <hi rend="italic"
                    >régime,</hi> and prevent the recurrence of the evils experienced during the
                    republic from the too great influence of patrons. But, whatever may have
                    prompted his action in the matter, its beneficial consequences for the law can
                    hardly be overrated. For the quasi - legislative powers with which they were
                    invested enabled the patented counsel to influence current doctrine not
                    speculatively merely but positively <hi rend="italic">{jura condere),</hi> and
                    so to leaven their interpretations of the <hi rend="italic">jus civile</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic"> jus honorarium</hi> with suggestions of natural law as to
                    give a new complexion to the system.</p>
                <p>Instead of giving his opinion like the unlicensed jurist by word of mouth, either
                    at the request of the judge or at the instance of one of the parties, the
                    patented counsel, who did not require to give his reasons, reduced it to writing
                    and sent it to the court under seal. Augustus does not seem to have contemplated
                    the possibility of conflicting responses being tendered from two or more jurists
                    equally privileged. It was an awkward predicament for a judge to be placed in.
                    Hadrian solved the difficulty by declaring that in such a case the judge should
                    be entitled to use his own discretion. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Gaius, i. 7. Justinian, <hi rend="italic">Inst.,</hi> i. 2,

                    'with which he was dissatisfied he could go on calling for others until he got
                    one to his mind, and then pronounce judgment in accordance with it on the ground
                    that there was difference of opinion, is extremely unlikely. The more probable
                    explanation of Hadrian’s rescript is, that the number of patented responding
                    counsel was very limited; that a judge, if he desired their assistance, was
                    required by this rescript to consult them all <hi rend="italic">{quorum omnium
                    si,</hi> &amp;c.); that, if they were unanimous, but only then, their opinion
                    had force of statute <hi rend="italic">{legis vicem optinet)</hi>; and that when

                    constitution, whether in the shape of rescript, decree, or edict, had the force
                    of statute. It may be that by the time of Ulpian that was the prevailing
                    opinion; but modern criticism is disposed to regard the <hi rend="italic">
                    dictum</hi> of Gaius, written in the time of Antoninus Pius, as coloured by his
                    Asiatic notions, and not quite accurate so far as the edicts were concerned. As
                    supreme magistrate the emperor had the same <hi rend="italic"> jus cdicendi</hi>
                    that kings, consuls, and prsetors had had before him, and used it as they did to
                    indicate some course of action he meant to adopt and follow or some relief he
                    proposed to grant. His range, of course, was much greater than that of the
                    prsetors had been; for his authority endured for life, and extended over the
                    whole empire and every department of government. But originally, and in
                    principle, his successor on the throne was no more bound to adopt any of his
                    edicts than a praetor was to adopt those of his predecessors. That it was not
                    unusual for an edict to be renewed, and that it occasionally happened that the
                    renewal was not by the immediate successor of its original author, are manifest
                    from various passages in the texts. Very frequently, when its utility had stood
                    the test of years, it was transmuted into a senatusconsult; this fact proves of
                    itself that an edict <hi rend="italic">per se</hi> had not the effect of
                    statute. But their adoption by a succession of two or three sovereigns, whose
                    reigns were of average duration, may have been held sufficient to give them the
                    character of consuetudinary law; and, by a not unnatural process, unreflecting
                    public opinion may have come to impute force of statute to the edict itself
                    rather than to the <hi rend="italic">longa consuetudo</hi> that followed on it,
                    thus paving the way for the assertion by the sovereigns of the later empire of
                    an absolute right of legislation, and for the recognition of the <hi
                    rend="italic">lex cdictalis {infra,</hi> p. 710) as the only form of
                    statute.</p>
                <p>The imperial rescripts and decrees <hi rend="italic">{rescripta, decretal)</hi>
                    had force of law <hi rend="italic">{legis vicem habent)</hi> from the earliest
                    days of the empire, and their operation was never limited to the lifetime of the
                    prince from whom they had proceeded. But they were not directly acts of
                    legislation. In both the emperor theoretically did no more than authoritatively
                    interpret existing law, although the boundary between interpretation and new
                    law, sometimes difficult to define, was not always strictly adhered to. The
                    rescript was an answer by the emperor to a petition, either by an official or a
                    private party, for an instruction as to how the law was to be applied to the
                    facts set forth; when the answer was in a separate writing it was usually spoken
                    of as an <hi rend="italic">epistula</hi>; when noted at the foot of the
                    application its technical name was <hi rend="italic">subscriptio</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">adnotatio.</hi> The decree was the emperor’s ruling in a case
                    submitted to him judicially; it might be when it had been brought before him in
                    the first instance <hi rend="italic">extra ordinem,</hi> or when it had been
                    removed by <hi rend="italic">supplicatio</hi> from an inferior court in its
                    earliest stage, or when it came before him by appeal. It was as a judge that the
                    emperor pronounced his decree; but, proceeding as it did from the fountain of
                    authoritative interpretation, it had a value far beyond that of the sentence of
                    an inferior court (which was law only as between the parties), and formed a
                    precedent which governed all future cases involving the same question. Those
                    decrees and rescripts constituted one of the most important sources of the law
                    during the first three centuries and more of the empire, and were elaborated
                    with the assistance of the most eminent jurists of the day, the rescripts being

                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0729-0706"/>of the <hi rend="italic">jus militare</hi> (as it
                    is sometimes called) were the military testament and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >castrense peculium.</hi> The first set at naught all the rules of the <hi
                    rend="italic">jus civile</hi> and the praetors’ edict alike as to the form and
                    substance of last wills. It might be in writing, by word of mouth, by the
                    unspoken signs perhaps of a dying man; all that was required was the <hi
                    rend="italic">voluntas</hi> so manifested as not to be mistaken. More
                    extraordinary still,—it was sustained even though its provisions ran counter to
                    the most cherished rules of the common law. Contrary to the maxim that no man
                    could die partly testate and partly intestate, a soldier might dispose of part
                    of his estate by testament and leave the rest to descend to his heirs <hi
                    rend="italic">ab intestato.</hi> Contrary also to the maxim <hi rend="italic"
                    >semel heres semper heres,</hi> he might give his estate to A for life or for a
                    term of years, or until the occurrence of some event, with remainder to B.
                    Contrary to the general rule, a Latin or peregrin, or an unmarried or married
                    but childless person, might take an inheritance or a bequest from a soldier as
                    freely as could a citizen with children. His testament, in so far as it disposed
                    only of <hi rend="italic">bona castrensia,</hi> was not affected by <hi
                    rend="italic">capitis deminutio minima.</hi> It was not invalidated by
                    prseterition of <hi rend="italic">sui heredes,</hi> nor could they challenge it
                    because they had less under it than their “legitim”; nor could the instituted
                    heir claim a Fal-cidian fourth, even though nine-tenths of the succession had
                    been assigned to legatees. Finally, a later testament did not nullify an earlier
                    one, if it appeared to be the intention of the soldier testator that they should
                    be read together.</p>
                <p>All this is remarkable, manifesting a spirit very different from that which
                    animated the common law of testaments. True, it was a principle with the jurists
                    of the classical period that the <hi rend="italic">voluntatis ratio</hi> was to
                    be given effect to in the interpretation of testamentary writings; but that was
                    on the condition that the requirements of law as to form and substance had been
                    scrupulously observed. But in the military testament positive rules were made to
                    yield to the <hi rend="italic">voluntas</hi> in all respects: the will was
                    almost absolutely unfettered. Roman law in this matter gave place to natural
                    law. One would have expected the influence of so great a change to have
                    manifested itself by degrees in the ordinary law of testaments; yet it is barely
                    visible. In a few points the legislation of Constantine, Theodosius II., and
                    Justinian relaxed the strictness of the old rules; but there was never any
                    approach to the recognition of the complete supremacy of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >voluntas.</hi> In the <hi rend="italic">Corpus Juris</hi> the contrast between
                    the <hi rend="italic">testamcntum paganum</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">
                    tcstamentum militare</hi> was almost as marked as in the days of Trajan. The
                    latter was still a privileged deed, whose use was confined to a soldier actually
                    on service, and which had to be replaced by a testament executed according to
                    the usual forms of law within twelve months after his retirement.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">peculium castrense</hi> had a wider influence; for it was
                    the first of a series of amendments that vastly diminished the importance of the
                    <hi rend="italic">patria potestas</hi> on its patrimonial side. It had its
                    origin in the concession by Augustus to <hi rend="italic">filiifamilias</hi> on
                    service of the right to dispose by testament of what they had acquired in the
                    active exercise of their profession <hi rend="italic">(quod in castris
                    adquisierant).</hi> But it soon went much further. Confined at first to <hi
                    rend="italic"> filiifamilias</hi> on actual service, the privilege was extended
                    by Hadrian to those who had obtained honourable discharge. The same emperor
                    allowed them not merely to test on their <hi rend="italic">peculium
                    castrense,</hi> but to manumit slaves that formed part of it; and a little step
                    further recognized their right to dispose of it onerously or gratuitously <hi
                    rend="italic">inter vivos.</hi> By and by the range of it was extended so as to
                    include not only the soldier’s pay and prize but all that had come to him,
                    directly or indirectly, in connexion with his profession,—his outfit, gifts made
                    to him during his service, legacies from comrades, and so on. All this was in a
                    high degree subversive of the doctrines of the common law. It may almost be
                    called revolutionary; for it involved in the first place the recognition of the
                    right of a person <hi rend="italic">alicni juris</hi> to make a testament as if
                    he were swi <hi rend="italic">juris,</hi> and in the second place the
                    recognition of a separate estate in a <hi rend="italic">filiicsfami-lias</hi>
                    which he might deal with independently of his <hi rend="italic"
                    >paterfamilias,</hi> which could not be touched by the latter’s creditors, and
                    which he was not bound to collate (or bring into hotch-pot) on claiming a share
                    of his father’s succession. The radical right of the parent, however, was rather
                    suspended than extinguished; for, if the soldier son died intestate, the right
                    of the <hi rend="italic"> paterfamilias</hi> revived: he took his son’s
                    belongings, not as his heir appropriating an in heritance, but as his <hi
                    rend="italic">paterfamilias</hi> reclaiming a <hi rend="italic">

                    which persons of position showed a remarkable distaste, have already been
                    mentioned. The relation of husband and wife still in law required no more for
                    its creation than deliberate interchange of nuptial consent, although for one or
                    two purposes the bride’s home-coming to her husband’s house was regarded as the
                    criterion of completed marriage. But it was rarely accompanied with <hi
                    rend="italic">manus.</hi> So repugnant was such subjection to patrician ladies
                    that they declined to submit to confarreate nuptials; and so great consequently
                    became the difficulty of finding persons qualified by confarreate birth to fill
                    the higher priesthoods that early in the empire it had to be decreed that
                    confarreation should in future be productive of <hi rend="italic">manus</hi>
                    only <hi rend="italic">quoad sacra,</hi> and should not make the wife a member
                    of her husband’s family. <hi rend="italic"> Manus</hi> by a year’s uninterrupted
                    cohabitation was already out of date in the time of Gaius; and, although that by
                    coemption was still in use in his time, it probably was quite unknown by the end
                    of the period. Husband and wife therefore had their separate estates, the common
                    establishment being maintained by the husband, with the assistance of the
                    revenue of the wife’s dowry <hi rend="italic"> (dos),—</hi> an institution which
                    received much attention at the hands of the jurists, and was to some extent
                    regulated by statute. Divorce was unfortunately very common; it was lawful even
                    without any assignable cause; when blame attached to either side, he or she
                    suffered deprivation to some extent of the nuptial provisions, but there were no
                    other penal consequences.</p>
                <p>Not only in the case of a <hi rend="italic">filiusfamilias</hi> who had adopted a
                    military career, but in all directions, there was manifested a tendency to place
                    restrictions on the exercise of the <hi rend="italic">patria potestas.</hi> This
                    was due in a great degree to the hold that the doctrines of natural law were
                    gaining within the Roman system, partly also to the fact that the emperors,
                    having succeeded to the censorial <hi rend="italic">regimen morum,</hi> allowed
                    it freely to influence their edicts and rescripts. Exposure of an infant was
                    still allowed; but a parent was no longer permitted, even in the character of
                    household judge, to put his son to death; in fact his prerogative was limited to
                    moderate chastisement, the law requiring, in case of a grave offence that
                    merited severer punishment, that he should hand his child over to the ordinary
                    tribunal. His right of sale, in like manner, was restricted to young children,
                    and permitted only when he was in great poverty and unable to maintain them,
                    while their impignora-tion by him was prohibited under pain of banishment.</p>
                <p>Except in the solitary case of a. son who was a soldier, a <hi rend="italic"
                    >jmler-familias</hi> was still recognized as in law the owner of all the
                    earnings and other acquisitions of his children <hi rend="italic">in
                    potestate</hi>; but the old rule still remained that for their civil debts he
                    was not liable beyond the amount of the fund he had advanced them to deal with
                    as <hi rend="italic"> de facto</hi> their own <hi rend="italic">(peculium
                    profecticium),</hi> except when he had derived advantage from their contract or
                    had expressly or by implication authorized them to enter into it as his agents.
                    To the party with whom he had contracted a <hi rend="italic">filiusfamilias</hi>
                    was himself liable as fully as if he had been a <hi rend="italic">
                    paterfamilias,</hi> with one exception, namely, when his debt was for borrowed
                    money; in that case, with some very reasonable qualifications, it was declared
                    by the notorious Macedonian senatusconsult (of the time of Vespasian) that the
                    lender should not be entitled to recover payment, even after his borrower had
                    become <hi rend="italic">sui juris</hi> by his father’s death. Between a father
                    and his emancipated son there was, and always had been, perfect freedom of
                    contract; but so was there now between a father and his soldier son in any
                    matter relating to the <hi rend="italic">peculium castrense,</hi> even though
                    the son was <hi rend="italic">in potestate.</hi> What is still more remarkable
                    is that the new sentiment which was operating on the <hi rend="italic">jus
                    civile</hi> admitted the possibility of natural obligation between <hi
                    rend="italic">paterfamilias</hi> and <hi rend="italic">filiusfamilias</hi> even
                    in reference to the <hi rend="italic"> peculium profecticium,</hi> which, though
                    incapable of direct enforcement by action, was yet to some extent recognized and
                    given effect to indirectly.</p>
                <p>In the matter of guardianship, while the tutory of pupils was carefully tended
                    and the law in regard to it materially amended during the period under review
                    (particularly by a senatusconsult generally referred to as the <hi rend="italic"
                    > Oratio divi Sevcri,</hi> prohibiting alienation of the ward’s property without
                    judicial authority), that of women above the age of pupilarity gradually
                    disappeared. The guardianship or curatory <hi rend="italic">(cura) of</hi>
                    minors above pupilarity owed its institution to Marcus Aurelius. The Plsetorian
                    law of the middle of the sixth century of the city had indeed imposed penalties
                    on those taking undue advantage of the inexperience of minors, <hi rend="italic"
                    > i.e.,</hi> persons <hi rend="italic">sui juris</hi> under the age of
                    twenty-five; and from that time the praetors were in the habit of appointing
                    curators to act with such persons for the protection of their interests in
                    particular affairs. But it was Marcus Aurelius who first made curatory a general
                    permanent office, to endure in the ordinary case until the ward attained
                    majority. The powers, duties, and responsibilities of such curators became a
                    matter for careful and elaborate definition and regulation by the jurists, whose
                    exposition of the law of guardianship, whether by tutors or curators, has found
                    wide acceptance in modern systems of jurisprudence.</p>

                    testamenti.</hi> It was a rescript of his, declaring that an heir-at-law should
                    no longer be entitled to dispute the last wishes of a testator on the technical
                    ground of non-compliance with the purely formal requirements of the law, that
                    practically introduced what Justinian calls the praetorian testament.</p>
                <p>One of the commonest provisions in the testaments of the period was the <hi
                    rend="italic"> fideicommissum,—</hi> a request by the testator to his heir to
                    enter to the inheritance and thereafter denude wholly or partially in favour of
                    a third party. It was introduced in the time of Augustus by (it is said) a
                    testator who had married a peregrin wife, and desired thus indirectly to give to
                    his peregrin children the succession which, as not being citizens, they could
                    neither take <hi rend="italic">ab intestato</hi> nor as his direct testamentary
                    heirs. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>They could not
                    even have a claim as cognates under the praetorian rules; for the praetors
                    followed the rule of the <hi rend="italic">jus civile</hi> to this extent, that
                    they did not grant <hi rend="italic">bonorum possessio</hi> to a person who had
                    not <hi rend="italic">testamenti factio</hi> with him whose succession was in
                    question. </p></note> The practice soon gained ground, and became thoroughly
                    established once the emperor, shocked at the perfidy of a trustee who had failed
                    to comply with the request of his testator, indicated his approval of the new
                    institution by remitting the matter to the consuls of the day, with instructions
                    to do in the circumstances what they thought just. So quickly did it establish
                    itself in public favour, and so numerous did the questions become as to the
                    construction and fulfilment of testamentary trusts, that before long it was
                    found necessary to institute a court specially charged with their determination,
                    —that of the <hi rend="italic"> praetor fideicommissarius.</hi></p>
                <p>The employment of a trust as a means of benefiting those who were under
                    disqualifications as heirs or legatees, as, for example, persons who had no <hi
                    rend="italic"> testamenti factio,</hi> women incapacitated by the Voconian law,
                    unmarried and married but childless persons incapacitated by the Julian and
                    Papia-Poppsean law, and so on, was in time prohibited by statute; but that did
                    not affect its general popularity. For, whether what was contemplated was a
                    transfer of the universal <hi rend="italic">hereditas</hi> or a part of it to
                    the beneficiary <hi rend="italic">{fideicommissum hereditatis),</hi> or only of
                    some particular thing <hi rend="italic">{fideicommissum rei singula r is),</hi>
                    a testamentary trust had various advantages over either a direct institution or
                    a direct bequest <hi rend="italic">{legatum).</hi> In theory the imposition upon
                    the heir of a trust in favour of a beneficiary, whether it required him to
                    denude of the whole or only a part of the inheritance, did not deprive him of
                    his character of heir or relieve him of the responsibilities of the position;
                    and at common law therefore he was entitled to decline the succession, often to
                    the great prejudice of the beneficiary. In order to avoid such a mischance, and
                    at the same time to regulate their relations <hi rend="italic"> inter se</hi>
                    and towards debtors and creditors of the testator’s, it became the practice for
                    the parties to enter into stipulatory arrangements about the matter; but these
                    were to some extent rendered superfluous by two senatusconsults, the Trebellian
                    in the time of Nero and the Pegasian in that of Vespasian, which at once secured
                    the beneficiary against the trustee’s <hi rend="italic">{i.e.,</hi> the heir’s)
                    repudiation of the inheritance, protected the latter from all risk of loss where
                    he was trustee and nothing more, and enabled the former to treat directly with
                    debtors and creditors of the testator’s and himself ingather the corporeal items
                    of the inheritance.</p>
                <p>It was one of the advantages of a trust-bequest, whether universal or singular,
                    that it might be conferred in a codicil, even though unconfirmed by any relative
                    testament. The codicil <hi rend="italic">{codiciUi),</hi> also an invention of
                    the time of Augustus, was a deed of a very simple nature. It was inappropriate
                    either for disherison of <hi rend="italic">sui</hi> or institution of an heir;
                    but if confirmed by testament it might contain direct bequests, manumissions,
                    nominations of tutors, and the like, and whether confirmed or unconfirmed might,
                    as stated, be utilized as a vehicle for trust-gifts. Latterly it was held
                    operative even in the absence of a testament, the trusts contained in it being
                    regarded as burdens on the heir-at-law.</p>
                <p>The most important changes in the law of intestate succession during the period
                    were those accomplished by the Tertullian and Orphitian senatusconsults, fruits
                    of that respect for the precepts of natural law which in so many directions was
                    modifying the doctrines of the <hi rend="italic">pis civile.</hi> The first was
                    passed in the reign of Hadrian, the second in the year 178, under Marcus
                    Aurelius. Down to the time of the Tertullian senatusconsult a mother and her
                    child by a marriage that was unaccompanied with <hi rend="italic">manus</hi>
                    stood related to each other only as cognates, being in law members of different
                    families; consequently their chance of succession to each other was remote,
                    being postponed to that of their respective agnates to the sixth or seventh
                    degree. The purpose of the senatusconsult was to prefer a mother to all agnates
                    of her deceased child except father and brother and sister; father and brother
                    excluded her; but with a sister of the deceased, and in the absence of father or
                    brother, she shared equally. While there can be little doubt that it was natural
                    considerations that dictated this amendment, yet its authors were too timid to
                    justify it on the abstract principle of common humanity, lest thereby they
                    should seem to impugn the wisdom of <hi rend="italic">thejus civile,</hi> and so
                    they confined its application to women who had thejus <hi rend="italic"
                    >liber-orum, i.e.,</hi> to women of free birth who were mothers of three
                    children and freedwomen who were mothers of four, thus making it ostensibly a
                    reward of fertility. The Orphitian senatusconsult was the counterpart of the
                    Tertullian. It gave children, whether legitimate or illegitimate, a right of
                    succession to their mother in preference to all her agnates; and subsequent
                    constitutions extended the principle, admitting children to the inheritance not
                    only of their maternal grandparents but also to that of their paternal
                    grandmother.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">The Formular System</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    procedure of the first three centuries of the empire was still two-staged; it
                    commenced before the prsetor <hi rend="italic">{in jure)</hi> and was concluded
                    before a <hi rend="italic"> judex {in judicio).</hi> But the <hi rend="italic"
                    >legis actiones</hi> had given place to praetorian <hi rend="italic"
                    >formulae.</hi> Under the older system parties, and particularly the plaintiff,
                    had themselves to formulate in statutory or traditional words of style the
                    matter in controversy between them; and as they formulated, so did it go for
                    trial to centumviral court or <hi rend="italic">judex</hi> or arbiters, with the
                    not infrequent result that it was then all too late discovered that the real
                    point in the case had been missed. Under the formular system parties were free
                    to represent their plaint and defence to the praetor in any words they pleased,
                    the plaintiff asking for a <hi rend="italic">formula</hi> and usually indicating
                    the style on the <hi rend="italic">album</hi> that he thought would suit his
                    purpose, and the defendant demanding when necessary an exception, <hi
                    rend="italic"> i.e.,</hi> a plea in defence, either praetorian or statutory,
                    that, without traversing the facts or law of the plaintiffs case, avoided his
                    demand on grounds of equity or public policy. It was for the praetor to consider
                    and determine whether the action or exception should or should not be granted,
                    and, if granted, whether it should be according to the style exhibited on the
                    <hi rend="italic">album</hi> or according to a modification of it. The result he
                    embodied in a written and signed appointment to a judge, whom he instructed what
                    he had to try, and empowered to pronounce a finding either condemning or
                    acquitting the defendant. This writing was the <hi rend="italic">
                    formula.</hi></p>
                <p>Although it was not until the early empire that this system of procedure attained
                    its full development, yet it had its commencement two centuries before the fall
                    of the republic. Gaius ascribes its introduction and definitive establishment to
                    the <hi rend="italic">Lex Aebutia</hi> (probably of the second decade of the
                    sixth century of the city) and two judiciary laws of the time of Augustus <hi
                    rend="italic">{supra,</hi> pp. 696, 704). The JEbutian law, of which
                    unfortunately w <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> e know very little, is generally
                    supposed to have empowered the praetors (1) to devise a simpler form of
                    procedure for causes already cognizable <hi rend="italic">per legis
                    actionem,</hi> (2) to devise forms of action to meet cases not cognizable under
                    the older system, and (3) themselves to formulate the issue and reduce it to
                    writing. It was by no means so radical a change as is sometimes supposed. There
                    were <hi rend="italic">formulae</hi> employed by the praetor both in the
                    procedure <hi rend="italic">per judicis postulationem</hi> and in that <hi
                    rend="italic"> p&gt;er condictionem.</hi> The difference between them and the
                    <hi rend="italic">formulae</hi> of the jEbutian system was that the former were
                    in part mere echoes of the statutory words of style uttered by the plaintiff,
                    and that they were not written but spoken in the hearing of witnesses.</p>
                <p>A large proportion of the personal actions of the formular system were evolved
                    out of the <hi rend="italic">legis actio per condictionem.</hi> The sequence of
                    operations may have been something like this. Taking the simplest form of it,
                    the action for <hi rend="italic">certa pecunia</hi> under the Silian law, the
                    first step was to drop the formal <hi rend="italic">condictio</hi> from which it
                    derived its character of <hi rend="italic">legis actio,</hi> thus avoiding a
                    delay of thirty days; the plaintiff stated his demand in informal words, and, if
                    the defendant denied indebtedness, the prsetor straightway formulated a written
                    appointment of and instruction to a judge, embodying in it the issue in terms
                    substantially the same as those he would have employed under the earlier
                    procedure:—“Titius be judge. Should it appear that N. N. ought to pay <hi
                    rend="italic"> {dare oportere)</hi> 50,000 sesterces to A. A., in that sum
                    condemn N. N. to A. A. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>In the typical Roman styles of actions the plaintiff was usually called
                    Aulus Agerius and the defendant Numerius Negidius. </p></note> should it not so
                    appear, acquit him.” This was no longer the <hi rend="italic">legis actio per
                    condictionem,</hi> because what had made it <hi rend="italic">legis actio</hi>
                    was gone, but the <hi rend="italic">certi condictio</hi> of the formular system.
                    The <hi rend="italic">condictio triti-caria</hi> of the same system ran on the
                    same lines: “Titius be judge. Should it appear that N. N. ought to give A. A.
                    the slave Stichus, then, whatever be the value of the slave, in that condemn N.
                    N. to A. A.,” and so on. In both of these examples the <hi rend="italic"
                    >formula</hi> included only two of the four clauses that might find place in it
                    <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Gaius enumerates them
                    as the <hi rend="italic">Aemonstratio, intentio, adjudicatio,</hi> and <hi

                    39-43. Besides these <hi rend="italic"> &amp; formula</hi> might be preceded by
                    a <hi rend="italic"> praescriptio</hi> (Gai., iv. §§ 130-137), and have
                    incorporated in it fictions (§§ 32-38), exceptions (§§ 115-125), and
                    replications, duplications, &amp;c. </p></note></p>

                <p>tention” and a “condemnation.” The matter of claim in both cases was certain,—so
                    much money in one, a slave in the other; but, while in the first the
                    condemnation also was certain, in the second it was uncertain. What if the claim
                    also was uncertain,— say a share of the profits of a joint adventure assured by
                    stipulation? It was quite competent for the plaintiff to condescend on a
                    definite sum, and claim that as due to him; but it was very hazardous, for
                    unless he was able to prove the debt to the last sesterce he got nothing. To
                    obviate the risk of such failure the pnetors devised the <hi rend="italic"
                    >incerti condictio,</hi> whose <hi rend="italic">formula</hi> commenced with a
                    “demonstration” or indication of the cause of action, and whose “intention”
                    referred to it and was conceived indefinitely: “Titius be judge. Whereas A. A.
                    stipulated with N. N. for a share of the profits of a joint adventure, whatever
                    in respect thereof N. N. ought to give to or do for (¿arc <hi rend="italic"
                    >faxere oportef)</hi> A. A., in the money amount thereof condemn N. N.,” and so
                    on. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This was
                    specifically called the <hi rend="italic">actio ex stipulatu,</hi> but was
                    really nothing more than a variety of the <hi rend="italic"> condictio
                    incerti.</hi> The later actions on the consensual contracts, and on all the
                    nominate real contracts except <hi rend="italic"> mutuum,</hi> in like manner
                    had specific names, but in fact were just <hi rend="italic">incerti
                    condictiones</hi> in the larger sense of the phrase. </p></note> Once this point
                    was attained further progress was comparatively easy, the way being open for the
                    construction of <hi rend="italic"> formulae</hi> upon illiquid claims arising
                    from transactions in which the practice of stipulation gradually dropped out of
                    use <hi rend="italic"> (supra,</hi> p. 701), till at last the <hi rend="italic"
                    >bonae fidei judicia</hi> were reached, marked by the presence in the
                    “intention” of the words <hi rend="italic">ex fide bona,—</hi> “whatever in
                    respect thereof N. N. ought in good faith to give to or do for A. A."</p>
                <p>In the case of real actions the transition from the <hi rend="italic">legis
                    actiones</hi> i to the <hi rend="italic">formulae</hi> followed a different
                    course. The ALbutian law did not abolish the procedure <hi rend="italic"> per
                    sacramentum</hi> when reference was to be to the centumviral court on a question
                    of quiritarian right. In the time of Cicero that court was apparently still in
                    full activity (p. 678), but by that of Gaius it is doubtful if it was resorted
                    to except for trial of questions of inheritance. In his time questions of
                    property were raised either <hi rend="italic">per sponsionem</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">per formulam petitoriam.</hi> The procedure by sponsion must be
                    regarded as the bridge between the sacramental process and the petitory <hi
                    rend="italic">vindicatio.</hi> In the first as in the second the question of
                    real right was determined only indirectly. The plaintiff required the defendant
                    to give him his stipulatory promise to pay a nominal sum of twenty-five
                    sesterces in the event of the thing in dispute being found to belong to the
                    former; and at the same time the defendant gave security for its transfer to the
                    plaintiff, with all fruits and profits, in the same event. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >formula</hi> that was adjusted and remitted to a judge <hi rend="italic">ex
                    facie</hi> raised only the simple question whether the twenty-five sesterces
                    were due or not: the action was in form a personal, not a real one, and was
                    therefore appropriately remitted to a single <hi rend="italic"> judex</hi>
                    instead of to the centumviral tribunal. But judgment on it could be reached only
                    through means of a finding <hi rend="italic"> (sentential</hi> on the question
                    of real right; if it was for the plaintiff he did not claim the amount of the
                    sponsion, but the thing which had been found to be his; and, if the defendant
                    delayed to deliver it, with its fruits and profits, the plaintiff had recourse
                    against the latter’s sureties. The petitory <hi rend="italic">formula</hi> was
                    undoubtedly of later introduction and much more straightforward. Like the <hi
                    rend="italic">certi condictio</hi> it contained only “intention” and
                    “condemnation.” It ran thus: “Titius be judge. Should it appear that the slave
                    Stichus, about whom this action has been raised, belongs to A. A. in quiritary
                    right, then, unless the slave be restored, whatever be his value, in that you
                    will condemn N. N. to A. A.; should it not so appear, you will acquit him.” s
                    The <hi rend="italic">formulae</hi> given above, whether applicable to real or
                    personal actions, are so many illustrations of the class known as <hi
                    rend="italic">formulae juris dvilis</hi> or <hi rend="italic">in jus

                    confession of weakness, and 1 adversely criticized accordingly. But every
                    amendment on the law is an admission of defect in what is being amended; and it
                    was in sympathy with the spirit of Roman jurisprudence, when it found an action
                    too narrow in its definition, to include some new case that ought to fall within
                    it, rather by feigning that the new case was the same as the old, to bring it
                    within the scope of the existing and familiar action, than to cause disturbance
                    by either altering the definition of the latter or introducing an entirely new
                    remedy. A <hi rend="italic">bonorum possessor (supra,</hi> p. 702) held a
                    position unknown to the <hi rend="italic">jus civile</hi>; he was not an heir,
                    and therefore not entitled offhand to employ the actions competent to an heir,
                    either for recovering the property of the defunct or proceeding against his
                    debtors. The praetor could have had no difficulty in devising new actions to
                    meet his case; but he preferred the simpler expedient of adapting to it an
                    heir’s actions, by introducing into the <hi rend="italic">formula</hi> a fiction
                    of civil heirship; so he did with the <hi rend="italic">bonorum emptor</hi> or
                    purchaser of a bankrupt’s estate at the sale of it in mass by his creditors. <hi
                    rend="italic">Emptio bonorum</hi> was a purely praetorian institution, and the
                    praetor, if he had thought fit, could easily have fortified the purchaser’s
                    acquisition by giving him praetorian remedies for recovering the property and
                    suing the debtors of the bankrupt; but here again he followed the simpler course
                    of giving him, as if he were a universal successor, the benefit of an heir’s
                    actions by help of a fiction of heirship. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    be sued under cover of a fiction of citizenship. A man who had acquired a <hi

                    by mancipation or surrender in court, if he was dispossessed before he had

                    for its recovery, for he was not in a position to affirm that he was quiritarian
                    owner; neither, for the same reason, could a man who in good faith and on a
                    sufficient title had acquired a thing from one who was not in a position to
                    alienate it. But in both cases the praetor granted him what was in effect a <hi

                    them came to be known by special names, as, for example, the <hi rend="italic">

                    the innominate ones. Their <hi rend="italic">formulae,</hi> unlike those <hi

                    the consideration of the judge, but only a question of fact, proof of which was
                    to be followed by a condemnation. That of the <hi rend="italic">actio de
                    dolo,</hi> for example, ran thus: “Titius be judge. Should it appear that,
                    through the fraud of N. N., A. A. was induced to convey and cede possession to
                    him of his farm (describing it), then, unless on your order N. N. restores it,

                    “condemnation” was occasionally “taxed” by the praetor, so as to prevent the
                    award of extravagant damages; or of the consequences of defects in the <hi
                    rend="italic"> formula</hi>; or of the procedure <hi rend="italic">in jure</hi>
                    before it was adjusted, or <hi rend="italic">in judicio</hi> afterwards; or of
                    appeal for review of the judgment by a higher tribunal; or of execution (which
                    was against the estate of the judgment-debtor, and took the form of
                    incarceration only when his goods could not be attached). Our main object has
                    been to show how elastic was this procedure, and how the praetorian <hi
                    rend="italic">formulae,</hi> in conjunction with the relative announcements in
                    the edict, supplied the vehicle for the introduction into the law of an immense
                    amount of new doctrine. The system w'as fully developed before Julian’s
                    consolidation of the praetorian remedy for the same wrong; for Gaius observes
                    (iv. 45) that in commodate and deposit failure of the borrower or depositary to
                    return the thing lent to or deposited -with him gave rise to actions that might
                    be formulated either <hi rend="italic">in jus or in factum.</hi> In the same

                    rend="italic">ordo judicioruin priva-torum.</hi> Early in the empire, however,
                    it became the practice in certain cases to abstain from adjusting a <hi
                    rend="italic">formula</hi> and making a remit to a <hi rend="italic">judex,</hi>
                    and to leave the cause in the hands of the magistrate from beginning to end.
                    This course was adopted sometimes because the claim that was being made rested
                    rather on moral than on legal right, and sometimes in order to avoid unnecessary
                    disclosure of family misunderstandings. Thus, the earliest questions that were
                    raised about testamentary trusts were sent for consideration and disposal to the
                    consuls, apparently because, in the existing state of jurisprudence, it was
                    thought incompetent for a beneficiary to maintain in reference to the heir (who
                    had only been <hi rend="italic">requested</hi> to comply with the testator’s
                    wishes) that he was bound in law <hi rend="italic">(dare oportere)</hi> to pay
                    him his bequest. Had the difficulty arisen at an earlier period, and in the
                    heyday of the constructive energy of the praetors, they would probably have
                    solved it with an <hi rend="italic">actio in factum.</hi> As it was, it fell to
                    the emperors to deal with it, and they adopted the method of <hi rend="italic"
                    >extraordinaria cognitio,</hi> the jurisdiction which they in the first instance
                    conferred on the consuls being before long confided to a magistrate specially
                    designated for it,— the <hi rend="italic">praetor fideicommissarius.</hi>
                    Questions between tutors and their pupil wards in like manner began to be dealt
                    with <hi rend="italic">extra ordinem,</hi> the cognition being entrusted by
                    Marcus Aurelius to <hi rend="italic">a praetor tute-laris</hi>; while fiscal
                    questions in which a private party was interested went to <hi rend="italic"> a.
                    praetor fisci,</hi> whose creation was due to Nerva. Claims for aliment between
                    parent and child or patron and freedman rested on natural duty rather than on
                    legal right; they could not therefore well be made the subject-matter of a <hi
                    rend="italic">judicium,</hi> and consequently went for disposal to the consuls
                    or the city prefect, and in the provinces to the governor. Questions of status,
                    especially of freedom or slavery, at least from the time of Marcus Aurelius,
                    were also disposed of <hi rend="italic">extra ordinem</hi>; and so were claims
                    by physicians, advocates, and public teachers for their <hi rend="italic"
                    >honoraria,</hi> and by officials for their salaries, the Romans refusing to
                    admit that these could be recovered by an ordinary action of location. In all
                    those extraordinary cognitions the procedure began with a complaint addressed to
                    the magistrate, instead of an <hi rend="italic"> in jus vocatio of</hi> the
                    party complained against; it was for the magistrate to require the attendance of
                    the latter <hi rend="italic">(evocatio) if</hi> he thought the complaint
                    relevant. The decision was a <hi rend="italic">judicatura</hi> or <hi

                    rend="italic">regime</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">jus civile</hi>; but their
                    number and scope were vastly increased under that of the <hi rend="italic">jus
                    praetorium.</hi> The characteristic of the procedure by interdict was this,—that
                    in it the praetor reversed the ordinary course of things, and, instead of
                    waiting for an inquiry into the facts alleged by a complainer, provisionally
                    assumed them to be true and pronounced an order upon the respondent, which he
                    was bound either to obey or show to be unjustified. The order pronounced might
                    be either restitutory, exhibitory (in both cases usually spoken of in the texts
                    as a decree), or prohibitory:—restitutory, when, for example, the respondent was
                    ordained to restore something he was alleged to have taken possession of by
                    violent means, to remove impediments he had placed in the channel of a river,
                    and so on; exhibitory, when he was ordained to produce something he was
                    unwarrantably detaining, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the body of a freeman he
                    was holding as his slave, or a will in which the complainer alleged that he had
                    an interest; prohibitory, as, for example, that he should not disturb the <hi
                    rend="italic">status quo</hi> of possession as between the complainer and
                    himself, that he should not interfere with a highway, a watercourse, the access
                    to a sepulchre, and so forth. If the respondent obeyed the order pronounced in a
                    restitutory or exhibitory decree, there was an end of the matter. But
                    frequently, and perhaps more often than not, the interdict was only the
                    commencement of a litigation, facilitated by sponsions and restipulations, in
                    which the questions had to be tried (1) whether the interdict or injunction was
                    justified, (2) -whether there had been breach of it, and, (3) if so, what
                    damages were due in consequence. The procedure therefore was often anything but
                    summary.</p>
                <p>In the possessory interdicts <hi rend="italic">uti possidetis</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic"> utrubi</hi> in particular it was extremely involved, due to some
                    extent to the fact that they were double interdicts <hi rend="italic"
                    >(interdicta duplicia), i.e.,</hi> addressed indifferently to both parties.
                    Gaius says, but, as most jurists think, erroneously, that they had been devised
                    as ancillary to a litigation about ownership, and for the purpose of deciding
                    which of the parties, as possessor, was to have the advantage of standing on the
                    defensive in the <hi rend="italic">rei vindicatio.</hi><note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Of that had been their original purpose, they
                    must have been unknown as long as a <hi rend="italic"> rei vindicatio</hi>
                    proceeded <hi rend="italic">per sacramentum</hi>; for in the sacramental real
                    action both parties vindicated, and both consequently were at once plaintiffs
                    and defendants. </p></note> That they were so used in his time, as in that of
                    Justinian, cannot be doubted. But it is amazing that they should have been, for
                    they were infinitely more cumbrous than the <hi rend="italic">vindicatio</hi> to
                    which they led up. Take the interdict <hi rend="italic">uti possidetis,</hi>
                    which applied to immovables, as <hi rend="italic">utrubi</hi> did to movables.
                    Both parties being present, the prsetor addressed them to this effect: “I forbid
                    that one of you two who does not possess the house in question to use force in
                    order to prevent the other who is in possession, provided he is so neither by
                    clandestine or violent exclusion of the first, nor in virtue of a grant from him
                    during pleasure, from continuing to possess as at present.” It is manifest that
                    this decided nothing; it was no more than a prohibition of disturbance of the
                    <hi rend="italic"> status quo</hi>; it left the question entirely open which of
                    the parties it was that was in possession, and which that was forbidden to
                    interfere. The manner of its explication was somewhat singular. Each of the
                    parties was bound at once to commit what in the case of one of them must have
                    been a breach of the interdict, by a pretence of violence offered to the other
                    <hi rend="italic">(vis ex conventu)</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>So Gaius calls it; it was probably the same thing as the <hi
                    rend="italic">vis moribus facta</hi> referred to by Cicero, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pro Caec.,</hi> 1, § 2, 8, § 22. </p></note> each of them was thus in a
                    position to say to the other —“We have both used force; but it was you alone
                    that did it in defiance of the interdict, for it is I that am in possession.”
                    The interim enjoyment of the fruits was then awarded to the highest bidder, who
                    gave his stipulatory promise to pay for them to his adversary in the event of
                    the latter being successful in the long run; penal sponsions and restipulations
                    were exchanged upon the question which of them had committed a breach of the
                    interdict; and on these, four in number, <hi rend="italic">formulae</hi> were
                    adjusted and sent to a <hi rend="italic">judex for</hi> trial. If the procedure
                    could not thus be explicated, because either of the parties declined to take
                    part in the <hi rend="italic"> vis ex conventu,</hi> or the bidding, or the
                    sponsions and restipulations, he was assumed to be in the wrong, and, by what
                    was called a secondary interdict, required to abstain from disturbing the other
                    “in all time coming.” Whatever we may think of the action system of the Romans
                    in the period of the classical jurisprudence, one cannot help standing aghast at
                    a procedure so cumbrous and complex as that of their possessory interdicts.</p>
                <p>2. A praetorian stipulation <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>To the authorities in note 1 above add Schirmer, <hi rend="italic">Geber die
                    prätorischen Judicial-Stipulationen,</hi> Greifswald, 1853. </p></note> was a
                    stipulatory engagement imposed upon a man by a magistrate or judge, in order to
                    secure a third party from the chance of loss or prejudice through some act or
                    omission either of him from whom the engagement was exacted or of some other
                    person for whom he was responsible. Although called praetorian, because the
                    cases in which such stipulations were exigible were set forth in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Edict,</hi> there can be no question that they originated in the
                    <hi rend="italic">jus civile</hi>; in fact they were just a means of assuring to
                    a man in advance the benefit of an action of the <hi rend="italic"> jus
                    civile</hi> whereby he might obtain reparation for any injury suffered by him
                    through the occurrence of the act or omission contemplated as possible. Ulpian
                    classifies them as cautionary <hi rend="italic"> (cauti anales),</hi> judicial,
                    and common. The first were purely precautionary, and quite independent of any
                    action already in dependence between the party moving the magistrate to exact
                    the stipulation and him on whom it was desired to impose it. There were many
                    varieties of them, connected with all branches of the law,— for example, the <hi
                    rend="italic">cautio damni infecti,</hi> security against damage to a man’s
                    property in consequence, say, of the ruinous condition of his neighbour’s house,
                    the <hi rend="italic">cautio usufructuaria</hi> that property usufructed should
                    revert unimpaired to the owner on the expiry of the usufructuary’s life
                    interest, the sedilian stipulation against faults in a thing sold, and so forth.
                    In all these cases the stipulation or <hi rend="italic">cautio</hi> was a
                    guarantee against future loss or injury, usually corroborated by sureties, and
                    made effectual by an action on the stipulation in the event of loss or injury
                    resulting. J udicial stipulations, according to Ulpian’s classification, were
                    those imposed by a judge in the course of and with reference to an action in
                    dependence before him, as, for example, the <hi rend="italic">cautio judicatum
                    solvi</hi> (that the defendant would satisfy the judgment), the <hi
                    rend="italic">cautio de dolo</hi> (that a thing claimed in the action would not
                    be fraudulently impaired in the meantime), and many others. Common were such as
                    might either be imposed by a magistrate apart from any depending action or by a
                    judge in the course of one, such as that taken from a guardian for the faithful
                    administration of his office, or from a procurator that his principal would
                    ratify what he did.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Missio in possessionem</hi> was the putting of a person in
                    possession <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n733/mode/1up"

                    <hi rend="italic">(missio in rem).</hi> The former was by far the more
                    important. It was resorted to as a means of execution not only against a
                    judgment-debtor but also against a man who fraudulently kept out of the way and
                    thus avoided summons in an action, or who, having been duly summoned, would not
                    do what was expected on the part of a defendant ', against the estate of a
                    person deceased to which no heir would enter, thus leaving creditors without a
                    debtor from whom they could enforce payment of their claims; and also against
                    the estate that had belonged to a person who had undergone <hi rend="italic"
                    >capitis deminutio,</hi> if the family head to whom he had subjected himself
                    refused to be responsible for his debts. <hi rend="italic">Missio in rem</hi>
                    was granted, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> where a man refused to give <hi
                    rend="italic">eautio damni infecti</hi>; the applicant was then put in
                    possession of the ruinous property for his own protection.</p>

                    the position he had occupied before some occurrence which had resulted to his
                    prejudice, was one of the most remarkable manifestations of the exercise of the
                    <hi rend="italic">imperium.</hi> It was not that the individual in question,
                    either directly by action or indirectly by exception, obtained a judgment that
                    either rendered what had happened comparatively harmless or gave him
                    compensation in damages for the loss he had sustained from it, but that the
                    magistrate—and it could only be the praetor, the urban or praetorian prefect, a
                    provincial governor, or the emperor himself—at his own hand pronounced a decree
                    that as far as possible restored the <hi rend="italic"> status quo ante.</hi> It
                    was not enough, however, to entitle a man to this extraordinary relief, that he
                    was able to show that he had been taken advantage of to his hurt, and that no
                    other adequate means of redress was open to him; he required in addition to be
                    able to found on some subjective ground of restitution, such as minority, or, if
                    he was of full age, intimidation which could not be resisted, mistake of fact,
                    fraud, absence, or the like. What should be held to amount to a sufficient
                    ground of restitution, either objective or subjective, was at first left very
                    much to the discretion of the magistrate; but even here practice and
                    jurisprudence in time fixed the lines within which he. ought to confine himself,
                    and made the principles of <hi rend="italic">in integrum restitutio</hi> as well
                    settled almost as those of the <hi rend="italic"> actio quod metus cattsa</hi>
                    or the <hi rend="italic">actio de dolo.</hi></p>
                <p>CHAPTER V.—THE PERIOD OF CODIFICATION.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">(Diocletian to Justinian.}</hi></p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Historical Events that influenced the Law.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Supremacy of the Emperors as Sole Legislators.—</hi> From the time
                    of Diocletian downwards the making of the law was exclusively in the hands of
                    the emperors. The senate still existed, but shorn of all its old functions alike
                    of government and legislation. The responses of patented jurists were a thing of
                    the past. It was to the imperial consistory alone that men looked for
                    interpretation of old law or promulgation of new.</p>
                <p>In the reign of Diocletian rescripts were still abundant; but the constitutions
                    in the Theodosian and Justinianian <hi rend="italic">Codes</hi> from the time of
                    Constantine downwards are mostly of a wider scope, and of the class known as
                    general or edictal laws <hi rend="italic">(leges generates edictales).</hi> It
                    would be wrong, however, to infer that rescripts had ceased; for Justinian’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Code</hi> contains various regulations as to their form, and the
                    matter is dealt with again in one of his <hi rend="italic">Novels.</hi> The
                    reason why so few are preserved is that they were no longer authoritative except
                    for the parties to whom they were addressed. This was expressly declared by the
                    emperors Arcadius and Honorius in 398 in reference to those in answer to
                    applications for advice from officials; and it is not unreasonable to assume
                    that a limitation of the same sort had been put at an earlier date on the
                    authority of those addressed to private parties. Puchta is of opinion that the
                    enactment of Honorius and Arcadius applied equally to <hi rend="italic">
                    decreta,</hi> for the reason that during this period matters of litigation did
                    not come under the cognizance of the emperors except on appeal, and that under
                    the new arrangements of Constantine the judgment of affirmance or reversal was
                    embodied in a rescript addressed to the magistrate from whom the appeal had been
                    taken. The rule of Arcadius and Honorius was renewed in 425 by Theodosius and
                    Valentinian, who qualified it, however, to this extent,— that, if it contained
                    any distinct indication that the doctrine it laid down was meant to be of
                    general application, then it was to be received as an edict or <hi rend="italic"
                    >lex generalis.</hi> To this Justinian adhered in so far as rescripts in the old
                    sense of the word were concerned; but he declared that his judgments <hi
                    rend="italic">(decreta)</hi> should be received everywhere as laws of general
                    application, and so should any interpretation given by him of a <hi
                    rend="italic">lex generalis,</hi> even though elicited by the petition of a
                    private party. The imperial edicts, adjusted in the consistory, were usually
                    addressed to the people, the senate, or some official, civil, military, or
                    ecclesiastical, according to the nature of their subject-matter.</p>

                    empire, but which in a previous section we have ascribed to the infiltration

                    would be a bold thing to say that, had Christianity never gained its
                    predominance, that spirit of natural right would not have continued to animate
                    the course of legislation, and to evoke, as years progressed, most of those
                    amendments in the law of the family and the law of succession that were amongst
                    the most valuable contributions of the imperial constitutions to the private
                    law. It may well be that that spirit was intensified and rendered more active
                    with the growth of Christian belief; but not until the latter had been publicly
                    sanctioned by Constantine, and by Theodosius declared to be the religion of the
                    state, do we meet with incontestable records of its influence. We find them in
                    enactments in favour of the church and its property, and of its privileges as a
                    legatee; in those conferring or imposing on the bishops a supervision of
                    charities and charitable institutions, and a power of interfering in matters of
                    guardianship; in the recognition of the efficacy of certain acts done in
                    presence of two or three of the clergy and thereafter recorded in the church
                    registers; in the disabilities as to marriage and succession with which heretics
                    and apostates were visited, and in a variety of minor matters. Of greater
                    importance were three features for which it was directly responsible,—the repeal
                    of the caduciary provisions of the Papia-Poppsean law, the penalties imposed
                    upon divorce, and the institution of the <hi rend="italic">episcopalis
                    audientia.</hi></p>
                <p>The purpose of the caduciary law was to discourage celibacy and encourage
                    fruitful marriages; but legislation in such a spirit could not possibly be
                    maintained when celibacy had come to be inculcated as a virtue, and as the
                    peculiar characteristic of a holy life. The penalties alike of <hi rend="italic"
                    > orbitas</hi> and <hi rend="italic">coelibatus</hi> were abolished by
                    Constantine in the year 320. The legislation about divorce, from the first of
                    Constantine’s enactments on the subject down to those of Justinian, forms a
                    miserable chapter in the history of the law. Not one of the emperors who busied
                    himself with the matter, undoing the work of his predecessors and substituting
                    legislation of his own quite as complicated and futile, thought of interfering
                    with the old principle that divorce ought to be as free as marriage and
                    independent of the sanction or decree of a judicial tribunal. Justinian was the
                    first who, by one of his <hi rend="italic">Novels,</hi> imposed a condition on
                    parties to a divorce of common accord <hi rend="italic">(communi consensu),</hi>
                    namely, that they should both enter a convent, otherwise it should be null; but,
                    so distasteful was this to popular feeling, and so little conducive to
                    improvement of the tone of morals within the conventual precincts, that it was
                    repealed by his successor. The legislation of Justinian’s predecessors and the
                    bulk of his own were levelled at one-sided repudiations, imposing penalties,
                    personal and patrimonial (1) upon the author of a repudiation on some ground the
                    law did not recognize as sufficient—and the lawful grounds varied from reign to
                    reign —and (2) upon the party whose misconduct gave rise to a repudiation that
                    was justifiable. The bishop’s court <hi rend="italic">(episcopate judicium,
                    episcopalis audientia)</hi> had its origin in the practice of the primitive
                    Christians, in accordance with the apostolic precept, of submitting their
                    differences to one or two of their brethren in the faith, usually a presbyter or
                    bishop, who acted as arbiter. On the establishment of Christianity the practice
                    obtained legislative sanction, Constantine giving the bishop’s court concurrent
                    jurisdiction with the ordinary civil courts where both parties preferred the
                    former, and by a later enactment going so far as to empower one of the parties
                    to a suit to remove it to the ecclesiastical tribunal against the will of the
                    other. For various reasons, advantage was taken of this power of resorting to
                    the bishop to an extent which seriously interfered with the proper discharge of
                    his spiritual functions, so that Honorius judged it expedient to revert to the
                    original rule, and, at least as regarded laymen, to limit the right of resort to
                    the episcopal judicatory to cases in which both parties consented. It is
                    impossible to say with any approach to exactitude what effect this intervention
                    of the clergy as judges in ordinary civil causes— for they had no criminal
                    jurisdiction—had on the development of the law. But it can hardly have been
                    without some influence in still further promoting the tendency to subordinate
                    act and word to will and <hi rend="italic">animus,</hi> to deal leniently with
                    technicalities, and to temper the rules of the <hi rend="italic">jus civile</hi>
                    with equity and considerations of natural right.</p>

                    rend="italic">1 —</hi> The formular system, with its remit from the praetor to a
                    sworn <hi rend="italic">judex</hi> who was to try the cause, was of infinite
                    advantage to the law; for the judgment was that of a free and independent
                    citizen, untrammelled by officialism, fresh from some centre of business, and in
                    full sympathy with the parties between whom he had to decide. Such a system was
                    incompatible with the political arrangements of Diocletian and Constantine; and
                    it is with no surprise that we find the former of these sovereigns instructing
                    the provincial governors that in future, unless when prevented by pressure of
                    business (or, according to a later constitution of Julian’s, when the matter was
                    of trifling importance), they were themselves to hear the causes brought before
                    them from first to last, as had previously been the practice in the <hi
                    rend="italic">extraordinariae cognitiones.</hi> The remit in such cases was not,
                    as formerly, to a private citizen, but to what was called a <hi rend="italic"
                    >judex pcdancus,</hi> probably a matriculated member of the local bar; and for a
                    time his delegated authority was embodied in a <hi rend="italic"> formula</hi>
                    after the old fashion. But even this exceptional use of it did not long survive,
                    for an enactment by the two sons of Constantine, conceived in terms the most
                    comprehensive, declared fixed styles to be but traps for the unwary, and forbade
                    their use in any legal act whatever, whether contentious or voluntary. The
                    result was, not only the formal disappearance of the distinction between the
                    proceedings <hi rend="italic">in jure</hi> and <hi rend="italic">in
                    judicio,</hi> but the practical disappearance also of the distinctions between
                    actions <hi rend="italic">in jus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">in factum,</hi> and
                    between <hi rend="italic">actiones directae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">actiones
                    utiles,</hi> the conversion of the interdict into an <hi rend="italic">actio ex
                    inter-dicto,</hi> admission of the power of amendment of the pleadings,
                    condemnation in the specific thing claimed, if in existence, instead of its
                    pecuniary equivalent, and execution accordingly by the aid of officers of the
                    law.</p>
                <p>Under the new system a process was full from first to last of intervention by
                    officials. The <hi rend="italic">in jus vocatio</hi> of the XII. Tables —the
                    procedure by which a plaintiff himself brought his adversary into court—was a
                    thing of the past. In the earlier part of the period the proceedings commenced
                    with the <hi rend="italic">litis denuntiatio</hi> introduced in the time of
                    Marcus Aurelius and remodelled by Constantine; but under Justinian (though
                    probably begun before his reign) the initial step was what was called the <hi
                    rend="italic"> libellus convenlionis.</hi> This wa3 a short and precise written
                    statement addressed by the plaintiff to the court, explaining (but without
                    detail) the nature of the action he proposed to raise and the claim he had to
                    prefer; this was accompanied with a formal undertaking to proceed with the cause
                    and follow it out to judgment, under penalty of having to pay double costs to
                    the defendant. If the judge was satisfied of the relevancy of the libel, he
                    pronounced an interlocutor <hi rend="italic">(inter-locutio)</hi> ordaining its
                    service on the respondent; this was done by an officer of the court, who cited
                    him to appear on a day named, usually at a distance of two or three months. The
                    defendant, through the officer, put in an answer <hi rend="italic"> (libellus
                    contradictionis),</hi> at the same time giving security for the proper
                    maintenance of the defence and eventual satisfaction of the judgment. On the day
                    appointed the parties were first heard on any dilatory pleas, such as defect of
                    jurisdiction; if none were offered, or those stated repelled, they then
                    proceeded to expound their respective grounds of action and defence, each
                    finally making oath of his good faith in the matter <hi rend="italic">
                    (juramentum calumniae),</hi> and their counsel doing the same.</p>
                <p>From this point, which marked the <hi rend="italic">litis contcstatio</hi> or
                    joinder of issue, the procedure was much the same as that <hi rend="italic">in
                    judicio</hi> under the formular system. But in all cases in which the demand was
                    that a particular thing should be given or restored, and the plaintiff desired
                    to have the thing itself rather than damages, execution was specific and
                    effected through officers of the law <hi rend="italic">(manic militari).</hi>
                    Where, on the other hand, the condemnation was pecuniary, the usual course was
                    for the judge, through his officers, to take possession of such things belonging
                    to the defendant as were thought sufficient to satisfy the judgment <hi
                    rend="italic">(pignus in causa judicati captum),</hi> and they were eventually
                    sold judicially if the defendant still refused to pay; the <hi rend="italic">
                    missio in bona</hi> of the classical period was rarely resorted to except in the
                    case of insolvency.</p>

                    rend="italic">2—</hi> This famous enactment, the production of Theodosius (II.),
                    tutor of the youthful Valentinian III., was issued from Ravenna in the year 426,
                    and was addressed to the Roman senate. It ran thus:—</p>
                <p>“We accord our approval to all the writings of Tapinian, Paul, Gaius, Ulpian, and
                    Modestine, conceding to Gaius the same authority that is enjoyed by Paul,
                    Ulpian, and the rest, and sanctioning the citation of all his works. We ratify
                    also the jurisprudence <hi rend="italic">(scicn-</hi><hi rend="italic">tia)</hi>
                    of those earlier writers whose treatises and statements of the law the aforesaid
                    five have imported into their own works,— Scaevola, for example, and Sabinus,
                    and Julian, and Marcellus,—and of all others whom they have been in the habit of
                    quoting as authorities <hi rend="italic">(omniumque quos illi eelebrarunt),</hi>
                    provided always, as their antiquity makes them uncertain, that the texts of
                    those earlier jurists are verified by collation of manuscripts. If divergent <hi
                    rend="italic">dicta</hi> be adduced, that party shall prevail who has the
                    greatest number of authorities on his side; if the number on each side be the
                    same, that one shall prevail which has the support of Papinian; but, whilst he,
                    most excellent of them all, is to be preferred to any other single authority, he
                    must yield to any two. [Paul’s and Ulpian’s notes on his writings, however, as
                    already enacted, are to be disregarded. ] Where opinions are equal, and none
                    entitled to preference, we leave it to the discretion of the judge which he
                    shall adopt.”</p>
                <p>This constitution has always been regarded as a signal proof of the lamentable
                    condition into which jurisprudence had sunk in the beginning of the 5th century.
                    Constantine, a hundred years earlier, had condemned the notes of Ulpian and Paul
                    upon Papinian. There were no longer any living jurists to lay down the law <hi
                    rend="italic"> (jura condere)</hi>; and, if it was to be gathered from the
                    writings of those who were dead, it was well that the use of them should be
                    regulated. The Valentiniauiau law proceeded so far in the same direction. It
                    made a selection of the jurisconsults of the past whose works alone were to be
                    allowed to be cited,—Papinian, Paul, Ulpian, and Modestine, the four latest
                    patented counsel of any distinction; Gaius, of authority previously only in the
                    schools, but whose writings were now approved universally, notwithstanding that
                    he had never possessed the <hi rend="italic">jus respondendi</hi>; and all the
                    earlier jurists to whom those five had accorded their imprimator. But it went
                    yet a step further, for it declared all of them, with the sole exception of
                    Papinian, to be of the same authority, and degraded the function of the judge in
                    most cases, so far at least as a question of law was concerned, to the purely
                    arithmetical task of counting up the names which the industry of the advocates
                    on either side had succeeded in adducing in support of their respective
                    contentions. It is probable that, from the days of Hadrian down to Alexander
                    Severus, when the emperor in his council had to frame a rescript or a decree,
                    its tenor would be decided by the vote of the majority; but that was after
                    argument and counter-argument, which must in many cases have modified first
                    impressions. Taking the votes of dead men, who had not heard each other’s
                    reasons for their opinions, was a very different process. It may have been
                    necessary; but it can have been so only because a living jurisprudence had no
                    existence,—because the constructive talent of the earlier empire had entirely
                    disappeared.</p>

                    earlier one. As the latest enactment in it belongs to the year 365, the
                    probability is that the collection was published about that time. Both <hi

                    Justinian in reference to them there is reason to believe that in the courts
                    they were regarded as authoritative, even to the ignoring of all rescripts not

                    commission to initiate the preparation of a body of law which, if his scheme had
                    been carried into execution, would have rendered that of Justinian unnecessary.
                    In a constitution some ten years later he explains the motives that had actuated
                    him,—that he saw with much concern the poverty-stricken condition of
                    jurisprudence and how very few men there were who, notwithstanding the prizes
                    that awaited them, were able to make themselves familiar with the whole range of
                    law; and that he attributed it very much to the multitude of books and the large
                    mass of statutes through which it was dispersed, and which it was next to
                    impossible for any ordinary mortal to master. His scheme was eventually to
                    compile one single code from materials derived alike from the writings of the
                    jurists, the Gregorian and Hermogenian collections of rescripts, and the edictal
                    laws from the time of Constantine downwards. His language leaves no doubt that
                    it was his intention to have this general code very carefully prepared, so as to
                    make it a complete exponent of the law in force, which should take the place of
                    everything, statutory or jurisprudential, of an earlier date. The collection of
                    edicts which he directed his commissioners to prepare, and which was to contain
                    all that had not been displaced by later legislation, even though some of them
                    might be obsolete by disuse, was to be <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0735-0712"/>the first step in the execution of his project.
                    For some reason or other nothing followed upon this enactment; and in 435 a new
                    and stronger commission was nominated to collect the edicts, but nothing was
                    said in then-instructions about anything ulterior. The work was completed in
                    three years, and published at Constantinople early in the year 438, with the
                    declaration that it should take effect from 1st January following; and a copy
                    was communicated to Valentinian, who ordained that it should come into force in
                    the West from 12th January 439. The arrangement is in sixteen books, subdivided
                    into titles, in which the constitutions are placed in chronological order. They
                    cover the whole field of law, private and public, civil and criminal, fiscal and
                    municipal, military and ecclesiastical. The private law is contained in the
                    first five, which unfortunately are very defective. The imperial edicts
                    subsequent to the publication of the <hi rend="italic">Code got</hi> the name of
                    <hi rend="italic"> Novels (novellae constitutiones).</hi><hi rend="italic">The
                    Collatio, the Vatican Fragments, and the Consultatio.—</hi> These were
                    unofficial collections. The first— <hi rend="italic">Collatio Legum Mosaica-rum
                    et Romanarum,</hi> otherwise <hi rend="italic">Lex Dei quam Dominus praecepit ad
                    Moysen—</hi> is a parallel of divine and human law, the former drawn from the
                    Pentateuch and the latter from the writings of Gaius, Papinian, Paul, Ulpian,
                    and Modestine, rescripts from the Gregorian and Hermogenian <hi rend="italic"
                    >Codes,</hi> and one or two later general enactments. Its date is probably about
                    the year 390, but its authorship is unknown. The <hi rend="italic">Vatican
                    Fragments</hi> were discovered by Mai in a palimpsest in the Vatican in
                    1820,—evidently part of a book of practice compiled in the Westem empire, and of
                    very considerable dimensions. The extant fragments deal with the law of sale,
                    usufruct, dowries, donations, tutories, and processual agency, and are drawn
                    from the writings of Papinian, Ulpian, and Paul, the two collections of
                    rescripts, and a few general enactments, the latest dating from the year 372.
                    The compilation, therefore, may be of about the same antiquity as the <hi
                    rend="italic">Collatio.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Consultatio (Veteris cujusdam
                    Jurisconsulti Consultatio')</hi> was first published by Cujas in 1577. It seems
                    to be part of a collection of answers upon questions of law submitted for the
                    opinion of counsel, and is of value, for the fragments it contains from Paul’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Sentences</hi> and the three <hi rend="italic">Codes.</hi> It
                    is thought to have been written in France in the end of the 5th or beginning of
                    the 6th century.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Romano-Barbarian Codes.—</hi> This title is usually applied
                    to three collections compiled in western Europe after it had thrown off the
                    sovereignty of Rome.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">The Edictum Theodorici</hi> was compiled at the instance of
                    Theodoric, king of the Ostrogoths, in or very soon after the year 500. Its
                    materials were drawn from the writings of the jurists— principally the <hi
                    rend="italic"> Sentences</hi> of Paul—the Gregorian, Hermogenian, and Theodosian
                    <hi rend="italic">Codes,</hi> and the later <hi rend="italic">Novels,</hi> all
                    reduced into 154 sections, with no systematic arrangement, but touching upon all
                    branches of the law public and private, especially criminal law and procedure.
                    It was professedly intended to apply to all Theodoric’s subjects, both Goths and
                    Romans.</p>
                <p>2. The <hi rend="italic">Lex Romana Visigothorum</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Breviarium Alaricianum</hi> was a much more ambitious and important collection.
                    It was compiled by a commission appointed by Alaric II., king of the Western
                    Goths, with approval of the bishops and nobles, and published at Aire in Gascony
                    in the year 506. The compilers selected their material partly from <hi
                    rend="italic"> leges</hi> (statute law) and partly from <hi rend="italic"
                    >jus</hi> (jurisprudential law), taking what they considered appropriate,
                    without altering the text except in the way of excision of passages that were
                    obsolete or purely historical. For the <hi rend="italic">leges</hi> they
                    utilized some 400 of the 3400 enactments (according to Haenel’s estimate) of the
                    Theodosian <hi rend="italic">Code,</hi> and about 30 of the known 104
                    post-Theodosian <hi rend="italic">Novels;</hi> for the <hi rend="italic"
                    >jus,—</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Institutes</hi> of Gaius, Paul’s <hi
                    rend="italic"> Sentences,</hi> the Gregorian and Hermogenian rescripts, and the
                    first book of Papinian’s <hi rend="italic">Responses</hi> (a single sentence).
                    All of these, except Gaius, were accompanied with an “interpretation,” which
                    resembles the <hi rend="italic">interpretatio</hi> of the XII. Tables in that it
                    is often not so much explanatory of the text as qualificative or corrective.
                    Gaius is contained in an epitome in two books, believed to have been only a
                    reproduction of an abridgment already current, and dating from about the
                    beginning of the 5th century. The <hi rend="italic">Breviary</hi> exercised very
                    considerable influence in Europe generally; and there is no question that, until
                    the rise of the Bologna school in the 12th century, it was from it, rather than
                    from the books of Justinian, that western Europe acquired its scanty knowledge
                    of Roman law’.</p>
                <p>3. The <hi rend="italic">Lex Romana Burgundionum,</hi> formerly, owing to a
                    mistake of a transcriber, called <hi rend="italic">Papianus,</hi> is the
                    collection which King Gundobald, wdien publishing his code of native law <hi
                    rend="italic"> (Lex Burgundionum</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Gundobada),</hi> had
                    promised should be prepared for the use of his Roman subjects. It deals with
                    private law, criminal law, and judicial procedure, distributed through 47
                    titles, and is arranged very much after the order of the <hi rend="italic">
                    Gundobada,</hi> from which it has a few extracts. Its statutory Roman sources
                    are the same as those of the <hi rend="italic">Breviary</hi>; the
                    jurisprudential authorities referred to are Gaius and Paul, the latter in his
                    <hi rend="italic">Sentences,</hi> and the former (only three times altogether)
                    in some other book than his <hi rend="italic">Institutes.</hi></p>

                    >Justinian’s Collections and his own Legislation.—</hi> It is unnecessary to
                    revert to the history of Justinian outside his legislative achievements, or even
                    to speak of his collections in detail, for both have already been described in
                    the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Justinian</hi> I. (vol. xiii. p. 792 <hi
                    rend="italic">sq.).</hi> Ambitious to carry out a reform more complete even than
                    that which Theodosius had planned but failed to execute, he took the first step
                    towards it little more than six months after the death of his uncle Justin, in
                    the appointment of a commission to prepare a collection of statute law <hi
                    rend="italic">(leges),</hi> among which he included the rescripts of the
                    Gregorian and Hermogenian <hi rend="italic">Codes.</hi> It was published in
                    April 529; and in rapid succession there followed his <hi rend="italic">Fifty
                    Decisions</hi> (529-532), his <hi rend="italic"> Institutes</hi> (21st November
                    533), his <hi rend="italic">Digest</hi> of excerpts from the writings of the
                    jurists (16th December</p>
                <p>533) , and the revised edition of his <hi rend="italic">Code,</hi> in which he
                    incorporated his own legislation down to date (16th November</p>
                <p>534) . From that time down to his death in 565 there followed a series of <hi
                    rend="italic"> Novels (novellae constitutiones),</hi> mostly in Greek, which
                    were never officially collected, and of which probably many have been lost.</p>
                <p>Taking his enactments in the <hi rend="italic">Code</hi> and his <hi
                    rend="italic"> Novels</hi> together we have of Justinian’s own legislation about
                    400 constitutions. Diocletian’s contributions to the <hi rend="italic">Code</hi>
                    are about three times as numerous; but most of them professed to be nothing more
                    than short declaratory statements of pre-existing law, whereas Justinian’s,
                    apart from his <hi rend="italic">Fifty Decisions,</hi> were all reformatory
                    enactments, many of them as long as an average Act of Parliament, and dealing
                    with diverse matters under the same rubric. They cover the whole field of law,
                    public and private, civil and criminal, secular and ecclesiastical. It cannot be
                    said that they afford pleasant reading: they are so disfigured by redundancy of
                    language, involved periods, and nauseous self-glorification. But it cannot be
                    denied that many of those which deal with the private law embody reforms of the
                    highest importance and of most salutary tendency. He sometimes loved to pose as
                    the champion of the simplicity and evenhandedness of the early law, at others to
                    denounce it for its subtleties; sometimes he allowed himself to be influenced by
                    his own extreme asceticism, and now and again we detect traces of subservience
                    to the imperious will of his consort; but in the main his legislation was
                    dictated by what he was pleased to call <hi rend="italic">humanitas</hi> so far
                    as the law of persons was concerned, and by <hi rend="italic">naturalis
                    ratio</hi> and public utility so far as concerned that of things. The result was
                    the eradication of almost every trace of the old <hi rend="italic">jus
                    Quiritium,</hi> and the substitution for it, under the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >jus Romanum,</hi> of that cosmopolitan body of law which has contributed so
                    largely to almost every modern system.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Amendments on the Law of the Family.—</hi> With the Christian
                    emperors the last traces disappeared of the old conception of the <hi
                    rend="italic"> familia</hi> as an aggregate of persons and estate subject
                    absolutely to the power and dominion of its head. <hi rend="italic">Manus,</hi>
                    the power in a husband over his wife and her belongings, was a thing of the
                    past; both stood now on a footing of equality before the law; perhaps it might
                    be more accurate to say, at least with reference to the Justinianian
                    legislation, that the wife was the more privileged of the two in respect both of
                    the protection and the indulgence the law accorded her. With <hi rend="italic"
                    >manus</hi> the old confarreation and coemption had ceased, marriage needing
                    nothing more than simple interchange of consent, except as between persons of
                    rank or when the intention was to legitimate previous issue; in the latter case
                    a written marriage settlement was required, and in the former either such a
                    settlement or a marriage in church before the bishop and at least three clerical
                    witnesses, who granted and signed a certificate of the completed union. The
                    legislation of the Christian emperors on the subject of divorce, largely
                    contributed to by Justinian in his <hi rend="italic">Novels,</hi> has already
                    been referred to. In regard to dowries many new provisions were introduced,
                    principally for curtailing the husband’s power of dealing with the dowry while
                    the marriage lasted, enlarging the right of the wife and her heirs in respect of
                    it, and simplifying <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0736-0713"/>the means of recovering it from the husband or his
                    heirs when the marriage was dissolved. Between the time of Constantine and that
                    of Theodosius and Valentinian it had become the practice for a man to make a
                    settlement on his intended wife of a provision which was to remain his property
                    (but without the power of alienation) during the marriage, but to pass to her on
                    his predecease; it got the name of <hi rend="italic">donatio ante nuptias</hi>
                    or sometimes, as being a sort of return for the <hi rend="italic">dos,
                    antiphema.</hi> The earliest legislation about it was by the last - mentioned
                    emperors; Zeno and Justin followed suit; and Justinian, in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Code</hi> and <hi rend="italic"> Novels,</hi> published five or six enactments
                    for its regulation. The general result was that, wherever a <hi rend="italic"
                    >dos</hi> was given or promised on the part of the wife, there a <hi
                    rend="italic">donatio</hi> was to be constituted on the part of the husband;
                    that, if one was increased during the marriage, a corresponding increase was to
                    be made to the other; that it might be constituted after the marriage without
                    infringing the rule prohibiting donations between husband and wife, which caused
                    Justinian to change its name to <hi rend="italic">donatio propter nuptias</hi>;
                    that the wife might demand its transfer to her (as she could that of the <hi
                    rend="italic"> dos)</hi> on her husband’s insolvency, but under obligation to
                    apply its income to the maintenance of the family; and that on the dissolution
                    of the marriage by her husband’s death or by a divorce for which he was in fault
                    she had ample remedies for reducing it into possession.</p>
                <p>The change in the complexion of the relations between husband and wife under the
                    Christian emperors, however, was insignificant when compared with that which had
                    overtaken the relation between parent and child. Justinian in his <hi
                    rend="italic"> Institutes</hi> reproduces the boast of Gaius that nowhere else
                    had a father such power over his children as was exercised by a Roman <hi
                    rend="italic"> paterfamilias.</hi> True it is that the <hi rend="italic">patria
                    potestas</hi> in name still held a prominent place in the Justinianian
                    collections; but it had been shorn of most of the prerogatives that had
                    characterized it in the republic. To expose a new-born child was forbidden under
                    penalties. To take the life of a grownup one—unless it was a daughter slain with
                    her paramour in the act of adultery—was murder; for the domestic tribunal, with
                    the judicial power of life and death in the <hi rend="italic">paterfamilias</hi>
                    as its head, had long disappeared. For the same reason a parent could no longer
                    sell his child as a slave, at least he could do so only when the child was an
                    infant and he in such extreme poverty as to be unable to support it. Even the
                    right to make a noxal surrender of his son to a party who had suffered from the
                    latter’s delict had silently become obsolete; so greatly had altered sentiment,
                    in sympathy with legislation, curtailed the power of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >paterfamilias</hi> over those in his <hi rend="italic">potestas.</hi> All that
                    remained of it in the latest Justinianian law was no more than is sanctioned in
                    most modern systems as natural emanations of the paternal relationship,—the
                    rights of moderate chastisement for offence, of testamentary nomination of
                    guardians, of pupilary substitution (enlarged by Justinian), and of withholding
                    consent from the marriage of a child, but subject to magisterial intervention if
                    used unreasonably.</p>
                <p>How the right of the <hi rend="italic">paterfamilias</hi> over the earnings and
                    acquisitions of his children was modified by the recognition of <hi
                    rend="italic"> the, peculium castrense</hi> has been shown in a previous page
                    (p. 706). But the modification was carried to such an extent by the Christian
                    emperors as finally to negative the father’s ownership altogether, except as
                    regarded acquisitions that were the outcome of funds advanced by him to his
                    child for his separate use <hi rend="italic">(peculium profecticium).</hi> Of
                    some of the child’s acquisitions his father had, down to the time of Justinian,
                    the life interest and right of administration; but by his legislation even these
                    might be excluded at the pleasure of the parties from whom the acquisitions had
                    been derived. By the classical law the father’s radical right in his son’s <hi
                    rend="italic">peculium castrense</hi> revived on the latter’s death; for if he
                    died intestate the former appropriated it not as his son’s heir, but as an owner
                    whose powers as such had been merely temporarily suspended. But by one of the
                    chapters in the famous <hi rend="italic"> Novel</hi> on the law of intestate
                    succession even this prerogative of the <hi rend="italic">paterfamilias</hi> was
                    abolished, and all a child’s belongings except his <hi rend="italic">peculium
                    profecticium</hi> were recognized as his own in death as well as in life, so
                    that if any of them should pass to his parent on his intestacy it should only be
                    by title of inheritance and in the absence of descendants.</p>
                <p>In every other branch of the law of the family the same reforming spirit was
                    manifested. Adoption was no longer followed in all cases by a change of family
                    for the adoptee, but only when the adopter was in fact one of his parents, such
                    as a paternal or maternal grandfather,—when there was a natural <hi
                    rend="italic"> potestas</hi> to underlie and justify the civil one. The modes of
                    legitimation of children born out of wedlock, especially that by subsequent
                    marriage of the parents, first introduced by Constantine, were regulated, and
                    the extent of the rights of the legitimated issue carefully defined.
                    Emancipation was simplified, and the old procedure by sales and manumissions,
                    which degraded the child too much to the level of a slave, dispensed with.
                    Tutory at law was opened to the pupil’s nearest kinsman, whether on the father’s
                    side or the mother’s; and the mother herself, or the child’s grandmother, might
                    be allowed, under certain conditions, to act as its guardian. Slavery was often
                    converted into the milder condition of colonate; but, even where this did not
                    happen, the rights of owners were not allowed to be abused; for slaves were
                    permitted to claim the protection of the magistrate, and cruelty by a master
                    might result in his being deprived of his human property. Kinship that had
                    arisen between two persons when one or both were slaves <hi rend="italic">
                    (servilis cognatio)</hi> was recognized as creative not only of disabilities but
                    of rights. The modes of manumission were multiplied, and the restrictions of the
                    legislation of the early empire abolished; and a freedman invariably became a
                    citizen, Junian Latinity and dediticiancy being no longer recognized.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Amendments on the Law of Property and Obligation.—</hi> In the
                    law of property the principal changes of the Christian empire were the
                    simplification of the forms of conveyance, the extension of the colonate, the
                    introduction and regulation of emphyteusis, and the remodelling of the law of
                    prescription. Simplification of the forms of conveyance was necessary only in
                    the case of <hi rend="italic">res mancipi,</hi> for <hi rend="italic">res nec
                    mancipi</hi> had always passed by delivery. From the Theodosian <hi
                    rend="italic"> Code</hi> it is apparent that movable <hi rend="italic">res
                    mancipi</hi> usually passed in the same way from very early in the period, and
                    that for the mancipation of lands and houses (for <hi rend="italic">in jure
                    cessio</hi> had disappeared with the formular system) a <hi rend="italic"
                    >solemnis traditio,</hi> a written instrument and delivery following thereon,
                    and both before witnesses, was gradually substituted. Of this there is no trace
                    in the Justinianian <hi rend="italic">Code.</hi> For Justinian abolished all
                    remains of the distinction between <hi rend="italic">res mancipi</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">res nec mancipi,</hi> between full ownership, bonitarian
                    ownership, and <hi rend="italic">nudum jus Quiritium,</hi> placing movables and
                    immovables on a footing of perfect equality so far as their direct conveyance
                    was concerned. But, as regarded the possession required of an alienee to cure
                    any defect in the conveyance, he made a marked difference between them. For,
                    amalgamating the old positive usucapion of the <hi rend="italic">jus civile</hi>
                    with .the negative “prolonged possession” <hi rend="italic">(longi temporis
                    posscssio)</hi> that had been introduced in the provinces (probably by the
                    provincial edict), he declared that possession on a sufficient title and in good
                    faith should in future make the possessor legal owner of the thing possessed by
                    him, provided that the possession of himself and his author had endured
                    uninterruptedly for three years in the case of a movable, and in the case of an
                    immovable for ten years if the party against whom he possessed was resident in
                    the same province, or for twenty if he resided in another one.</p>
                <p>The same causes that led to the colonate induced the introduction of emphyteusis

                    existed in some of the Eastern provinces when independent, and which came to be
                    utilized first by the emperors, then by the church, and afterwards by
                    municipalities and private landowners, for bringing into cultivation the large
                    tracts of provincial land belonging to them which were unproductive and
                    unprofitable through want of supervision on the spot. Its nature and conditions
                    were carefully defined by Zeno and amended by Justinian. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >emphyteuta,</hi> as the grantee of the right was called, did not become owner;
                    the granter still remained <hi rend="italic">dominus,</hi> all that the grantee
                    enjoyed being <hi rend="italic">&amp;jus in re aliena,</hi> but <hi
                    rend="italic">de facto</hi> so extensive as hardly to be distinguishable from
                    ownership. It conferred upon him and his heirs a perpetual right in the lands
                    included in the grant, in consideration of a fixed annual payment to the lord
                    <hi rend="italic">(canon)</hi> and due observance of conventional and statutory
                    conditions; but he was not entitled to abandon it, nor able to free himself of
                    the obligations he had undertaken, without the lord’s consent. The latter was
                    entitled to hold the grant forfeited if the <hi rend="italic"> canon</hi> fell
                    into arrear for three years (in church lands for two), or if the land-tax was in
                    arrear for the same period, or if the <hi rend="italic"> emphyteuta</hi> allowed
                    the lands to deteriorate, or if he attempted to alienate them <hi rend="italic"
                    >(alienare meliorationes,</hi> as the text says) without observance of statutory
                    requirements. These were that he should intimate an intended alienation and the
                    name of the intended alienee to the lord, so that the latter, before giving his
                    assent, might satisfy himself that he would not be a loser by the transaction;
                    and, if the alienation was to be by sale, he had to state the price fixed, so as
                    to give the lord the opportunity of exercising his statutory right of
                    pre-emption at the same figure. If those requirements were complied with, and
                    the lord had no reasonable objection to the proposed alienee, he was not
                    entitled to resist the alienation, provided a payment <hi rend="italic"
                    >(laudemium)</hi> was made to him of two per cent, of the sale-price in
                    consideration of his enforced consent.</p>
                <p>The changes in the law of obligation were more superficial than those in the law
                    of property, and consisted principally in the simplification of formalities and
                    in some cases in their entire abolition. To describe them, however, would cany
                    us into details which would here be out of place.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Amendments on the Law of Succession.—</hi> The changes made in
                    the law of succession by Justinian’s Christian predecessors, especially
                    Theodosius II. and Anastasius, were far from insignificant; but his own were in
                    some directions positively revolutionary. The testament <hi rend="italic">per
                    aes et libram</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">jus civile</hi> probably never
                    obtained any firm footing in the East; for it was only by Caracalla’s con<pb

                    subjects that provincials generally acquired <hi rend="italic">tcstamenti
                    factio</hi>; and by that time a testament bearing externally the requisite
                    number of seals had been recognized as sufficient for a grant of <hi
                    rend="italic">bonorum possessio,</hi> unchallengeable by the heirs-at-law, even
                    though they were able to prove that neither <hi rend="italic">familiae
                    mancipatio</hi> nor <hi rend="italic">tcstamenti nuncupatio</hi> had intervened.
                    Hence the universal adoption of what Justinian calls the preetorian testament,
                    which, however, underwent considerable reform at the hands of the emperors,
                    notably in the requirement (in the ordinary case) of signature by the testator
                    and subscription by the witnesses. There was much hesitating legislation on the
                    subject before the law was finally established as it stands in the Justinianian
                    books; and even at the last we find it encumbered with many exceptions and
                    reservations in favour of testaments that were merely deeds of division by a
                    parent among his children, testaments made in time of plague, testaments
                    recorded in books of court, testaments entrusted to the safe-keeping of the
                    emperor, and so forth. Codicils had become deeds of such importance as, in the
                    absence of a testament, to be dealt with as imposing a trust on the heir-at-law;
                    it was therefore thought expedient to deny effect to them unless attested by at
                    least five witnesses. And a most important step in advance was taken by
                    Justinian in the recognition of the validity of an oral <hi rend="italic">mortis
                    causa</hi> trust; for he declared that, if it should be represented to a
                    competent judge that a person on his deathbed had by word of mouth directed his
                    heir-at-law to give something to the complainant, the heir should be required
                    either on his oath to deny the averment or to give or pay what was claimed.</p>
                <p>In the matter of intestacy there was long a halting between two opinions,—a
                    desire still further to amend the law in the direction taken by the prsetors and
                    by the legislature in the Tertullian and Orphitian senatusconsults, and yet a
                    hesitancy about breaking altogether from the time-hallowed principle of
                    agnation. Justinian in his <hi rend="italic">Code</hi> went far beyond his
                    predecessors, making a mother’s right of succession independent altogether of
                    the <hi rend="italic">jus liberorum;</hi> extending that of a daughter or sister
                    to her descendants, without any deduction in favour of agnates thus excluded;
                    admitting emancipated collaterals and their descendants as freely as if there
                    had been no <hi rend="italic">capitis deminutio minima</hi>; applying to agnates
                    the same <hi rend="italic">successio graduum</hi> that the prsetors had allowed
                    to cognates, and so forth. But it was by his <hi rend="italic"> Novels,</hi>
                    especially the 118th and 127th, that he revolutionized the system, by
                    eradicating agnation altogether and settling the canons of descent—which were
                    the same for real and personal estate—solely on the basis of blood kinship,
                    whether through males or females, and whether crossed or not by a <hi
                    rend="italic">capitis deminutio.</hi> First came descendants of the intestate,
                    male and female alike, taking <hi rend="italic">per capita</hi> if all were of
                    the same degree, <hi rend="italic">per stirpes</hi> if of different degrees.
                    Failing descendants, the succession passed to the nearest ascendants, and,
                    concurrently with them, to brothers and sisters of full blood and (by <hi
                    rend="italic">Nov.</hi> 127) the children of any that had predeceased. Where
                    there were ascendants alone, one-half of the succession went to the paternal
                    line and one-half to the maternal; where there were ascendants and brothers and
                    sisters, or only brothers and sisters, the division was made equally <hi
                    rend="italic">per capita</hi>; when children of a deceased brother or sister
                    participated it was <hi rend="italic">per stirpes.</hi> In the third class came
                    brothers and sisters of half-blood or by adoption and their children; the
                    division here was on the same principle as in the second class. The fourth class
                    included all other collaterals according to propinquity, and without distinction
                    between full and half blood; the primary division was <hi rend="italic"> per
                    stirpes,</hi> but all of the same degree took <hi rend="italic"> per
                    capita.</hi></p>
                <p>A reform effected by Justinian by his 115th <hi rend="italic">Novel</hi> ought
                    not to pass unnoticed; for it rendered superfluous all the old rules about
                    disherison and praeterition of a testator’s children, practically abolished <hi
                    rend="italic"> bonorum possessio contra tabulas,</hi> and established the
                    principle that a child had, as a general rule, an inherent and indefeasible
                    right to be one of his father’s heirs in a certain share at all events of his
                    succession, and that a parent had the same right in the succession of his child
                    if the latter had died without issue. The enactment enumerated certain grounds
                    upon which alone it should be lawful for a parent to disinherit his child or a
                    child his parent, declaring that in eveiy case of disherison the reason of it
                    should be stated in the testament, but giving leave to the person disinherited
                    to dispute and disprove the facts when the testament was opened. If a child who
                    had not been disinherited—and one improperly disinherited was eventually in the
                    same position—was not instituted to at least his “legitim” <hi rend="italic"
                    >{legitima</hi> or <hi rend="italic">debita portio),</hi> he was entitled to
                    have the testament declared null in so far as the institutions in it were
                    concerned, thus opening the succession to himself and the other heirs-at-law,
                    but without affecting the minor provisions, such as bequests, nominations of
                    tutors, &amp;c. The legitim, which under the practice of the centumviral court
                    had been one-fourth of the share to which the child would have been entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">ab intestato,</hi> was raised by Justinian to one-third at least,
                    and one-half where there were five or more entitled to participate. He did not
                    allow challenge of the will to be excluded, as in the earlier <hi rend="italic"
                    >querela inofficiosi tcstamenti,</hi> because the testator had made advances to
                    his child during his life or left him a legacy which quantitatively equalled the
                    legitim; his idea was that a child was entitled to recognition by his parent <hi
                    rend="italic">as one of his heirs,</hi> and that to deny him that position was
                    to put upon him an indignity which the law would not permit.</p>
                <p>Amongst the other beneficial changes effected by Justinian may be mentioned the
                    assimilation so far as possible of <hi rend="italic">hcreditas</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic"> bonorum possessio,</hi> so that the latter might be taken like
                    the former without formal petition for a grant of it; the equiparation of
                    legacies and singular trust-gifts, and the application of some of their rules to
                    <hi rend="italic">mortis causa</hi> donations; the extension of the rule of
                    “transmission” to every heir without exception, so that, if he died within the
                    time allowed him for considering whether or not he would accept <hi
                    rend="italic"> {tempos deliberandi),</hi> his power of acceptance or declinature
                    passed to <hi rend="italic">his</hi> heirs, to be exercised by them within what
                    remained of the period; the introduction of entry under inventory <hi
                    rend="italic">{cum beneficio inventarii),</hi> which limited the heir’s
                    responsibilities and rendered unnecessary the nine or twelve months of
                    deliberation; and the application of the principle of collation to descendants
                    generally, so that they were bound to throw into the mass of the succession
                    before its partition every advance they had received from their parent in
                    anticipation of their shares.</p>
                <p>IV. The Justinianian Law-Books.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Their Use in the Courts and in the Schools.—</hi> Although the
                    <hi rend="italic">Institutes</hi> were primarily intended to serve as a
                    text-book in the schools, it was expressly declared that they and the <hi
                    rend="italic"> Digest</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Code</hi> should be
                    regarded as just so many parts of one great piece of legislation and all of
                    equal authority, and that, although <hi rend="italic">Digest</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic"> Code</hi> were but collections of legislation and doctrine that
                    had proceeded originally from many different hands, yet they were to be treated
                    with the same respect as if they had been the work of Justinian himself. But,
                    while everything within them was to be held as law, nothing outside them was to
                    be looked at, not even the volumes from which they had been collected; and so
                    far did this go that, after the publication of the revised <hi rend="italic">
                    Code,</hi> neither the first edition of it nor the <hi rend="italic"> Fifty
                    Decisions</hi> were allowed to be referred to. If a case arose for which no
                    precedent was to be found, the emperor was to be resorted to for its decision,
                    as being outside his collections the only fountain of the law. To preserve the
                    purity of the texts Justinian forbade the use of conventional abbreviations <hi
                    rend="italic">{sigla)</hi> in making transcripts, visiting an offender with the
                    penalties of falsification <hi rend="italic"> {crimen falsi).</hi> Literal
                    translations into Greek were authorized, and indeed were very necessary for many
                    of his subjects; so were 7rapaTtrXa or summaries of the contents of individual
                    titles (although the jurists read the word less strictly). Commentaries and
                    general summaries were forbidden under heavy penalties, as an interference with
                    the imperial prerogative of interpretation; but the prohibition does not seem to
                    have been enforced, as we have accounts and remains not only of translations but
                    of commentaries, notes, abridgments, excerpts, and general summaries even in
                    Justinian’s lifetime. These, it is true, were mostly by professors <hi
                    rend="italic"> {antecessores),</hi> and their productions may have been intended
                    primarily for educational purposes; but there can be little doubt that they soon
                    passed into the hands of the practitioners and were used without scruple in the
                    courts. A Greek <hi rend="italic">Paraphrase of the Institutes,</hi> usually
                    attributed to Theophilus, a professor in Constantinople and one of Justinian’s
                    commissioners, is commonly supposed to have been used by him in his prelections.
                    It embodies much more historical matter than is to be found in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Institutes</hi>; but its value has been very differently rated by
                    different critics. Its latest editor, Ferrini, who puts a high estimate on it,
                    is of opinion that the original of it was a paraphrase of Gaius, which was
                    remodelled after the plan of Justinian’s <hi rend="italic">Institutes,</hi> and
                    had their new matter incorporated in order to adapt it to the altered
                    conditions; but he doubts if there be any sufficient authority for ascribing it
                    to Theophilus. If he be right in assuming that it was really a redaction of
                    Gaius, the historical explanations will bejeceived with all the more
                    confidence.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Fate of the Justinianian Books in the East.—</hi> The literary
                    work indicated in the preceding section was continued throughout the 6th
                    century. But the next three were comparatively barren, the only thing worth
                    noting being the ’EKÁ0777 <hi rend="italic">vbyuv év crvvT¿fj.ifi yevopévy</hi>
                    of Leo the Isaurian in 740, professedly an abstract of the whole Justinianian
                    law amended and rearranged; but it was repealed by Basil the Macedonian on
                    account of its imperfections and its audacious departure from the law it
                    pretended to summarize. The last-named emperor, with his son Leo the
                    Philosopher, set themselves in the end of the 9th and beginning ©f the 10th
                    centuries to the production of an authoritative Greek version of the whole of
                    the Justinianian collections and legislation, omitting what had become obsolete,
                    excising redundancies, and introducing such of the post-Justinianian legislation
                    as merited preservation. The result was the <hi rend="italic">Basilica</hi> (Tá
                    BcnrtXtKá, <hi rend="italic">i.e., vb/uapa),</hi> which was completed in the
                    reign of Leo, though probably issued in a preparatory stage in the reign of
                    Basil, who also published a sort of institutional work, the Ilpó^eípor, which
                    was revised and republished by Leo under <pb break="no"

                    The <hi rend="italic">Basilica</hi> consists of sixty books, subdivided into
                    titles, following generally the plan of the Justinianian <hi rend="italic"
                    >Code,</hi> but with the whole law on any particular subject arranged

                    rend="italic">Novels</hi> (see Basilica, vol. iii. p. 419). Leo’s son,
                    Constantinus Porphyro-genitus, made an addition to it in the shape of an
                    official commentary collected from the writings of the 6th-century jurists, the
                    so-called <hi rend="italic">lAapdypafpai</hi><hi rend="italic">iraXaiuv,</hi>
                    which is now spoken of as the <hi rend="italic"> scholia</hi> to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Basilica,</hi> and has done good exegetical service for modern
                    civilians. The <hi rend="italic">Basilica</hi> retained its statutory authority
                    until the fall of the Byzantine empire in 1453. But long before that it had
                    practically been abandoned; and not a single complete copy of it exists. Its
                    place was taken by epitomes and compendia, the last being the E$d/3t/3\os of
                    Constantinus Harmenopulus of 1345, “a miserable epitome of the epitomes of
                    epitomes,” as Bruns calls it, which survived the vicissitudes of the centuries,
                    and finally received statutory authority in the modern kingdom of Greece in the
                    year 1835, in place of the <hi rend="italic"> Basilica,</hi> which had been
                    sanctioned thirteen years before, in 1822.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Their Fate in the West. —</hi> Before the rise of the Bologna
                    school it was to a much greater extent from the Romano-barbarian codes than from
                    the books of Justinian that central and western Europe derived their
                    acquaintance with Roman law. Theodoric’s <hi rend="italic">Edict</hi> can have
                    had little influence after Justinian’s recovery of Italy, and the
                    Romano-Burgundian law was no doubt gradually displaced by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Breviary {Lex Rom. Fisigothorum}</hi> after Burgundy had fallen into the hands
                    of the Franks; but the <hi rend="italic">Breviary</hi> itself found its way in
                    all directions in France and Germany, penetrating even into England, to a great
                    extent through the agency of the church. There must, however, have been other
                    repertories of Roman law in circulation, as witness a testament made in Paris in
                    the end of the 7th century, preserved by Mabillon, in which the testator uses
                    the old formula of theyiis <hi rend="italic">civile,—</hi> “ita do, ita lego,
                    ita testor, ita vos Quirites testimonium mihi perhibetote,”—words that are not
                    to be found either in the Visigothic or the Justinianian collections.</p>
                <p>In his pragmatic sanction of the year 554 Justinian anew accorded his imperial
                    sanction to the <hi rend="italic">jura</hi> and <hi rend="italic">leges,
                    i.e.,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Digest</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Code,</hi>
                    which he says he had long before transmitted to Italy, at the same time
                    declaring that his <hi rend="italic">Novels</hi> were to be of the same
                    authority there as in the East. Two years after this came Julian’s Latin epitome
                    of them, not improbably prepared by command of the emperor himself. That they
                    all came at once to some extent into use is beyond question; for there is
                    preserved in Marini’s collection the testament of one Mannanes, executed at
                    Ravenna in the reign of Justinian’s immediate successor Justin II., in which the
                    requirements of both <hi rend="italic">Code</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Novels</hi> are scrupulously observed. Of other monuments of the same period
                    that prove the currency of the Justinianian law in Italy several are referred to
                    by Savigny in the second volume of his <hi rend="italic">History of the Roman
                    Law in the Middle Ages,</hi> among which may be mentioned the Turin gloss of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Institutes,</hi> which Fitting ascribes to about the year 545,
                    and two little pieces known as the <hi rend="italic">Dictatum de
                    consiliariis</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Collectio de tutoribus,</hi> which
                    form an appendix to some manuscripts of Julian’s epitome of the <hi
                    rend="italic"> Novels,</hi> and may possibly have been from his pen. The
                    invasion of the Lombards, the disturbance they caused in Italy for two
                    centuries, and the barrier they formed between it and the rest of Europe
                    militated against the spread of the Justinianian law northwards; but it was
                    taught without much interruption in Ravenna, the seat of the exarchs; to which
                    (but this is doubtful) the school <hi rend="italic">{studium}</hi> of Rome,
                    revived by Justinian, is said to have been transferred. By the Lombards, as
                    their savagery toned down, the Roman law was so far recognized that they allowed
                    it to be applied to the Romans living within their territory; and it is said to
                    have even been taught in Pavia, which they had established as their capital.
                    Their overthrow by Charlemagne opened an outlet for it beyond Italy; and in the
                    9th century there is evidence that the Justinianian books or some of them were
                    already circulating in the hands of the clergy in various parts of Europe. Yet
                    there are very few remains of any literature indicating much acquaintance with
                    them. Almost the only pieces worth mentioning are the so-called <hi
                    rend="italic"> Summa Perusina,</hi> an abridgment of the first eight books of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Code,</hi> ascribed to the 9th century; the <hi
                    rend="italic"> Quaestiones ac monita,</hi> to the Lombardic laws, drawn mostly
                    from the <hi rend="italic">Institutes,</hi> but with a few texts from the <hi
                    rend="italic">Digest,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Code,</hi> and Julian’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Epitome,</hi> and supposed to have been written early in the 11th
                    century; the <hi rend="italic">Brachylogus,</hi> an abbreviated revision of
                    Justinian’s <hi rend="italic">Institutes,</hi> with references to his other
                    books, which is thought to have been written in France (Orleans?), according to
                    Fitting between 999 and 1002, but according to other authorities nearer the end
                    of the 11th century; and the <hi rend="italic">Petri exceptiones legum
                    Romanarum,</hi> a systematic exposition of the law in four books, written in-the
                    south of France early in the latter half of the 11th century, and mostly
                    compiled from Justinianian sources.</p>
                <p>It was in the very end of the 11th century or the beginning of the 12th that at
                    Bologna, and under one Irnerius, who appears not to have been a professional
                    jurist but originally a teacher of letters, the study of Roman law began
                    somewhat suddenly to attract students from all parts of the world. Through the
                    action of the clergy the only parts of the Justinianian legislation that had
                    hitherto been in ordinary use were the <hi rend="italic">Institutes,</hi> the
                    <hi rend="italic">Code,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Novels.</hi> The first,
                    from its elementary character, had naturally commended itself; the <hi
                    rend="italic"> Code,</hi> with its opening title on the Trinity and its second
                    on Holy Church, and the <hi rend="italic">Novels,</hi> with their abundant
                    legislation on matters ecclesiastical, were in many respects charters of the
                    church’s privileges, and were prized accordingly; but the <hi rend="italic">
                    Digest,</hi> as being the work of pagan jurists, had been practically ignored.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Code</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"> Novels,</hi> however,
                    with their modicum of wheat concealed in such a quantity of chaff, offered
                    little attraction to laymen of intelligence; and, when a copy of a portion of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Digest,</hi> with its infinitely purer diction and its
                    clear and incisive reasoning, came into the hands of Irnerius, it must have been
                    for him as a new revelation. The text of it seems to have reached him by
                    instalments; at least this is the only reasonable explanation of its division by
                    the glossarists (as Irnerius and his successors of the Bologna school were
                    called, the name being derived from the <hi rend="italic"> glossae,</hi> notes
                    marginal and interlinear, with which they furnished it) into three parts, <hi
                    rend="italic">Digestum Fetus</hi> (books 1 to 24, tit. 2), <hi rend="italic"
                    >Infortiatum,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"> Digestum Novum</hi> (book 39 to the
                    end), the general idea being that, after first the old and then the new <hi
                    rend="italic">Digest</hi> had come to light, the connecting link unexpectedly
                    turned up, and got in consequence the somewhat singular name by which it
                    continued to be known for centuries. The whole collection was by the glossarists
                    distributed in five volumes, the fourth containing the first nine books of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Code,</hi> and the fifth, called <hi rend="italic">Folumen
                    parvum legum,</hi> containing the <hi rend="italic">Institutes,</hi> a Latin
                    translation of 134 of the <hi rend="italic">Novels</hi> known as the <hi
                    rend="italic">Authenticum,</hi> and the last three books of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Code</hi> which had been recovered subsequently to the others.
                    With these five volumes, the teaching that accompanied them, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">glossae, summae, casus, brocarda,</hi> &amp;c., with which they
                    were enriched from the rise of the school with Irnerius till its close with
                    Franciscus Accursius in 1260, Roman jurisprudence began a new career, which it
                    would carry us beyond the limits of this article to attempt to trace even in
