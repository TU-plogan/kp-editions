                <p><label type="entry">ROLLS</label> Master of the, is the third member of the
                    Supreme Court of Judicature in England, the lord chancellor, president of the
                    Chancery Division, being the first and the lord chief justice, president of the
                    Queen’s Bench Division, being the second. At first he was the principal clerk of
                    the Chancery and as such had charge of the records of the court, especially of
                    the register of original writs and of all patents and grants under the great
                    seal. Until the end of the 15th century he was called either the clerk or the
                    keeper of the rolls, and he is still formally designated as the master or keeper
                    of the rolls. The earliest mention of him as master of the rolls is in 11 Hen.
                    VII. c. 18; and in 11 Hen. VII. c. 24 he is again described as clerk of the
                    rolls, showing that his official designation still remained unsettled. About the
                    same period, however, the chief clerks of the Chancery came to be called masters
                    in Chancery and the clerk, master, or keeper of the rolls was always the first
                    among them whichever name they bore. In course of time, from causes which are
                    not very easy to trace, his original functions as keeper of the records passed
                    away from him and he gradually assumed a jurisdiction in the Court of Chancery
                    second only to that of the lord chancellor himself. In the beginning he only
                    heard causes in conjunction with the other masters in Chancery and his decrees
                    were invalid until they had been approved and signed by the lord chancellor. But
                    later on he heard causes without assistance and his decrees held good until they
                    were reversed on petition either to the lord chancellor or afterwards to the
                    lords justices of appeal (15 and 16 Vict. c. 83). Before any judge with the
                    formal title of vice-chancellor was appointed the master of the rolls was often
                    spoken of as vice-chancellor. By 1 and 2 Vict. c. 94 the custody of the records
                    was restored to him, and he is chairman of the State Papers and Historical
                    Manuscripts Commissions. Under 38 and 39</p>
                <p>Vict. c. 77 and 39 and 40 Vict. c. 59 he now always sits with the lords justices

                    Vict. c. 66), which provides that all judges of the High Court of Justice and
                    the Court of Appeal shall be incapable of being elected to or sitting in the
                    House of Commons. The master of the rolls is always sworn of the privy
                    council.</p>
