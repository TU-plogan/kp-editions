                <p><label type="entry">ROBERT</label> Hubert (1753-1808), bornât Paris in 1753,
                    deserves to be remembered not so much for his skill as a painter as for the
                    liveliness and point with which he treated the subjects he painted. The contrast
                    between the ruins of ancient Rome and the life of his time excited his keenest
                    interest; and, although he had started for Italy on his own responsibility, the
                    credit he there acquired procured him the protection of the minister Marigny and
                    an official allowance. His incessant activity as an artist, his daring
                    character, his many adventures, attracted general sympathy and admiration. In
                    the fourth canto of his <hi rend="italic">HImagination</hi> Delille celebrated
                    Robert’s miraculous escape when lost in the catacombs; later in life, when
                    imprisoned during the Terror and marked for the guillotine, by a fatal accident
                    another died in his place and Robert lived. The quantity of his work is immense;
                    the Louvre alone contains nine paintings by his hand and specimens are
                    frequently to be met with in provincial museums and private collections. In
                    spite of a certain naturalness in details which was wanting to his predecessor
                    Panini, all Robert’s work has more or less of that scenic character which
                    justified the taste of Voltaire when he selected him to paint the decorations of
                    his theatre at Ferney. Robert fell, struck by apoplexy, on 15th April 1808. His
                    brush was in his hand; he had painted till the last moment. He was much engraved
                    by the abbé Le Non, with whom he had visited Naples in the company of Fragonard
                    during his early days; in Italy his work has also been frequently reproduced by
                    Châtelain, Liénard, Le Veau, and others.</p>
