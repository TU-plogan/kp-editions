                <p><label type="entry">RITTER</label> Carl (1779-1859), the greatest geographer of
                    modern times, was born at Quedlinburg on August 7th, 1779, and died in Berlin,
                    September 29th, 1859. His father, a physician of some local eminence, having
                    died, leaving his family in somewhat straitened circumstances, Carl, along with
                    an elder brother and a young man, Johann Gutsmuths, who had been his private
                    tutor, was received into the Schnepfenthal institution then just founded by
                    Salzmann for the purpose of putting his educational theories to the test of
                    experience. Gutsmuths, who had continued to teach his pupils without
                    remuneration after their father’s death, remained their special guardian and
                    instructor at Schnepfenthal, and in his letters to their mother every little
                    detail of their mental development is affectionately recorded. The Salzmann
                    system was practically that of Rousseau: conformity to natural law and
                    enlightenment were its watchwords; great attention was given to practical life;
                    and the modern languages were carefully taught to the complete exclusion of
                    Latin and Greek. In 1787 Gutsmuths reports about Carl that, “while not much of a
                    hand at making money [trading with counters for coin was a regular branch of the
                    Schnepfenthal education], he draws better maps than the biggest boys, and is
                    making great strides towards becoming a professor of geography.” When his school
                    days were drawing to a close his future course was'determined in a curious way
                    by an introduction to Bethmann Hollweg, a banker in Frankfort. It was arranged
                    that Ritter should become tutor to Hollweg’s children, but that in the meantime
                    he should attend the university at his patron’s expense. In October 1796 he
                    accordingly bade adieu to Schnepfenthal, and his next two winters were spent at
                    Halle, where he resided in the house of Professor Niemayer, then at the height
                    of his fame, and attended the lectures of Rüdiger on statistics and science,
                    Sprengel on European history, Meinert on scientific agriculture, &lt;tc. His
                    duties as tutor in the Hollweg family began at Frankfort in 1798 and continued
                    for the next fifteen years. In one matter he went directly counter to the
                    Salzmann theory: he gave a large place to the study of the ancient classics, of
                    which he had grown passionately fond. The years 1814-1819, which he spent at
                    Göttingen in order still to watch over the welfare of his pupils, were those in
                    which he began to devote himself exclusively to geographical inquiries. In
                    accordance with a promise exacted by Pestalozzi (with whom he had become
                    acquainted at Yverdun on one of his many tutorial tours) he had several years
                    previously drawn up a manual of physical geography in which many features of his
                    later work are to be traced, but the book was not published. He now brought out
                    his first masterpiece, <hi rend="italic">Die Erdkunde im Verhaltniss zur Natur
                    und zur Geschichte des Menschen</hi> (Berlin, 2 vols., 1817-1818). In 1820 he
                    was called to be professor extraordinarius of history at Berlin, where shortly
                    afterwards he began also to lecture on statistics at the military college. He
                    remained in this position till his death.</p>
                <p>The service rendered to geography by Ritter was mainly threefold. His personal
                    influence, due largely to the moral character of the man and partly to the skill
                    of the teacher, was unusually potent on those who came within its range during
                    the long years that he acted as a professor. Had he done nothing more than use
                    this influence in disseminating the geographical ideas of his time he would have
                    stood high with his ow <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> n generation. But,
                    secondly, his investigations and teaching were informed by a fresh conception of
                    his subject which imparted life to what had been its dry bones and dust.
                    Geography w <hi rend="superscript">τ</hi> as, to use his own expression, a kind
                    of physiology and comparative anatomy of the earth: rivers, mountains, glaciers,
                    &amp;c., were so many distinct kinds of organs, each w <hi rend="superscript"
                    >τ</hi> ith its own appropriate functions; and, as his physical frame is the
                    basis of the man, determinative to a large extent of his life, so the structure
                    of each country is a leading element in the historic progress of the nation.
                    This naturally led him to attach great importance to the vertical as
                    distinguished from the horizontal development of the earth’s surface, and also
                    to give perhaps quite as much attention to the history of civilization and of
                    the individual animals and plants by which civilization has been affected as to
                    questions of purely physical geography. And, thirdly, he was a scientific
                    compiler of the first rank. Such portions of his universal geography as he
                    completed remain each the standard thesaurus for its territory. This is
                    especially the case with the sections devoted to Palestine and to Central Asia.
                    Among Ritter’s minor works may be mentioned <hi rend="italic">Vorhalle
