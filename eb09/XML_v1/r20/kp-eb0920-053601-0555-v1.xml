                <p><label type="entry">RICCI</label> Matteo (1552-1610), is eminent as practically
                    the founder of Christian missions in modern China.</p>
                <p>He was born of a noble family at Macerata in the March of Ancona on 7th October
                    1552, two months before Francis Xavier, burning with the desire to carry his
                    message into China, died at its gates. After some education at a Jesuit college
                    in his native town, Ricci, at the age of sixteen, was sent by his father to
                    study law at Rome. But the youth had already contemplated entering the Jesuit
                    Company, and this purpose he accomplished about 1571, without informing his
                    father, of whose opposition he was aware, until the step had been taken. The
                    father instantly started for Rome, but was stopped by illness, and abandoned
                    opposition.</p>
                <p>In 1577 Ricci and several other Italian students of noble birth offered
                    themselves for the East Indian missions; and Ricci, without visiting his family
                    to take leave, proceeded to Portugal. His comrades were Rudolfo Acquaviva,
                    Nicolas Spinola, Francesco Pasio, and Michele Ruggieri, all afterwards, like
                    Ricci himself, famous in the Jesuit annals. They arrived at Goa in September
                    1578. After four years spent in India, Ricci was summoned to the task of opening
                    China to evangelization.</p>
                <p>Several attempts had been made by Xavier, and since his death, to introduce the
                    church into China,—as by Melchior Nunes of the Jesuit society operating from
                    Sanchian <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The island

                    Cruz, a Dominican, in that or the following year; by the Augustinians under
                    Martin Herrada, 1575; and in 1579 by the Franciscans led by Pedro d’Alfaro; but
                    all these attempts proved abortive. In 1571 a house of the Jesuits had been set
                    up at Macao (where the Portuguese were established in 1557), but their attention
                    was then occupied with Japan, and it was not till the arrival at Macao of
                    Alessandro Valignani on a visitation in 1582 that work in China was really taken
                    up. For this object he had obtained the services first of M. Ruggieri and then
                    of Ricci. After various disappointments they found access to Chau-king-fu on the
                    Si-Kiang or West River of Canton, where the viceroy of the two provinces of
                    Kwang-tung and Kwang-si then had his residence, and by favour of this personage
                    they were enabled to establish themselves, and there spent several years. Their
                    proceedings were very cautious and tentative; they excited the curiosity and
                    interest of even the more intelligent Chinese by their clocks, their globes and
                    maps, their books of European engravings, and by Ricci’s knowledge of
                    mathematics, including dialling and the like, and the projection of maps. They
                    conciliated some influential friends, and their reputation spread pretty widely
                    in China. This was facilitated by the Chinese system of transfer of public
                    officers from one province of the empire to another, and in the later movements
                    of the missionaries they frequently met with one and another of their old
                    acquaintances in office, who were more or less well disposed. Eventually
                    troubles arose at Chau-king which compelled them to seek a new locality; and in
                    1589, with the viceroy’s sanction, they migrated to Chang-chau in the northern
                    part of Kwang-tung, not far from the well known Meiling Pass.</p>
                <p>During his stay here Ricci was convinced that a mistake had been made in adopting
                    a dress resembling that of the bonzes, thus identifying the missionaries with a
                    class who were the objects either of superstition or of contempt. With the
                    sanction of the visitor it was ordered that in future the missionaries should
                    adopt the costumes of Chinese literates. And, in fact, they before long adopted
                    Chinese manners altogether.</p>
                <p>Chang-chau, as a station, did not prove a happy selection, but it was not till
                    1595 that an opportunity occurred of travelling northward. We cannot follow
                    Ricci’s movements in detail, or the vicissitudes of favour and trouble which
                    attended his plans. The latter were, on the whole, never very grave. For some
                    time his residence was at Nan-chang-fu, the capital of Kiang-si; but in 1598 he
                    was enabled to proceed under favourable conditions to Nanking, and thence, for
                    the first time, to Peking, which had all along been the goal of his missionary
                    ambition. But circumstances were not then propitious, and the party had to
                    return to Nanking. The fame of the presents which they carried had, however,
                    reached the court, and the Jesuits were summoned north again, and on the 24th
                    January 1601 they entered the capital. Wan-lieh, the emperor of the Ming
                    dynasty, in those days lived in seclusion, and saw no one but his women and the
                    eunuchs. But the missionaries were summoned to the palace; their presents were
                    immensely admired; and the emperor had the curiosity to send for portraits of
                    the fathers themselves.</p>
                <p>They obtained a settlement, with an allowance for subsistence, in Peking, and
                    from this time to the end of his life Ricci’s estimation among the Chinese was
                    constantly increasing, as was at the same time the amount of his labours.
                    Visitors, who were never turned away, thronged the mission residence
                    incessantly; inquiries coming to him from all parts of the empire, from
                    strangers as well as acquaintances, respecting the doctrines which he taught, or
                    the numerous Chinese publications which he issued, had to be answered. This in
                    itself was a great burden, as Chinese composition, if wrong impressions are to
                    be avoided, demands extreme care and accuracy. As head of the mission, which now
                    had four stations in China, he also devoted much time to answering the letters
                    of the priests under him, a matter on which he spared no pains or detail. The
                    new converts had to be attended to—always welcomed, and never hustled away.
                    Besides these came the composition of his Chinese books, the teaching of his
                    people, and the maintenance of the record of the mission history which had been
                    enjoined upon him by the general of the order, and which he kept up to the most
                    recent dates. Thus his labours were wearing and incessant. In May 1610 he broke
                    down, and after an illness of eight days died on the 11th of that month, aged
                    fifty-eight. His coadjutor Pantoja applied to the emperor for a burying-place
                    outside the city. This, after due consideration by the boards concerned, was
                    granted, with the most honourable official testimonies to the reputation and
                    character of Ricci; and a large building in the vicinity of the city was at the
                    same time bestowed upon the mission for their residence.</p>
                <p>Ricci’s character, his acquirements, and the use he made of them were certainly
                    worthy of all honour. We do not know what amount of success in conversion had
                    rewarded his labours during his life, hut some eminent and creditable converts
                    there were, and his work was the foundation of the considerable spread which the
                    Roman Catholic Church has since attained in China. When the missionaries of
                    other Roman Catholic orders made their way into China, some twenty years after
                    the death of Ricci, they found great fault with the manner in which certain
                    Chinese practices had been dealt with by the Jesuits, a matter in which Ricci’s
                    action and policy had given the tone to the mission in China,—though in fact
                    that tone was rather inherent in the Jesuit system than the outcome of
                    individual character, for controversies of an exactly parallel nature arose two
                    generations later in southern India, between the Jesuits and Capuchins,
                    regarding what were called “Malabar rites.” The controversy thus kindled in
                    China burned for considerably more than a century with great fierceness, <note

                    career of Ricci, but indicate its existence. The chief points of controversy
                    were (1) the lawfulness and expediency of certain terms employed by the <pb

                    “Heaven,” and Shang-ti, “Supreme Ruler” or “Emperor,” instead of Tien-Chu, “Lord
                    of Heaven,” and in particular the erection of inscribed tablets in the churches,
                    on which these terms were made use of; <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    of Confucius, and of personal ancestors, which Ricci had recognized as merely
                    “civil” observances; (3) the erection of tablets in honour of ancestors in
                    private houses; and (4), more generally, sanction and favour accorded to ancient
                    Chinese sacred books and philosophical doctrine, as not really trespassing on
                    Christian faith.</p>
                <p>Probably no European name of past centuries is so well known in China as that of
                    Li-ma-teu, the form in which the name of our missionary (,β⅛-cci Mat-teo') was
                    adapted to Chinese usage, and by which he appears in Chinese records. <note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The name comes forward
                    prominently in the mouth of the emperor Kang-hi, in a dialogue which took place
                    between him and Monsgr. Maigrot, the leader of the anti-Jesuit movement
                    (mentioned in Browning’s lines referred to above), at the summer residence in
                    Tar-tary, August 1706,—a dialogue which the Jesuits have reported with not a
                    little malice :— </p></note> The works which he composed in Chinese are
                    numerous; a list of them (apparently by no means complete, however) will be
                    found in Kivclier’s China Illustrata, and also in Abel Rémusat’s Nouveaux
                    Mélanges Asiatiques (ii. pp. 213-215). They are said to display an aptitude for
                    clothing ideas in a Chinese dress very rare and remarkable in a foreigner. One
                    of the first which attracted attention and reputation among Chinese readers was
                    a Treatise upon Friendship, in the form of a dialogue containing short and pithy
                    paragraphs; this is stated in the De Expeditione to have been suggested during
                    Ricci’s stay at Nan-chang by a conversation with the prince of Kien-ngan, who
                    asked questions regarding the laws of friendship in the West.</p>
                <p>In the early part of his residence at Peking, when enjoying constant intercourse
                    with scholars of high position, Ricci brought out the Tien-chu shih-i, or
                    “Veritable doctrine of the Lord of Heaven,” which deals with the divine
                    character and attributes under eight heads. “This work,” says Mr A. Wylie,
                    “contains some acute reasoning in support of the propositions laid down, but the
                    doctrine of faith in Christ is very slightly touched upon. The teachings of
                    Buddhism are vigorously attacked, whilst the author tries to draw a parallel
                    between Christianity and the teachings of the Chinese literati.”</p>
                <p>In 1604 Ricci completed the Erh-shih-wu yen, a series of short articles of moral
                    bearing, but exhibiting little of the essential doctrines of Christianity.
                    Chi-jên shih ρien is another of his productions, completed in 1608, and
                    consisting of a record of ten conversations held with Chinese of high position.
                    The subjects are :— (1) Years past no longer ours; (2) Man a sojourner on earth;
                    (3) Advantage of frequent contemplation of eternity; (4) Preparation for
                    judgment by such contemplation; (5) The good man not desirous of talking; (6)
                    Abstinence, and its distinction from the prohibition to take life; (7)
                    Self-examination and self-reproof inconsistent with inaction; (8) Future reward
                    and punishment; (9) Prying into futurity hastens calamity; (10) Wealth with
                    covetousness more wretched than poverty with contentment. To this work is
                    appended a translation of eight European hymns, with elucidations, written in
                    1609.</p>
                <p>Some of the characteristics briefly indicated here may have suggested, though
                    probably they are far from justifying, the bitterness of attacks made upon
                    Ricci’s theology, long after he had been in his grave, by some of the opponents
                    of the Jesuits in the controversies to which we have referred. An example of
                    these is found in the work called Anecdotes sur l'État de Religion dans la
                    Chine, Paris, 1733-35, the author of which (Abbé Villers) speaks of the
                    T'ien-ehu shih-i in this fashion—“The Jesuit was also so ill versed in the
                    particulars of the faith that, as the holy bishop of Conon, Monsgr. Maigrot,
                    says of him, one need merely read his book on the true religion to convince
                    oneself that he had never imbibed the first elements of theology”. . . . The
                    writer goes on to say other things even much more bitter.</p>
                <p>Ricci’s pointed attacks on Buddhism, and the wide circulation of his books,
                    called forth the opposition of the Buddhist clergy.</p>
                <p>One of the ablest who took their part was Chu-hang, a priest of Hang-chau, who
                    had abandoned the literary status for the Buddhist cloister. He wrote three
                    articles against the doctrine of the missionaries. These were brought to Ricci’s
                    notice in an ostensible tone of candour by Yu-chun-he, a high mandarin at the
                    capital. This letter, with Ricci’s reply, the three Buddhist declamations, and
                    Ricci’s confutation, were published in a collected form by the Christian
                    Sen-Kwang-K’e.</p>
                <p>Another work of Ricci’s which attracted attention was the Hsi-kuo fa, or “Art of
                    Memory as practised in the West.” Ricci was himself a great, expert in memoria
                    techniea, and astonished the Chinese by his performances in this line. He also
                    wrote or edited various Chinese works on geography, the celestial and
                    terrestrial spheres, geometry, and arithmetic. <note anchored="true"

                    ejusdem Societatis Commentariis, in which Trigault himself added a large amount
                    of interesting matter respecting China and the Chinese.</p>
                <p>Among the scientific works of his time which Ricci took with him into China,
                    there was a fine set of maps, which at first created great interest, but disgust
                    afterwards when the Chinese came to perceive the insignificant place assigned
                    therein to the “Middle Kingdom,” thrust, as it seemed, into a corner, instead of
                    being set in the centre of the world like the gem in a ring. Ricci, seeing their
                    dissatisfaction, set about constructing a map of the hemisphere on a great
                    scale, so adjusted that China, with its subject states, filled the central area,
                    and, without deviating from truth of projection, occupied a large space in
                    proportion to the other kingdoms gathered round it. All the names were then
                    entered in Chinese calligraphy. This map obtained immense favour, and was
                    immediately engraved at the expense of the viceroy, and widely circulated.</p>
                <p>In the accompanying cut we have endeavoured to realize this Jesuitical map, as we
                    fear it must be called. The projection we have adopted is a perspective of the
                    hemisphere, as viewed from a point at the distance of one diameter from the
                    surface, and situated on the production of the radius which passes through the
                    intersec tion of 115° E.</p>
                <p>long. (Green wich) with 30°</p>
                <p>N. lat. Some thing pretty near this must have been Li-</p>
                <p>ma-teu’s projec tion. With a vertex much more distant the desired effect would be
                    impaired, and with one nearer neither of the poles would be seen, whilst the
                    exaggeration of China would have been too gross for a professed representation
                    of the hemisphere.</p>
                <p>The chief facts of Ricci's career are derived from Trigault; some
                    contemporary-works on the rites controversy have also been consulted; in the
                    notice of Ricci's Chinese writings valuable matter has been derived from <hi

                    examination. The projection of the sphere by the present writer appeared in the
                    (now defunct) <hi rend="italic">Geographical Magazine</hi> for July 1874. A
                    number of Ricci's letters are extant in the possession of the family, and access
                    to them was afforded to Giuseppe La Farina, author of the work called <hi

                    interest. There is a curious Chinese account of Ricci published by Dr
