                <p><label type="entry">REGIOMONTANUS</label> (1436-1476). The real name of this
                    astronomer was <hi rend="smallcaps">Johann Müller,</hi> but from his birthplace,
                    Königsberg, a small town in Franconia, he called himself <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Joh. de Monteregio.</hi> The name Regiomontanus occur for the first time on the
                    title !)age of his <hi rend="italic">Scripta,</hi> published in 1544, but he has
                    since become best known by it. He was born in June 1436 and became the pupil of
                    Pur bach at the university of Vienna, and jointly with him endeavoured, with
                    such imperfect instruments as they could construct, to test the accuracy of the
                    Alphonsine tables of the motions of the planets. After Purbach’s death
                    Regiomontanus finished and published his <hi rend="italic">Epitome in Ptolemsei
                    Almagestum,</hi> but, having in the meantime become acquainted with Cardinal
                    Bessarion, who was anxious to spread the knowledge of the Greek literature among
                    the Western nations, he proceeded with him to Italy in 1462, and for the
                    following eight years devoted a great deal of time to the study of the Greek
                    language and to collecting <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit20newyrich/page/n359/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0359-0342"/>Greek manuscripts. He returned from Italy in 1471
                    and settled at Nuremberg, at that time one of the chief centres of German
                    industry and literary life. Here he became associated with Bernhard Walther
                    (1430-1504), a wealthy patrician and an enthusiastic astronomer. An observatory
                    was erected, and the finest instruments the skilful artisans of Nuremberg could
                    make were regularly used by the two friends for observing the heavens. Clocks
                    driven by weights were here used for the first time for scientific purposes, the
                    influence of refraction in altering the apparent places of the stars better
                    appreciated, Venus substituted for the moon as a connecting link between
                    observations of the sun and of stars, and other improvements introduced in
                    practical astronomy. Regiomontanus also published a number of calendars and
                    ephemerides, which induced Pope Sixtus IV. to summon him to Rome to assist in
                    reforming the confused calendar. He died very shortly after his arrival in Rome,
                    July G, 1476.</p>
                <p>In 1464 Regiomontanus finished a work on trigonometry, which science had made
                    considerable progress among the Arabians but had to be reinvented in Europe. The
                    work was, however, never printed till 1533 <hi rend="italic">(Da Triangulis
                    libri quinqué),</hi> probably because the author, after introducing the use of
                    tangents, had wished to re-write his book, but was prevented from doing so by
                    his early death. In his <hi rend="italic">Tabulae Direclionum</hi> (Nuremberg,
                    1475) there is a table of tangents ( <hi rend="italic">tabula fecunda).</hi> His
                    instruments and observations at Nuremberg are described in a posthumous work,

                    (Nuremberg, 1544). The ephemerides and calendars were published partly in German
                    <hi rend="italic">(Magister Johann von Kunsperk’s teutschcr Keilender),</hi>
                    partly in Latin ( <hi rend="italic">Ephemerides Astronomicae,</hi> Nuremberg,
                    1473 or 1475, for the years 1475-1506; <hi rend="italic">Kalendarium Novum,</hi>
                    Nuremberg 1474, reissued many times and translated into German and Italian). The
                    German geographer Martin Behem made these calendars known among the Spanish and
                    Portuguese navigators, and they became of the greatest importance in guiding
                    Columbus, Diaz, Vasco da Gama, and many others over the trackless ocean. The
                    life of Regiomontanus was written by Gassendi (The Hague, 1654); among modern
