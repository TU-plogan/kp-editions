                    (1797-1855), perhaps the most important figure in modern Italian philosophy, was
                    born at Rovereto in the Italian Tyrol in 1797, and died in 1855. With every
                    worldly advantage as the eldest son of a noble and wealthy family, from an early
                    age he resolved to devote himself to God’s service in the Catholic priesthood.
                    He became the founder of a new religious order, named the Institute of Charity,
                    but known in Italy generally as the Rosminians. The members may be priests or
                    laymen. All are prepared to do any works of charity— corporal, intellectual, or
                    spiritual—to which they may be directed by divine providence, under obedience to
                    their superior, to the bishops, and to the pope. They have branches in Italy,
                    England, Ireland, France, and America. In London they are attached to the
                    ancient church of St Etheldreda, Ely Place, Holborn, where the English
                    translations of Rosmini’s works are edited.</p>
                <p>Rosmini’s <hi rend="italic">Sistema Eilosofico</hi> set forth the conception of a
                    complete encyclopaedia of the human knowable, synthetically conjoined, according
                    to the order of ideas, in a perfectly harmonious whole. This conception Rosmini
                    developed in more than forty volumes. Here a brief notice of the characteristic
                    principle of his philosophy must suffice.</p>
                <p>Rosmini, contemplating the position of recent philosophy from Locke to Hegel, and
                    having his eye directed to the ancient and fundamental problem of the origin,
                    truth, and certainty of our ideas, wrote:—“If philosophy is to be restored to
                    love and respect, I think it will be necessary, in part, to return to the
                    teachings of the ancients, and in part to give those teachings the benefit of
                    modern methods” <hi rend="italic">(Theodicy,</hi> n. 148). Pursuing therefore
                    the now generally approved method of the observation of facts, he most carefully
                    examined and analysed the fact of human knowledge, and obtained the following
                    results :—(1) that the notion or idea of being or existence in general enters
                    into, and is presupposed by, all our acquired cognitions, so that, without it,
                    they would be impossible; (2) that this idea is essentially objective, inasmuch
                    as what is seen in it is as distinct from and opposed to the mind that sees it
                    as the light is from the eye that looks at it; (3) that it is essentially true,
                    because “being’’and “truth” are convertible terms, and because in the vision of
                    it the mind cannot err, since error could only be committed by a judgment, and
                    here there is no judgment, but a pure intuition affirming nothing and denying
                    nothing; (4) that by the application of this essentially objective and true idea
                    the human being intellectually perceives, first, the animal body individually
                    conjoined with him, and then, on occasion of the sensations produced in him <hi
                    rend="italic">not by himself,</hi> the causes of those sensations, that is, from
                    the action felt he perceives and affirms an agent, a being, and therefore a true
                    thing, that acts on him, and he thus gets at the external world,—these are the
                    true primitive judgments, containing (α) the subsistence of the particular being
                    (subject), and (5) its essence or species as determined by the quality of the
                    action felt from it (predicate); (5) that reflexion, by separating the essence
                    or species from the subsistence, obtains the full specific idea
                    (universalization), and then from this, by leaving aside some of its elements,
                    the abstract specific idea (abstraction); (6) that the mind, having reached this
                    stage of development, can proceed to further and further abstracts, including
                    the first principles of reasoning, the principles of the several sciences,
                    complex ideas, groups of ideas, and so on without end; (7) finally, that the
                    same most universal idea of being, this generator and formal element of all
                    acquired cognitions, cannot itself be acquired, but must be innate in us,
                    implanted by God in our nature. Being, as naturally shining to our mind, must
                    therefore be what men call the light of reason. Hence the name Rosmini gives it
                    of ideal being; and this he laid down as the one true fundamental principle of
                    all philosophy, and the supreme criterion of truth and certainty. This he firmly
                    believed to be the teaching of St Augustine, as well as of St Thomas, of whom he
                    was an ardent admirer and defender. The above seven points could only be hinted
                    at here. A complete and exhaustive treatment of them will be found in Rosmini’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Hew Essay on the Origin of Ideas,</hi> which has lately been
                    rendered into English (London, 1883-84).</p>
                <p>Rosmini’s <hi rend="italic">Sistemai Filosofico</hi> has been translated into
                    English by Davidson <hi rend="italic">(Rosmini’s Philosophical System,</hi>
                    London, 1882). The volume contains also a biographical sketch of the author,
                    with a complete catalogue of his writings, ninety-nine in all, on philosophical,
                    religious, and miscellaneous subjects, and a copious list of works relating to
                    his life and philosophy.</p>
