                <p><label type="entry">RICHMOND</label> a borough in the North Riding of Yorkshire,
                    is finely situated on the Swale, at the terminus of the Richmond branch of the
                    North-Eastern Railway, 44 miles north-west of York and 15 south-west of
                    Darlington. The interest of the town centres in the castle, said to have been
                    founded by Alan Rufus, son of Hoel, count of Bretagne, who is also said to have
                    rebuilt the town on his obtaining the estates of the Saxon Earl Edwin, embracing
                    two hundred manors of Richmond and extending over nearly a third of the North
                    Riding. When Henry VII. came to the throne these possessions reverted to the
                    crown. Henry VIII. gave it to his son Henry by a daughter of Sir John Blount,
                    and Charles II. bestowed the title of duke of Richmond on his son by the duchess
                    of Portsmouth. The castle is situated on a perpendicular rock rising about 100
                    feet above the Swale, and from its great strength was considered inaccessible.
                    Originally it covered an area of 5 acres, but the only portions of it now
                    remaining are the Norman keep, with pinnacled tower and walls 100 feet high by
                    11 feet thick, and some other smaller towers. A portion of it is now occupied by
                    the North York Rifles militia. The old church of St Mary, chiefly in the Gothic
                    style, though with some traces of Norman, has been restored under the direction
                    of Sir Gilbert Scott. For the free grammar school founded by Elizabeth a Gothic
                    building was erected in 1850, in memory of the Rev. James Tate, a former master.
                    The tower of the Franciscan abbey founded in 1258 still remains. The chief
                    modern buildings are the town-hall, the masonic hall, and the workmen’s hall.
                    The principal trade is in agricultural produce, but there are a paper mill and
                    an iron and brass foundry. The town received its first charter from Elizabeth.
                    Under the Municipal Corporations Act it is governed by a mayor, four aldermen,
                    and tw <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> elve councillors. Up to 1885, when it
                    ceased to be separately represented, Richmond was a parliamentary borough,
                    returning two members till 1868, and one after that date. The population of the
                    municipal borough (area 2520 acres) in 1871 was 4443, and in 1881 it was
                    4502.</p>
