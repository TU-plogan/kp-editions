                <p><label type="entry">APIS</label>, a sacred bull worshipped at Memphis from the
                    earliest period, having probably been introduced into the religious system as
                    early as the 2d dynasty by the king Kaiechos, who instituted the worship of Apis
                    and the bull Mnevis. His name in hieroglyphs was <hi rend="italic">Hapi,</hi>
                    and meant “the hidden,” as he had to be discovered amidst the cattle, which was
                    done by certain diacritical marks. According to the hieroglyphic inscriptions
                    which accompany his form, he was the second birth or living incarnation of the
                    god Ptah, ' <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> the Egyptian Hephaestos or Vulcan. Apis
                    is first mentioned and appears in the monuments of the 4th dynasty. The two
                    bulls Apis and Mnevis are considered to have respectively represented the moon
                    and sun, and seem both to have been buried at Memphis. He was supposed to have
                    been born of a virgin cow, rendered pregnant by a moonbeam or a flash of
                    lightning. The mother of Apis, according to Strabo, had a part of the temple of
                    the Apis reserved for her use; and the hieroglyphic inscriptions record a
                    prophet or priest attached to her service. On the monuments she shares the
                    honours of the bull, and is represented under the attributes of Athor as a
                    goddess with a cow’s head. This cow had her especial name, these animals having
                    each a separate appellation. According to the Greek writers Apis was the image
                    of Osiris, and worshipped because Osiris was supposed to have passed into a
                    bull, and to have been soon after manifested by a succession of these animals.
                    The hieroglyphic inscriptions identify the Apis with Osiris, adorned with horns
                    or the head of a bull, and unite the two names as Hapi-Osor, or Apis Osiris.
                    According to this view the Apis was the incarnation of Osiris manifested in the
                    shape of a bull. But besides this title, the monuments style Apis the son of
                    Ptah, who was supposed to be his father by the sacred cow, or the second life of
                    Ptah. Other monuments, indeed, declare him to have had no father, and to have
                    been Onnophris or Osiris, but this conflict of ideas must have arisen from his
                    material and spiritual nature, uniting the soul of Osiris or Ptah mystically
                    with the sacred animal. Besides the mother of the Apis, a cow was annually
                    exhibited to him decorated with the same insignia—that is, a disk between the
                    horns and a housing on the back, to judge from the insignia found on the bronze
                    figures of the Apis—and then slaughtered the same day, for no issue of the
                    divine animal was permitted to exist. According to other authorities several
                    cows were kept in the Apeum. On the announcement of the birth of an Apis, the
                    sacred scribes and priests proceeded to verify the characters of the calf. The
                    marks of the Apis were a black coloured hide, with a white triangular spot on
                    the forehead, the hair arranged in the shape of an eagle on the back, and a knot
                    under the tongue in shape of a Scarabaeus, the sacred insect and emblem of Ptah,
                    a white spot resembling a lunar crescent at his right side. These marks have
                    been supposed to be for the most part certain arrangements of the hairs of the
                    hide as seen in some animals. A house was built to the calf Apis facing the
                    east, in which for four months he was nourished with milk. When he had grown up
                    he was conducted, at the time of the new moon, to a ship by the sacred scribes
                    and prophets, and conducted to the Apeum at Memphis, where there were courts,
                    places for him to walk in, and a drinking fountain. According to Diodorus, he
                    was first led to N∏opolis, and kept there 40 days, then shipped in a boat with a
                    gilded cabin to Memphis, and he was there allowed to be seen for 40 days only by
                    women, who exposed themselves to him. Like all the sacred animals his actions
                    were oracular, and he had two chambers, his passage into one of which was deemed
                    fortunate, and into the other unlucky. Thus the licking the garments of a
                    visitor was supposed to prognosticate a tranquil but short life, and his refusal
                    of the food offered to him by the hand of Germanicus, the approaching death of
                    that hero. The actions of the children who played around his shrine or
                    accompanied his processions were also considered oracular. The day of his birth
                    was kept as an annual festival. His life was not allowed to exceed 25 years, and
                    should it have attained that maximum reckoned from the date of his
                    enthronisation, the Apis was killed and thrown into a well, in which the priests
                    asserted he had precipitated himself. This well was known to no one, and no one
                    was allowed to reveal the place of burial. If the Apis died before the 25 years
                    he received a splendid burial at Memphis in the Serapeum, for after death he was
                    called the Osor-hapi, or Serapis. This funeral was expensive; his body was
                    placed in a barge, and accompanied by a procession of a Bacchanalian character,
                    passing through the brazen doors of Memphis. As universal joy prevailed at his
                    discovery, so his death threw all Egypt into a general mourning, and every one
                    shaved off his beard. This mourning continued till the discovery of another
                    Apis. His birthday was celebrated by an annual feast, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >natales</hi><hi rend="italic">Apidis,</hi> of seven days’ duration, during
                    which it was supposed the crocodiles were innocuous, and a silver cup was thrown
                    on the occasion into a certain part of the Nile, which was considered a flux of
                    Apis. This festival coincided with the rise of the Nile. On the mummy coffins an
                    Apis is often seen on the foot-board of those of the 7th and 6th centuries <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> bearing on the back the mummy of the deceased to the
                    sepulchre. The discovery by Μ. Mariette of the Serapeum at Memphis described by
                    Strabo has thrown great light on the λvorship and history of the Apis, the mode
                    of burial, and the sequence of the bulls. (See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Serapeum.)</hi> The oldest Apis mentioned was one of the reign of Amenophis
                    III., and he was followed in the 18th dynasty by bulls which had died in the
                    reigns of Tutankhamen and Horus. There was a succession under the 19th dynasty,
                    commencing with Seti or Sethos I., besides three which died in the 16th, 26th,
                    and 30th years of Raineses IL, and three others, the dates of whose deaths are
                    unknown. Under the 20th dynasty there was an Apis which died in the <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0187-0174"/> 26th year of Rameses III., one in the reign of
                    Rameses IX., others of the date of Rameses XI. and XIV., and four others whose
                    dates are not determined, besides three more which died under the 21st dynasty.
                    Of bulls deceased in the 22d dynasty, there is one of the 23d year of Osorkon
                    II., another of the 14th year of Takellothis I., and a third of the 28th year of
                    Sheshank or Shishak III. It is not till the reign of this monarch that the dates
                    connected with the Apis become of chronological importance. On the sepulchral
                    tablet of the Apis which was born in the reign of Shishak III., is found the
                    formula of the date of the birth and inauguration of the bull. It was born on
                    the 20th of the month Payni, in the 28th year of the king’s reign, and enthroned
                    on the 1st of Paophi of the same year, having died in the 2d year of the king
                    Pamai, and been buried on the 1st of the month Meclιir of the same year. It had
                    attained the age of 26 years. Three other bulls died in the 4th, llth, and 37th
                    years of Shishak IV. Important statements like these show the intervals of time
                    which elapsed between the regnal years of different kings, and check the
                    chronology of the 22d and subsequent dynasties, but owing to unfortunate lacunae
                    the chronology of Egypt is conjectural, and not positive till the reign of
                    Tirhakah. The dates of the other Apis are, one which died on the 5th of the
                    month Thoth, in the 6th year of Bekenrenf, or Bocchoris, another of the 2d year
                    of Shabak or Sabaco, and that buried on the 23d Pharmouthi of the 24th year of
                    Tirhakah, 730 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The dates of the other bulls prior
                    to the conquest of Egypt by Alexander the Great, 332 B.c. are—one born in the
                    26th year of Tirhakah, enthroned on the 9th Pharmouthi, the same year deceased,
                    in the 20th year of Psammetichus I., and buried on the 25th Paophi, of the 23d
                    year of Psammetichus; another deceased in the 52d year of the same king; a third
                    born in the 53d year of Psammetichus I., enthroned on the 12th of Athor of the
                    54th year, deceased on the 6th of Paophi, and buried on the 10th Choiak of the
                    16th year of Necho, having lived 16 years 7 months and 17 days; another born on
                    7th Paophi of the 16th year of Necho, enthroned 9th Epiphi of the 1st year of
                    Psammetichus I., died on the 12th Pharmouthi of the 12th year of Apries, and
                    buried the 21st Payni of the same year, aged 17 years 6 months and 5 days;
                    another born in the 5th year of Amasis, inaugurated on the 18th Payni of the
                    same year, died on the 6th Phamenoth, was buried on the 15th Pashons of the 23d
                    year of the same king, aged 18 years and 6 months. The Apis which died after
                    this, and of which a sarcophagus was found dated in the 4th year of Cambyses, is
                    the one supposed to have been killed by Cambyses on his return from Aethiopia.
                    Another born in the month Pharmouthi of the 5th year of Cambyses, died in the
                    4th year of Darius, and was buried on the 2d Pashons of the 5th year of Darius,
                    and had lived upwards of 7 years. It is the Apis of Darius, alluded to by
                    Polyaenus, for the successor of which Darius offered 100 talents as a reward to
                    the fortunate discoverer. Another Persian king Ochus is said to have killed and
                    eaten an Apis, 338 B.c. The death of an Apis soon after the death of Alexander
                    the Great, 323 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> is also recorded. The sepulchral
                    tablets in the demotic characters, according to Μ. Brugsch, record the birth of
                    an Apis in the month of Phamenoth, in the 20th year of Ptolemy Euergetes I., 231
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> which died in the 51st year, 179 B.c.; and
                    another older, probably of Ptolemy Philadelphus IL, 253 B.c.; another of the
                    14th year of Ptolemy Epiphanes IV., 211 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.;</hi> another
                    in the 20th year of Ptolemy IV., 185 B.c.; another in the 17th year of Ptolemy
                    Philometor VII., 164 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.;</hi> and another born in the 53d
                    year (118-117 B.c.) of Ptolemy Euergetes II., died 15 years old, 103 B.c., in
                    the reign of Ptolemy XI. In the Roman times the discovery of an Apis in the
                    reign of Hadrian, 121 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> caused a tumult at
                    Alexandria; and the last known Apis is that brought to the Emperor Julian II.,
                    362-363 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> after which the Apis disappears from
                    Egypt altogether. The Apis was embalmed at great cost, but the operation
                    consisted in preparing with bitumen the skull and a few of the principal bones
                    of the bull made up into an appropriate shape. The second genius of the
                    Karneter, or Egyptian Hades, was also called Hapi or Apis, but he was quite
                    distinct from the bull god and the son of Osiris. His type was that of a human
                    mummy with the head of a Cynocephalus ape. Bronze native figures of the Apis are
                    not uncommon, and those of stone are occasionally found, but porcelain ones are
                    extremely rare.</p>
