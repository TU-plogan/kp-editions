                <p><label type="entry">ARCHERY</label>, the art or exercise of shooting with a bow
                    and arrow. The origin of the bow as an instrument of war is lost in obscurity.
                    With all the ancient peoples, both civilised and barbaric, the bow was a
                    favourite weapon, and skill in the use of it was regarded by the Scythians as a
                    princely accomplishment. The Greeks and Romans employed archers to draw the
                    enemy into action, and the exploits of the ancient Egyptians rivalled those of
                    the archers of the Middle Ages.</p>
                <p>There is no record of the use of the bow in France until the reign of
                    Charlemagne, in the beginning of the 8th century, although we have evidence that
                    in England both the Anglo-Saxons and the Danes employed it in the chase, as well
                    as in battle against the primitive inhabitants of England, many years before the
                    Conquest. The probability is that it was first introduced as a military weapon
                    into Britain by the Romans; but it was under the Norman rule that the practice
                    of archery in this island was not only greatly improved, but generally diffused
                    throughout the country, so that England soon became famous for its archery, and
                    her archers took precedence of those of every other nation. To preserve this
                    superiority by constant practice appears to have been the study of many of our
                    monarchs; and numerous statutes for enforcing and regulating the use of the bow
                    among the people were enacted from early times until after the invention of
                    fire-arms. Many laws were also made for securing the presence in distant and
                    obscure parts of the country of persons skilled in the manufacture of bows and
                    all the apparatus appertaining to archery, for guarding against fraud by those
                    artificers, and also for the procuring of a constant supply of bow-staves from
                    abroad. These laws appear to have been absolutely necessary, for in the olden
                    time the English chiefly depended for their success in battle upon the bravery
                    and expertness of their archers, whose appearance in the field generally led to
                    success. William the Conqueror is reputed to have been so admirable an archer
                    that few could bend the bow he used, and his victory at Hastings was certainly
                    due to the skill and intrepidity of his archers. Richard I. performed great
                    exploits with his archers in the Holy Land, where, according to Gibbon, 300
                    archers and 17 knights, headed by the king, sustained the charge of the whole
                    Turkish and Saracen army. It was in his reign that the renowned Robin Hood
                    flourished in Sherwood Forest. Edward II. levied a company of “Northumbrian
                    archers” in the year 1314, for the invasion of Scotland.</p>
                <p>The battles of Cressy and Poitiers were gained by the English archers in the
                    years 1346 and 1356 respectively. Edward III. was extremely jealous of the
                    honour of the bow, and anxious that its glory should be maintained. In <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0393-0372"/> the early part of his reign it was ordered that
                    most of the sheriffs of England should each provide 500 white bows and 500
                    bundles of arrows for the then pending war with France. In the following year
                    this order was reissued, with the difference that the sheriff of Gloucester
                    should furnish 500 painted bows in addition. This king embodied a company of
                    soldiers, whom he called the “Archers of the Guard.” Edward III. also, in 1363,
                    commanded the general practice of archery on Sundays and holidays by the people
                    in lieu of the ordinary rural pastimes, which were forbidden on pain of
                    imprisonment. In this reign the price of bows was regulated by Government <hi
                    rend="italic">; a</hi> white bow was Is., a painted bow Is. 6d., a sheaf (24) of
                    sharp arrows Is. 2d., and a sheaf of blunt arrows Is. Richard IL, in 1392,
                    directed that none of his servants should ever be unfurnished with bows and
                    arrows, and that they should avail themselves of every opportunity of practising
                    archery. At the same date an Act of Parhament compelled all persons employed a.s
                    servants to shoot with bows and arrows on Sundays and other holidays. In the
                    year 1402 the English archers won the battle of Homildon; and in 1403, at the
                    battle of Shrewsbury, where Hotspur was slain, the most terrible havoc was
                    created by the archers on both sides. In the reign of Richard III., it was
                    enacted that for every ton of Malmsey or Tyne wine brought into England, ten
                    good bow-staves should also be imported, under penalty of 13s. 4d. for every
                    deficient stave; and to encourage the import of bow-staves, those above 6∣ feet
                    long Were freed from duty.</p>
                <p>For the manufacture of bows yew was generally preferred to all other woods, but
                    to prevent a too rapid consumption of yew, bowyers were ordered to make four
                    wych-hazel, ash, or elm bows, to one of yew; and no person under 17 years of
                    age, except those possessed of portable property worth 40 marks, or the sons of
                    parents owning an estate of £10 per annum, was allowed to shoot with a yew bow,
                    under penalty of 6s. 8d. for each offence. That distant counties might be
                    properly supplied with bows and arrows, the king claimed and exercised the
                    prerogative of sending, if necessary, all arrow-head, bow-string, and bow
                    makers, not being freemen of the city of London, to any part of the realm that
                    required the services of such artificers; and neglect of an order to visit a
                    place after the receipt of instructions to repair thereto, was punishable by.a
                    fine of 40s. for every day the workman remained away.</p>
                <p>In the reign of Henry IV. it was enacted that all arrowheads should be well
                    brased and hardened at the points with steel, and stamped with the name of the
                    maker, under penalty of fine and imprisonment, and forfeiture of the arrows,
                    &amp;c., in default; and by another statute passed in the same reign, it was
                    enacted that persons from places whence bow-staves were derived, should import
                    four bowstaves for every ton of merchandise taken on board, under penalty of 6s.
                    8d. for every bow-stave deficient. In this reign the highest price permitted for
                    a yew bow was 3s. 4d. In the reign of Edward IV. it was enacted that every
                    Englishman, and every Irishman living with an Englishman, should have an English
                    bow of his own height; and also that in every township shooting butts should be
                    set up, at which the inhabitants were commanded to practise on holidays, under
                    the penalty of one halfpenny for each neglect. In the same reign the king, in
                    preparing for a war with France, directed all sheriffs to procure a supply of
                    bows and arrows for the service of the state. In 1405, it was made penal to use
                    bad materials in the manufacture of bowsand arrows. In 1417 the archers of the
                    army of Henry V. won the battle of Agincourt. This king directed the sheriffs of
                    counties to take six wing-feathers from every goose for the feathering of
                    arrows. In 1478 archery was encouraged in Ireland by statute. In the year 1424
                    James I. of Scotland, who was himself an excellent bowman, revived the practice
                    of archery among his subjects. Richard III. lent 1000 archers to the duke of
                    Bretagne. The same troops afterwards fought at the battle of Bosworth. In 1485
                    Henry VII. instituted the yeomen of the guard, who were then all archers, and in
                    the 19th year of his reign the use of the cross-bow was forbidden by Act of
                    Parhament, because the long bow had been of so much greater benefit to the
                    nation. In this reign archery occupied an important position in the fashionable
                    pastimes of the kingdom, and upon the occasion of the marriage of Henry with the
                    Princess Elizabeth it formed a great feature among the nuptial festivities, the
                    king himself joining in the shooting with heartiness and glee.</p>
                <p>Several Acts were passed in the reign of Henry VIII. for the encouragement and
                    promotion of archery; one ordered that butts should be erected and kept in
                    repair in all townships, and that the inhabitants should practise shooting at
                    them on holidays. The same Act directed that every able-bodied man, not being an
                    ecclesiastic or a judge, should practise shooting with the long bow; and the
                    guardians and employers of youth were ordered to bring up the boys in their
                    charge to the practice of archery, neglect being punishable by fine. In this
                    reign the practice of archery was strongly advocated from the pulpit by Bishop
                    Latimer; and so jealous were the English of rival nations· competing with them,
                    that aliens were forbidden to use the long bow. The English victory at the
                    battle of Floddeπ Field was due to the skill and courage of the archers. Edward
                    VI. devoted much of his time to the practice of archery as an amusement, and his
                    Journal, in which are many allusions to his successes and disappointments at
                    matches, is still preserved in the British Museum.</p>
                <p>Archery continued to be an object of attention and solicitude with the
                    Legislature during the reign of Elizabeth, and the price of bows was again
                    regulated by statute; also, bowyers were commanded to keep in hand always a
                    sufficient stock of bows. Charles I. issued commissions to prevent the enclosure
                    of fields near London, so “as to interrupt the necessary and profitable exercise
                    of shooting with bows and arrows,” and also for the restoration of all
                    shooting-marks that had been already removed. And the· earl of Essex, at the
                    beginning of the civil war, raised a company of archers for the defence of the
                    king. In the time of Charles II. archery was a highly fashionable and popular
                    recreation with all classes of society, and the “Merrie Monarch” used frequently
                    to take part with the ladies and gentlemen of his court in toxophilite meetings.
                    Queen Catherine also showed deep interest in the fascinating pastime, and in the
                    year 1676 she presented a silver badge to the “Marshal of the Fraternity of
                    Archers.” Both the king and queen frequently reviewed the numerous associations
                    of archers then existent. In the spring of 1682 a. grand fête was given by the
                    London Artillery Company at the Artillery Grounds, at which there were present
                    upwards, of 1000 archers, and it is said that the gala outshone anything of its
                    kind that had previously been seen in England; but from that time until the
                    beginning of the present century, the attractions of archery appear to have been
                    overlooked, and its practice neglected. In the <hi rend="italic">English
                    Bowman,</hi> a small book published in the year 1801, we find the following
                    reason given as the cause of its revival in London :—</p>
                <quote> “About the year 1776, BIr Waring, who then lived with Sir Ashton Lever at
                    Leicester House, and who may justly be styled the father of modem archery,
                    having, by continual business, contracted an oppression upon his chest (arising
                    principally from sitting too closely at his desk and pressing his breast too
                    much against it, and which the most eminent in the faculty had in vain
                    endeavoured to remove), resolved to try the effects of the bow in affording
                    relief. He accordingly made it a regular exercise, and in a short time </quote>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n394/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0394-0373"/>
                <quote> derived great benefit from the use of it, and ascribed his cure, which was
                    perfect, to the practice of archery. Sir Ashton Lever, perceiving the good
                    effects which so engaging an amusement had upon the constitution, followed Mr
                    Waring’s example, and took up the bow; he was soon joined by several of his
                    friends who, in the year 1781, formed themselvee into a society, under the title
                    of the Toxophilites, and met regularly at Leicester House, having butts erected
                    in the gardens belonging to it. </quote>
                <p>That society was the parent of the numerous societies of archers known about that
                    period <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> 1790). “The enthusiasm,” says Hansard, in
                    his <hi rend="italic">Book of Archery, “</hi> can only be compared with that
                    which animated the admirers of Shakspeare and the drama generally during the
                    Garrick era.”</p>
                <p>There is now no means of ascertaining precisely the period at which the bow was
                    relinquished entirely in these kingdoms as a weapon of war. Grose informs us
                    that it was commonly used by the English soldiery for more than two centuries
                    after the introduction of fire-arms, and indeed, long subsequently to the
                    adoption of guns, the bow remained the favourite weapon of the army,—a fact
                    which is not surprising when we learn, on the authority of Neade, a celebrated
                    archer of Charles I., that the ordinary range of the bow was from 16 to 20 score
                    yards, and that so rapid was the shooting of the archers, or so slow the firing
                    of the musketeers, that an archer could shoot six arrows in the time occupied in
                    charging and discharging one musket.</p>
                <p>But although the bow has long been disused as a military weapon, it has ever been
                    cherished in Great Britain, and particularly among the upper classes of society,
                    as an instrument of delightful and healthful recreation; and it would be
                    impossible to overrate the physical and moral advantages accruing from the
                    regular practice of archery —one of the few “out-door” amusements that are as
                    suitable for delicate ladies as for strong men. “There is,” remarks Mr H. A.
                    Ford, “no exercise more healthy or more rational, or which returns more true and
                    genuine gratification to the man who practises it.” As an exercise for ladies it
                    brings all the muscles generally into healthy action, and is, in Mr Ford’s
                    opinion, admirably suited to meet the requirements of the fair sex,—“general and
                    equal, without being violent—calling the faculties, both of mind and body, into
                    gentle and healthy play, yet oppressing none—withal most elegant and
                    graceful.”</p>
                <p>Another era in the annals of the art may be dated from the year 1844, when a
                    national meeting of the archers of Great Britain and Ireland was held at York,
                    since which time archery has assumed much importance as a national pastime, and
                    year after year the wider competition which such assemblages have secured has
                    brought forward bowmen and bowwomen, who, by their persistent efforts in
                    carrying off honours, and that by the most remarkable achievements, have carried
                    the art as nearly as possible to perfection. Under the auspicee of the “Grand
                    National Society” archery has been conducted through all the stages of actual
                    revival and establishment as a favourite British pastime. Rapid progress has, in
                    every respect, marked its modern career. It was only in the year 1845 that
                    ladies began to compete publicly with men for the prizes offered at “The
                    National,” but at some of the matches, which have, without interruption,
                    annually taken place since then, as many as 130 archeresses have participated in
                    match-shooting, whilst at least an equal number of gentlemen have competed with
                    them on some occasions, with a guaranteed prize list of about £400. These
                    anniversaries have been held four times at Leamington and at Cheltenham; thrice
                    at York and at Derby; twice at Shrewsbury, at Exeter, and at Bath; once at
                    Edinburgh, Liverpool, Worcester, Oxford, the Alexandra Park (London), Clifton,
                    Norwich, Birmingham, Hereford, Brighton, and Winchester. After the establishment
                    of the Grand National meeting it was found necessary to fix an order of
                    shooting; hence the origin of “The York round,” on which all public competitions
                    by archers are now conducted, and which, for gentlemen, consists of 6 dozen
                    arrows at 100 yards, 4 dozen at 80 yards, and 2 dozen at 60 yards; and for
                    ladies, 4 dozen arrows at 60 yards, and 2 dozen at 50 yards. By this arrangement
                    archers living in various parts of the three kingdoms can ascertain their
                    relative proficiency. It is upon two days’ shooting, or the result of a “double
                    round,” that the Grand National prizes are awarded on “value” alone, as the best
                    criterion of good and central shooting. The principal of these prizes are the
                    champion’s gold medal for gentlemen, and the challenge silver bracer and brooch
                    for ladies. These much coveted honours are awarded by a majority of points only;
                    and the points for the champion’s medal are reckoned as follows :—Two for the
                    gross score, two for the gross hits, one for best score at 100 yards, and one
                    for the best hits at ditto, and the same at 80 and 60 yards—making ten points in
                    all. The ladies’ challenge bracer (presented by the West Norfolk Bowmen) is
                    awarded on the same principle, namely, for the greatest number of points—eight
                    in all. The highest score ever made by a champion was 1251, with 245 hits, at
                    Cheltenham in 1857, by Mr Horace A. Ford, the author of <hi rend="italic">The
                    Theory and Practice of Archery,</hi> who won the medal of Great Britain as many
                    as eleven times, and is, without doubt, the finest shot England has seen since
                    the days to which legends and distance lend a somewhat doubtful glory, his
                    scores being absolutely without parallel. He has now retired from public life as
                    an archer. The nearest approach to any of his victories has been made by Major
                    Hawkins Fisher, who carried off the medal in 1871 with 955, and has been
                    champion in the years 1871-72-73-74. Mr Peter Muir, the greatest archer,
                    probably, that Scotland has produced, at any rate in modern days, was the
                    champion in 1863, scoring 845. Mrs Horniblow became the possessor of the lady
                    champion’s bracer no less than ten times, and the highest score she ever made in
                    obtaining it was 764, at Leamington, in the year 1873. To this lady is due the
                    honour of having signally demonstrated that the bow really was a weapon adapted
                    to woman’s use, and capable of evidencing, in their hands, not the perfection of
                    grace only, but that of skill and talent also. To the Grand National Society, in
                    the first instance, is this great increase of skill mainly owing, but beyond
                    this, increased skill has led to increased taste and liking for the amusement,
                    till, in an ever widening circle, nearly every county of England has become
                    included within it. This has led to the establishment of other great meetings,
                    till, at the time the present article is written, besides numberless meetings of
                    private clubs, there are several public matches open to all, where formerly
                    there were none. Thus we have the Grand National itself, the Leamington and
                    Crystal Palace meetings, the Grand Western (where two handsome challenge prizes
                    reward the shooting both of the champion and championess of the west of
                    England), and a Scotch national meeting, where a champion gold medal, presented
                    by Mr T. Macfarlane of New Zealand, and exclusively confined to Scotland, is
                    annually shot for, being awarded to the successful bowman, according to the
                    rules for the champion medal of Great Britain.</p>
                <p>There are several societies of archers in the three kingdoms, but the most noted
                    of the kind now existing are the following :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The Royal Company of Archers.</hi></p>
                <p>The king’s body guard for Scotland was first constituted in its present form in
                    the year 1676, by an Act of t.ho privy council of Scotland. An earlier origin
                    has been claimed for the company, it being said by some that it was <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n395/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0395-0374"/> originally formed by the commissioners for
                    enforcing the exercise of archery appointed by James I. of Scotland, who picked
                    out the most expert bowmen in the various counties, and constituted them into a
                    body of guards to defend the king’s person, in which distinguished station they
                    displayed great devotion and bravery at the battle of Flodden, the body of the
                    king being afterwards found surrounded by those of his attached archers’ guard.
                    This, however, is mere tradition, no authentic record of their existence being
                    found until the above-mentioned year 1676, when the minutes of the Royal Company
                    begin by stating, that owing to “the noble and usefull recreation of archery
                    being for many years much neglected, several noblemen and gentlemen did
                    associate themselves in a company for encouragement thereof and did apply to the
                    privy council for their approbation, and after several meetings, did adjust and
                    concert several articles and regulations of the said company, and ,did further
                    apply to the privy council for their approbation, which was granted.” The
                    minutes of the company have been kept with great regularity from that time down
                    to the present, with the exception of a period of about twenty years at the end
                    of the 17th century, during which time there are no records. It is not supposed
                    that the company was extinct at that time from what can be gathered from the
                    succeeding minutes. It is probable, however, that during the Revolution the
                    Royal Company was principally Composed of upholders of the house of Stuart, and
                    that on this account their existence was for a time suspended. This may be true,
                    as we find that the company was subsequently a strong Jacobite body; but whether
                    it is the case or not, it is certain that the records recommence in 1703 by
                    informing us of the election of a captain-general to succeed John, second earl
                    of Argyle, who held that office from the formation of the company in 1676, and
                    who had just died. The new captain-general was Sir George Mackenzie, Viscount
                    Tarbat, afterwards created earl of Cromarty. Owing to his exertions while
                    principal secretary of state for Scotland in 1703, he procured for the company a
                    new charter from Queen Anne, renewing all their former rights and privileges,
                    and conferring others, all which were to be held of the Crown for the <hi
                    rend="italic">reddendo</hi> of a pair of barbed arrows. This <hi rend="italic"
                    >reddendo</hi> was paid to George IV. at Holyrood, when he visited Scotland in
                    1822, and to the present sovereign, Queen Victoria, on a similar occasion in
                    1842.</p>
                <p>The history of the Royal Company since 1703 has been one of great prosperity.
                    Large parades were frequently held, and were attended by numbers of archers
                    dressed in the uniform of the body, which, in the last century, consisted of a
                    green tartan coat and white knee-breeches. On such occasions the whole
                    population of Edinburgh and the surrounding districts turned out to view the
                    procession, as the company, with music and colours, marched down the Canongate
                    to Leith Links, there to shoot for a prize. Many distinguished men marched in
                    their ranks, and, both at their competitions and at the mess table, the utmost
                    hilarity and good fellowship prevailed. Several of the leading insurgents in
                    1745 were members, but the company was not at that time suspended in any way,
                    and a few years later no subjects more loyal or more attached to the
                    constitution could be found in Great Britain.</p>
                <p>In 1777 the Royal Company erected a large and handsome hall in the vicinity of
                    their shooting-ground in the Meadows, Edinburgh. They meet there periodically
                    for the transaction of business and to dine. The hall is decorated with several
                    very fine portraits of eminent members of the body, in various uniforms,
                    according to the rank which they held in the company and the time in which they
                    lived. Among them are some masterpieces of Raeburn, Watson, Gordon, Grant,
                    P.R.A., Macnee, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>In 1822, when king George IV. visited Scotland, it was thought appropriate that
                    the Royal Company should act as his Majesty’s body guard during his stay.
                    Consisting as the company did, and still does, of representatives of almost all
                    the noble families of Scotland, together with a large proportion of landed
                    gentry, professional men, and others, it was considered that no fitter body
                    could be chosen, especially as there was a tradition, as we have seen, that the
                    Royal Company had at a former period acted in a similar capacity. On the landing
                    of the king he was received by a detachment of the body, who surrounded his
                    carriage inside the cavalry escort and marched up with it to Holyrood. They
                    occupied the same position in subsequent state processions; while at the levee
                    and drawingroom held by his Majesty they lined the staircase and presence
                    chamber, performing the duties usually assigned to the band of
                    gentlemen-at-arms. When Queen Victoria visited the Scottish capital in 1842, the
                    Royal Company again did duty, and the last time they were called out in their
                    capacity of royal body guard was in 1860, on the occasion of the great volunteer
                    review in the Queen’s Park, Edinburgh.</p>
                <p>King George IV., besides authorising the company to take, in addition to their
                    former name, that of “The King’s Body Guard for Scotland,” presented to the
                    captain-general a gold stick, thus constituting the company part of the royal
                    household. In virtue of this stick the captain-general of the Royal Company
                    takes his place at a coronation or similar pageant immediately behind the gold
                    stick of England, who, with the exception of the officers on guard for the day,
                    is next the sovereign’s own person. The lieutenants-general of the company have
                    silver sticks; and the council, which is the executive body of the company,
                    possess seven ebony ones. George IV., in addition to the grant of a gold stick,
                    appointed a full dress uniform to be worn by members of the company at court,
                    when not on duty as guards, in which latter case the ordinary field dress is
                    used. The court dress was scarlet and gold, but was changed in 1831 to a green
                    coat with green velvet facings richly embroidered with gold thistles and arrows,
                    gold epaulettes, crimson silk sash, gold-laced trousers, and cocked hat with
                    green plume. The officers wear a gold sash in place of a crimson one, and an <hi
                    rend="italic">aiguillette</hi> on the left shoulder. All ranks wear swords. The
                    shooting uniform has been frequently changed. We are not told what colour the
                    coat was at the formation of the company, but there was a distinctive dress
                    introduced about that time. In 1715 a green tartan was adopted (now the 42d
                    tartan), which continued, with several modifications and alterations, to be the
                    uniform down to 1829, when it was changed to green cloth. The present field
                    dress consists of a dark green tunic with black braid facings, with a narrow
                    stripe of crimson velvet in the centre; shoulder wings and gauntleted cuffs
                    similarly trimmed; dark green trousers with black and crimson stripe; a bow-case
                    worn as a sash, of the same colour as the coat, with a centre ornament of two
                    arrows crossed saltierwise in a garter tie, surmounted by a crown; a black
                    leather waist-belt, with richly chased gold clasp; a short sword, gilt hilted,
                    made after the fashion of a Roman gladius; Balmoral bonnet, with thistle
                    ornament and eagle’s feather. The mess uniform consists of a dark green dress
                    coat with velvet collar and gilt buttons, with a crown on them, white waistcoat,
                    and black trousers.</p>
                <p>The Royal Company possess two sets of colours. The first banner was got in 1714,
                    and bears a representation of the common seal of the company, viz., a yew tree
                    <hi rend="italic">proper,</hi> supported dexter and sinister by an archer with a
                    bow in one hand and an arrow in the other. The second was procured in 1732, and
                    bears on one side a lion rampant <hi rend="italic">quleβ</hi><hi rend="italic

                    with a new stand of colours in 1832. The ono banner combines the old ones, and
                    the other has the Royal Scottish arms, with the words “King’s Body Guard for
                    Scotland.”</p>

                <p>Most of the prizes shot for by the Royal Company are held for a year by the
                    winner, and in some cases he receives a grant of money to enable him to affix a
                    silver or gold medal with his name and crest inscribed thereon to the prize. The
                    only prize which becomes the winner’s absolute property is one of «£20,
                    presented annually by her Majesty to be expended in the purchase of a piece of
                    plate. This prize was first given by the Scottish privy council at the very
                    beginning of the company. It was not, however, continued for many years, but was
                    revived by his Majesty George III. in 1788, and has since been shot for
                    regularly. The following is a list of the principal prizes shot for by the
                    company :—</p>
                <p>1. Musselburgh Silver Arrow, given by the magistrates of that town, and first
                    shot for so far back as 1603. Now the competition is confined to members of the
                    Royal Company, but at that time it was probably open to all comers. 2. Peebles
                    Silver Arrow, shot for at that town. This arrow bears medals extending back to
                    1626, but it was not shot for by the Royal Company until 1786. 3. Silver</p>
                <p>Arrow presented to the company by the magistrates of Edinburgh in 1709, and shot
                    for from that time. 4. Selkirk Silver Arrow, first shot for by the company in
                    1818, but in itself a very ancient ξrize. 5. Silver Punch Bowl and Ladle,
                    subscribed for by mem-ers in 1720, and having the. gold medal of the winner of
                    each year attached. 6. Dalhousie Sword, a richly ornamented Indian sword,
                    presented by captain-general the earl of Dalhousie, in 1833. 7. The Hopetoun
                    Royal Commemoration Prize, a handsome silver vase and gold medal, presented by
                    captain-general the earl of Hopetoun, to commemorate George IV.’s visit to
                    Scotland in 1822. 8. Spens Anniversary Medal, shot for in honour of the memory
                    of Dr Nathaniel Spens, an old and favourite member in the end of last century.
                    9. Prize given by the town of Biggar. 10. Silver Arrow, presented by the
                    magistrates of Montrose. All these prizes are shot for in the field at a
                    distance of 180 yards. There is, however,—11. St Andrew’s Cross, presented in
                    1801 by Sir George Mackenzie of Coul, Bart.; shot for at 200 yards. There are
                    two prizes shot for at 100 yards, namely, 12. A Gold Medal made out of
                    “pagodas,” being part of the money paid by Tippoo Sultan at the treaty of
                    Seringapatam, presented by Major James Spens in 1793; and 13. A Silver Bugle
                    Horn, presented in its present shape in 1830, by Sir Henry Jardine, Knt., but
                    shot for for some time previously in a less handsome form. There are three
                    prizes shot for at butts, at a circular piece of card-board four inches in
                    diameter, at a distance of 100 feet. The most ancient of these is—14. The Goose
                    Medal, or the Goose. The old mode of competing for this was by building a live
                    goose in a turf butt, the head only being exposed to view, and he who hit the
                    head and killed the goose was entitled to have her. Of course, this barbarous
                    practice has been long discontinued, though it remained till after the middle of
                    last century. In place of the goose s head, a small glass globe is put into the
                    centre of the cardboard mark on the butt, and he who breaks the globe with his
                    arrow receives a gold medal, to be worn for the ensuing year. 15. Papingo or
                    Popinjay Medal, presented in 1831, and originally competed for by shooting at a
                    stuffed bird, a parrot or popinjay, fixed to the top of * high pole. Ho who
                    brought the bird down was adjudged victor. It having been found inconvenient to
                    shoot for the prize in this P∖ <hi rend="superscript"> an</hi> * <hi

                    appointed days</p>
                <p>The affairs of the company are managed by a council of seven, who are elected by
                    the whole company annually. Although the company has a right, as a body, to
                    elect their own officers and admit new members, yet both those powers have for
                    many years been left in the hands of the council. The fees of entry to the Royal
                    Company are £25, and the entrant has also to be balloted for by the council.
                    There are several “uniform” dinners held in the course of the year, which are
                    very popular both with members and their friends. Smaller and less pretentious,
                    though not less pleasant, are the “match” dinners held once a month by the
                    shooting members, after a friendly match shot at rovers or butts. The average
                    number of members belonging to the Royal Company is between 500 and 600.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Royal Toxophilite Society</hi> is now established at the
                    Archers’ Hall, Inner Circle, Regent’s Park, London, where it has a handsome
                    building for the use of its members, and ample shooting ground. It was founded
                    in 1781 by Sir Ashton Lever, and represents the two ancient bodies, “The
                    Finsbury Archers” and “The Archers’ Company of the Honourable Artillery
                    Company,” and possesses, among other plate, the large silver shield given to the
                    Archers’ Company by Queen Catherine of Braganza (consort of Charles II. ), and
                    also silver arrows of the same and of earlier periods. The Royal Toxophilite
                    Society have occupied their present ground (about six acres in extent) since
                    1832, when they obtained possession of it from the Woods and Forests, and
                    erected on it their “Archers’ Hall.” The entire cost of the building, laying out
                    the grounds, furnishing, and finishing, amounted to £4548, 9s. 6d. The society
                    has for many years enjoyed special royal patronage. King George IV., who was
                    fond of archery, shot, when Prince of Wales, with the members in their gardens
                    at Leicester House, and on his becoming patron of the society in 1787, it
                    assumed the title of “Royal,” by which it has ever since been distinguished.
                    King William IV. was also its patron, as was the late Prince Consort. The Prince
                    of Wales is at the present time the patron of the society, of which the earl of
                    Dudley is the president.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Woodmen of Arden</hi> hold their meetings at Meriden, in
                    Warwickshire. The society was revived, after a long interval, in the year 1785.
                    The number of members is limited to 80; but the standing rules relating to the
                    election of a member were, by general consent, suspended in the case of the late
                    Sir Robert Peel. This occurred at the jubilee festival in 1835. The earl of
                    Aylesford is lord warden of the society, whose shooting grounds, which are in
                    the forest of Arden, consist of about 12 acres of land. A forest hall was
                    erected in 1844. The Woodmen, exercising a nominal, as their predecessors did a
                    real authority, over vert and venison, give appropriate designations to their
                    officers. Of these, the lord warden is chief; and they have likewise master
                    foresters and verderers. At the grand target, or annual wardmote, whoever hits
                    the gold first is styled (for the year ensuing) Master Forester; and whoever
                    gains the second gold becomes the Senior Verderer for the same period. In 1787
                    the silver bugle horn of Arden w as presented to the society by the earl of
                    Aylesford; it is never shot for at a less distance than nine score yards, which
                    may be extended to twelve score. In 1788 the countess of Aylesford presented to
                    the society the “silver arrow,” to be annually shot for at nine score yards.
                    Gold and silver medals are also presented to the master forester and senior
                    verderer; and there are the Digbean gold medal, <hi rend="italic">optime
                    merenti,</hi> the possessor of which ranks as Captain of Numbers, he having
                    gained the greatest number of prizes at the grand target; and the Digbean silver
                    medal, <hi rend="italic">bene</hi><hi rend="italic">merenti,</hi> which confers
                    the Lieutenancy of Numbers upon the member who gains the next greatest number of
                    prizes. The winners of these medals, which are shot for at 100 yards, take rank,
                    for the year thereafter, next to the senior verderer.</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Practical Archery.</hi></p>
                <p>Implements for the practice of archery are principally made in London and
                    Edinburgh, and are of various degrees of excellence. It cannot be too strongly
                    impressed upon archers that they should select their gear from a maker of
                    undoubted “good report.” In the choice of a bow preference should be given to
                    one which is under, rather than over, the strength which an archer can use
                    without difficulty. The power required to draw an ordinary bow, for a gentleman,
                    ranges from 40 to 60 tt&gt; <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> power to draw the
                    arrow to the point)—46 to 50 lb being the average power used for the “York
                    Round.” The “Royal Archers” at Edinburgh and the “Woodmen of Arden” are the only
                    clubs shooting longer distances than are recognised by “the York.” These longer
                    distances are 180, 200, and 220 yards, requiring bows of from 56 to 64 lb power.
                    Gentlemen’s bows are 5 ft. 10 in. and 6 feet long. Ladies’ bows, of course, are
                    lighter, andean be drawn by a power of from 24 to 32 lb, the length being from 5
                    ft. 3 in. to 5 ft. 6 in. Bows are made of various kinds of wood, such as
                    lancewood, snakewood, washaba, and .yew,— the last being generally preferred for
                    sweetness of material and steadiness of cast, though lance and other woods are
                    found to be more durable, much cheaper, and quite as well adapted for practice.
                    Bows are made of three pieces, two pieces, and one piece, and are called
                    three-woods, two-woods, and self. Self bows usually follow the string. Two-wood
                    and three-w’ood bows being made a little reflex, should retain their shape. It
                    is important that all bows should be preserved from damp, especially those
                    constructed of two or three pieces, as, not only does moisture affect the wood
                    and cause it to warp, but it also dissolves the glue by which the parts are
                    united, and renders the implement useless. For correct and precise shooting an
                    archer must possess himself of the best arrows he can procure. These should be
                    of a weight adapted to the power of the particular bow for which they are
                    intended, and must be alike in thickness, shape, and stiffness. The standard
                    length of an arrow used by gentlemen is 28 inches, and its weight is equal, in
                    standard silver coin, to from 4s. to 5s.; those weighing from 4s. 6d. to 4s. 9d.
                    being used with bows of from 46 B⅛ to 50 R&gt;. The lady’s arrow is 25 inches
                    long, and weighs, in silver coin, from 3s. to 3s. 6d. Arrows are manufactured
                    generally of red-pine timber, and the best are footed with a piece of hard
                    wood—usually bullet-tree—glued on one end, upon the point of which the iron pile
                    is fixed, and into the other end is inserted a wedge-shaped piece of horn,
                    called the nock, in which a notch is made for the reception of the bow-string
                    when the archer is shooting. The feathering of arrows depends in some measure
                    upon the taste of the shooter. An arrow has three feathers—now generally taken
                    from a turkey’s wing—affixed edgewise at the nock end, about an inch from the
                    end, equi-distant from each other, and parallel to the flight. The wings are
                    much shorter than they were formerly, ranging from 1∣ to 2⅜ inches in length, as
                    the shooter may desire. One feather on each arrow is of a different colour from
                    the rest, and is placed perpendicularly to the line of the nock; it is called
                    the guide-feather (or “cock-feather”), as it enables the archer more readily to
                    place the arrow on the bow-string. By using feathers of the right or left wing
                    for the same set of arrows, the natural curve of the feather is sufficient to
                    impart to the arrow in its passage through the air a rotatory motion equivalent
                    to the flight of a rifle ball. The best shaped arrow is nearly the same
                    thickness from the pile to the under end of the feathers, from which it tapers
                    off slightly to the nock. The full-shouldered, or nearly parallelshaped pile, is
                    to be preferred.</p>
                <p>In addition to his bow and arrows an archer, to be fully equipped, must have a
                    drawing-glove to protect the fingers of the right hand; an arm-guard made of
                    stout calf, morocco, or other leather, to shield the left arm from the stroke of
                    the string after the discharge of an arrow; a waist-belt in which to carry the
                    arrows when shooting, and to which are attached a green worsted tassel for the
                    removal of dirt, &amp;c., from the points of discharged arrows; and an ivory
                    grease-pot, containing grease for the drawing fingers of the glove, of which
                    there are various kinds, every archer using that which suits him best. A doeskin
                    glove, with the first three fingers tipped with smooth, firm calf or pig skin,
                    about 1∣ inch long, upon the fingers, and having a strap to buckle round the
                    wrist, is about the easiest and best for use. The flat tab covering the three
                    fingers allows them perfect freedom; but the ordinary draw-glove, with
                    cylindrical points and straps up the back of the hand and around the wrist is
                    perferred by many archers, whilst others again prefer screw tips, fitting each
                    finger separately, and with a strap on the front. Then there is the quiver,
                    which is generally made of Japanned tin. It is used to preserve the arrows from
                    damp, &amp;c., also for keeping the reserve arrows in, as only three are used
                    when shooting in company; it is never worn except when roving.</p>
                <p>Targets consist of straw basses with painted canvas faces sewed on them. The
                    “National” targets are 4 feet in diameter, and they have on their faces five
                    circles or divisions, the centre one being gold, and scoring 9; tho red scores
                    7; blue, 5; black, 3; and the white or outer circle, 1. These targets are placed
                    on stands constructed of three ribs of iron jointed at the top; the two side
                    ribs have spikes on the front edge on which the targets rest; the centre rib is
                    thrown behind, as a spur to support the triangle. There should always be a pair
                    of targets provided by an archer in practising, in order to save time and
                    trouble; and a young archer has always been advised to practise at a short
                    distance, and to lengthen it as he progresses—commencing at 20 yards, till he is
                    able to hit the smallest mark, which will prove that he has attained command
                    over his bow.</p>
                <p>To enable an archer to keep a record of his shooting the following scoring-card
                    will be found useful (the marks may be made with the point of a pin or pencil)

                <p>There is no “royal road to archery, and more real progress towards proficiency in
                    the bow may be gained in a few hours under the practical guidance of an adept in
                    the art, than can possibly be imparted by all the treatises upon the subject
                    that ever were written; yet, for thoso who would master the rudiments of the
                    science, a few words may be useful upon what have ever been considered the “five
                    points of archery,” which Ascham in his celebrated work describes as “standing,
                    nocking, drawing, holding, and loosing.”</p>
                <p>1. Roberts, in his <hi rend="italic">English Bowman,</hi> remarks upon the
                    difficulty of conveying by verbal description so accurato a representation as
                    the pencil can give of an archer drawing his bow. It is a model of gracefulness,
                    tho attainment of which is so pointedly recommended by Ascham. Mr Ford in his
                    disquisition, says the “heels <pb break="no"

                    feet must be flat and firm on the ground, both equally inclining outwards from
                    the heels, the position of the feet being such that a straight line drawn from
                    it would intersect both heels The kneee must be perfectly straight, not bent in
                    the slightest degree</p>
                <p>The weight of the body should be thrown equally on both legs In short, the
                    footing must be firm, yet at the same time easy and springy, and the more
                    natural it is the more likely it is to possess these qualities.” The
                    accompanying woodcut will best illustrate the attitude which an archer should
                    assume.</p>
                <p>2. To string a bow, take it by the handle in the left hand, with the flat side
                    (or back) towards the wrist; place the horn of the under end in the hollow of
                    the left foot; then put the palm of the right hand on the back of the upper end
                    of the bow, below the loop of the string, with the thumb on the one side, and
                    the forefinger <hi rend="italic">I) ent</hi> on the other side of the bow, and
                    with the left hand fixed as the fulcrum. Then with the right hand press the
                    string upwards until it reaches the notch in the horn, and the bow is strung,
                    and should exhibit a space of about 5 j inches between the string and the
                    interior of the handle.</p>

                    point of view, in alluding to the stringing of the bow, remarks :—‘ Whilst the
                    right wrist is pressing the bow downwards the other hand should be pulling your
                    bow towards you, each hand with equal pressure, each hand with equal strength.
                    At the same moment that you press and pull, you must use your first two fingers
                    (of course of the right hand) in slipping the string into the groove intended
                    for its reception.’ Another mode is recommended, and we are told ‘ to press the
                    thumb and forefinger closely against the sides of the bow, whilst you pull
                    smartly at the handle.’ This, I believe, is the accepted method among gentlemen;
                    but a lady has not often sufficient power in her thumb and forefinger to bend
                    the bow and stringit at the same moment; besides this, the pressing of the bow
                    with the wrist is far more graceful for a lady. The same remark and advice apply
                    to the unstringing of the bow, only that the string has to be slipped <hi
                    rend="italic">out</hi> of the groove. If you find,after some halfdozen attempts
                    that this method of stringing strains neither the right nor left wrist, you may
                    safely conclude that your bow is suited to your strength.”</p>
                <p>3. The bow being now ready to receive the arrow, the archer must “nock,” or place
                    it on the string at a spot prepared for it (which should be about ⅞ths of an
                    inch above the upper end of the handle) with the guide feather furthest from the
                    bow, catching the string with two or three fingers, and the arrow between the
                    first and second.</p>
                <p>4. He must then take a firm position with his left shoulder towards the target,
                    turning his head only from his neck, and looking over his left shoulder. He must
                    then raise the bow with his left hand, keeping the upper end inclined one or two
                    degrees from his body, and with his right hand draw the arrow to the level of
                    his chin, and below his ear, to which point the arrow should always be drawn
                    while the left hand and arm should be elevated or depressed, according to the
                    distance to be shot, or the strength of the bow.</p>
                <p>5. When the arrow is fully drawn, dwell for a moment or two to steady the aim;
                    then “quit” or discharge the arrow, by allowing the string to pass smoothly over
                    the finger points without jerking. The position which a lady should assume
                    whilst in the act of discharging her arrow is illustrated by the annexed figure,
                    the correctness of which might have been increased by the elbow of the left arm,
                    in which there should not be the slightest bend, being held straighter.</p>
                <p>Except for line there is no accepted theory of taking aim. Due regard must be
                    paid to the weather. When it is calm, the archer must fix the position of the
                    target in his vision, and experience will soon tell him how to find the line and
                    degrees of elevation. In wind, the line and degrees must be varied to suit the
                    conditions of the atmosphere; in a cross wind there must be an adaptation to the
                    direction of the wind; whilst in an up and down wind more or less elevation must
                    be taken according to the strength of the current.</p>
                <p>The following is a summary of points well worthy of being remembered by every
                    shooter:—Have the string straight on your bow. <hi rend="italic">Always</hi>
                    nock on the same place. Place the arrow <hi rend="italic">over</hi> the string,
                    not between it or the bow. Do not have the arrow too tight on the string. Draw
                    slowly and evenly. Turn your elbow a little upwards. Slant the bow a little to
                    the right. Always draw the arrow the same length. Draw a little below the right
                    side of the chin. Always, while drawing, keep the elbow of your right arm level
                    with the shoulder. Keep the “point of aim” always <hi rend="italic"
                    >directly</hi> in view. Look along the <hi rend="italic">τchole length</hi> of
                    the arrow. Be careful to point it perfectly straight. Do not shut the left eye;
                    yet do not aim with it. Make the <hi rend="italic">left</hi> arm always that by
                    which you change the elevation. Do not hold the bow long <hi rend="italic"
                    >fully</hi> drawn. Never let the fingers of your right hand follow the string.
                    Do not jerk, but loose smoothly. Be certain that your bow-arm does not move when
                    loosing.</p>
                <p>“Flight” and “clout” shooting has ceased, and “roving” is now practised only in
                    Britain by the two clubs previously mentioned. They use a target 3 feet in
                    diamater, and count arrows four bow lengths from the target; the nearest arrow
                    counts two. Shooting at butts is still practised, the butts being from 80 to 100
                    feet apart; the <pb break="no"
