                <p><label type="entry">ANTALCIDAS</label>, a Spartan politician, who rendered
                    conspicuous service to his native state at one of the turning-points in Greek
                    history. He comes first into notice as ambassador from Sparta to Tiribazus, the
                    Persian satrap of Ionia, to sue for peace (393-2 B.c.) Upon hearing of this the
                    Athenians, becoming anxious lest they should lose their growing ascendency, also
                    sent an embassy, at the head of which was Conon, to counteract the efforts·of
                    the Spartans. Tiribazus favoured the cause of Sparta, and secretly supplied
                    Antalcidas with the means of carrying on war against Athens. Artaxerxes,
                    however, disapproving the conduct of his satrap, recalled him, and appointed
                    Struthas, whose sympathies were on the side of Athens, in his place. But this
                    check to the policy of Antalcidas was only temporary. In a few years
                    circumstances became even more favourable than at first to a successful
                    negotiation, Tiribazus having been restored to his satrapy, and accordingly, in
                    388-7, Antalcidas was again sent upon an embassy to Asia. By skilful diplomacy
                    he succeeded in securing the active assistance of the Persian power against
                    Athens. Appointed on his return admiral of the Spartan fleet, he carried on a
                    naval warfare in a manner so vigorous, that the Athenians were glad to accept
                    peace on the terms Artaxerxes chose to dictate. These were made known by
                    Tiribazus to a congress of deputies from Sparta, Argos, and Athens, and formed
                    the basis of “the peace of Antalcidas,” so called from its being arranged in
                    accordance with the views of the Spartan ambassador. Antalcidas seems to have
                    been engaged in another mission to Persia in 371; but the later incidents of his
                    career are involved in uncertainty. Plutarch states that he committed suicide on
                    the failure of his last mission, but there seems no proof of this.</p>
