                <p><label type="entry">ARTESIAN WELLS</label>, the name applied to water-springs
                    rising above the surface of the ground by natural hydrostatic pressure, on
                    boring a small hole down through a series of strata to a water-carrying bed
                    enclosed between two impervious layers. In Europe this mode of well-boring was
                    first practised in the French province of Artois, whence the name Artesian is
                    derived. At Aire, in that province, there is a well from which the water has
                    continued steadily to flow to a height of 11 feet above the ground for more than
                    a century; and there is, within the old Carthusian convent at Lillers, another
                    which dates from the 12th century, and which still flows. But unmistakable
                    traces of much more ancient bored springs appear in Lombardy, in Asia Minor, in
                    Persia, in China, in Egypt, in Algeria, and even in the great desert of
                    Sahara.</p>
                <p>In ordinary wells the water does not rise, but remains at the bottom of the
                    trough dug for it in the soil, and to raise it we must use special apparatus or
                    pumps. In Artesian wells, on the other hand, the water rises from a considerable
                    depth to the surface of the ground, and usually spouts up to a greater or less
                    height above it. The theoretical explanation of the phenomenon is easily
                    understood.</p>
                <p>The secondary and tertiary geological formations, such as those underneath London
                    and Paris, often present the appearance of immense basins, the boundary or rim
                    of the basin having been formed by an upheaval of the subjacent strata. In these
                    formations it often happens that a porous stratum, consisting of sand,
                    sandstone, chalk, or other calcareous matter, is included between two
                    impermeable layers of clay, so as to form a flat porous U tube, continuous from
                    side to side of the valley, the outcrop on the surrounding hills forming the
                    mouth of the tube. The rain filtering down through the porous layer to the
                    bottom of the basin forms there a subterranean pool, which with the liquid or
                    semi-liquid column pressing upon it constitutes a sort of huge natural
                    hydrostatic bellows. Sometimes the pressure on the superincumbent crust is so
                    great as to <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0706-0645"/> cause an upheaval or disturbance of the valley,
                    and there can be little doubt that many earthquakes, that are manifestly not of
                    volcanic origin, are due to this simple cause.</p>
                <p>It is obvious, then, that when a hole is bored down through the upper impermeable
                    layer to the surface of the lake, the water will be forced up by the natural law
                    of water seeking its level, to a height above the surface of the valley greater
                    or less according to the elevation of the level in the feeding column, thus
                    forming a natural fountain on precisely the same principle as that of most
                    artificial fountains, where the water supply comes from a considerable height
                    above the jet.</p>
                <p>In the Tertiary formations, the porous layers are not so thick as in the
                    Secondary, and consequently the occurrence of underground lakes is not on so
                    grand a scale; but there being a more frequent alternation of these sandy beds,
                    we find a greater number of them, and often a series of natural fountains may be
                    obtained in the same valley, proceeding from water-bearing strata at different
                    depths, and rising to different heights.</p>
                <p>It does not follow that all the essentials for an Artesian well are present,
                    though two impermeable strata with a porous one between may crop out round a
                    basin. There must be, in the first place, <hi rend="italic">continuity</hi> of
                    the permeable bed for the uninterrupted passage of the water; and there must be,
                    on the other hand, no flaw or breach in either of the confining layers by which
                    the water might escape. To one or other of these causes is due the failure of
                    many attempts to find Artesian wells where from appearances they might be
                    expected. It has occasionally happened that on deepening the bore, with the hope
                    of increasing the flow of water, it has ceased altogether, doubtless from the
                    lower confining layer being pierced, and the water allowed to escape by another
                    outlet. The subterranean pool is frequently of small extent, and of the nature
                    of a channel rather than of a broad sheet of water; and the existence of one
                    spring is no guarantee that another will be found by merely boring to the same
                    depth in its neighbourhood. Several such failures are recorded by Arago in his
                    notices on Artesian wells in the <hi rend="italic">Annuaire</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">du Bur. des Long.</hi> (1835, &lt;fcc.), and referred by him to
                    the circulation of the subterranean waters in irregular trenches between
                    impermeable masses. The preliminary theoretical determination of the existence
                    of these Artesian conditions is in itself a difficult matter, and can be arrived
                    at only by a thorough acquaintance with the geological disposition of the
                    district. Still more difficult, as can readily be imagined, is the practical
                    execution of the boring of a hole of a few inches diameter to the depth of
                    hundreds of feet. The keeping of the bore quite vertical, the ready elevation of
                    the loosened rubbish, the prevention of the breakage of the boring rods at great
                    depths, are some of the difficulties that beset the operation, and have tried
                    the ingenuity of engineers.</p>
                <p>The mechanical appliances employed in boring deep wells are not essentially
                    different from those used in the sinking of mining shafts; and it may be
                    remarked that the expense and tediousness of Artesian boring at the beginning of
                    this century are to be ascribed not so much to the want of steam engines, as to
                    the awkward mode of using the boring tool. In the old method a continuous boring
                    bar was made use of, the steel boring tool or chisel being fixed to iron rods,
                    which were screwed together in lengths of 10 to 15 feet. This, with a strong
                    cross handle at the top, formed*a sort of large gimlet, and was turned by two
                    men, the tool being raised and suddenly dropped, as required, by a third man at
                    the end of a lever, which was connected by a rope or chain w ith the
                    gimlet-head. Most of the accidents, w hich formerly rendered well-sinking a
                    hazardous task, were due to breakages of the borer or boring bar by the sudden
                    fall which it was necessary to give the too in pecking through a hard stratum.
                    The modern mode of boring is but an adaptation of steam power to a simple method
                    practised for ages by the Chinese. They bore their deep wells by a steel head
                    worked up and down by means of a cord suspended from a lever—a wooden pipe being
                    used to guide the borer and keep the hole perfectly vertical. Free falling
                    tools, worked by steam power, are now employed when bore-holes of large diameter
                    have to be executed, the weight of the tool giving sufficient percussion to
                    pierce the hardest rock. In the enormous Artesian boring, of 5⅜ feet diameter,
                    begun, in 1866, at La Chapelle, in Paris, a boring tool of about 4 tons weight
                    was employed. It was raised by steam power, and allowed to fall freely from
                    twenty to twenty-five times a minute, a twist of - <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>
                    ⅛th of a turn being given after each stroke. (See <hi rend="italic"
                    >Engineering,</hi> vol. viii. pp. 401, 413.) The borer is withdrawn at
                    intervals, and the rubbish removed by means of a cylindrical augur with a valve
                    at the bottom. Permanent pipes of cast or wrought iron must be fixed in the
                    bore-hole to keep it open; and if the operations are through clay or sand, the
                    pipes must follow the progress of the chisel as closely as possible.</p>
                <p>One of the most remarkable examples of the patience and skill required to
                    surmount the difficulties of deep boring is the Artesian well at Grenelle, in
                    the vicinity of Paris. The operation of boring extended from 1834 to 1841; after
                    a depth of 1254 feet had been reached (May 1837), a length of 270 feet of the
                    boring rods suddenly broke off and fell to the bottom of the hole, and nearly
                    fifteen months’ constant labour was required to pick it up again. Discouraged by
                    the delay, the French Government was to have abandoned the project after a depth
                    of 1500 feet had been reached without any satisfactory result; but the urgent
                    representations of Arago prevailed on them to prosecute the work. And it was
                    fortunate, for an additional depth of about 300 feet proved the correctness of
                    Arago’s theory. On the 26th February 1841, at a depth of 1798 feet, the boring
                    rods suddenly sank a few yards. The subterranean water-bearing stratum had been
                    reached, and within a few hours a vast column of water spouted up at the rate of
                    600 gallons per minute, and at a temperature of nearly 82° Fahr., furnishing a
                    valuable source of supply for a suburb of Paris where it was greatly wanted.
                    Prior to this no Artesian boring had reached even 1C00 feet; and that of
                    Grenelle waβ the deepest executed till the completion (12th August 1850) of the
                    salt-spring at Kissingen, in Bavaria, which throws up a column of water to the
                    height of 58 feet from a depth of 1878⅜ feet. The most remarkable feature of
                    this spring is that the projecting force is due, not to hydrostatic pressure,
                    but to that of carbonic acid gas generated at the junction of the gypsum with
                    the magnesian limestone, about 1680 feet down. Modern mechanical improvements
                    have enabled engineers to exceed these Artesian dimensions considerably, and at
                    a greatly diminished cost. The well at Passy, near Paris, which is supplied from
                    the same waterbearing stratum as that of Grenelle, was bored by the Saxon
                    engineer Kind in a very short time, having been begun on 15th September 1855,
                    and carried to a depth of over 1700 feet by March 1857. Its total depth is now
                    about 1923 feet, with the enormous diameter of 2 feet 4 inches at the bottom;
                    and it throws up a continuous stream of water at the rate of 5,582,000 gallons
                    per day to a height of 54 feet above the ground. Among other deep wells sunk in
                    the Paris basin subsequently to those of Grenelle and Passy, the following may
                    be mentioned. A gigantic bore, 5 feet 7 inches in diameter, was begun in January
                    1866 at La Chapelle, and by November 1869 had reached a depth of 1811 feet, the
                    intention of the engineers being to extend it to a depth of 2950 feet. The
                    mechanical processes employed are detailed in pp. 401 and 413 of vol. viii.
                    (1869) <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n707/mode/1up"

                    19 inches diameter was carried down to a depth of 1570 feet in about two and a
                    half years (1864-7), for the purpose of obtaining a water supply for the sugar
                    refinery of Μ. Say in Paris; and the same engineer who executed this work (Μ.
                    Dru), began in 1866 an Artesian boring of the huge diameter of 6∣ feet at the
                    part of Paris named <hi rend="italic">Butte</hi><hi rend="italic">aux
                    Cailles,</hi> to be carried down to a depth of 2600 to 2900 feet. (See <hi
                    rend="italic">Engineering,</hi> vol. iii. p. 605.) Besides these monster wells,
                    there are in the Paris basin a great many others, varying from 300 to 400 feet
                    in depth, and from 2 to 8 inches in the diameter of the bore-hole.</p>
                <p>The Tertiary chalk strata over which London stands have been riddled with
                    Artesian borings for the sake of pure water supply. The source of the New River
                    (which was opened in 1613) is one of the chalk springs, at Chadwell, near Ware;
                    this alone yields London a twenty-fourth part of its water supply, some 4 J
                    million gallons a day. Many of the large London breweries obtain the water
                    employed in the manufacture of their beer from Artesian wells over 300 feet
                    deep. The Kentish Town water-works have a well 900 feet deep, which penetrates
                    the chalk bed some 580 feet. Artesian wells also supply water to the Bank of
                    England, the fountains at Trafalgar Square, the Mint, Pentonville Prison, Colney
                    Hatch Asylum, Shoreditch Workhouse, the North Western Railway Station, Holloway
                    Prison, &amp;c. On the duke of Northumberland’s property at Sion House there is
                    a chalk well which descends 620 feet, and spouts the water up about 4 feet above
                    the surface. At Merton ⅛ Surrey, at Brighton, at Southampton, all along the east
                    coast of Lincolnshire, and in the low district between the chalk wolds near
                    Louth and the Wash, Artesian borings have long been known, and go by the name of
                    <hi rend="italic">blow-wells</hi> among the people of the district. It is worthy
                    of notice that the general level to which the water rises in the London district
                    has been very sensibly lowered by the immense number of perforations that have
                    been made; and in several wells where the water formerly rose to the surface, it
                    now stands considerably below it, and requires to be pumped up.</p>
                <p>None of the Artesian borings in England approach the depths frequent on the
                    Continent and in America. The average depth of the water-bearing stratum around
                    Paris is six times that of the London chalk beds; and in some parts of Germany
                    and of America, wells have been sunk to even double the depth of the Parisian
                    wells of Grenelle and Passy. At Chicago there are two wells, one 700 feet and
                    the other 1000 feet deep, with a diameter of 5 inches, which supply the city
                    with 800,000 gallons of water daily. At the town of St Louis, in the State of
                    Missouri, an Artesian boring was carried down for 3147 feet, but as only brine
                    was obtained, it was ordered by Government to be stopped in September 1868, when
                    the depth was approaching three-quarters of a mile. The deepest boring in the
                    world is at Sperenberg, twenty miles from Berlin, having been sunk for the
                    purpose of obtaining a supply of rock salt. A bore-hole of 16 feet diameter was
                    carried down to the depth of 280 feet, where the salt bed began; after a further
                    descent of 680 feet was attained, the bore was reduced to 13 inches diameter,
                    and then continued till the extraordinary depth of 4194 feet was reached,
                    without having pierced through the salt deposit, which has thus the enormous
                    thickness of at least 3907 feet.</p>
                <p>The following are some of the other most important Artesian sinkings that have
                    been made. At Louisville, in Kentucky, a bore of 3 inches was carried to a depth
                    of 2086 feet between April 1857 and the summer of 1858, when a supply of water
                    almost as plentiful as that of Grenelle was obtained. At Charleston, South
                    Carolina, there is a well 1250 feet deep, which was begun in 1848, and which
                    discharges water some 10 feet above the surface at the rate of 1200 gallons an
                    hour. In 1858 a well at Neusalwerk, near Minden, had reached the depth of 2288
                    feet. At Bourne, Lincolnshire, there is a well 95 feet deep, which yields over
                    half a million gallons of water per day, the pressure being sufficient to supply
                    the town and force the water to the tops of the highest houses. There is one, on
                    the property of the Continental Hotel, in Philadelphia, over 200 feet deep, and
                    8 inches in diameter, which yields 50,000 gallons a day. Two Artesian wells at
                    Croydon supply a million gallons of water per day; and Brighton draws over a
                    million gallons from Artesian sinkings. There is a well at Bages, near
                    Perpignan, which gives 330 gallons per minute; and one at Tours, which jets
                    about 6 feet above ground, and gives 237 gallons per minute.</p>
                <p>The boring of wells in the great-desert of Sahara is a very ancient industry; and
                    some oases are supplied with water wholly from Artesian wells. The average depth
                    of these is from 160 to 200 feet, and the upper strata have only to be pierced
                    to give a constant stream. With their primitive methods of boring, the Arabs
                    often labour for years before they reach the wished-for pool; and with only palm
                    wood as a casing, they have great difficulty in keeping the bore-hole from
                    closing up by the drifting of the sand, and they require to scour them out
                    periodically. Since 1858 an immense number of perforations have been made by
                    French engineers, and the fertilising effect upon the sandy desert plains is
                    already making itself apparent. Villages are built and palm trees are growing
                    where formerly there was but waste and solitude. (See <hi rend="italic"
                    >Geological Magazine,</hi> vol. i. p. 31.) The importance of deep wells in such
                    cases cannot be over-estimated.</p>
                <p>Artesian wells have been made to supply warm water, for keeping hospitals,
                    &lt;fcc., at a constant temperature. Invariably the temperature of water from
                    great depths is higher than that at the surface, this being due to some unknown
                    source of heat in the interior of the globe. The temperature of the water in the
                    well at Grenelle is 82° Fahr., and that of Passy the same, showing that they
                    have a common source. Kissingen well has a temperature of 66° Fahr., that of St
                    Louis one of 73 <hi rend="superscript"> 0,</hi> 4 Fahr., that of Louisville 76⅛
                    <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi> Fahr., and that of Charleston 87° Fahr. The
                    average rate of increase of temperature is 1° for a descent of from 40 to 55
                    feet. In Würtemberg the water of Artesian wells is employed to maintain in large
