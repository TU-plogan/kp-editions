                <p><label type="entry">ARBITRAGE</label> (from the French <hi rend="italic"
                    >arbitrer,</hi> in the secondary sense of comparing and settling accounts,
                    derived in its turn from the primary sense of arbitrating disputes), is a term
                    that is applied both to a calculation and to a trade: 1st, To the calculation of
                    the relative simultaneous values at any particular moment of any particular
                    merchandise, on <hi rend="italic">one</hi> market, in terms of the quotations on
                    one or more <hi rend="italic">other</hi> markets, taking, of course, the
                    exchanges into account; and 2d, To the business founded on such calculations, of
                    buying (or <hi rend="italic">vice versa)</hi> wholesale in the cheapest market
                    for the time being, and simultaneously reselling (or <hi rend="italic">vice
                    versa)</hi> equal amounts in the dearest market, or if not simultaneously, at
                    least as nearly simultaneously as post and telegraph will permit. Arbitrage
                    proper is a separate, distinct, and well-defined business, with three main
                    branches. Two of these, viz., arbitrage or arbitration in bullion and coins, and
                    arbitration in bills, also called the arbitration of exchanges, fall within the
                    businesses of bullion dealing and banking respectively. The third, arbitrage in
                    stocks and shares, is arbitrage properly so called, and so understood, whenever
                    the word is mentioned without qualification among business men, and it is
                    strictly a Stock Exchange business. A few of the great financial firms outside
                    the Stock Exchange combine the three arbitrations; they are dealers in bullion,
                    in bills, and in stocks and shares all over the world; but, as a rule, the
                    arbitrage properly known as such, is the business of an arbitrageur, who is
                    almost always a member of a Stock Exchange or “Bourse,” and his arbitrations
                    with very few exceptions are neither in bullion nor in bills, but in Government
                    and other stocks and shares. In this strict and accurate sense, arbitrage may be
                    defined to be a traffic, consisting in the purchase (or sale) on one Stock
                    Exchange, and simultaneous or nearly simultaneous, re-sale (or re-purchase) on
                    another Stock Exchange, of the same amount in the same stocks or shares, which
                    at any moment are found, on telegraphic or other advices, to be quoted and
                    negotiable on two or more markets at a difference in price (arising from
                    whatever temporary cause), sufficient to cover the cost of transmission,
                    commission, interest, insurance, and leave an adequate profit over and above to
                    be divided by the operators at both ends. The benefit to the various communities
                    at large resulting from the operations of the arbitrageur consists—first, in the
                    general and constant process of equalisation, equilibration, and the consequent
                    stability in the prices of a large number of stocks and shares, and of an
                    enormous amount of capital throughout the world; and second, in the greater
                    inducement thus afforded for the economy of idle capital, by means of temporary
                    investment in interest-bearing securities with a minimised risk of fluctuation.
                    The great Government loans are, in the first instance, the natural
                    subject-matter of arbitrage; and then, in a minor degree, a variety of other
                    securities. British Consols, however, form one great exception to the rule,
                    inasmuch as, from one cause or another (but mainly because they are almost
                    entirely held in <hi rend="italic">one</hi> country), no arbitrage business is
                    done in these Consols, notwithstanding that they can be now dealt in “To
                    Bearer.” On the other hand, there is an enormous arbitrage business in the new
                    French Five per cents., which, with the United States “Five-Twenties,” covering
                    between them a round <hi rend="italic">five hundred millions sterling,</hi>
                    probably stand first in the present list of arbitrage stocks. Indeed, but for
                    the system of arbitrage, it is not easy to see how the great French loans of
                    1871-72 could have been carried at all without convulsing the financial world.
                    Arbitrage, however, by making the new security universally negotiable, enabled
                    all the great bankers and capitalists of the world—European, American, and East
                    Indian—to join hands simultaneously in concluding an operation gigantic even for
                    modern times. Next to “French Fives” and “U. S. Five-Twenties,” on the
                    arbitrageur’s list would come, in various order, according to the men and the
                    circumstances, “Turkish,” “Egyptian,” “Italian,” “Spanish” “Russian,” some South
                    American stocks, and to a very considerable extent, the shares and obligations
                    of the great Lombardo-Venetian Railways. And these stocks, if we add some East
                    Indian securities, cover perhaps the widest area of international arbitrage. But
                    a vast variety of minor securities constitute financial <hi rend="italic"
                    >flora,</hi> so to speak, with minor and local areas of distribution, known only
                    to particular localities, or to financial specialists. It has been stated above
                    that some great financial houses do each kind of arbitration themselves.
                    Similarly, one or two great firms of arbitrageurs do their own bill-broking; but
                    although arbitrage business is carried on by a considerable number of the
                    leading Stock Exchange firms, there are perhaps only two that arbitrate their
                    own bills—this arising from certain regulations that were passed by the London
                    Stock Exchange in 1829 not having a retrospective effect. With these exceptions,
                    the arbitrageurs do not undertake the banking part of the business themselves,
                    but pay their bankers a margin to do it for them. The details of the system of
                    arbitrage, and all the combinations with other business that may arise,
                    constitute a special profession.</p>
                <p>The literature of the subject is extremely meagre. Mr Goschen’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Theory of Foreign Exchanges,</hi> London, 1866, is general and theoretical, but
                    throws great light upon particular aspects of the philosophy of arbitrage,
                    without touching specially on the details of the subject itself. The principal
                    other works are—Kelly’s <hi rend="italic">Cambist,</hi> 1811, 1835; Otto
