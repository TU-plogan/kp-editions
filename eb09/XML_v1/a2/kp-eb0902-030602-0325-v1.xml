                <p><label type="entry">ARAM, <hi rend="smallcaps">Eugene</hi></label>, was born of
                    humble parents at Rams-gill in Yorkshire, in 1704. He received little education
                    at school, but manifested an intense desire for learning. While still young, he
                    married and settled as a schoolmaster at Netherdale, and during the years he
                    spent there, he taught himself both Latin and Greek. In 1734 he removed to
                    Knaresborough, where he remained as schoolmaster till 1745. In that year a man
                    named Daniel Clark, an inti mate friend of Aram, after obtaining a considerable
                    quantity of goods from some of the tradesmen in the town, suddenly disappeared.
                    Suspicions of being concerned in this swindling transaction fell upon Aram. His
                    garden was searched, and some of the goods found there. As, however, there was
                    not evidence sufficient to convict him of any crime, he was discharged, and soon
                    after set out for London, leaving his wife behind. For several years he
                    travelled through parts of England, acting as usher in a number of schools, and
                    settled finally at Lynn, in Norfolk. During his travels he had amassed
                    considerable materials for a work he had projected on etymology, to be entitled,
                    a <hi rend="italic">Comparative Lexicon of the English, Latin, Greek, Hebrew,
                    and Celtic Languages.</hi> In February 1759 a skeleton was dug up at
                    Knaresborough, and some suspicion arose that it might be Clark’s. Aram’s wife
                    had more than once hinted that her husband and a man named Houseman knew the
                    secret of Clark’s disappearance. Houseman was at once arrested and confronted
                    with the bones that had been found. He affirmed his innocence, and, taking up
                    one of the bones, said “This is no more Dan Clark’s bone than it is mine.” His
                    manner in saying this roused suspicion that he knew more of Clark’s
                    disappearance than he was willing to admit. He was again examined, and confessed
                    that he had been present at the murder of Clark by Aram and another man, Terry,
                    of whom nothing further is heard. He also gave information as to the place where
                    the body had been buried in St Robert’s Cave, a well-known spot near
                    Knaresborough. A skeleton was dug up here, and Aram was immediately arrested,
                    and sent to York for trial. Houseman was admitted as evidence against him. Aram
                    conducted his own defence, and did not attempt to overthrow Houseman’s evidence,
                    although there were some discrepancies in that; but made a skilful attack on the
                    fallibility of circumstantial evidence in general, and particularly<pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0326-0307"/> of evidence drawn from the discovery of bones. He
                    brought forward several instances where bones had been found in caves, and tried
                    to show that the bones found in St Robert’s Cave were probably those of some
                    hermit who had taken up his abode there. He was found guilty, and condemned to
                    be executed on the 6th August, three days after his trial. While in his cell he
                    confessed his guilt, and threw some light on the motives for his crime, by
                    asserting that he had discovered a criminal intimacy between Clark and his own
                    wife. On the night before the 6th August he attempted to commit suicide by
                    opening the veins in his arm; but he was discovered before life was extinct, and
                    suffered the last penalty of the law. The story of Eugene Aram has been made the
                    subject of a powerful ballad by Hood, <hi rend="italic">The Eream of Eugene
