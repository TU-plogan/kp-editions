                    of a man’s person, for the purpose of compelling him to be obedient to the law,
                    and is defined to be the execution of the command of some court of record or
                    officer of justice.</p>
                <p>Arrests are either in civil or in criminal cases.</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="italic">In Civil Cases.—</hi> The arrest must be by virtue of a
                    precept or order out of some court, and must be effected by corporal seizing or
                    touching the defendant’s body, or as directed by the writ, <hi rend="italic"

                    may then justify the breaking open of the house in which he is, to carry him
                    away.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Arrests on mesne process,</hi> before judgment obtained, are
                    abolished by 32 and 33 Vict. c. 62, § 6; an exception, however, is made in cases
                    in which the plaintiff proves, at any time before final judgment, by evidence on
                    oath to the satisfaction of a judge of one of the superior courts, that he has a
                    good cause of action to the amount of £50, that the defendant is about to quit
                    the country, and that his absence will materially prejudice the plaintiff in
                    prosecuting his action. In such cases an order for arrest may be obtained till
                    security to the amount of the claim be found.</p>
                <p>Until a recent period a judgment creditor might arrest his debtor under a writ of
                    <hi rend="italic">capias ad satisfaciendum,</hi> but since 32 and 33 Vict. c. 62
                    (the Debtor’s Act, 1869), imprisonment for debt has been abolished in England,
                    except in certain cases, and in these the period of detention must not exceed
                    one year.</p>
                <p>The following persons are privileged from arrest, viz., lsZ, Members of the Royal
                    Family and the ordinary servants of the king or queen regnant, chaplains, lords
                    of the bedchamber, &amp;c. This privilege does not extend to servants of a queen
                    consort or dowager. <hi rend="italic">2d,</hi> Peers of the realm, peeresses by
                    birth, creation, or marriage, Scotch and Irish peers and peeresses. <hi
                    rend="italic">3d,</hi> Members of the House of Commons during the session of
                    Parliament, and for a <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n691/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0691-0630"/> convenient time (forty days) before and after it.
                    Members of Convocation appear to have the same privilege, <hi rend="italic"
                    >⅛th,</hi> Foreign ambassadors and their “domestics and domestic servants.”
                    Temporary privilege from arrest is enjoyed by barristers travelling on circuit,
                    by parties, witnesses, or attorneys connected with a cause, and by clergymen
                    whilst performing divine service.</p>
                <p>The arrest of any privileged person is irregular <hi rend="italic">ab</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">initio,</hi> and the party may be discharged on motion. The only
                    exception is as to indictable crimes, such as “treason, felony, and breach of
                    the peace.”</p>
                <p>There are no longer any places where persons are privileged from arrest, such as
                    the Mint, Savoy, Whitefriars, &lt;fcc., on the ground of their being ancient
                    palaces; but near the Palace of Holyrood, Edinburgh, a sanctuary still exists
                    for the benefit of debtors, who resort there for such protection, and take
                    lodgings within the precincts.</p>
                <p>Except in cases of treason, felony, or breach of the peace, an arrest cannot be
                    made on a Sunday, and if made it is void (29 Car. II. c. 7); but it may be made
                    in the night as well as in the day.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="italic">In Criminal Cases.—</hi> All persons whatsoever are,
                    without distinction, equally liable to this arrest, and any man may arrest
                    without warrant or precept, and outer doors may be broken open for that purpose.
                    The arrest may be made,—l <hi rend="italic">st</hi>, by warrant; 2 <hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi>, by an officer without warrant; 3 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>,
                    by a private person without warrant; or, 4 <hi rend="italic">th,</hi> by a hue
                    and cry.</p>
                <p>1. Warrants are ordinarily granted by justices of the peace on information or
                    complaint in writing and upon oath, and <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> they must
                    be indorsed when it is intended they should be executed in another county (see
                    11 and 12 Vict. c. 42). They are also granted in cases of treason or other
                    offence affecting the Government by the Privy Council, or one of the secretaries
                    of state, and also by the chief or other justice of the court of Queen’s bench
                    in cases of felony, misdemeanour, or indictment found, or criminal information
                    granted in that court. Every warrant ought to specify the offence charged, the
                    authority under which the arrest is to be made, the person who is to execute it,
                    and the person who is to be arrested.</p>
                <p>2. The officers who may arrest without warrant are,—justices of the peace, for
                    felony or breach of the peace committed in their presence; the sheriff and the
                    coroner in their county, for felony; constables, for treason, felony, or breach
                    of the peace committed in their view,—and within the metropolitan police
                    district they have even larger powers; and watchmen from sunset to sunrise.</p>
                <p>3. A private person is bound to arrest for a felony committed in his presence,
                    under penalty of fine and imprisonment.</p>
                <p>4. The arrest by hue and cry is where officers and private persons are concerned
                    in <hi rend="italic">pursuing</hi> felons, or such as have dangerously wounded
                    others.</p>
                <p>The remedy for a wrongful arrest is by an action for false imprisonment.</p>
                <p>In Scotland the law of arrest in criminal procedure has a general constitutional
                    analogy with that of England, though the practice differs with the varying
                    character of the judicatories. Colloquially the word arrest is used in
                    compulsory procedure for the recovery of debt; but the technical term applicable
                    in that department is caption, and the law on the subject is generically
                    different from that of England. There never was a practice in Scottish law
                    corresponding with the English arrest in mesne process; but by old custom a
                    warrant for caption could be obtained where a creditor made oath that he had
                    reason to believe his debtor meditated flight from the country, and the writ so
                    issued is called a warrant against a person <hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">meditatione</hi><hi rend="italic">jugoe.</hi> Imprisonment of old
                    followed on ecclesiastical cursing, and by fiction of law in later times it was
                    not the creditor’s remedy, but the punishment of a refractory person denounced
                    rebel for disobedience to the injunctions of the law requiring fulfilment of his
                    obligation. The system was reformed and stripped of its cumbrous fictions by an
                    Act of the year 1837. Although the proceedings against the person could only
                    follow on completed process, yet, by a peculiarity of the Scottish law,
                    documents executed with certain formalities, and by special · statute bills and
                    promissory-notes, can be registered in the records of a court for execution
                    against the person as if they were judgments of the court.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Arrest of Judgment</hi> is the assigning just reason why
                    judgment should not pass, notwithstanding verdict given, either in civil or in
                    criminal cases, and from intrinsic causes arising on the face of the record.</p>
