                <p><label type="entry">ARNDT, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label>, was a famous
                    Protestant theologian of the 16th century, and may be regarded as the founder of
                    the German Pietism of a later generation. He was born at Ballenstädt, in Anhalt,
                    in 1555, and studied in a variety of universities—in Helmstadt in 1576; in
                    Wittenberg in 1577, when the crypto-Calvinist controversy was at its height, and
                    where he took the side of Melanchthon and the crypto-Calvinists; in Strasburg,
                    under Pappus, who was a strict Lutheran and had a great influence over him; in
                    Basel, where he studied theology under Sulcer, and also medicine. In 1581 he
                    went back to Ballenstädt, but was soon recalled to active life by his
                    appointment to the pastorate at Badeborn in 1583. After some time his Lutheran
                    tendencies exposed him to the anger of the authorities, who were of the Reformed
                    church. He found an asylum in Quedlinburg, and afterwards was transferred to St
                    Martin’s church in Brunswick. Arndt’s fame rests on his writings, which were
                    mainly of a mystical devotional kind, and were inspired by Bernard, Tauler, and
                    Thomas à Kempis. His principal work is <hi rend="italic">The True
                    Christianity,</hi> which has been translated into most European languages, <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n684/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0684-0623"/> and has served as the foundation of many
                    devotional works, both Roman Catholic and Protestant. In this book Arndt dwells
                    upon the mystical union between the believer and Christ, and his aim is to
                    correct the purely forensic side of the Reformation theology, which paid almost
                    exclusive attention to Christ’s death <hi rend="italic">for</hi> His people, by
                    drawing attention to Christ’s life <hi rend="italic">in</hi> His people. Like
                    Luther, Arndt was very fond of the little anonymous book, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Deutsche</hi><hi rend="italic">Theologie,</hi> and published an edition with a
                    preface recommending it. The first edition of his <hi rend="italic">True

                    translated into English at least twice, and has gone through a great number of
                    editions; the best known translation is that of A. W. Boehm, Lond. 1720. Several
                    of his sermons are published in R. Nesselmann’s <hi rend="italic">Buch der
                    Predigten,</hi> 1858. Arndt has always been held in very high repute by the
                    German Pietists, and the founders of Pietism, Spener and Storr, repeatedly call
                    attention to him and his writings; they have gone so far as to compare him to
                    Plato, <hi rend="italic">cf.</hi> C. Scheele, <hi rend="italic">Plato</hi><hi
