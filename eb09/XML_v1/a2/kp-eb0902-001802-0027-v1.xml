                <p><label type="entry">ANDORRE, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Andorra</hi></label>, a
                    small semi-independent state on the south side of the Pyrenees, between the
                    Spanish province of Lerida and the French department of Ariège. It is surrounded
                    by mountains, and consists of one main valley, which is watered by the Balira, a
                    tributary of the Segre, which itself flows into the Ebro, and of several smaller
                    valleys, the most important of which are those of the Ordino and the Os. It has
                    an area of about 600 square miles, and is divided into six parishes, Andorra la
                    Viéja (the capital), San Julian de Loria, Canillo, Encamp, Ordino, Massana. The
                    population is under 7000. The territory was once densely wooded, whence probably
                    its name, from the Arabic <hi rend="italic">Aldarra, “</hi> a place thick with
                    trees.;” but the forests have been almost entirely destroyed for fuel. The
                    pasturage is extensive and excellent; the mountains contain iron and lead mines;
                    rye, potatoes, fruits, and tobacco, are grown on the lower grounds; game and
                    trout are abundant. The population is rather pastoral than agricultural; but
                    smuggling, together with the manufacture of tobacco, occasion some traffic. The
                    Andorrans are a robust and well-proportioned race, of an independent spirit,
                    simple and severe in their manners, but mostly ignorant and ill-educated,
                    although they receive instruction gratuitously at the parish schools; they speak
                    the Catalan dialect of Spanish, and are all Roman Catholics. This remarkable
                    Kttle state is a surviving specimen of the independence possessed in mediaeval
                    times by the warlike inhabitants of many Pyrenean valleys. Its privileges have
                    remained intact, because the <hi rend="italic">suzeraineté</hi> of the district
                    became equally and indivisibly shared, in 1278, between the bishops of Urgel and
                    the counts of Foix; the divided <hi rend="italic">suzeraineté</hi> being now
                    inherited by the French crown and the present bishop of Urgel, and the two
                    powers having mutually checked innovations, while the insignificant territory
                    has not been worth a dispute. Thus Andorra is not a republic, but is designated
                    in official documents as the “Vallées et Suzerainetés.” Before 1278 it was under
                    the <hi rend="italic">suzeraineté</hi> of the neighbouring counts of Castelbo,
                    to whom it had been ceded, in 1170, by the counts of Urgel. A marriage between
                    the heiress of Castelbo and Roger Bernard, count of Foix, carried the rights of
                    the above-named Spanish counts into the house of Foix, and hence, subsequently,
                    to the crown of France, when the heritage of the feudal system was absorbed by
                    the sovereign; but the bishops of Urgel claimed certain rights, which, after
                    long dispute, were satisfied by the “Act of Division” executed in 1278. The
                    claims of the bishopric dated from Carlo-vingian times, and the independence of
                    Andorra, like most other Pyrenean anomalies, has been traditionally ascribed to
                    Charlemagne. Preserved from innovations by the mutual jealousy of rival
                    potentates, as well as by the conservative temper of a pastoral population,
                    Andorra has kept its mediaeval usages and institutions almost unchanged. In each
                    parish two <hi rend="italic">consuls,</hi> assisted by a local council, decide
                    matters relating to roads, police, slight taxes, the division of pastures, the
                    right to collect wood, &amp;c. Such matters, as well as the general internal
                    administration of the territory, are finally regulated by a <hi rend="italic"
                    >conseil général</hi> of 24 members (4 to each parish), elected, since 1866, by
                    the suffrages of all heads of families, but previously confined to an
                    aristocracy composed of the richest and oldest families, whose supremacy had
                    been preserved by the principle of primogeniture. A general syndic, with two
                    inferior syndics, chosen by the <hi rend="italic">conseil général,</hi>
                    constitutes the supreme executive of the state. Two <hi rend="italic"
                    >viguiers</hi> —one nominated by France, and the other by the bishop of
                    Urgel—command the militia, which consists of about 600 men, although all capable
                    of bearing arms are liable to be called out. This force is exempt from all
                    foreign service, and the chief office of the <hi rend="italic">viguiers</hi> is
                    the administration of criminal justice, in which their decisions, given simply
                    according to their judgment and conscience, there being no written laws, are
                    final. Civil cases, on the other hand, are tried in the first instance before
                    one of the two <hi rend="italic">aldermen,</hi> who act as deputies of the <hi
                    rend="italic">viguiers;</hi> the judgment of this court maybe set aside by the
                    civil judge of appeal, an officer nominated by France and the bishop of Urgel
                    alternately; the final appeal is either to the Court of Cassation at Paris, or
                    to the Episcopal College at Urgel. A tribute of 960 francs is paid annually to
                    France, in return for which the Andorrans are permitted to import certain
                    articles free of duty; the bishop of Urgel receives a tribute .of almost the
                    same amount. The expenses of government are defrayed by a species of rent paid
                    by owners of flocks to the community for the use of the pasture land.</p>
