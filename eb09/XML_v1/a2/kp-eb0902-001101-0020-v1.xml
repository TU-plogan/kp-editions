                <p><label type="entry">ANDAMAN ISLANDS</label>. These islands lie in the Bay of
                    Bengal, 590 geographical miles from the Hoogly mouth of the Ganges, 160 miles
                    from Cape Negrais in British Burma, the nearest point of the mainland, and about
                    340 from the north extremity of Sumatra. Between the Andamans and Cape Negrais
                    intervene two small groups, Preparis and Cocos; between the Andamans and Sumatra
                    intervene the Nicobar Islands, all seeming to indicate a submarine range
                    stretching in a curve, to which the meridian forms a tangent, between Cape
                    Negrais and Sumatra; and though this curved line measures 700 miles, the widest
                    sea-space is less than 90. Some zoological facts are held to point to the former
                    existence of continuous land from Negrais to Achin Head. If we can accept the
                    doubtful authority of Wilford, Hindu legends notice this remarkable chain, and
                    ascribe it to Rama, who attempted here first to bridge the sea, an enterprise
                    afterwards transferred to the south of India, and accomplished at the place we
                    call Adam’s Bridge.</p>
                <p>The main part of the group is a band of four islands, so closely adjoining, end
                    to end, but slightly overlapping, that they have long been known as one, viz.,
                    “the Great Andaman.” The axis of this band, almost a meridian line, is 156
                    statute miles long. The four islands are (north to south)—North Andaman, 51
                    miles long; Middle Andaman, 59 miles; South Andaman, 49 miles; and Rutland
                    Island, 11 miles. Of the three straits which part these four islands, the two
                    most southerly, Macpherson’s and Middle Straits, though narrow are navigable.
                    Andaman Strait, between Middle and North islands, is at low water a fetid swampy
                    creek, not passable by a boat.</p>
                <p>Little Andaman, 30 miles by 17, forming the southern extreme of the group, is
                    detached from Great Andaman by Duncan Passage, 28 miles in width. One
                    considerable island (Interview Island) lies immediately west of Great Andaman,
                    and many islets are scattered round. The highest point in the group is Saddle
                    Mountain, in North Andaman, approaching 3000 feet. From this southward the hills
                    sink in height.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">People. —</hi> These islands, so near countries that have for
                    ages attained considerable civilisation and have been the seat of great empires,
                    and close to the track of a great commerce which has gone on at least 2000
                    years, continue to our day the abode of savages as low in civilisation as almost
                    any known on earth. Our earliest notice of them is in that remarkable collection
                    of early Arab notes on India and China which was translated by Eus. Renaudot,
                    and again in our own time by Μ. Reinaud. It accurately represents the view
                    entertained of this people by mariners down to our own time. “The inhabitants of
                    these islands eat men alive. They are black, with woolly hair, and in their eyes
                    and countenances there is something quite frightful They go naked, and have no
                    boats.</p>
                <p>If they had, they would devour all who passed near them. Sometimes ships that are
                    windbound, and have exhausted their provision of water, touch here and apply to
                    the natives for it; in such cases the crews sometimes fall into the hands of the
                    latter, and most of them are massacred.” The traditional charge of cannibalism
                    has been very persistent; but it is entirely denied by themselves, and rejected
                    by all who have taken part in our recent colony. Of their massacres.of
                    shipwrecked crews, there is no doubt; such horrors have continued to our own day
                    on these islands, as well as on the Nicobars.</p>
                <p>The people are <hi rend="italic">Oriental Negroes,</hi> and idle stories were
                    once current of their descent from wrecked cargoes of African slaves. Races of
                    somewhat like character are found in the mountains of the Malay peninsula <hi
                    rend="italic">(Semangs)</hi> and in the Philippine group <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Ajitas</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Aetas');</hi> there is reason to believe a
                    similar race exists in the interior of Great Nicobar; there are recent rumours
                    of the like in Borneo; and, strange to say, late reseaτch has shown a
                    possibility of near connection with the Andamanners of the aboriginal race of
                    Tasmania, recently extinct—circumstances which seem to indicate a former
                    diffusion of this variety of mankind over a large space of the south-eastern
                    world. But, in truth, accurate comparison of these tribes has yet scarcely been
                    attained. The Andaman countenance has generally impressed Europeans at first as
                    highly repulsive, and as African in character; but when we come to particulars,
                    it has usually neither the exaggerated blubber-lip, nor to a like extent the
                    prognathous profile, of the true Negro; nor has the Andamanner the Negro's large
                    or ill-formed feet. The ear is small and well-formed; the hair glows in short
                    detached tufts, curled in small rings close to the head, but is declared not to
                    be woolly. (There are tribes of a long-haired race on Interview Island, and it
                    is also said on Rutland. These are of superior stature, and may have been
                    modified by alien blood from shipwrecked crews.) The skin is of a lustrous
                    black; the people, especially the men, are often robust and vigorous, though
                    their stature is low—seldom 5 feet, and generally much less. In this respect
                    they can look down on the Cape Boschmen alone. The general resemblance of
                    countenance ascribed to the people in some accounts is entirely denied by those
                    who have become familiar with them. Professor Owen, in a skull which he
                    examined, found none of the distinctive characters of the African Negro. The
                    people, as a rule, are absolutely devoid of clothing. The men’s nearest approach
                    to it is to twist a few fibres round the forehead or neck, or below the knee;
                    the women sometimes make a slight attempt at decent covering with leaves or
                    tails of plaited fibre—the last appearing to be only a modern innovation, and
                    the result of partial contact with our settlement. Adult males are alleged to be
                    tattooed, or rather cicatrised (though photographs do not confirm the
                    universality of this). The process begins about the age of eight, and goes on at
                    intervals. It used to be done with a flint; now usually with bottle-glass. Till
                    the process is complete, the youth is ineligible for marriage. With both sexes
                    all hair is shaven off, except a narrow strip from crown to nape, which is kept
                    cut close. The men rarely have beard, and in general their eye-lashes are few.
                    The people are neither long-lived nor healthy. Indeed, few are believed to pass
                    forty. They suffer especially from fevers, colds, and lung complications; but
                    also from bowel complaints, headache, toothache, abscesses, and rheumatism. The
                    malarious influence of newly cleared jungle affects them as violently as
                    Europeans. Formerly their almost sole remedial treatment was to coat themselves
                    in whole or part with mud and turtle-oil. This mud daubing in various forms is
                    also used' as mourning, and as a protection against musquitoes or the sun’s
                    rays. Paint made from ferruginous red earth is used as a decoration. Of late the
                    natives round the colony appreciate quinine highly.</p>
                <p>They have nothing whatever approaching to agriculture, nor does their rude
                    shelter of leaves deserve the name of hut. Their chief food in the hot season
                    consists of turtle, wild fruits, and honey, which they procure with great
                    dexterity. In the rains the seeds of an <hi rend="italic">Artocarpus</hi> are a
                    staple, and in the intermediate season the wild hog; when the hog becomes
                    scarce, fish and turtle. They have large appetites: a man will consume 6 lb of
                    fish at a sitting, and soon be ready to begin again. At their haunts <hi
                    rend="italic">kitchen-middens</hi> are formed from bones and shells till the
                    stench becomes unbearable; then they shift quarters. Col. Man mentions a
                    kitchenmidden at Hope Town 15 feet high and nearly 50 in diameter, almost
                    exclusively composed of shells. They seem kindly among themselves, and capable
                    of strong attachments; and though irritable, they are not vindictive. They are
                    very fearless, and are formidable archers, shooting strongly and truly with a
                    bow between 5 and 6 feet long, of tough wood, hard to bend. They shoot and
                    harpoon fish w ith skill, and catch it also by hand; and have hand-nets, and
                    stake-nets for turtle.</p>
                <p>Monogamy seems the rule. A young man proclaims himself a candidate for marriage
                    by eating a special kind of fish (a species of ray), whilst marriageable girls
                    wear certain flowers. The young man, if a pig-hunter, abstains from pork for a
                    year; if a turtlehunter, from turtle; and during the probationary year honey is
                    forbidden. The wife provides shelter and mats to lie on, does the cooking <hi
                    rend="italic">(all</hi> food is cooked), procures water and shell-fish, carries
                    loads, shaves and paints her husband, and tends him when sick. The husband
                    protects his wife, makes canoes, weapons, &amp;c., and sometimes goes in search
                    of food; but this generally devolves on the unmarried. They pet their children,
                    but many perish. A family of three living children is rare. If an adult dies, he
                    is quickly buried, and the tribe migrates 8 or 10 miles for about a month. Some
                    months later the bones, as they dry, are taken up, and these, the skull
                    especially, are carried about by the kinsfolk—for how long we are not told.
                    Mourning is shown by a daily daubing of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n21/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0021-0012"/> olive mud, particularly a thick coat on the head.
                    It lasts a month. During their sorrow they are silent, refrain from red paint
                    and decoration, and from much food, especially from pork and honey; but have
                    daily to throw a piece of honey-comb into the fire.</p>
                <p>A notable eccentricity with these people is <hi rend="italic">crying,</hi> as an
                    utterance of emotion. It is an expression of reconciliation with enemies, and of
                    joy at meeting friends after long separation. Something similar is known in New
                    Zealand, and, it would seem, among the Patagonians. When two Andaman tribes meet
                    under such circumstances, the new-comers begin the process, the women weeping
                    first; their men then take up the lugubrious function; finally, the tribe on
                    whose ground the scene occurs reciprocate, commencing with their women. This
                    doleful antistrophe is continued long—“sometimes through several days ”—and then
                    they take to dancing!</p>
                <p>They are said to have no idea of a God or future state, though Colonel Symes in
                    his narrative gives a different acoount, and perhaps information on this point
                    is still too imperfect. We find reference made to their belief that evil spirits
                    cause disease, and to their dread of the ghosts of the dead.</p>
                <p>They were always very hostile to strangers, repulsing all approaches with
                    treachery, or with violence and showers of arrows. This may have originated in
                    ancient liability to slave raids. Not till five years after the establishment of
                    Port Blair colony did they begin to abate hostility. Robberies were frequent,
                    and the murder of persons straying into the woods. The Government established
                    <hi rend="italic">homes</hi> for the aborigines in the environs of the
                    settlement—viz., sheds for shelter, with some aid in rations, &amp;c., and this
                    conduced to a better state of things. An orphanage also has now been established
                    under European matrons.</p>
                <p>They are perfect swimmers and divers, and expert in managing canoes. These are
                    neatly formed, and, according to Mouat, some are fitted with outriggers, which
                    enable them to go seaward for considerable distances.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The native boats near Port Blair have no
                    outrigger.</p></note> Two centuries ago, according to Captain A. Hamilton, they
                    used to make hostile descents on the Nicobars, and this is confirmed by a
                    Nicobar tradition mentioned in the <hi rend="italic">Asiatic
                    Researches</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>ii.
                    344.</p></note> But there is apparently no later evidence of such expeditions,
                    and they were probably confined to March and April, when the sea is generally
                    like a pond.</p>
                <p>The number of aborigines is unknown, and conjecture has varied from 3000 up to
                    10,000, or even 15,000. Dr Mouat, in 1857, whilst steaming rapidly round the
                    islands, everywhere saw natives in considerable numbers, and was induced to
                    believe that the older and lower estimates had been much under the truth; but
                    there is reason to believe that the population is on the coast only. They are
                    divided into tribes or groups, not usually containing more than thirty
                    individuals; and among these the country is partitioned in some fashion, for we
                    are told that trespasses are a common ground of war between tribes. Each tribe
                    has a dépôt, or headquarters, where the sick are tended and surplus stores are
                    kept.</p>
                <p>The name <hi rend="italic">Mincopie</hi> is applied to the Andaman race in books,
                    originating with a vocabulary given by Lieutenant Colebrooke.<note

                    Of the language we have as yet little information. It is said to be very
                    deficient in words, and there is the tendency usual in the circumstances to
                    strong dialectic differences. Thus the people of Little Andaman are said not to
                    understand those of South Andaman. Those near the settlement begin to
                    incorporate English and Hindustani words. It is stated positively that they have
                    <hi rend="italic">no numerals.</hi> It was once believed that they had no proper
                    names, but this proves erroneous. The child is named before birth; hence names
                    seem of common gender, and as they are few—some twenty in all—a special epithet
                    is prefixed to each, personal or local in origin.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate.—</hi> This is very moist, as might be expected. The
                    islands are exposed to the full force of the south-west monsoon of summer, and
                    also in some seasons share that rainy effect of the north-east monsoon of the
                    late autumn which characterises the Coromandel coast in the same latitude. Hence
                    Colonel Kyd, who was chief of the settlement abandoned in 1796, says only four
                    months’ fair weather could be counted on, and a later explorer uses nearly the
                    same phrase. The natives divide the year into three seasons—(1.) The dry,
                    literally “the northern sun,” February to May; (2.) The rainy, June to
                    September; (3.) The moderate season, October to January. There is, however,
                    rather a remarkable want of uniformity in the seasons. The rainfall at Port
                    Blair for four years is reported as follows :—</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Geology, &amp;c.—</hi> The islands appear from the sea as a
                    series of low hills. These being covered with dense and lofty forest, we have as
                    yet little information on the geology. The surface is excessively irregular, and
                    the islands are toe narrow to have rivers. There has been no alluvial deposit,
                    and in many places the rocky formation is bare. Near our settlement in South
                    Andaman the principal rocks are grey tertiary sandstones, identical with those
                    prevailing in Aracan. This sandstone affords excellent building material. Traces
                    of coal have been found, but only small pockets in the sandstone, without seam.
                    Serpentine rock occurs on the east coast south of Port Blair, and on Rutland. A
                    broad strip of indurated chloritic rock extends from Port Blair north-north-east
                    to the east coast of Middle Andaman, Coral reef barriers gird the islands on all
                    sides. The general dip of the rocks is to the westward, and thus the depth of
                    sea on the east is much greater. On the west the corals are continuous and very
                    extensive, forming patches of reef even 20 or 25 miles from shore. Agate flakes
                    have been found on the site of an old encampment. It is curious that Captain A.
                    Hamilton speaks of an adventurer known to him who made money by <hi
                    rend="italic">quicksilver</hi> obtained from these islands, but no confirmation
                    of this has been reported. No fossils have yet been got.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Vegetation.—</hi> On the east the prevailing character is of
                    forest trees with straight stems of 100 feet in mean height, often entirely
                    covered with climbing plants. On the west vegetation is not so lofty. Deciduous
                    trees are everywhere sporadic, and large tracts of them occur, robbing the
                    landscape in the hot season of its tropical richness by their grey sterile
                    aspect. These trees are generally of little utility. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bombax</hi><hi rend="italic">malabaricum</hi> is abundant among them. The
                    immense buttressing of the stems of many of the trees is notable. Extensive
                    tracts are also occupied by bamboo jungle, 30 to 35 feet high, almost entirely
                    of <hi rend="italic">Bambusa andamanica,</hi> from which lofty forest trees
                    stand out, very far apart. The bamboo seems to attach especially to the
                    indurated chloritic rock. Mangrove swamps fringe the little bays and straits,
                    with many orchids. Behind the swamps are palms, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phoenix</hi><hi rend="italic">paludosa</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Licuala</hi><hi rend="italic">paludosa;</hi> also <hi rend="italic"
                    >Barringtonia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Excoecaria Agallocha,</hi> recognised
                    by their red decaying leaves in June and July, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lager-</hi><hi rend="italic">stroemia</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pterocarpus</hi> by their rich lilac or yellow blossoms. Arborescent
                    euphorbias, screw-pines, and a <hi rend="italic">Cycas</hi> of considerable
                    height, give a remarkable aspect to the coast vegetation in many places. Above
                    these are the coast forests, on the slopes of hills, and valleys influenced by
                    the sea. <hi rend="italic">Mimusops</hi><hi rend="italic">indica,</hi> believed
                    to be a very valuable wood, forms whole forests; sometimes in equal proportions
                    with <hi rend="italic">Hemicyclia</hi><hi rend="italic">andam.</hi> Around these
                    are tropical mixed forests, through which it is hard to force a way from the
                    multitude of climbers. <hi rend="italic">Dipterocarpus lcevis</hi> is the
                    typical tree here. Palms are numerous— <hi rend="italic">e.g., Licuala</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">peltata</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Areca triandra.</hi> On one
                    small island (Ter-mooklee) there is a gigantic <hi rend="italic">Corypha</hi>
                    with leaves 30 feet long, but stemless. The high forests of the interior are
                    little known. The quantity of intricate climbers is less, and the uniformity of
                    vegetation greater. Treeless spots are confined to craggy islands completely
                    exposed to wind and weather. The general character of the vegetation is <hi
                    rend="italic">Burmese,</hi> altered by some unfavourable circumstances,
                    principally the scarcity of running water. But there are also· a number of
                    Malayan types not found on the adjacent continent. There are no tree ferns,
                    apparently. There <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n22/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0022-0013"/> are a considerable number of edible wild fruits.
                    No indigenous coco-palms exist, though these are so plentiful on the adjoining
                    Cocos and Nicobars. Much of the scenery of the islands is very beautiful.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Animal Life.—</hi> This is greatly deficient throughout the
                    whole group, especially as regards Mammalia, of which the species are very few.
                    There is a small pig <hi rend="italic">(S. andaman-ensis),</hi> important to the
                    food of the people—perhaps that found on the Nicobars; a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Paradoxurus;</hi> a rat with spiny hairs (if. <hi rend="italic">andam.);</hi> a
                    small frugivorous bat <hi rend="italic">(Cgnoρterus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >marginatus).</hi> A “wild cat” is alleged, but there seems doubt about it. No
                    Quadrumana have been seen. Of birds several species seem peculiar to this group,
                    or to the Nicobars, or to the two together; and some of the Andaman species are
                    considered by Mr Blyth to accord better with corresponding species at a distance
                    than with those on the adjoining part of the continent. Thus, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Artamus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Oriolus</hi> of the Andamans seem identical
                    with those of Java, not with those of India or Burma; and a shrike of these
                    islands agrees better with a species of China and the Philippines than with the
                    nearest species in Bengal, Aracan, and the Malay peninsula. Caves on the coast
                    are frequented by the swift, which forms the edible nest of the China market.
                    Pigeons, kingfishers, and woodpeckers are numerous. Reptiles are pretty
                    numerous, both as regards species (15 to 20) and individuals, including eight
                    <hi rend="italic">Ophidia</hi> and several <hi rend="italic">Geckoes,</hi> of
                    which four or five are peculiar. Among these is one <hi rend="italic">(Phelsuma
                    andam.)</hi> the immediate kindred of which is known only in Madagascar and the
                    adjoining islands. The Indian toad is common. Turtle are abundant, and now
                    supply Calcutta. The species of fish are very numerous, and many are peculiar.
                    They have been especially studied by Dr F. Day. It is much to be desired that
                    these islands should have a thorough scientific exploration whilst the type of
                    their productions is still substantially uninfluenced by foreign agency.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> It is uncertain whether any of the names of the
                    islands given by Ptolemy ought to be attached to the Andamans; yet it is
                    probable that this name itself is traceable in the Alexandrian geographer.
                    Andaman first appears distinctly in the Arab notices of the 9th century, already
                    quoted. But it seems possible that the tradition of marine nomenclature had
                    never perished; that the ΆγαΘοΰ <hi rend="italic">t&gt;atμovos vησos</hi> was
                    really a misunderstanding of some form like <hi rend="italic">Agdamdn,</hi>
                    while <hi rend="italic">Νήσοι Βαρούσσαι</hi> survived as Lanka <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bâlûs,</hi> the name applied by the Arabs to the Nicobars. The islands are
                    briefly noticed by Marco Polo, who probably saw without visiting them, under the
                    name <hi rend="italic">Angamanain,</hi> seemingly an Arabic dual, “The two
                    Angamans,” with the exaggerated but not unnatural picture of the natives, long
                    current, as dog-faced Anthropophagi. Another notice occurs in the story of
                    Nicolo Conti <hi rend="italic">(circa</hi> 1440), who explains the name to mean
                    “Island of Gold,” and speaks of a lake with peculiar virtues as existing in it
                    (the natives do report the existence of a fresh-water lake on the Great
                    Andaman). Later travellers repeat the stories, too well founded, of the
                    ferocious hostility of the people; of whom we may instance Cesare Federici
                    (1569), whose narrative is given in <hi rend="italic">Ramusio,</hi> vol. iii.
                    (only in the later editions), and in Purchas. A good deal is also told of them
                    in the vulgar and gossipping, but useful work of Captain Hamilton (1727). In
                    1788-89 the Government of Bengal sought to establish in the Andamans a penal
                    colony, associated with a harbour of refuge. Two able officers, Colebrooke of
                    the Bengal Engineers, and Blair of the sea service, were sent to survey and
                    report. In the sequel the settlement was established by Captain Blair, in
                    September 1789, on Chatham Island, in the S.E. bay of the Great Andaman, now
                    called Port Blair, but then Port Cornwallis. There was much sickness, and after
                    two years, urged by Admiral Cornwallis, the Government transferred the colony to
                    the N.E. part of Great Andaman, where a naval arsenal was to be established.
                    With the colony the name also of Port Cornwallis was transferred to this new
                    locality. The scheme did ill; and in 1796 the Government put an end to it, owing
                    to the great mortality and the embarrassments of maintenance. The settlers were
                    finally removed in May 1796. In 1824 Port Cornwallis was the rendezvous of the
                    fleet carrying the army to the first Burmese war. In 1839, Dr Helfer, a German
                    savant employed by the Indian Government, having landed in the islands, was
                    attacked and killed. In 1844 two troop-ships, “Briton” and “Runnymede,” were
                    driven ashore here, almost close together. The natives showed their usual
                    hostility, killing all stragglers. Outrages on shipwrecked crews continued so
                    rife that the question of occupation had to be taken up again; and in 1855 a
                    project was formed for such a settlement, embracing a convict establishment.
                    This was interrupted by the great mutiny of 1857, but as soon as the neck of
                    that revolt was broken, it became more urgent than ever to provide such a
                    resource, on account of the great number of prisoners daily falling into our
                    hands. Lord Canning, therefore, in November 1857, sent a commission, headed by
                    Dr F. Mouat, to examine and report. The commission reported favourably,
                    selecting as a site Blair’s <hi rend="italic">original</hi> Port Cornwallis, but
                    pointing out and avoiding the vicinity of a salt swamp which seemed to have been
                    pernicious to the old colony. To avoid confusion, the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Port Blair</hi> was given to the new settlement, which was established in the
                    beginning of 1858. At the end of 1871 the number of convicts in the colony was
                    7603. For some time sickness and mortality were excessively large, but the
                    reclamation of swamp and clearance of jungle on an extensive scale by Colonel
                    Henry Man when in charge (1868-1870), had a most beneficial effect, and the
                    health of the settlement has since been notable. Of late years the European
                    detachment of 120 men has sometimes been without a man in hospital.<note

                    Cattle have been introduced in considerable numbers; extensive gardens have been
                    planted, embracing many thousands of valuable fruit and timber trees. Mangoes,
                    oranges, pommeloes, pine-apples, and jack-fruit are grown with especial success.
                    The Andaman colony obtained a tragical notoriety from the murder of the viceroy,
                    the Earl of Mayo, by a Mohammedan convict, when on a visit to the settlement,
                    8th February 1872. Recently the two groups, Andaman and Nicobar, the occupation
                    of the latter also having been forced on the British Government (in 1869) by the
                    continuance of outrage upon vessels, have been united under a chief commissioner
