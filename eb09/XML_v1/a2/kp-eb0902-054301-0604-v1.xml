                <p><label type="entry">ARLES</label><hi rend="italic">(Arelate),</hi> a city of
                    France, in the department of Bouches du Rhone, 46 miles north-west of
                    Marseilles, in lat. 43° 40' 18" N., long. 4° 37' 46" E. It stands on the left
                    bank of the Rhone, where that river divides to form its delta. It is generally
                    well built, with regular streets and fine quays. The public buildings consist of
                    the town-hall, dating from Louis XIV., and built after plans by Mansart; the
                    cathedral of St Trophime, founded in the 7th century and remarkable for its
                    portico; a college, museum, school of navigation, and public library. The
                    building of railway waggons, &amp;c., is largely carried on, as well as the
                    manufacture of silk, glass-bottles, and soap, and the sausages of Arles are
                    famed for their excellence. The trade in agricultural produce, oil, wine,
                    fruits, cattle, wool, and salt, is considerable. A canal (called after the city)
                    has been constructed from Arles to the harbour of Bouc on the Mediterranean, and
                    a connection is formed with the canals of Beaucaire and Craponne. The latter
                    affords communication with the Durance. Population in 1872, 24,695.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Arelate</hi> was an important town at the time of Caesar’s
                    invasion, and subsequently received a Roman colony, and became under the later
                    emperors one of the most flourishing towns on the further side of the Alps. It
                    was pillaged in 270 A.υ., but restored and embellished by Constantine, who made
                    it his principal residence, and founded what is now the suburb of Trinquetaille.
                    After the fall of the Roman empire the city passed into the power of the
                    Visigoths, and rapidly declined. It was plundered in 730 by the Saracens, but in
                    the 10th century became the capital of a kingdom of the same name, formed by
                    Bozon from the two kingdoms of Burgundy. In the 12th century it was a free city,
                    governed by <hi rend="italic">consuls</hi> and <hi rend="italic">podestats</hi>
                    after the model of the Italian republics, which it also emulated in commerce and
                    navigation. In 1251 it submitted to Charles of Anjou, and from that time onwards
                    followed the fortunes of Provence. A number of ecclesiastical councils have been
                    held here, as in 314,—when the Dona-tists were condemned,—354, 452, and 475.
                    Arles still possesses many monuments of Roman architecture and art, the most
                    remarkable being the ruins of an amphitheatre <hi rend="italic">(arènes),</hi>
                    capable of containing 20,000 spectators, which was turned, by Abd-el-Rahman,
                    into a fortress and flanked with four massive towers, of which two are still
                    standing. There are also a theatre, in which, besides the famous Venus of Arles,
                    discovered in 1651, many other remains have been found; an ancient obelisk of a
                    single block, 47 feet high, erected in 1676 in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Place</hi><hi rend="italic">Royale</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the ruins
                    of two temples, an aqueduct, and a triumphal arch. There is, besides, a Roman
                    cemetery of great beauty, which has been laid out as a public pleasureground,
                    and bears the name of Aylscamps or EHscamps, which hardly conceals the original
                    designation, “<hi rend="italic">Elysii</hi><hi rend="italic">CampiP</hi> (See
