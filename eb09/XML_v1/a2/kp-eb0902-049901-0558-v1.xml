                    >Argyleshire</hi></label>, a county on the west coast of Scotland, comprehending
                    a large district on the mainland and a number of the Hebrides or Western Isles.
                    The mainland portion lies between lat. 55° 15' and 56° 55' N., and between long.
                    4° 32' and 6° 6' W.; its greatest length being 115 miles, and its greatest
                    breadth about 36 miles. It is bounded on the N. by Inverness-shire; on the E. by
                    the counties of Perth and Dumbarton, Loch Long, and the Firth of Clyde; on the
                    S. by the North Channel; and on the W. by the Atlantic. Its sea coast has been
                    stated at 600 miles. H the various islands are included, the greatest breadth of
                    the county is 68 miles, and its total area amounts to 3255 square miles, or
                    2,083,126 acres, which is more than a tenth part of the whole area of Scotland.
                    It contains forty parishes, and has been variously divided at different times
                    into a number of districts. The names of these at present in use are North and
                    South Argyll, Cowal, Dunoon, Kintyre (or Cantyre), Tarbert, Lorn, Mull,
                    Ardnamurchan, Morven, Islay, &amp;c. The principal towns are Inveraray, Dunoon,
                    Campbeltown, Oban, and Tobermory.</p>
                <p>There are numerous mountain streams, but no navigable rivers. The two principal
                    are the Orchy and Awe. The former flows from Loch Tulia through Glen Orchy, and
                    falls into Loch Awe at its northern extremity; and the latter forms an outlet
                    for the loch across the neck of land which lies between it and Loch Etive. The
                    other streams are the Add, Aray, Coe or Cona, Creran, Douglas, Echaig, Etive,
                    Euchar, Feochan, Finart, Fyne, Kinglas, Kinloss, Large, Leven, Nell, Ruel,
                    Shiel, Shira, Strae, Talaken, Uisge-Dhu, &amp;c. Most of these yield excellent
                    salmon and trout fishing. There are also some good fishing streams in the
                    islands. The county is remarkable for the numerous inlets of the sea with which
                    it is deeply indented, the principal of them being Loch Long, with its branch
                    Loch Goil; Loch Fyne, with Loch Gilp; Loch Etive; Loch Linnhe, with its branches
                    Loch Creran, Loch Leven, and Loch Eil; and Loch Sunart. There is also a large
                    number of inland lakes, the total area of which is about 25,000 acres. Of these
                    the principal are Loch Awe, Loch Avich, Loch Eck, Loch Lyndoch (partly in
                    Perthshire), and Loch Shiel.</p>
                <p>The principal islands are Mull, Islay, Jura, Colonsay, Lismore, Tiree, Coll,
                    Gigha, Muck, Rum, and Canna. Besides these there are the two small but
                    interesting islands of Staffa and Iona—the one famous for its basaltic caves and
                    rocks, and the other as the earliest seat of Christianity in Scotland.</p>
                <p>The whole county is rugged and mountainous, and many of the peaks are among the
                    loftiest in the kingdom; as Ben Cruachan (3689 ft.), Ben More, in Mull (3172),
                    Ben Ima (3318), Buchael Etive (3345), and Ben Arthur, “The Cobbler” (2891), on
                    the borders of Dumbartonshire. To the tourist it offers a rich variety of
                    Highland scenery, culminating in the gloomy grandeur of Glencoe.</p>
                <p>The situation and conformation of Argyllshire tend to produce a very abundant
                    rainfall. At Oban, the average annual amount is 64Ί8 inches; in Glen Fyne, 104T1
                    inches; at the Bridge of Orchy, 113 ’ 62 inches; and at Upper Glencoe, 127’65;
                    while at Edinburgh the average quantity is only 26 <hi rend="superscript">
                    -</hi> 40 inches. The prevailing winds, as observed at Callton-More, near
                    Crinan, are the S.W. and S.E., and next in frequency are the N.W. and N.E. The
                    average temperature is 48° Fahr.</p>
                <p>Geologically, the mainland consists principally of the metamorphic or so-called
                    primary strata, covered in part by newer formations. In the portion west of
                    Lochs Linnhe and Eil—the districts of Sunart, Ardgower, and Morven—gneiss is the
                    prevalent rock, broken through by granite near Strontian, and by trap rocks in
                    Ardnamurchan and Morven. In the other portion east of Loch Linnhe, the lower
                    rocks are chiefly mica slate and clay slate, the continuation of the strata
                    forming the great range of the southern Grampians. Mica slate is the most
                    important and oldest of these formations, rising up into the wild and rugged
                    mountains so conspicuous near Loch Long and Loch Fyne. In Appin it is partly
                    replaced by quartz rock, remarkable for bare sterility, and on Loch Fyne by
                    chlorite slates running down into Knapdale or the upper portion of the
                    promontory of Kintyre. These slates form a good building stone, being readily
                    cut even with a saw, and are the material of which the ducal castle at Inveraray
                    is built. Mica slate again forms most of Kintyre south of Tarbert, with
                    occasional beds of dark coloured limestone.</p>
                <p>Clay slate is far less common on the mainland, but occurs near Dunoon and Toward
                    Point on the Clyde. It has been long quarried extensively at Ballachulish, and
                    again appears near Oban and further south, often as a dark coloured
                    carbonaceous-looking rock. From this it extends into Kerrera, Seil, Easdale,
                    Luing, and the other so called slate islands. It haβ everywhere a very marked
                    cleavage, distinct from the stratification, and some of the beds furnish a very
                    durable roofing slate, which has been long wrought in Easdale, and with which
                    many houses in Scotland are covered. Cubical crystals of iron'pyrites abound in
                    all these slates, which, though no organic remains have yet been found in them,
                    are probably the equivalents of the lowest Silurian formations.</p>
                <p>To the same period may also be referred the quartz rock mentioned as occurring in
                    Appin, specially near the lower part of Glencoe, and more extensively in Jura
                    and Islay, along with the clay slate. From its hardness and indestructibility it
                    would form a valuable building stone, but is little used. These properties also
                    cause it to project in singularly sharp ridges and conical summits, of which the
                    Paps of Jura are the best known.</p>
                <p>The limestone associated with these older strata, though seldom in large masses,
                    is yet widely spread. It has been wrought near Ballachulish and in various parts
                    of Appin, in several places near the Crinan Canal, and along the whole peninsula
                    of Kintyre as far as Campbeltown. The largest masses are found in some of the
                    islands. Thus it covers the whole of Lismore and a large tract in the centre of
                    Islay near Bowmore. A magnesian variety found on Iona, associated with
                    serpentine, takes a good polish, and the red or flesh coloured marble of Tiree,
                    often with embedded crystals of green hornblende, occurs in beds in the gneiss
                    of that island.</p>
                <p>Red sandstones, probably belonging to more than one period in the history of the
                    earth, are found in different parts of Argyllshire. Some portions, resting
                    conformably on the mica slate of Kintyre, may belong to the Torridon sandstone
                    or Cambrian of the north-west coast, whilst other portions are of Devonian age.
                    Some beds near Oban and on the Sound of Mull are probably Trias. True coal, a
                    continuation of that in Ayrshire, has been wrought near Campbeltown. At various
                    points on the coast of Mull, Morven, and Ardnamurchan, beds belonging to the
                    Lias, Oolite, and even perhaps the Cretaceous formations, appear underlying the
                    trap rocks. Though of much interest in a scientific point of view they have
                    little influence on the general character of the county. More recent formations
                    are the leaf beds, with remains of Miocene plants discovered in the trap tufa at
                    Ardtunhead, in Mull, by the duke of Argyll in 1850. Raised beaches with fossil
                    shells are also known on several parts of the coast, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> at the Sound of Kerrera.</p>
                <p>Of the igneous rocks, granite chiefly occurs in a large mass round the upper end
                    of Loch Etive, extending south to Ben Cruachan near Loch Awe. Smaller masses
                    appear near Ballachulish and at the Ross of Mull. In the latter place it has
                    been extensively quarried and used for the magnificent fighthouse erected on the
                    Skerry Vohr. Veins are common near these masses and in other places. Felspar
                    porphyries, in great variety of forms and colours, abound in Glencoe, <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n559/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0559-0500"/> in large masses in the mountains north of Loch
                    Fyne below Inveraray, and again in Davar Island, and at other points'near
                    Campbeltown. Trap rocks—greenstones, dolerites, basalts, claystone porphyries,
                    amygdaloids, and tufas—cover great extents both of the mainland and islands. In
                    the west of Lorn they enclose the lower part of Loch Etive, stretching north to
                    Loch Creran, and south nearly to Loch Awe and Loch Melfort From this place,
                    running westward through Kerrera, they form nine-tenths of Mull and a wide tract
                    on the opposite coast of Morven aud Ardnamurchan. The islands of Muck, Eig, Rum,
                    and Canna are more remote outliers of these formations to the north-west, which
                    also form the Treshinish Islands —Ulva, Gometra, and Staffa, with its far-famed
                    caves and beautiful columnar cliffs. From their relation to the stratified beds,
                    these rocks evidently belong to a recent period in the history of the earth,
                    many of them not older than the upper tertiary. At that time the west of this
                    county, and especially the island of Mull, had formed the site of active
                    volcanoes, rivalling in extent and activity any now known at least in Europe.
                    The trap rocks in Kintyre connect them with those in central Scotland and the
                    north of Ireland, whilst those in Skye are their continuation to the north.</p>
                <p>Argyll is not rich in mineral products possessing an economic value. The lead
                    mines of Strontian, in Sunart, produced in 1872 about twelve tons of lead ore. A
                    vein of arsenical nickel was discovered in 1849 by the duke of Argyll near
                    Inveraray. Fine •specimens of the harmotome or cross-stone occur at Strontian,
                    of the heliotrope or bloodstone in Rum, and of natrolite, siolezite, stilbite,
                    and other zeolites in the trap-rocks of Mull, Morven, and Lorn.</p>
                <p>Argyllshire was formerly interspersed with natural forests, remains of
                    which—consisting chiefly of oak, ash, pine, and birch—are still visible in the
                    mosses. But, owing to the clearance of the ground for the introduction of sheep,
                    and the neglect of planting, the county is now remarkable for its want of wood,
                    except in the neighbourhood of Inveraray, where there are extensive and
                    flourishing plantations. A great part of the county is unfitted for agriculture;
                    but many districts afford fine pasturage for the hill sheep; and some of the
                    valleys—as Glendaruel—exhibit great fertility. The usual Scottish grains and
                    roots are all more or less grown.</p>
                <p>The chief branches of industry are the rearing of cattle and sheep, and the
                    herring fishery. The cattle, though of small size, are equal, if not superior,
                    to any other breed in the kingdom, and are in great demand in the markets of the
                    south, to which they are sent in immense numbers. Dairy husbandry is practised
                    to some extent in the southern parts of Kintyre, where there is a large
                    proportion of arable land. In the higher tracts sheep have very advantageously
                    been substituted for cattle. The blackfaced is the species that is now almost
                    universally reared.</p>
                <p>Argyllshire is an attractive field for the sportsman, its deer forests,
                    grouse-shootings, and salmon-fishings being among the best in Scotland. The
                    rents derived from these sources have greatly increased during the last half
                    century. As examples of these it may be stated, that the deer-forest of
                    Blackmount is let for about £3000 a year, and the salmon-fishing of Ardnamurchan
                    for upwards of £600. Loch Fyne is celebrated for its herring fishery; but during
                    1873 and 1874 the shoals have not advanced beyond the Sound of Kilbrannan.</p>
                <p>The manufactures of Argyllshire are very limited, consisting solely of whisky and
                    gunpowder; the former is produced at Campbeltown and in Islay, and the latter at
                    Kames (Kyles of Bute), and at Melfort, Furnace, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>There were originally only military roads in Argyllshire, but these were
                    gradually supplemented by others formed at the joint expense of Government (by a
                    grant and maintenance) and the county, by means of assessment under the Road
                    Commissioners—consequently there have never been any tolls. The Government grant
                    was withdrawn about 1860, and the roads are now maintained solely by assessment,
                    which is levied equally on landlords and tenants. By means of steamers there is
                    regular intercourse between various parts of the extensive, coast and the
                    Western metropolis. In order to avoid the circuitous passage round the Mull of
                    Kintyre the Crinan Canal was constructed, extending across the isthmus from
                    Ardrishaig to Loch Crinan, a distance of 8 miles; and another canal unites
                    Campbeltown with Dalavaddy. The Crinan is deep enough for vessels drawing 12
                    feet of water; its breadth at the surface is 66 feet, and at the bottom 30, and
                    the passage is interrupted by fifteen locks. There are about twenty bank
                    branches in the county. There are (1875) four weekly newspapers published in
                    Argyllshire.</p>
                <p>The antiquities of the county comprise monoliths, circles of standing stones,
                    crannoges, and cairns. In almost all the burying grounds—as at Campbeltown,
                    Keil, Soroby, Kilchousland—there are specimens of sculptured crosses and slabs,
                    many of which are figured in <hi rend="italic">The Sculptured Stones of
                    Scotland,</hi> vol. ii., published by the Spalding Club, and <hi rend="italic"

                    Proc, of Antiq. Soc. of Scotland,</hi> vols. iv. vi. viii. Besides the famous
                    ecclesiastical remains at Iona, there are ruins of a Cistercian priory in
                    Oronsay, and of a church founded by Somerlid at Saddel. Among castles may be
                    mentioned Dunstafihage, Ardtornish, Skipness, Kilchurn, Ardchonnel, Dunolly,
                    Dunderaw, and Carrick.</p>
                <p>The earliest recorded event in the history of Argyllshire is the settlement in
                    the 4th or 5th century of a body of Irish Scots, under the leadership of Erc,
                    who soon extended their power and established a dynasty. The most famous of
                    their kings was Aidan, the friend of Columba. In the 8th century the district
                    fell into the hands of Norwegian adventurers, and continued for five or six
                    hundred years under Norwegian control, till the rise of a deliverer called
                    Somerlid. Along with the Hebridean Isles, all the western parts of Argyll came
                    to the Scottish monarchs by conquest in the 14th century. Some time after,
                    Macdonald, the representative of this region, obtained leave from the Scottish
                    crown to hold his possessions as a feudatory to that kingdom; but his turbulent
                    spirit involved him and his family in repeated rebellions. These were at last
                    punished by the forfeiture of the estates, which, along with the titles, were
                    bestowed on the Campbells of Lochow, who have ever since retained them. Cohn,
                    second Lord Campbell, was created earl of Argyll in 1457; Archibald, second
                    earl, fell at Flodden; Archibald, fourth earl, was the first nobleman in
                    Scotland who declared himself a Protestant; Archibald, fifth earl, is famous as
                    the supporter of Queen Mary; Archibald, the eighth earl, and other prominent
                    holders of the titles, are noticed in the article immediately preceding. The
                    tenth earl was raised to the dukedom of Argyll in 1701. The title is now (1875)
                    held by a member of the same family, George Douglas Campbell, eighth duke.</p>
                <p>Like other parts of the Highlands of Scotland, this county was the seat of
                    several clans, of which the principal were the Campbells, the Macleans, the
                    Stewarts of Appin, the Macdonalds of Glencoe, the Macquarries, and the
                    Macdougalls; and the number of Campbells is still a striking feature of the
                    personal nomenclature of the county. Gaelic is still to a considerable extent
                    the vernacular dialect. The chief proprietors are the duke of Argyll and earl of
                    Breadalbane, whose estates are respectively 168,000 and 179,000 acres in extent.
                    The other principal estates, according to extent, are those of Poltal-loch
                    (183,000 acres), Islay f67,000), Jura (55,000), Ardnamurchan (55,000), Sunart
                    (54,418), Kildalton (54,250), and Ardkinglass (51,670). The total number of
                    owners of land possessing one acre or upwards was, in 1872-73, 581, and of
                    owners who had less than one acre, 2283.</p>
                <p>The valued rent of the county for 1874-75 is (exclusive of burghs and canals)
                    £416,543. The valuation of the burghs is—Campbeltown, £20,624; Oban, £11,763;
                    Inveraray, £3323. The county returns one member to parli∙ir <pb break="no"

                    and four substitutes. The justiciary circuit-court for the counties of Argyll
                    and Bute is held at Inveraray in spring and autumn. Sheriffcourts are held at
                    Inveraray, Tobermory, Campbeltown, and Fort-William; and courts for small-debt
                    actions, four times a year, at Oban, Lochgilphead, Dunoon, and Bowmore, in
                    Islay. There are three prisons (at Campbeltown, Inveraray, and Tobermory), five
                    poorhouses, an asylum at Lochgilphead for the Argyllshire and Bute district,
                    seaside homes for convalescents at Dunoon and at Kilmun, and a county militia
                    barracks at Campbeltown. The ecclesiastical statistics of the county are as
                    follows :—The Established Church of Scotland has a synod, 6 presbyteries, 40
                    parish and 18 <hi rend="italic">quoad sacra</hi> churches, and 14 chapels of
                    ease. The Free Church has a synod, <hi rend="italic">5</hi> presbyteries, and 46
                    churches. The United Presbyterians have 8 churches connected with 2
                    presbyteries. The Episcopalians have a bishopric (Argyll and the Isles), a dean,
                    and 17 clergymen; and the Roman Catholics have 5 priests. In 1871 there were
                    79*18 per cent, of the children between 5 and 13 years of age receiving
                    education—Argyllshire in this respect standing above ten counties, but 7 ’ 36
                    below the highest, Perth. The population of Argyll has been decreasing since
                    1831, from the extensive emigration that has been going on, principally to
                    Canada. The following is the state of its population since the commencement of
                    the present century—1801,81,277; 1811, 86,541; 1821, 97,316; 1831, 100,973;
                    1841, 97,371; 1851, 89,298; 1861, 79,724; 1871, 75,679.</p>
