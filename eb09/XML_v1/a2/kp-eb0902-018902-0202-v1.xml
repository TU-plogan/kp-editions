                <p><label type="entry">APOLOGETICS</label> is, properly speaking, that part of
                    theology which vindicates the right of theology in general, and of Christian
                    theology in particular, to exist as a science, and is occasioned by the presence
                    of anti-theological and antichristian speculation. Apologetics is therefore the
                    scientific representation of the grounds on which Christian theology, in so far
                    as it is a part of human knowledge, rests and may be vindicated. So long as
                    Christianity lies hid, as it were, in the mind of man or in the consciousness of
                    the church, without assuming an external or objective form, so long as it
                    remains only in the form of a force impelling men to action, so long as it is
                    content to manifest itself on the active or practical side only, there is no
                    great need of Apologetics; but whenever Christian dogmatics arise, whenever
                    Christianity objectifies itself on its intellectual side, and begins to force
                    its way into the circle of the sciences, its entrance is disputed, it has to
                    face hostile criticism, and begins to form an apologetic.</p>
                <p>Apologetics is therefore the logical antecedent but the historical consequent of
                    dogmatics; it is the introduction to dogmatics, it prepares the way for it
                    logically by justifying its claim to exist, but it actually comes after
                    dogmatics in the history of the intellectual manifestation of Christianity,
                    because, as a matter of fact, men do not feel called on to justify Christian
                    theology until it actually exists in a dogmatic form. Thus, Apologetics may be
                    compared to psychology, and in some respects is to dogmatics what psychology is
                    to metaphysics. Just as psychology is the link between physics and metaphysics,
                    just as in psychology the two spheres of impersonal and personal life touch each
                    other, and the two sets of natural and spiritual laws are seen in conjoint
                    action, so Apologetics lies between human and superhuman science, in it the two
                    spheres of human life and revelation meet, and the various and different laws
                    which regulate each adjust themselves to each other’s varying action; and
                    psychology, which is historically consequent to metaphysics, is logically its
                    antecedent and introduction. The position of Apologetics necessarily gives it a
                    somewhat changeable nature. All sciences change, but they do so according to an
                    inward development of their own, and their change is so far orderly and
                    progressive; but the course of Apologetics must always be more or less erratic,
                    because it has to do with the varying relations of the two spheres of human life
                    and revelation, and has to adjust itself afresh at each change in these
                    relations. The special form, too, which Apologetics has for the most part
                    assumed—a defence or vindication of Christianity—has made it more changeable. It
                    has been compelled to change its front from time to time to meet the altered
                    form of attack.</p>
                <p>In one aspect the general science of Apologetics and the number of treatises upon
                    the subject mark the imperfection of dogmatics and the neglect of its study; for
                    with the advance of theology, general Apologetics tends to disappear, and in its
                    stead comes an apologetic introduction, justifying each of the fundamental
                    doctrines of dogmatics; or, in other words, with the advance of theology,
                    Apologetics gives place to speculative theology, which shows the various
                    relations in which each particular dogma stands to all other dogmas, whether
                    theological or other.</p>
                <p>Apologetics, as the justification and vindication of Christian theology, has to
                    deal with two great questions: (1), Can man know God? and (2), Does man know God
                    <hi rend="italic">1</hi> Is a theology possible? and if so, is Christianity
                    true, and the theology which it gives, the true theology <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ί</hi></p>
                <p>Under the· first question are discussed all the various topics concerning man and
                    his natural capacities for a knowledge of God and the things of God, the natural
                    craving for a knowledge of the supernatural, the intimations more or less
                    obscure of a higher than merely natural life.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n203/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0203-0190"/>
                <p>Under this head comes every discussion concerning the capacities in man for the
                    knowledge of God, and concerning the actual amount of knowledge which man has
                    had of God apart from revelation. The apologist endeavours to show from
                    psychology, metaphysics, and other sources of knowledge capable of aiding him in
                    his research, that man is a religious as well as an intelligent being, that
                    theology on its formal side has a real basis in the human mind, and that
                    whenever the objects of theological science are presented to the mind, they may
                    be assimilated by these faculties. Many delicate questions arise here—the whole
                    question of anthropomorphism, for example. It is argued that because our
                    knowledge of God and of divine things must pass through and be assimilated by
                    human faculties, it must necessarily be as much human as divine, and in this way
                    the divine is more or less transformed into the human, and becomes
                    anthropomorphic. The doctrine of the personality of God is often instanced as a
                    notable example of anthropomorphism in theology. Apologetics vindicates theology
                    from this charge by ascertaining from psychology whether the human factor tends
                    to vitiate all human knowledge, and what is the precise influence of the formal
                    element, or that element which the mind supplies, upon the material of human
                    knowledge; and in this way tries to show that theology, while it is knowledge
                    which passes through the mind of man, is not necessarily anthropomorphic.</p>
                <p>But man has not merely capacity to know God and divine things, he actually does
                    know something about these things; they have actually become objects or material
                    of human knowledge. This brings us within the range of natural theology, which
                    is just the sum of the knowledge which man, apart from revelation, has about
                    God. Natural theology may be studied and its results presented in two different
                    ways. Paley, Butler, and Chalmers, for example, have endeavoured, from an
                    analysis of the human mind and character, to describe the kind and amount of
                    knowledge which man has of the being and attributes of God, of the moral
                    government of the world, of the immortality of the soul, and of the future state
                    of reward and punishment. This method of inquiry is open to the objection, that
                    it is very difficult to separate between what man has acquired by revelation and
                    what he possesses without revelation, if the mind analysed be one already
                    impregnated by Christianity. Hence it is well to supplement and correct the
                    knowledge obtained in this way by an historical survey of what man has actually
                    known and taught concerning God and divine things in the great natural religions
                    which have existed, and still exist. Natural theology, in this sense of the
                    word, is the result of a comparative history of religions, and contains a
                    methodical summary of all the various religious ideas which have been evolved in
                    the religious experience of mankind. The historical method is useful to correct
                    the analytic, and the analytic gives order and method to the historical. This
                    historical method is as yet in its infancy, but few historical sciences are
                    engaging more attention than the new science of religions, and its growth cannot
                    fail to have a considerable effect upon the future course of Apologetics. It
                    looks upon all religions as more or less related to each other, and seeks to
                    find the real course of the development of religious ideas, and natural theology
                    becomes in this way the orderly statement of the various religious truths which
                    each natural religion has contributed to the sum of the religious knowledge of
                    the race; and every great religion is conceived to leave behind it a residuum
                    which is its contribution to natural theology. But while Christian Apologetics
                    thankfully acknowledges the contributions made by natural theology to our
                    knowledge of God and His relations to us, it is always much more disposed to
                    regard them as of indirect than of direct value. They are of more use in showing
                    that man has capacities whereby he may arrive at a knowledge of theology, that
                    he has aspirations which can only be satisfied by theology, than in furnishing
                    actual and reliable information about God and His relations to us. They serve to
                    prove that man is able to learn truths about God if the true materials of
                    information were presented to him; or, in other words, in Apologetics natural
                    theology has a <hi rend="italic">formal</hi> rather tlιan a <hi rend="italic"
                    >material</hi> value.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Does</hi> man know God <hi rend="italic">1</hi> Is the
                    Christian theology <hi rend="italic">true?</hi> Christianity is founded on
                    certain presuppositions, can these be vindicated? The most important of these is
                    the presupposition of the possibility and actual existence of a divine
                    revelation, or a superhuman source of knowledge of God and His relations to us,
                    and the most important task of Apologetics is to vindicate the possibility and
                    existence of the Christian revelation. It is because it possesses this
                    revelation that Christianity claims for itself a position altogether different
                    from other religions, and hence the possibility and fact of a revelation have
                    always been attacked by antichristian speculation. The precise point of attack
                    has varied continually, but in the present day the chief objection to a
                    revelation, in the Christian sense of the word, is based upon the fact, that an
                    historical study of religions shows that every religion has professed to be
                    founded upon a divine revelation, and claims for itself the same supernatural
                    sanction which the Christian theologian declares to be the exclusive possession
                    of Christianity. To this the apologist answers, that the fact that numberless
                    false claims have been made is not a sufficient ground for summarily rejecting
                    the claim of Christianity, which has to be judged upon its own merits; he then
                    proceeds to point out, that just as Christianity professes to be different. in
                    kind, and not in degree only, from other religions, so the Christian revelation
                    is one generically distinct, even in the external form which it assumes, from
                    all other supposed revelations. While most pretended revelations claim to be the
                    promulgation of divine truths, the Christian revelation is the manifestation of
                    a divine life in the world, the intrusion into human history of a divine force,
                    which, flowing on from generation to generation, at last condenses itself in the
                    presence and person of the Lord Jesus Christ, the perfect revelation of God. It
                    is sufficient to disprove the claims of any pretended revelation, to show that
                    the truths it teaches might have been reached without any special and
                    supernatural communication; but before the Christian revelation can be
                    discredited, it must be shown that the divine life in the world, which reached
                    its most perfect development in Jesus Christ, is not specifically different from
                    the life of man,—that Jesus Christ was a mere man, not different in kind from
                    other men. The great difference, then, between the Christian and other so-called
                    revelations is, that it ends and is summed up in the person and work of Christ,
                    and so is a consistent whole; while they do not end in a life like that of
                    Christ, and lacking this to bind them together into a unity, are merely a more
                    or less disjointed series of statements—not even the record of supernatural
                    manifestation, still less that manifestation itself.</p>
                <p>The first thing, therefore, that Apologetics has to do, in this its second and
                    most important division, is to describe the character and meaning of revelation,
                    discuss the possibility of the thing from all sides,—logical, metaphysical, and
                    moral,—show that it can be known by man, and prove its necessity for the
                    religious life of mankind.</p>
                <p>The apologist must describe carefully the character and course of this divine
                    life which has entered into history for the purpose of redemption, explaining it
                    both on its objective side of manifestation and on its subjective sidθ of
                    inspiration. He has to show how it appears in <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n204/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0204-0191"/> miracle, and is apprehended by the mind specially
                    fitted for this apprehension; and he points out that such a conception as that
                    of the Christian revelation, such an idea aβ.that of the continuous
                    manifestation of God in the world, does not belong to any pagan religion or
                    theology.</p>
                <p>This manifestation of God, which is <hi rend="italic">miracle</hi> in the proper
                    sense of the word, and the special apprehension of it, which is <hi
                    rend="italic">inspiration</hi> in the more limited meaning, have happened, and
                    have been recorded, and the apologist has therefore as much to do with the
                    record of the revelation as with the revelation itself; and hence, after the
                    preliminary investigations into the nature of revelation and its twin sides,
                    manifestation and inspiration, comes an investigation of the sources from which
                    we derive our knowledge of this revelation. The whole question of the Canon of
                    Scripture must, therefore, be looked into and settled, the character, historical
                    or other, the authenticity, and the credibility of the various books of the Old
                    and New Testaments must be discussed, and whatever assistance in this task can
                    be obtained from contemporary history must be taken advantage of. Connected with
                    this inquiry, several difficult and delicate questions arise, about the relation
                    between inspiration and perfect historical accuracy in every point, the
                    questions of plenary and non-plenary inspiration, whether plenary inspiration
                    requires perfect accuracy in minute details of history, whether it demands
                    scientific accuracy of description, &amp;c., none of which can be entered into
                    here.</p>
                <p>From the records of the revelation the apologist turns to the revelation itself.
                    We have already distinguished the Christian from other pretended revelations, by
                    saying that it is a revelation which has Christ, while other revelations have
                    not Christ, and in our day the whole attack and defence have centred round the
                    doctrine of our Lord Jesus Christ. The opponents of Christianity, feeling that
                    the core of the system which they are attacking is the supernatural life of
                    Christ, set themselves to attack that conception, and they do so by attempting
                    to show, either that there was no such life as that of the Jesus Christ of the
                    Gospels, or else that it was not supernatural—there was no such man as Jesus
                    Christ, or if there was, He did not differ wholly from other men. The first mode
                    of attack is that adopted by D. F. Strauss, and the second that of Ernest Renan
                    and others. Strauss’s position is somewhat of this kind: the historical and the
                    supernatural are so inextricably mixed the one with the other that they cannot
                    be separated, but the supernatural is on general grounds impossible, and
                    therefore the historical is impossible also. He accordingly sets himself to show
                    that the Gospels are not credible as history, and he resolves the Gospel life of
                    Jesus of Nazareth into a poem, <hi rend="italic">the</hi> poem of the Jewish
                    nation and, indeed, of the human race. This is the basis of his celebrated
                    mythical theory. Renan, on the other hand, cannot admit the thorough-going
                    destructive criticism of Strauss. There must have been such a life as that of
                    Jesus of Nazareth, although the account we have of it is a highly coloured
                    picture. He admits the life, but denies the supernatural element in it, and
                    explains it by saying that it was created round about the historical life by the
                    enthusiasm of the early disciples; in short, he separates the historical from
                    the supernatural, and while he admits the one he rejects the other. The
                    apologist answers such attacks as these very much by pitting the one antagonist
                    against the other. He asserts with Strauss that the historical and the
                    supernatural are inseparably blended, and he takes from Renan the general idea,
                    that, according to all laws of historical research, the Gospel narratives are
                    truly historical. In this way he tries to show, specially against Strauss, that
                    there is no time, even if the Gospel narratives are brought down to the latest
                    possible date, for the growth of the poem into which he resolves the life of
                    Christ; and specially against Renan, he points out that if the historical be
                    granted even only to the length to which Renan goes, it is so blended with the
                    supernatural that the miraculous cannot be separated from it. This defence of
                    the historical and supernatural character of the life of Christ, and of
                    Christianity because it has the life of Christ as its centre and essence, widens
                    into a general description of His position and character as these are shown in
                    the Gospels. Apologetics tries to show that Jesus Christ is, as it were, the sum
                    of all the previous revelation of God contained in the Old Testament. It traces
                    the broadening down of revelation, in order to show how perfectly the life of
                    Christ came as the conclusion and perfection of all that went before, and that
                    it fulfilled both Jewish prophecy and pagan aspiration. It attempts to show that
                    Jesus is not merely the actual and perfect fulfilment of every previous
                    theophany, but that He is and must be the Perfect Revelation of God. It does
                    this in various ways: by describing the character of Jesus, unique
                    intellectually and unique morally; by describing the teaching of Jesus, and its
                    marvellous similarity and yet dissimilarity with the doctrines of Jewish
                    revelation and Gentile philosophy; by describing the actual work of Jesus, by
                    showing that in Him miracle or manifestation and prophecy or inspiration came to
                    their culmination; and by pointing to the mission of the Holy Ghost and the
                    victorious spread of Christianity throughout the world. Such is a short outline
                    of Apologetics and the field of investigation which it occupies: we shall now
                    proceed to give a short summary of the history of the study.</p>
                <p>The historical course of Apologetics may be divided into five great periods
                    :—</p>
                <p>The first period, extending from the beginning of the 2d century to the end of
                    the 5th, may be subdivided into two: (1.) From the beginning of the 2d to the
                    beginning of the 3d century; and, (2.) From the beginning of the 3d to the end
                    of the 5th. The first of these is marked by the writings of Justin Martyr,
                    Athenagoras, Tertullian, and Minucius Felix. The two Apologies of Justin were
                    directed, the one against the Jews, and the other against the pagans. In both he
                    follows the same method of justifying the Christian religion from the charges
                    which were then commonly brought against it, and then attacking his opponents
                    severely. All the apologists of this age follow the same course, and we see from
                    their writings that the common attacks upon Christianity were charges of
                    atheism, immorality practised at their Agapae, the Thyestaean banquets, and the
                    like. The second of these periods is marked by the writings of Origen, Arnobius,
                    Lactantius, Eusebius, Cyril of Alexandria, Augustine. These names show the
                    course that Apologetics was taking. It had raised itself far above the position
                    of a mere defence against vulgar prejudice and polished sarcasm; and Origen,
                    when he opposed Celsus, was giving a philosophical defence against a
                    philosophical attack upon the principles which lay at the basis of Christianity
                    <hi rend="italic">(cf.</hi> Pressensé’s <hi rend="italic">Hist, de V</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Eglise,</hi> 2 <hi rend="superscript"> mβ</hi> série, ii. pp.
                    104-142). With Arnobius begins the study of Christian evidences; and he tries to
                    show that Christianity is not merely probable, but certainly true; while
                    Lactantius proceeds upon the idea that, if Christianity be only clearly
                    understood, it must be accepted, that its best defence is a clear statement of
                    the principles on which it rests. Eusebius, on the other hand, is the first of
                    the learned apologists, and proves the truth of Christianity by an elaborate
                    comparison between it and all that was best in the various systems which went
                    before it, and so far prepared the way for it. Cyril opposes Julian as Origen
                    had opposed Celsus. Julian had directed his attack against the claims of
                    Christianity to universal dominion; he admitted that it was one form, but denied
                    that it was the only form of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n205/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0205-0192"/> truth, and Cyril’s defence is interesting,
                    inasmuch as it is the first answer of the Christian apologist to the objections
                    of the pure Theist. Augustine’s great work, the <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Civitate</hi><hi rend="italic">Dei,</hi> is apologetic in so far
                    as it endeavours to show that Christianity and the church are the.only ark of
                    safety in presence of the dissolution of the empire and human society which then
                    seemed imminent. In this second division of the first period, Christianity has
                    become triumphant, and the duty of Apologetics has not been to defend it from
                    the coarse attacks of passion and prejudice, but to give a philosophical answer
                    to philosophical objections, and then to show how Christianity adapts itself to
                    the intellectual, moral, and political requirements of men and nations.</p>
                <p>The second period dates from the 6th to the middle of the 15th century. It is
                    that period in the history of theology in which the church attempted to rule
                    thoroughly the intellectual life of mankind; when the <hi rend="italic">ecclesia
                    salvans</hi> had become an <hi rend="italic">ecclesia docens,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">ecclesioe patres</hi> had given place to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >ecclesioe</hi><hi rend="italic">scholastici.</hi> It embraces the growth, life,
                    and decline of scholasticism. In this period there are no direct attacks upon
                    Christianity, and so no direct defences of it; but still Apologetics, although
                    for the most part absorbed into the sum of Christian doctrine, and recognisable
                    only in the attempt to assimilate philosophy and theology, is to some extent
                    visible in the jealous defence of particular doctrines against the attacks of
                    Nominalism, and reveals itself more prominently in the attacks made by Christian
                    theologians upon the Jewish and the Mahometan religions. Such works as Abelard’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Dialogus</hi><hi rend="italic">inter</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Philosophum,</hi><hi rend="italic">Judoeum</hi><hi rend="italic">et

                    >Fidei</hi><hi rend="italic">contra Gentiles,</hi> are the best examples of the
                    Apologetics of this second period.</p>
                <p>The third period extends from the middle of the 15th to the middle of the 17th
                    century. This was the age of the Renaissance and of the Reformation, an age of
                    inquiry, doubt, and change. Along with the Reformation, keeping with it as long
                    as it was merely destructive, and abandoning it as soon as it became
                    constructive, was a spirit or tendency, best described by the term Humanism. The
                    Humanists were men who were thoroughly imbued with the spirit of the old
                    classical poets of Greece and Rome, and had imbibed many of the old pagan ideas
                    with reference to Christianity. Humanism, which was at first learning revived,
                    contained within it two tendencies which afterwards showed themselves hostile to
                    Christianity: the first was embodied in literary criticism, and mainly displayed
                    the antagonism between literature and dogma, while the other took the form of a
                    pantheist philosophy founded on the divinity of Nature. The most notable of the
                    apologetical works of this period are those of Marcilius Ficinus <hi

                    >Christiana),</hi> Eugubinus Steuchus <hi rend="italic">(De</hi><hi

                    rend="italic">Christianoe).</hi></p>
                <p>The fourth period extends from the middle of the 17th to the end of the 18th
                    century. During this period, anti-christian speculation assumes distinct forms,
                    and Apologetics undergoes corresponding changes. The period has three divisions,
                    which are to some extent successive, but are best distinguished by the form of
                    unbelief then prevalent—the English deism, the French scepticism, and the German
                    rationalism. The English deism, which began with Lord Herbert of Cherbury and
                    Hobbes, and ended with Hume, called forth an innumerable number of replies from
                    Christian theologians, and the special nature of the attack then made upon
                    Christianity still gives their special form to English works upon Apologetics.
                    The general tone of English Deists was that there was no warrant for the
                    mysteries in Christianity, for its superior morality, for its historical
                    position and influence, and so English Apologetics has been mainly concerned
                    with the doctrine of the <hi rend="italic">evidences</hi> of Christianity; and
                    the general line of argument commonly taken has been, that there is as much
                    evidence for Christianity as for some ordinary set of opinions generally
                    admitted. Thus Bishop Berkeley’s <hi rend="italic">Alciphron, or the Minute
                    Philosopher,</hi> among other things, aims at establishing the existence of God
                    by showing that the evidence is as strong as the evidence for the existence of
                    our fellow-men; Locke’s <hi rend="italic">Reasonableness of Christianity</hi>
                    shows that the Christian theology attacked is in all points able to be
                    satisfactorily explained in accordance with human reason, if the same methods of
                    investigation and adjustment be allowed, which are usually permitted when
                    testing the reasonableness of any common statement or opinion; and in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Analogy</hi> of Bishop Butler the whole argument rests upon the
                    basis:—the Deists make certain statements about religion; if these be true they
                    contain as many difficulties as are to be found in Christianity, and
                    difficulties of the same kind, therefore Christianity is as reasonable, at
                    least, as deism or any system of mere natural theology. In the French
                    scepticism, the principal charge made against Christianity was that it rested on
                    imposture and was maintained by trickery. An attack of this kind is answered,
                    not so much by special defence, as by a silent appeal to historical testimony
                    and to the character of man, and it is not to be wondered at if the French
                    Church has not produced any very valuable apologetic writings defending
                    Christianity from the special attacks of this schooL The German rationalism
                    began with Lessing’s publication of the <hi rend="italic">Wolfenbüttel</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Fragments,</hi> (extracts from a work by Reimarus, a schoolmaster
                    at Hamburg), and ended w ith Kant. In its earlier form it was little else than
                    an importation of the ideas of the English Deists, but latterly it assumed a
                    special form by upholding the authority of the <hi rend="italic">individual</hi>
                    reason. The replies to the ordinary arguments of the English Deists were very
                    numerous <hi rend="italic">(cf.</hi> Lechler’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Geschichte</hi><hi rend="italic">des Engl.</hi><hi rend="italic">Deismus),</hi>
                    but do not deserve further notice. The authority of the individual reason may be
                    vindicated, either in the province of criticism or in that of dogma; the one
                    effort gave rise to the critical rationalism of Eichhorn and Paulus, and the
                    other to the dogmatic rationalism of Wegscheider. The critical rationalism of
                    Eichhorn and his school has been gradually answered by the advance of criticism
                    itself, which shows a progressive tendency towards higher and more spiritual
                    ideas, if not to a recognition of the inspired authority of Scripture. The
                    dogmatic rationalism of Wegscheider has fallen before the new impulse given to
                    dogmatic theology by Schleiermacher and Neander.</p>
                <p>At the present time Apologetics seems to be in a transition state. Since the time
                    of Kant the historical method of investigation has become all powerful in almost
                    every department of human knowledge, and at the present the chief attacks made
                    upon the supernatural and unique character of the Christian religion and
                    theology are based upon the comparative science of religions. It is held that
                    the Christian religion is the highest and most perfect development to which the
                    religious spirit of man has yet reached, but that it simply differs in degree of
                    development from any other religion. It is said that the Christian theology
                    contains, like all other theologies, a great many elements of truth, but that it
                    is simply a natural religion like any other. This mode of attack has not yet
                    been thoroughly faced by Christian apologists, but it must be the work of the
                    Apologetics of the future to vindicate the supernatural character of
                    Christianity by arguments which are based upon historical investigation and
                    comparison of the different religions of mankind. For the general out·</p>
