                <p><label type="entry">ANCONA</label>, a province of the kingdom of Italy, bounded
                    on the N. by the Adriatic Sea and the province of Pesaro-Urbino, on the W. by
                    Pesaro-Urbino and Umbria, on the S. by Macerata, and on the E. by the Adriatic.
                    It forms part of the old district of the Marches, which passed from the dominion
                    of the Pope to that of Victor Emmanuel in 1860. The Marches comprise the March
                    of Ancona on the north and the March of Fermo on the south, although the whole
                    territory is sometimes called the March of Ancona. The name, however, has long
                    ceased to be the official designation of any part of Italy, and the present
                    province of Ancona, which has an area of 740 square miles, and a population of
                    262,369, corresponds in extent neither to the March of Ancona, nor to the Papal
                    delegation of the same name. There is little that is peculiar in the physical
                    features of the province; the rivers are small and unimportant, and the hills
                    are of no great height. Agriculture is the chief industry, and the sod, although
                    naturally poor, yields large and profitable crops through the energy of its <pb

                    to the rearing of cattle and sheep, and the vine and the mulberry-are grown to
                    some extent. The cultivation of the silkworm has not of late years been very
                    successful, owing to the prevalence of disease in the worm. Chalk, sulphur, and
                    raw petroleum are found, in different parts of the province, but as yet little
                    has been done to utilise those discoveries. The principal towns are Ancona,
                    Jesi, and Osimo.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Ancona,</hi> a city of Italy, and capital of the province of
                    the same name, is pleasantly situated on the Adriatic, 132 miles N.E. of Rome,
                    in a sort of amphitheatre between two hills—Monte Ciriaco and Monte Guasco or
                    Conero. The streets are narrow and irregular, but the city contains some fine
                    buildings, among which may be mentioned the cathedral of St Ciriaco (which is
                    said to occupy the site of an ancient and famous temple of Venus), several of
                    the churches, and the citadel. The harbour, one of the best on the Adriatic, is
                    defended by several forts and protected by two moles. On the older of these
                    moles there is a magnificent triumphal arch of Parian marble, erected in honour
                    of the Emperor Trajan, by whom the mole was built, while the other mole
                    possesses a second arch, of much inferior beauty, dedicated to Pope Benedict
                    XIV. Ancona ceased to be a free port in 1869, and this circumstance, together
                    with the gradual accumulation of mud in the harbour, and the conversion of a
                    mercantile ship-building yard into a naval arsenal, has had a very unfavourable
                    effect upon the commerce of the place. In 1843 the value of the imports was
                    £1,020,770, and of the exports £428,219; in 1869 the respective amounts had
                    decreased to £585,296, and £157,969. The chief articles imported are coal,
                    hardware, sugar, fish, cottons, woollens, linens, lead, iron, and petroleum;
                    while the chief exports are wheat, maize, wine, rags, liquorice, and
                    manufactured goods; the principal manufactures of the town being silk, paper,
                    tallow, wax, and leather. Ancona has a population of 46,000, many of whom are
                    Jews and Greeks. The city was founded about 380 B.c. by Syracusan exiles, who
                    fled from Sicily in order to escape the tyranny of the elder Dionysius. From its
                    admirable position it rapidly rose in importance as a seaport, and it also
                    became celebrated for its purple dye. The exact time of its subjection to the
                    Romans is uncertain, but it was probably about 268 B.C., when the rest of
                    Picenum came under the power of Rome. After the dissolution of the Western
                    Empire, Ancona was plundered by the Goths, Lombards, and Saracens successively,
                    but it always recovered its strength and importance, and eventually became a
                    semi-independent republic, under the protection of the Popes. It continued in
                    this position until 1532, when Clement VII. made himself master of it, and
                    incorporated it with the Papal dominion. In 1797 it was taken by the French,
                    who, in 1799, had in turn to surrender to a combined force of Austrians,
                    Russians, and Turks, after a long and gallant defence under General Meunier. The
                    French recovered possession of it in 1805, and soon after annexed it to their
                    kingdom of Italy, but the Treaty of Vienna restored it to the Pope in 1815. In
                    1832 the French seized Ancona, in order to check the Austrians, who were then
                    occupying Bologna and the surrounding country; and they retained possession of
                    it until the Austrians evacuated the Papal territory in 1838. In 1860 Ancona was
                    held by a hastily organised body of Belgians and Irishmen under the command of
                    the French general, Lamoricière. It was here that Lamoricière retired after his
                    disastrous defeat at Castelfidardo by Cial-dini, when Victor Emanuel determined
                    on invading the Papal States. On the 29th of September (eleven days after
                    Castelfidardo), Lamoricière capitulated at Ancona with his entire army. In 1861
                    the city of Ancona, like the rest of the province, became part of the new
                    kingdom of Italy.</p>
