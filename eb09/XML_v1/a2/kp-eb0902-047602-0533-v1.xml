                <p><label type="entry">ARCHON</label> (αρχών), the title of the highest magistrates
                    in Athens. The last king of Athens, Cpdrus, having given up his life for the
                    advantage of the state, it is said that the people, out of gratitude for his
                    noble act, passed a resolution that in future none of their rulers should bear
                    the ancient and venerated title of king (βασιλεύς). The holder of supreme power
                    in the state received from that time the name of archon or ruler. This is the
                    popular account of the change, but it is not improbable that, on the death of
                    Codrus, disputes arose with regard to the succession, and that the nobles took
                    advantage of the opportunity to gain an addition to their own power. For the
                    archon appears to have been in all respects equal to the king, and his office
                    was hereditary, but he was made responsible for his acts to the Eupatridae or
                    nobles. Thirteen descendants of Codrus successively held the office. In 752
                    B.C., during the archonship of Alcmaeon, the time of office was reduced to ten
                    years, though the office itself remained hereditary. Seven decennial archons are
                    enumerated, extending from 752 to 684. But during this time, about the year 714,
                    a very important change had been introduced j,nto the archonship. The office at
                    that date ceased to be hereditary; the exclusive right of the Medontidae was
                    abolished, and the whole body of nobles became eligible for the magistracy. In
                    684 a further change was effected; the office was made annual, and the supreme
                    power was distributed among nine officials, each of whom received the title of
                    archon. This arrangement of the magistracy continued till the time of Solon, who
                    introduced the classification of the citizens according to property and not to
                    birth, and threw the office open to all who possessed an income of the first
                    class, apparently calculated as five hundred measures of corn, wine, and oil
                    (Plutarch, <hi rend="italic">Aristides,</hi> 1). The most extensive and
                    important change was introduced by Aristides, who after the battle of Plataea
                    threw open the highest magistracy to all citizens, whether of the propertied
                    class or not. The mode of election to the archonship, after the, office was
                    taken from the family of Codrus, was by the suffrage (χειpoτoviα) of the nobles;
                    and this continued to be the case even after the reform effected by Solon, for
                    it is expressly stated that though he altered the qualification he made no
                    change in the manner of election. The great reform in this respect was probably
                    due to Clisthenes, who in 508 introduced the election by lot, and who further,
                    by his distribution of the people into tribes and appointment of generals,
                    seriously impaired the power of the archons. To secure that the office and
                    honours were not conferred on unworthy persons, the newly elected archons were
                    subjected to a double scrutiny, before the senate and in the agora, in which
                    they were required to show that they were true Athenian citizens, whose
                    ancestors had been citizens for three generations, and to swear that they would
                    obey the laws and revere the religion of their country.</p>
                <p>Of the nine archons to whom in conjunction were entrusted the duties of the
                    supreme magistracy, the first was called specially “The Archon” (ό αρχών); there
                    was also attached to his name the epithet <hi rend="italic">eponymτιs</hi>
                    Γe7rωvυp,os), because the year in which he held office was named after him, just
                    as at Rome it was named after the two consuls. At first this archon had the
                    general administration of state affairs, but gradually the expansion of
                    democratic power reduced his authority, and at the period of which we have
                    accurate information his duties were not very extensive. He had the
                    sunerintendence of the festivals of the greater Dionysia and of the Thargelia,
                    the arrangement of the tragic choruses, and the conduct of certain sacrifices.
                    As a special department of civil administration, he had under his care all
                    orphans, particularly heiresses, all widows, and others who were left without
                    protection, provided they were citizens of Athens; and had, in short, the charge
                    of all matters in which questions of inheritance were involved. When his power
                    was still further reduced, there remained to him the privilege of bringing
                    disputed cases of succession into the proper courts, and of casting lots for the
                    dicasts who were to try tho cause. The second archon had the title of king
                    (βασιλε.υς); to him had been handed over the name, as well as the sacred duties
                    of priesthood which formerly belonged to the supreme ruler. He was the <hi
                    rend="italic">rex</hi><hi rend="italic">sacrorum,</hi> and to his province
                    pertained all that concerned the religion and public worship of the state. In
                    conjunction with his wife, who was called <hi rend="italic">βασίλισσα</hi> (or
                    queen), he offered up certain state sacrifices; and he had specially intrusted
                    to him the superintendence of the mysteries, the festival of the Lenaea, the
                    torch races, and the gymnic contests. He acted as public prosecutor in matters
                    of religion · and, in cases of murder or offence against the gods, he brought
                    the indictment into the Areopagus, and voted with its members. In later times he
                    acted as president of the court in all cases concerning the rights and duties of
                    priests. The third archon bore the title of polemarch (7roλε'p,αpχoς), which
                    indicates that originally he was the supreme commander of the Athenian forces.
                    As late as the battle of Marathon we find the polemarch Callimachus marching
                    along with the ten generals, and taking the command of the right wing. But after
                    this we no longer hear of the polemarch as actively engaged in leading the army.
                    Doubtless the introduction of the ten generals by Clisthenes tended to limit the
                    military functions of this archon. His duties in later times seem to have been
                    the superintendence and protection of the personal and family rights of the
                    resident aliens and foreigners. To these he stood in the same relation as the
                    archon eponymus stood to citizens. He had also the arrangement of the funeral
                    games in honour of those who had fallen in battle, and the offering up of the
                    annual sacrifice to Artemis in commemoration of the battle of Marathon. Each of
                    the three superior archons was allowed to select two assessors or assistants
                    (7rαpεδp0ι), who were sanctioned after examination by the senate. The remaining
                    six archons were called thesmothetae (0εσp∙o0εrαι), a name which is sometimes
                    applied to the whole body of archons. The six formed a college of justice, whose
                    jurisdiction seems at first to have extended to all cases not directly under the
                    cognisance of other magistrates. They received information against parties for
                    various offences, brought the cases to trial in the proper court, appointed the
                    juries, and gave public notice of the days of sitting. They revised every year
                    the body of laws to see that no discrepancies were allowed to creep in, and they
                    were required to enter all new laws. They also drew up and ratified the treaties
                    with foreign states. Their assessors were called symbuli <hi rend="italic"
                    >(σνμβονλοι).</hi> After the introduction of popular courts by Solon, the
                    archons seem to have lost their special juridical powers; they then acted simply
                    as presidents of the courts and sometimes as a grand jury. During their year of
                    office the archons were exempt from all state burdens, and at its close they
                    were required to give an account of the manner in which they had discharged
                    their duties; if found blameless, they became members of the Areopagus.</p>
                <p>The name archon is frequently applied by Greek authors to magistrates in general;
                    it w’as also used as a title under the Greek empire, and the Jews sometimes
                    applied it to members of their Sanhedrim. It was even given metaphorically by
                    the Gnostice to their mystic aeons.</p>
