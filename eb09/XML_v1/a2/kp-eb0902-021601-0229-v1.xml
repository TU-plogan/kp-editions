                <p><label type="entry">APULIA</label>, the name applied to a district of southern
                    Italy, the limits of which were not very definitely or permanently marked. It is
                    usually regarded as having been bounded by the country of the Frentani on the
                    N., Samnium on the W., Calabria and LucaDia on the S., and the Adriatic on the
                    E. The northern portion comprised the district sloping eastward from the
                    Apennines, but did not take in any part of the mountains themselves; while the
                    southern portion was occupied by a rocky off-shoot of the main chain, which left
                    only a narrow but fertile strip of land along the sea. On the northern part of
                    the coast was the remarkable mountain-mass of Garganus, forming an enormous
                    promontory. Apulia was watered by the Tifernus <hi rend="italic">fBifemd),</hi>
                    the Frento (Fbrtore), the Cerbalus <hi rend="italic">(Cervaro),</hi> the Aufidus
                    <hi rend="italic">(f)fantd),</hi> and a number of intermittent mountain streams.
                    The soil for the most part was calcareous and arid, but in winter afforded
                    abundant pasturage for the sheep, that in ancient times as now were driven
                    during the summer to the neighbouring highlands of Samnium. Of the mingled
                    population of Apulia, the Apulians proper (of Oscan race, it is supposed), the
                    Daunians (perhaps of Pelasgian origin), and the Peucetians or Poediculi
                    (likewise Pelasgian), seem to have been the principal elements. The prevalent
                    language, according to Mommsen’s investigations, was distinct from the Oscan and
                    related to the Greek. Direct Greek influence—probably emanating from Tarentum—is
                    evident in the workmanship and inscriptions of the coins and vases and other
                    remains which have been discovered throughout the region. The more important
                    towns were Larinum (1), Teanum, Luceria, Arpi, Salapia, Sipontum, Canusium,
                    Barium, Egnatia, and Venusia. Reduced under Roman dominion in the 4th century
