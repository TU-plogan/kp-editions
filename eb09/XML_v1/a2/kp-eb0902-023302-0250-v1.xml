                <p><label type="entry">ARABESQUE</label>, a term to which a meaning is now commonly
                    given that is historically incorrect. We apply it to the grotesque decoration
                    derived from Roman remains of the early time of the empire, not to any style
                    derived from Arabian or Moorish work; the term is therefore a misnomer.
                    Arabesque and Moresque are really distinct; the latter is from the Arabian style
                    of ornament, developed by the Byzantine Greeks for their new masters, after the
                    conquests of the followers of Mahomet; and the former is a term pretty well
                    restricted to varieties of Cinquecento decoration, which have nothing in common
                    with any Arabian examples in their details, but are a development derived from
                    Greek and Roman grotesque designs, such as we find them in the remains of
                    ancient palaces at Rome, and in ancient houses at Pompeii These were reproduced
                    by Raphael and his pupils in the decoration of some of <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0251-0234"/> the corridors of the Loggie of the Vatican at
                    Rome: grotesque is thus a better name for these decorations than Arabesque.</p>
                <p>This technical Arabesque, therefore, is much more ancient than any Arabian or
                    Moorish decoration, and has really nothing in common'with it except the mere
                    symmetrical principles of its arrangement. Pliny and Vitruvius give us no name
                    for the extravagant decorative wall-painting in vogue in their time, to which
                    the early Italian revivers of it seem to have given the designation of
                    grotesque, because it was first discovered in the arched or underground chambers
                    <hi rend="italic">{grotte)</hi> of Roman ruins—as in the golden house of Nero,
                    or the baths of Titus. What really took place in the Italian revival was in some
                    measure a supplanting of the Arabesque for the classical grotesque, still
                    retaining the original Arabian designation, while the genuine Arabian art, the
                    Saracenic, was distinguished as Moresque or Moorish. So it is now the original
                    Arabesque that is called by its specific names of Saracenic, Moorish, and
                    Alhambresque, while the term Arabesque is applied exclusively to the style
                    developed from the debased classical grotesque of the Roman empire.</p>
                <p>There is still much of the genuine Saracenic element in Renaissance Arabesques,
                    especially in that selected for book-borders and for silver-work, the details of
                    which consist largely of the conventional Saracenic foliations. But the
                    Arabesque developed in the Italian Cinquecento work repudiated all the original
                    Arabian elements and devices, and limited itself to the manipulating of the
                    classical elements, of which the most prominent feature is ever the floriated or
                    foliated scroll; and it is in this Cinquecento decoration, whether in sculpture
                    or in painting, that <hi rend="italic">Arabesque</hi> has been perfected.</p>
                <p>We will first briefly describe the Saracenic, as the elder sister of the two
                    styles, which was ingeniously developed by the Byzantine Greek artists for their
                    Arabian masters in the early times of Mahometan conquest. Every natural
                    object-was proscribed; the artists were, therefore, reduced to making
                    symmetrical designs from forms which should have no positive meaning <hi
                    rend="italic">; yet</hi> the Byzantine Greeks, who were Christians, managed to
                    work even their own ecclesiastical symbols, in a disguised manner, into their
                    tracery and diapers; as the lily, for instance. The cross was not so introduced;
                    this, of course, was inadmissible; but neither was the crescent ever introduced
                    into any of this early work in Damascus or Cairo. The crescent was itself not a
                    Mahometan device till after the conquest of Constantinople in 1453 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> The crescent, as the new moon, was the symbol of
                    Byzantium; and it was only after that capital of the Eastern empire fell into
                    the hands of the Turks that this symbol was adopted by them. The crescent and
                    the cross became antagonist standards, therefore, first in the 15 th century.
                    And the crescent is not an element of original Moorish decoration.</p>
                <p>The Alhambra diapers and original Majolica (Majorca) ware afford admirable
                    specimens of genuine Saracenic or Moorish decoration. A conventional floriage is
                    common in these diaper3; tracery also is a great feature in this work, in
                    geometrical combinations, whether rectilinear or curvilinear; and the designs
                    are rich in colour: idolatry was in the reproduction of natural forms, not in
                    the fanciful combination of natural colours. These curves and angles, therefore,
                    or interlacings, chiefly in stucco, constitute the prominent elements of an
                    Arabian ornamental design, combining also Arabic inscriptions; composed of a
                    mass of foliation or floral forms conventionally disguised, as the exclusion of
                    all natural images was the fundamental principle of the style in its purity. The
                    Alhambra displays almost endless specimens of this peculiar work, all in relief,
                    highly coloured, and profusely enriched with gold. The mosque of Touloun, in
                    Cairo, 876 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> the known work of a Greek, affords
                    the completest example of this art in its early time; and Sicily contains many
                    remains of this same exquisite Saracenic decoration.</p>
                <p>Such is the genuine Arabesque of the Arabs, but a very different style of design
                    is now implied by the term—the Arabesque of the Cinquecento, a purely classical
                    ornamentation. This owes its origin to the excavation and recovery of ancient
                    monuments, and was developed chiefly by the sculptors of the north, and the
                    painters of Central Italy; by the Lombardi of Venice, by Agostino Busti of
                    Milan, by Bramanti of Urbino, by Raphael, by Giulio Romano, and others of nearly
                    equal merit.</p>
                <p>Very beautiful examples in sculpture of this Cinquecento Arabesque are found in
                    the churches of Venice, Verona, and Brescia; while in painting, the most
                    complete specimens are those of the Vatican Loggie, and the Villa Madama at Rome
                    and the ducal palaces at Mantua. The Vatican Arabesques, chiefly executed for
                    Raphael by Giulio Romano, Gian Francesco Penui, and Giovanni da Udine, though
                    beautiful as works of painting, are often very extravagant in their composition,
                    ludicrous, and sometimes aesthetically offensive; as are also many of the
                    decorations of Pompeii. The main features of these designs are balanced scrolls
                    in panels; or standards variously composed, but symmetrically scrolled on either
                    side, and on the tendrils of these scrolls are suspended or placed birds and
                    animals, human figures and chimeras, of any or all kinds, or indeed any objects
                    that may take the fancy of the artist. But he is limited by the laws of
                    aesthetics; his designs must be symmetrical or they will want harmony, and they
                    must not offend against mechanical possibility or the principle of gravitation,
                    or they will be ridiculous: nothing that outrages aesthetic sensibility can ever
                    be beautiful. The most perfect specimens of Cinquecento Arabesque aro certainly
                    found in sculpture. As specimens of exquisite work may be mentioned the
                    Martinengo tomb, in the church of the Padri Ri formati at Brescia, and the
                    façade of the church of Santa Maria dei Miracoli there, by the Lombardi; and
                    many of the carvings of the Château de Gaillon, France—all of which fairly
                    illustrate the beauties and capabilities of the style.</p>
                <p>This kind of decoration need not, however, be limited to architectural panels and
                    pilasters; it is applicable for large surface decoration, and for manufactures,
                    whether in wood or metal, or textile. It affords as much room also for the
                    display of colour as of form: some of the surface decorations of Gaertner, in
                    Munich, are splendid examples of delicacy of colour, showing how much may be
                    effected by harmonious combinations in scroll-work of the most delicate
                    gradations and tints. Good specimens of Arabesque, in manufactures, in casts,
                    and in copies in colour, may now be seen in the South Kensington Museum. For
