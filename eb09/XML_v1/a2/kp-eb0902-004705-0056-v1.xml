                    very numerous products of the distillation of coal tar. The substance has been
                    known to chemists since the year 1826, when Μ. Unverdorben, by the destructive
                    distillation of indigo, produced a liquid of an oily consistence, which he
                    teτmed <hi rend="italic">crystalline.</hi> In the year 1835, Runge, a German
                    chemist, isolated from the o∏ of coal tar a substance which, having the property
                    of producing a beautiful blue colour on treatment with chloride of lime, he
                    named <hi rend="italic">λ∙yanol.</hi> In 1840, another investigator showed that
                    by treating indigo with caustic potash it yields an oil, and he gave to his
                    product the name <hi rend="italic">Aniline,</hi> from the specific name of one
                    of the indigo yielding plants, <hi rend="italic">Indigofera. anil.</hi> About
                    the same time it was discovered that on treating nitrobenzol with a reducing
                    agent, an organic base is formed, to which the observer of this reaction gave
                    the name <hi rend="italic">^benzidam,.</hi> Professor Hofmann, while a student
                    in the laboratory of Baron Liebig, investigated these variously prepared
                    substances, and found them to be identical in composition and action, and
                    thenceforth they took their place as one body, under the name <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aniline</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Plιenylamine.</hi> Pure aniline is a basic
                    substance of an oily consistence, colourless, boiling at a temperature of 182°
                    C. Dropped on paper aniline produces a greasy stain, which, owing to its
                    volatilising at an ordinary atmospheric temperature, quickly disappears. On
                    exposure to air it absorbs oxygen rapidly, and becomes of a deep brown colour;
                    and it ignites readily, burning with a large smoky flame. It is possessed of a
                    somewhat pleasant vinous odour, and a burning aromatic taste. It is a highly
                    acrid poison, and Dr Letheby has pointed out that the poisonous action of
                    nitrobenzol is due to a change of that substance into aniline taking place
                    within the stomach.</p>
                <p>The readiness with which aniline, in certain of its reactions, produces very
                    brilliant colours, was of course known to chemists from the time Runge produced
                    it from coal tar and gave it the name kyanol. Up to year 1858 <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0057-0048"/> it, however, possessed nothing beyond a
                    scientific interest. On the 26th of August 1858, Mr W. H. Perkin obtained a
                    patent for the production of a dye-stuff derived from aniline, which soon became
                    well known as mauve, or Perkin’s purple, as well as by various other names. The
                    discovery of Mr Perkin formed the turning-point in the history of aniline, and
                    was indeed the beginning of a great revolution in the arts and manufactures
                    connected with the dyeing of textile fabrics. The manufacture of aniline dyes
                    was really first begun in France, the French manufacturers acting on the
                    information supplied by Mr Perkin’s patent specification. It immediately spread
                    to all industrial centres, and became one of the most eagerly investigated of
                    all commercial undertakings. A rapid succession of patents were applied for and
                    obtained; new processes and combinations were continually being projected, and a
                    great variety of colours were tried with more or less success as commercial
                    substances. The activity of scientific research kept pace with the energy of
                    manufacturing enterprise, resulting in a rapid improvement of processes,
                    decrease in the cost of the manufacture, and a great increase in the beauty and
                    tinctorial effect of the dyes produced. At the present time every colour, and
                    all tints and shades of colours, are produced from aniline; and, while the
                    processes employed and the combinations formed are very numerous, the names
                    under which the dye-stuffs are sold must be said to be endless.</p>
                <p>Of the processes by which aniline may be prepared, that only is available in
                    manufacturing which was devised by Zinin, when he prepared it, under the name of
                    benzidam, from nitrobenzol. Aniline is only found in-very small quantities as a
                    direct product of the distillation of coal tar, but a large proportion of light
                    hydrocarbons are among the products when the temperature ranges between 80° C.
                    and 130° C. The chief of these is benzol, with smaller quantities of toluol and
                    other closely allied substances. These hydrocarbons, when acted upon by strong
                    nitric acid, give up an atom of hydrogen, the place of which is taken by one of
                    nitroxyl (NO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>), and benzol is thus transformed into
                    nitrobenzol: <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> benzol (C <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi>
                    H <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi>) + nitric acid (HNO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>)
                    = nitrobenzol (C <hi rend="subscript"> β</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> NO
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>) + water (H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O).
                    Nitrobenzol is a yellow oily liquid, with the exact flavour of bitter almonds,
                    for which it has long been used as a substitute in fancy soap-making, under the
                    name of essence of mirbane. Its transformation into aniline is now practically
                    effected by submitting it to the reducing influence of nascent hydrogen, by the
                    action of iron and acetic acid. To a mixture of nitrobenzol and strong acetic
                    acid a certain proportion of iron filings is gradually added. Very energetic
                    chemical action is set up with great disengagement of heat. When the reaction is
                    complete the aniline is distilled over by superheated steam. The aniline of
                    commerce thus prepared is not a chemically pure product, but a mixture of
                    aniline and toluidine, just as the commercial benzol operated on is a mixture of
                    benzol with toluol. In the manufacture of dyes it is found essential that
                    certain proportions of both aniline and toluidine should be present in the
                    aniline oil operated on.</p>
                <p>The method by which Mr Perkin obtains from aniline the violet colour known as
                    mauve, is by mixing a solution of sulphate of aniline and of potassic dichromate
                    in equivalent proportions, and leaving them for several hours till the resulting
                    reaction is complete. A black precipitate is formed, which is washed free from
                    the potassic sulphate it contains, and then treated with naphtha to dissolve out
                    the resinous matter contained in the mass. The residue consists of the mauve
                    dye, and may be dissolved in alcohol. It has been found to be the sulphate of a
                    base, to which the name mauveine has been given.</p>
                <p>The greater proportion of aniline dyes manufactured are now produced directly or
                    indirectly from another basic body, termed rosaniline. About the time of the
                    French-Austrian war in 1859, a second coal-tar dye was introduced into commerce,
                    which became popularly known as aniline red or Magenta, from the battle fought
                    at the period of its introduction. Dr Hofmann’s investigations into the nature
                    and composition of this dye have done more to place the entire industry on a
                    satisfactory basis than any other undertaking. He found that it consisted of a
                    salt of a basic substance, to which he gave the name rosaniline (C <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 20</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 19</hi> N <hi rend="subscript"
                    > 3</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O). For the preparation of rosaniline,
                    Hofmann found that a certain proportion of toluidine must be present in the
                    commercial aniline employed. Rosaniline is now entirely manufactured by treating
                    aniline of a known composition with a strong solution of arsenic acid in an iron
                    retort, heated to a temperature of not more than 180° C. The reaction occupies
                    about eight hours; and at the conclusion of the operation a crude mass,
                    consisting of rosaniline arsenite and arseniate, is found, which is next
                    dissolved in water acidulated with hydrochloric acid. Common salt is added to
                    this solution, when a double decomposition takes place. Rosaniline hydrochlorate
                    is formed on the one hand, and sodium arseniate and arsenite on the other. For
                    the preparation of the salts of rosaniline, the base is treated directly with
                    acids.</p>
                <p>Rosaniline blues are prepared by acting upon commercial aniline with a salt of
                    rosaniline, such as the acetate, under the influence of a heat of about 190° C.,
                    kept up for two hours. The reaction which takes place is the substitution of
                    three atoms of phenyl for three of hydrogen, and hence these blues are
                    chemically salts of triphenylrosani-line. Violet colours, such as Hofmann’s
                    violet, are prepared by an analogous process to that employed for the blues, by
                    treating rosaniline with the iodides of methyl or ethyl, atoms of these radicals
                    taking the place of hydrogen, and forming ethylic or methylic rosaniline.
                    Aniline green is formed by the action of aldehyd on a solution of aniline red in
                    sulphuric acid, and subsequent boiling in a solution of hyposulphite of soda.
                    Aniline yellow, or yellow fuchsine, is formed from a base named chrysaniline, a
                    minor product of the formation of rosaniline; but most of what is termed aniline
                    yellow is prepared from picric acid, a different product of the distillation of
                    coal tar. Various shades of brown and maroon, as well as black colours, are
                    regular commercial products; but they are neither so well understood, nor of
                    such consequence as the reds, blues, and greens.</p>
                <p>Aniline colours are employed in the industrial arts for numerous other purposes
                    besides their great use as dyeing materials. Violet ink and other fancy coloured
                    inks are prepared from them. They are used by paper manufacturers for tinting
                    pulps, and for the superficial staining of finished paper. They are likewise
                    used by paper stainers in the printing of wall papers, in the preparation of
                    lithographic inks, and to some extent for water colours. They are largely
                    employed as colouring materials in perfumery, fancy soaps, and cosmetics,
                    besides having many other minor applications.</p>
                <p>Concerning these dyes, Dr Hofmann, to whom the industry is so much indebted,
                    wrote, in 1862, while it was yet in its infancy, “Instead of disbursing her
                    annual millions for these substances, England will, beyond question, at no
                    distant day become herself the greatest colourproducing country in the world;
                    nay, by the very strangest of revolutions, she may erelong send her coal-derived
                    blues to indigo-growing India, her distilled crimson to cochinealproducing
                    Mexico, and her fossil substitutes for quercitron and safflower to China, Japan,
                    and the other countries whence these articles are now derived.” It is scarcely
                    needful to say that these bold anticipations have already been fully
                    realised.</p>
