                <p><label type="entry">ANDES</label>. The Andes form a mountain chain second only to
                    the Himalayas in the vastness of its proportions, and possessing many remarkable
                    peculiarities. The origin of the name appears to be unknown, although numerous
                    meanings have been authoritatively assigned to it. It has been variously
                    supposed to be derived from the Peruvian words <hi rend="italic">Anta,</hi> or
                    tapir; <hi rend="italic">Anti,</hi> meaning metal or copper; and <hi
                    rend="italic">Antis,</hi> the name of a tribe resident in the mountains; or from
                    the Spanish <hi rend="italic">Andenes,</hi> applied to the gardens on the
                    terraces which occur on the western slopes of the Andes in Chili. Humboldt
                    believes its meaning has been lost. In connection with this may be noticed the
                    curious fact mentioned by Colonel Tod, that the Hindoos of North India called
                    the Himalayas by the name Andes.</p>
                <p>The Andes form a continuous belt of mountainous highland along the western margin
                    of South America, and have been considered by many writers as the southern
                    continuation of the Rocky Mountains, which form a similar belt along the west
                    side of North America. There are many objections against this view, and in
                    favour of that which makes the Andes and Rocky Mountains two distinct ranges. In
                    New Granada, or Columbia, as it is now called, the eastern range of the Andes
                    terminates on the western side of the Gulf of Maracaybo, near 72° W. long. South
                    of the gulf a branch range is thrown off, which traverses Venezuela. The central
                    range dies out in the low lands south of the junction of the Cauca and Magdalena
                    rivers. The western range also lowers and spreads in breadth in advancing
                    northwards, and is lost in the low flats along the south margin of the Gulf of
                    Darien. At the neck of the Panama isthmus, the Naipi and Cupica valleys stretch
                    from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean, and are nowhere more than a few hundred
                    feet above the level of the sea. North of the Atrato a serpentine ridge of
                    mountains occurs, which terminates in Cape Tiburon. It is crossed by a pass
                    called Tanela, which is about 5 miles in length, and 130 feet above the sea.
                    Most of the isthmus between 8° and 9° N. lat. is below the level of this pass.
                    Here the Isthmus of Panama curves round westwardly; and west of Panama there is
                    another broad low tract stretching right across. This district cannot be
                    regarded as belonging in any way to the Andes. In Central America the mountains
                    form numerous isolated ranges. In Mexico there are two high sierras. The eastern
                    sierra does not reach the Rio Branco. The western sierra terminates at its north
                    end in the Sierra Madre de Durango, which dies out in the northern part of
                    Chihuahua and in Sonora, without being in any way connected with the Rocky
                    Mountains.</p>
                <p>The Rocky Mountains commence in about 100° W. long, at their south end, and
                    terminate in about 145° W. at the north end, and have a general north-westerly
                    direction. The Andes, on the other hand, commence near 54° S. lat. and 70° W.
                    long. The southern portion forms a gentle curve, bending round to 73° W. in
                    Patagonia, and reaching 70° again in the south of Chili. It continues on this
                    line to Coquimbo, where it bends easterly, and after a slight double curve it
                    cuts the meridian of 70° again south of Lake Titicaca. There is then a sharp
                    bend, corresponding to that in the coast, which carries the range nearly to 80°
                    W. in Ecuador, beyond which it again has an easterly bend, so as to cause it to
                    terminate between 72° W. and 76° W. The north and south ends are consequently
                    nearly in the same meridian. There are other dissimilarities between the Andes
                    and the Rocky Mountains.</p>
                <p>The formation of the Andes is due to several causes operating at distinct
                    intervals of time. They consist mainly of stratified material which has been
                    more or less altered. This material was deposited at the bottom of a sea, so
                    that at some former time the highest portions were submerged, probably in
                    consequence, to a certain extent, of subsidence of the sea bottom. Since the
                    latest deposits there has been upheaval and denudation. The range, then, has
                    resulted from the accumulation of sediment on a subsiding area; from the
                    subsequent upheaval of such deposits, which have been increased in height by the
                    ejection of volcanic products; and from the operation of denuding agents.</p>
                <p>As far as our present knowledge goes, it appears to be probable that the Andes
                    mark an area on which sedimentary deposits have been accumulated to a greater
                    thickness than on any other portion of South America. It is further demonstrable
                    that these deposits belong to several geological periods, the elevation having
                    occurred at different periods, while their axes extend in different directions.
                    Hence it is a complex range of mountains formed by the combination of several
                    distinct systems of ridges. The width of the range varies from about 60 to 300
                    or more miles, but, as compared with other mountains, the Andes are for the most
                    part narrow relatively to their height. Where their special features are most
                    characteristically developed, they consist of a massive embankment-like
                    foundation, rising with a rapid slope from the low country on either side, and
                    having its margins surmounted by lofty ridges of ragged or dome-like summits.
                    These Cordilleras, as they are usually termed, flank longitudinal valleys, or
                    plainlike depressions which form the highest levels of the central portion of
                    the gigantic embankment, and which vary in width from 20 to 60 miles. At
                    intervals the longitudinal depression is broken up, either by ridges connecting
                    the Cordilleras, or by lofty plateau-like uplands. In several cases these
                    transverse ridges and belts of high ground form the main watershed of the
                    country. They are rarely cut across by the river systems, whereas both the
                    marginal Cordilleras are intersected at numerous points, and more especially by
                    the rivers draining the eastern slope of the country. In no case do these
                    eastern rivers originate to the west of the western Cordilleras. A few of the
                    central valleys, or plain-like depressions, have no connection either with the
                    western or eastern river system. Roughly speaking, the height of the central
                    plains or valleys is from 6000 to 11,000 feet above the sea; of the passes and
                    knots, from 10,000 to 15,000 feet; and of the highest peaks, from 18,000 to
                    23,290 feet—the last being the <pb break="no"

                    generally considered to be the highest peak in America. Judging from these
                    estimates, we may regard the bulk of the Andes as somewhere about that of a mass
                    4400 miles long, 100 miles wide, and 13,000 feet high, which is equivalent to
                    5,349,801,600,000,000 cubic feet. On this basis we find that the Mississippi
                    would carry down an equivalent mass of matter in 785,000 years. The rate of
                    denudation in certain river basins varies from one foot in 700 years, to one
                    foot in 12,000 years. Assuming that similar rates would apply to the Andes, they
                    would be denuded away in from 9 to 156 million years. In all probability, much
                    less than 9 million years would suffice. On the other hand, the Andes would be
                    swept away in 135,000 years, supposing the denuding powers of the globe were
                    concentrated on them alone. From the above data, and assuming the average
                    specific gravity of the matter forming the Andes to be 2 ’ 5, the weight of the
                    portion above the sea may be estimated at 368,951,834,482,750 tons, giving an
                    average of about 1000 tons on each square foot at the level of the sea. Under
                    Aconcagua the pressure would be about 1780 tons per square foot at the same
                    level, provided, of course, it were not, as it no doubt is, more or less
                    modified by lateral pressure. These figures afford some, though at best a vague,
                    conception of the mighty grandeur of this range of mountains, and of the scope
                    there is for the exertion of enormous pressure. How vast, then, must be those
                    forces which have counteracted such pressures, and upheaved the ocean-spread
                    sediments of the continent, until the Andes, that—</p>

                <p>But, however vast the Andes may seem to us, it should be remembered that they
                    form but an insignificant portion of the globe itself. Aconcagua is about
                    ⅟₂₉₀₀th of the earth’s diameter, which is relatively not more than a pimple
                    ⅟₃₀th of an inch high on the skin of a tall man.</p>
                <p>The range may be considered as commencing on the south with Cape Horn, although
                    for several degrees it is much broken up by arms and straits of the sea. The
                    first portion of any extent commences between Cape Good Success and Cape San
                    Paulo, and stretches across Tierra del Fuego, by Mount Darwin and Mount
                    Sarmiento, and the range of hills on either side of Admiralty Sound. The
                    mountains named are from 6600 to 6800 feet high. The Strait of Magellan also
                    cuts through and across the range, isolating, the mountainous islands of
                    Clarence and Santa Ines. Otway Water cuts through the range, and penetrates to
                    the plain of Patagonia. North of this are several snowy eminences, and in some
                    places glaciers descend almost to the sea-level. At Last Hope Inlet, or a little
                    north of 52° S., we have the commencement of the Andes as a continuous range,
                    Disappointment Bay being the most northern place where the Pacific reaches the
                    plains to the east of the Andes. South of this, and for several degrees to the
                    north, the islands which fringe the coast have a mountainous character, and
                    appear to belong essentially to the Andes range, with which there is reason to
                    believe they were once connected. Along this space the Andes encroach upon the
                    ocean, and have no western slope proper. Many of the sea channels are very
                    narrow and ravine-like in character; they appear to represent a valley between
                    two ridges of mountains,—a feature which is most conspicuous farther north. The
                    highest part or crest of the range is close to the sea, and consequently the
                    streams which fall into the Pacific are all small. Towards the south the width
                    is about 20 miles; and in the latitude of Mount Stokes, which is 6400 feet high,
                    it is 40 miles. North of this the range is in places more than 40 miles across.
                    From 46 to 42 S., the mountains become somewhat higher, the loftier peaks
                    ranging from 4000 to 8000 feet. Among the more conspicuous are Mount Yanteles,
                    8030 feet; Mount Melimoyu, 7500 feet; Mount Corcovado, 7510 feet; and Mount
                    Minchinmadiva, 7406 feet above the sea-level. The Eyre Sound glaciers descend to
                    the sealevel. At about 41° 30' S. lat. there is a low pass across the Andes; and
                    to the north of this the slope is more or less distant from the sea, except,
                    perhaps, at one part where the desert of Atacama terminates in lofty cliffs on
                    the shore. In Chili the Andes increase in height and width, and between about
                    38° and 28° S. run approximately north and south; and nowhere do they recede so
                    far from the sea as in the southern part of Chili. At this part, or in about the
                    latitude of Antuco (36° 50' S.), the lower land on the west is more than 100
                    miles broad, and the width of the range itself is probably more than 100 miles.
                    Here the Andes consist of two ranges, the crests of which are from 60 to 80
                    miles apart, enclosing a longitudinal valley. Across these ranges there is a
                    pass, which, with the exception of those near the mountains Osorno and
                    Villarica, is the most southern in Chili. The summit of this pass is not more
                    than 12,000 feet above the sea. The pass of Planchon lies north of Mount
                    Descabezado; and to the south of Peteroa is the pass of Las Damas, which is
                    probably not more than 11,000 feet at its highest point. At the head of the
                    Maypu valley a pass traverses the two ranges of the Andes as well as the
                    included valley of Tunuyan. That through the western range is called Peu-quenes
                    Pass, and rises to 13,210 feet above the sea-level; while that through the
                    eastern range is called Portillo, and rises to 14,365 feet above the sea. Near
                    32° 38' S., Aconcagua rises to 23,290 feet, and is, so far as known, the highest
                    peak in America, and the highest volcano in the world. A little to the south of
                    it is the Cumbre or Uspallata Pass. In the western range it rises to 12,454 feet
                    above the sea; and on its north flank is the pass of Los Patos. At about 30° S.
                    the mountainous system becomes more complicated, owing to the appearance of
                    several ranges which rise out of the plains towards the north-west corner of the
                    Argentine Confederation, some of which run north and join the lofty highlands of
                    the Bolivian Andes. It is doubtful whether all strictly belong to the Andes.
                    Thus, in the latitude of Coquimbo, where both the mountains and the coast line
                    trend somewhat to the east of north, there are three parallel mountain ranges.
                    The western is called the Andes, the central range is known as the Sierra
                    Famatina, and the eastern as the Sierra Velasco. The two latter ranges are quite
                    isolated from the first-mentioned range, terminating abruptly on the north and
                    south. North of 28° S., however, a number of sierras which rise from the
                    Argentine plain form an extensive mass of mountains. These are continuous into
                    the Cordilleras de los Valles, de Despoblado, and Abra de Cortaderas, which form
                    the eastern margin of the lofty mountain plains of Bolivia. These plains slope
                    down from the eastern side of the Andes, just as the Atacama desert seems to
                    form part of the western slope. At about 22° S. the Andes begin to trend
                    somewhat to the west of north. At about 20° S. the eastern and western ranges
                    are connected by a lofty transverse chain about 60 miles broad, and similar to
                    the mountain knots of Peru. North of this the ranges bend more to the west, and
                    enclose the extensive valley of the Desaguadero river and Lake Titicaca, which
                    is shut in on the north by the transverse chain of the Vilcanota Mountains. The
                    width of the range is in this part from 200 to 250 miles; or if the offset
                    running eastward to Santa Cruz be included, the width is between 500 and 600
                    miles. One special feature about this part of the range is, that the Desaguadero
                    valley (13,000 feet above the sea) is the <pb break="no"

                    the river systems on the outer flanks, "whether to the east or to the west.
                    There are one or two small ones of a similar kind in the north-west part of the
                    Argentine Confederation. The highlands which surround this great valley (which
                    might be appropriately called the navel of South America) form a continuous
                    re-entering watershed, separating respectively the numerous small rivers flowing
                    into the Pacific, the Amazon system, which drains a large portion of the
                    northern part of South America, and the La Plata system, which drains most of
                    the southern part of the same area. In this region, too, more especially in the
                    eastern Cordillera, it was for a time believed, on the authority of Mr Pentland,
                    that the highest peaks of the Andes were situated; his first estimates were,
                    however, ascertained by himself and others to have been too great. The highest
                    peak is the Nevado de Sorata, close to Lake Titicaca, and estimated at 21,286
                    feet high; next to it comes the twin peaked Illimani, a little further south,
                    which rises to 21,181 feet. The passes crossing the valley have summits
                    averaging 14,000 feet, but the one which skirts the Nevado de Sorata rises
                    nearly to 16,000 feet above the sea. From about 18° the Andes, like the coast,
                    runs north-west, so that whereas in about 18° S. the crest of the western
                    Cordillera is in 70° W. long., at,14° S. it has reached a little beyond. 75°.
                    Here there is another change of direction, this portion of the "western
                    Cordillera stretching from about 14° S. to 6° S., the south end being near 75°
                    W., and the north near 80° W., the westing being rather more than half a degree
                    per degree of latitude. From 6° S. to the equator the direction is very slightly
                    to the east of north; beyond this the trend is still more east, so that the
                    termination of the west Cordillera lies between 76° and 78° W. long, in between
                    7° and 8° N. lat. The northern end of the eastern Cordillera is near 72° W.
                    Returning again, to the Peru vian Andes, we find some lofty peaks which rival,
                    and it may be surpass, those of Bolivia. Thus Sehama. is reputed to be 22,000
                    feet; Chungara somewhat less; Chipicani, 18,898 feet; Arequipa, 18,373;
                    Chuquibamba, 21,000 feet. There are numerous passes over the Andes in Peru, such
                    as those of Gualillos, of the Altos de los Huescos, and of the Altos de
                    Toledo—the first mentioned of which rise to 17,820 feet above the sea. North of
                    the Vilcanota Mountains the eastern portion of the Andes is much cut up by the
                    numerous feeders of the Ucayali and Madeira rivers, most of which originate on
                    the flanks of the western Cordillera. At Pasco there is a lofty mountain knot or
                    table-land, which connects the Cordilleras, and at the same time forms the
                    watershed between the upper portions of the basins of the rivers Ucayali,
                    Huallaga, and the Maranon, or Upper Amazon. From this table-land three
                    Cordilleras extend northward, of w hich the eastern dies out between the Ucayali
                    and Huallaga rivers; the central between the Huallaga and the Upper Amazon;
                    while the western Cordillera is continuous into the mountain knot of Loja, which
                    forms the southern portion of the Andes of Ecuador, and which is estimated to be
                    11,650 square miles in extent. From this knot two lofty Cordilleras, abounding
                    in volcanoes, both active and extinct, run nearly parallel. They are separated
                    at intervals by transverse ridges into three vast mountain valley plains, of
                    -which the two southernmost drain into the Amazon basin, and the northernmost
                    into the basin of the Esmeraldas river. The two Cordilleras are again united in
                    the north by the mountain knot of Los Pastos, on the borders of Ecuador and
                    Columbia. The valley plains are about 40 miles wide. On the south is the valley
                    of Cuenca, which is about 50 miles long, and about 7800 feet above the sea. From
                    it the way into the central valley plain, that of Ambato, is across the
                    transverse ridge by the pass of Assuay, which rises to 15,520 feet. It is about
                    130 miles long, and about 8000 feet above the sea. The mountain fringe comprises
                    several important volcanoes, viz., Sangay, Tunguragua, and Cotopaxi in the
                    eastern Cordillera; and the volcano Carguirazo in the western Cordillera, which
                    also includes the lofty Chimborazo, estimated to reach 21,424 feet above the
                    sea. Then crossing over the low transverse ridge of the Alto de Chisinche, we
                    descend into the valley-plain of Quito, which is bordered by one of the most
                    intensely volcanic areas on the globe. To the east are Sinchulagua, Antisana,
                    and Cayambe; the last is now extinct, stands on the equator, and is 19,534 feet
                    above the sea. It is the highest point on the equator in the globe, and is the
                    only one along that line where perpetual snow exists. In the western Cordillera
                    the prominent eminences are Pichincha and Imba-bura. The valley-plain is about
                    9500 feet above the sea. Taking Cotopaxi as a centre, Orton observes that the
                    other peaks may be arranged in concentric orbits thus. Ruminaqui and Sinchulagua
                    are 10 miles distant; Iliniza, Corazon, Atacatzo, and Antisana are 25 miles;
                    Quirotoa, Pichincha, and Guamani are 30 miles; Llanganati is 40 miles;
                    Tunguragua, Carguirazo, Cayambi, are 50 miles; Chimborazo, Imbabura, and
                    Cotocachi, are 60 miles; Altar is 65 miles; Sangay is 75 miles; lastly, Chiles
                    and Assuay are 100 miles. Chimborazo is the most conspicuous feature in this
                    part of the Andes, and from one point its outline resembles that of a lion at
                    rest. Cotopaxi is the most symmetrical active volcano on the globe. Its apical
                    angle is 122° 30'; and the slope is a little over 30° on the south, west, and
                    east sides, and nearly 27° on the north side. Its summit was attained for the
                    first time on November 27, 1872, by Drs Reiss and Stfibel. The height was found
                    to be about 19,500 feet. Beyond the mountain knot of Los Pastos two Cordilleras
                    run in a north-easterly direction to about 2° N. The western Cordillera is
                    broken by the valley of the Patia, which has its source on the slopes of the
                    valley between the mountain knot of Los Pastos and the transverse ridge south of
                    Popayan. The eastern Cordillera is continued into the Paramo de Guanacas, from
                    which basis the Andes spread out fan-like into three Cordilleras. This paramo,
                    like the cross range between Iliniza and Cotopaxi, forms part of the main
                    watershed between the rivers draining into the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.
                    North of the paramo this watershed runs along the western Cordillera for some
                    distance, and then crosses several minor ranges of hills with their intervening
                    valleys. The low watersheds at the head of the Atrato basin coincide with it;
                    and north of Cupica Bay it suddenly bends, passing from within a few miles of
                    the Pacific to within a few miles of the Atlantic Ocean. Having commenced this
                    general account of the Andes with a notice of the mountain ranges of Columbia,
                    and of the lowlands of the Isthmus of Panama, we thus come round to our
                    starting-point. In the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Amebica</hi> there is a
                    brief account of the chain from a geological point of view, as well as of the
                    transverse chains of South America; and under the heads of the various countries
                    through which these pass further particulars are given.</p>
