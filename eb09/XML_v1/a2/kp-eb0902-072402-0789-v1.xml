                <p><label type="entry">ASSAYING</label>. This term is used in metallurgy to denote a
                    chemical operation in which the quantity of one ingredient of a mineral or alloy
                    is determined; it is chiefly used in reference to the precious metals, gold and
                    silver, and it is in this connection that the subject will here be treated of.
                    In the wider acceptation of the term in which it is used amongst practical
                    metallurgists, <hi rend="italic">assaying</hi> means almost the same thing as
                    the quantitative estimation of one constituent of a compound, when the process
                    adopted is one which has to be frequently repeated in a laboratory, and the
                    results are required for commercial purposes. In this sense wo speak not only of
                    the assay of gold and silver, but of other metals, such as lead and copper, of
                    non-metallic elements, such as sulphur and iodine, and even of compounds such as
                    nitre. The operations of assaying were, until recently, chiefly performed by
                    what is called the dry method, but of late years the processes of volumetric
                    analysis have been so largely introduced into the metallurgical laboratory, that
                    the wet method is almost as much used as the dry method. In the processes of
                    assaying the precious metals described in the following pages, the reader will
                    have both these terms explained, for gold is assayed in the dry, while silver is
                    assayed in the wet way.</p>
                <p>The precious metals, gold and silver, being almost universally used as convenient
                    representatives of value, and as such passing frequently between one country and
                    another, it is of the utmost importance to ascertain, quickly and accurately,
                    the marketable value of any sample of gold or silver bullion. Were these metals
                    invariably used in their pure state, their commercial value would be in direct
                    proportion to their weight, and all that would have to be known would be the
                    actual value of a pound of gold or silver; but the metals exist in commerce in
                    the form of alloys or mixtures containing an indefinite amount of base metal.
                    Gold is generally alloyed with copper and silver, whilst silver is generally
                    alloyed with copper. The problem is, therefore, to ascertain by some ready
                    process, which admits of extreme accuracy as well as moderate rapidity, the
                    exact proportion of pure gold present in an alloy, ore, or mixture containing
                    this metal; and inasmuch as silver is also a precious metal, the assay of gold
                    almost always involves the assay of the silver which accompanies it, for in many
                    cases the amount of silver present may be sufficient to increase the commercial
                    value of the substance under assay. It is very seldom, however, that the copper
                    or other metal present is in sufficient quantity to be of value, unless, indeed,
                    the substance under assay be a copper ore or pyrites containing only traces of
                    gold. In the case of silver assay, when the base metal is copper, it is
                    generally neglected. It is, however, frequently necessary to examine silver for
                    gold, for, formerly, the methods of parting these two precious metals were by no
                    means so exact as they are now, and on this account old silver frequently
                    contains an amount of gold which it will pay well to extract by modern methods.
                    The principle of assaying gold and silver is very simple theoretically, but in
                    practice great experience is necessary to ensure accuracy, and there is no
                    branch of business which more demands personal and undivided attention.</p>
                <p>All substances containing gold may be divided into two classes. The first class
                    comprises ores containing gold in a mineralised form. These include graphic
                    tellurium and foliated tellurium, and are of no commercial importance. For the
                    present purpose, we need simply mention the substances in the second class,
                    which consist of <hi rend="italic">alloys</hi> of gold, and include <hi
                    rend="italic">native gold,</hi> containing from 65 to 99 per cent, of gold; <hi
                    rend="italic">palladium gold,</hi> containing about 86 per cent, of gold; <hi
                    rend="italic">rhodium gold,</hi> containing from 59 to 66 per cent, of gold; <hi
                    rend="italic">gold amalgam,</hi> containing 38 per cent, of gold; and <hi
                    rend="italic">artificial alloys,</hi> as gold coin, jewellery, &amp;c. Of the
                    foregoing list, the only alloys which are of commercial importance are, <hi
                    rend="italic">native gold</hi> and <hi rend="italic">artificial alloys.</hi>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0790-0725"/> gold is commonly found in a quartzose gangue, and
                    nearly always associated with iron and copper pyrites, mispickel or arsenical
                    pyrites, blende, galena, many antimonial minerals, and nearly all the primitive
                    rocks.</p>
                <p>The only artificial alloys of gold which will be specially noticed here are the
                    standard gold of this realm, and alloys of gold with silver or copper used for
                    jewellery. The standard of alloys of gold is expressed in fractions of unity. It
                    is assumed that there are 24 carats in unity, and ⅜∣nds in the carat. Standard
                    gold, in the 24 carats, contains 22 carats of pure or fine gold, as it is
                    called, and two carats of alloying metal, either silver or copper, or a mixture
                    of the two. Standard gold is, therefore, called 22-carat gold. In a similar way
                    articles of jewellery are denominated 12-carat, 16-carat, 18-carat, &lt;fcc.,
                    according to the proportion of fine gold alloyed with the inferior metal. An
                    ordinary assay report of gold expresses the variation from the standard, and not
                    the fine metal contained in it, and it is, therefore, marked as either better or
                    worse than standard. The standard of gold being 22 carats fine and 2 alloy, an
                    ingot of gold found to contain only 21 carats pure gold would be reported <hi
                    rend="italic">worse</hi> 1 carat. If it contained 23∣ carats, it would then be
                    reported <hi rend="italic">better</hi> 1 j carat.</p>
                <p>The processes by which gold is generally assayed are <hi rend="italic"
                    >cupellation,</hi> when the alloy consists of copper, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >parting,</hi> when the alloy consists of silver. Generally speaking, both
                    operations are necessary. We will describe them as they would be performed in
                    practice. When the standard of the alloy to be examined is not approximatively
                    known, a preliminary assay must be made to ascertain the quantity of lead
                    necessary to fuse with the gold alloy. But in most cases this is unnecessary,
                    as, from the circumstances of the case, the standard of the alloy is generally
                    known within sufficiently close limits.</p>
                <p>The process of cupellation is briefly as follows :—The gold alloy is fused with a
                    quantity of lead, and a little silver if silver is already present. The
                    resulting alloy, which is called the <hi rend="italic">lead button,</hi> is then
                    submitted to fusion on a very porous support, made of bone-ash, and called a <hi
                    rend="italic">cupel.</hi> The fusion being effected in a current of air, the
                    lead oxidises. The heat is sufficient to keep the resulting oxide of lead fused,
                    and the porous cupel has the property of absorbing melted oxide of lead without
                    taking up any of the metallic globule, exactly in the same way that
                    blotting-paper will absorb water whilst it will not touch a globule of mercury.
                    The heat being continued, and the current of air always passing over the surface
                    of the melted lead button, and the oxide of lead or <hi rend="italic"
                    >litharge</hi> being sucked up by the cupel as fast as it is formed, the
                    metallic globule rapidly diminishes in size until at last all the lead has been
                    got rid of. Now, if this were the only action, little good would have been
                    gained, for we should simply have put lead into the gold alloy, and then taken
                    it out again; but another action goes on whilst the lead is oxidising in the
                    current of air. Other metals, except the silver and gold, also oxidise, and are
                    carried by the melted litharge into the cupel. If the lead is therefore rightly
                    proportioned to the standard of alloy, the resulting button will consist of only
                    gold and silver, and these are separated by the operation of <hi rend="italic"
                    >parting,</hi> which consists in boiling the alloy (after rolling it to a thin
                    plate) in strong nitric acid, which dissolves the silver and leaves the gold as
                    a coherent sponge. To effect this parting properly, the proportion of silver to
                    gold should be as 3 to 1. The operation by which the alloy is brought to this
                    standard is termed <hi rend="italic">quartation</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >inquartation,</hi> and consists in fusing the alloys in a cupel with lead and
                    the quantity of fine silver or fine gold necessary to bring it to the desired
                    composition.</p>
                <p>What is called the <hi rend="italic">Trial of the Pyx</hi> is an ancient ceremony
                    which takes place about once in e?ery three years, at which the standard coin of
                    the realm is carefully assayed. For a description of this see the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Coinage.</hi></p>
                <p>It is unnecessary in the present work to describe the various delicate operations
                    which we have briefly alluded to above, but we will describe the implements and
                    furnaces which have been introduced and adopted in the Royal Mint by Mr H. W.
                    Field, the late resident assay-master of that establishment.</p>
                <p>Fig. 1 is the front elevation of the furnace; <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> a view of
                    the front iron roller on which it rests; <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> the ash-pit;
                    <hi rend="italic">cc</hi> are the dampers moving horizontally from side to side
                    towards each other, meeting exactly in the centre; <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> the
                    muffle door by which the assays are introduced; e&lt;∙, the door slides. So far,
                    the furnace is similar to that formerly in use, except that the bars on which
                    the muffle stands run from front to back, and are movable, rendering the removal
                    of the brick-work unnecessary. By this means the muffle stand is easily
                    introduced, and, having steady pins on the under side, it is raised about an
                    inch above the bare. The furnace measures 2 feet 10 inches in height, 1 foot 7
                    inches in width, and 1 foot 11 inches in depth. Instead of the furnace, as
                    formerly, being fed at the top, the fuel is charged by the door <hi
                    rend="italic">h,</hi> which also affords the means of regulating the draught,
                    and of throwing a current of air through the muffle by the door <hi
                    rend="italic">d.</hi> This door has a bar <hi rend="italic">k,</hi> traversing
                    about two-thirds of it, running easily from the top towards the bottom within
                    <hi rend="italic">ii,</hi> with a ketch <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> on each side
                    to keep it close. These are made on an incline, and about 3⅛ inches long, so as
                    to allow the traversing bar to slide freely when the door is not required to be
                    closed. In this manner the door may be opened from a quarter of an inch to the
                    extent of three inches. This feeding and regulating door is fixed by hinges <hi
                    rend="italic">ll</hi> to the front part of the <hi rend="italic">iron frame</hi>
                    covering the brick lining on the top of the furnace. On this frame rests the
                    square dome r, the front of which, <hi rend="italic">ιv,</hi> is removable by
                    two handles <hi rend="italic">nn;</hi> and by taking out the two thumb-screws
                    oo, the door and part of the frame come away, leaving a large opening, so as to
                    enable the furnace to be cleaned, the muffle repaired, &lt;fcc. The furnace
                    should be placed in a recess, under a chimney, with a movable iron ceiling <hi
                    rend="italic">t,</hi> about 1 foot above the dome, fitting close in every part,
                    so that the draught of air may pass through the furnace. A door, or flap, <hi
                    rend="italic">x,</hi> is attached to the iron ceiling by a hinge opening on the
                    side of the recess, with means to fix it at any point required, so that the
                    current of air may be regulated by the operator; <hi rend="italic">s,</hi> a
                    swivel door affords another mode for damping the furnace.</p>

                    three rows; they are not pierced through horizontally, but slope towards the
                    ceiling of the muffle at such an angle so as to exclude the ashes; <hi

                    current of air by cylinders of charcoal.</p>
                <p>Fig. 5 is the movable muffle door.</p>
                <p>Fig. 6 is a representation of a muffle, 14⅜ inches long, 7⅜ inches wide, until it
                    begins to taper at about 1 ⅜ inches from the front (see fig. 7), when it does
                    not exceed 5^ inches. The height is 6⅜ inches, in the clear 5 j inches. Its
                    sides are perforated with holes about a quarter of an inch in diameter.</p>
                <p>Fig. 8 is an annealing-iron for softening the assays after they are flattened and
                    rolled. It resembles a square bar of iron about J th of an inch thick, having
                    strengthening pieces rivetted at each end and two in the middle <hi
                    rend="italic">ll&gt;lb</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> f</hi> between which are
                    receiving places for the assays <hi rend="italic">aaa.</hi></p>
                <p>The apertures are made diagonally, as shown by <hi rend="italic">ccc,</hi> that
                    rhe assays may not fall completely to the bottom of the box, so that they may be
                    conveniently removed. The under part of the box has a kind of double keel <hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi> rivetted on it, so that in taking it from the furnace there
                    be no danger of upsetting it on the <hi rend="italic">annealing
                    trident.</hi></p>
                <p>Fig. 9 represents the trident for removing the annealing-iron from the
                    furnace.</p>
                <p>Fig. 10 represents the cupel mould; fig. 11 being the section of the same,
                    showing the four pieces of which it consists. The mould is circular, made of
                    forged steel nicely turned. There are several substances of which cupels may be
                    made, but the one in general use is the ash of burnt bones. This consists
                    principally of phosphate of lime, with a little carbonate and some fluoride of
                    calcium. The bones of sheep and horses are best for cupels. They should be burnt
                    until they are quite white, care being taken not to heat the bone-earth too
                    strongly. It must then be finely ground, sifted, and washed several times with
                    boiling distilled water till all soluble salts are removed. The finest particles
                    of the powdered boneearth will remain longest suspended in the washing waters.
                    This must be allowed to settle separately, and should be reserved for giving a
                    final coating to the surface of the cupels. For the body of the cupels the
                    bone-ash should be about as fine as wheat flour. The bone-ash being moistened
                    with a quantity of water, just sufficient to make the particles adhere, is put
                    into the mould <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> fig. 11, and pressed down level with
                    the surface. The mould is then put together, as in fig. 10, and the pestle
                    struck w ith a hammer so as to compress the bone earth into a solid cake. The
                    surface of the cupel may then have sifted over it a little of the very fine
                    levigated bone-ash, and the pestle again hammered on it. The pestle is to be
                    turned lightly round so as to smooth the inner surface of the cupel, and then
                    withdrawn. The cupel is removed from the mould by gentle pressure on the
                    narrowest end. It must be dried gently by a stove, and lastly ignited in a
                    muffle to expel all moisture. It is then ready for use.</p>
                <p>Fig 12 shows the appearance of the finished ξvjfy cupel, which is generally 1
                    inch by Jtlis of an inch.</p>
                <p>The lead used in cupellation should be of the <hi rend="superscript"> lg-</hi>
                    greatest purity, because, as most lead contains a small portion of silver, this
                    silver would necessarily combine with the assay and vitiate the accuracy of the
                    result. Another important consideration is the <hi rend="italic">quantity</hi>
                    of lead to be used with each assay. This information is generally obtained by an
                    experimental assay, unless, as most frequently happens, the circumstances of the
                    case enable the assayer to judge the <pb break="no"

                    accuracy. The sample of gold alloy is either cut from a corner, or drilled out
                    of the centre of an ingot, care being taken to secure uniformity of composition
                    with the whole mass. The amount of lead to be added to the alloy varies with the
                    proportion of base metal present; as a rule, from 10 to 20 parts are required to
                    1 of alloy.</p>
                <p>The amount of lead having been determined, the alloy is wrapped up in a known
                    quantity (say one-half of that required for its purification), formed into a
                    case somewhat resembling a thimble, great care being taken to make the joints
                    firm and close so that no gold shall escape. The requisite quantity of silver is
                    added at the same time. When a number of assays are made at the same time, they
                    are arranged, enveloped in their lead cases, on a board divided into
                    compartments corresponding in number and position with the cupels into which
                    they are intended to be charged. As the assayer generally makes two or more
                    trials of the same piece, so that great accuracy may be secured, it is his
                    practice to give one assay a side place in the muffle, and the second a middle
                    one, in order to check any irregularity in the result. When a sufficient number
                    of assays are weighed and arranged upon the board in the manner referred to, and
                    the furnace as well as the cupels raised to the necessary point of heat, the
                    charging tongs are then taken, and the rest of the lead and silver apportioned
                    to each assay placed individually upon the cupels, beginning at the back of the
                    muffle. The lead added in this case is not flattened, but is a piece of known
                    weight—various sizes of which, as well as cases, are kept in stock by the
                    assayer. The lead, so placed in the furnace rapidly melts, and becomes covered
                    with a gray oxide, but soon after appears fluid and bright. At this point the
                    assays are added by means of a pair of tongs (fig. 13), great care being taken
                    that no part overhangs or touches the edge of the cupel. The assays are thus
                    drawn into the mass of molten lead, and any particles of gold are in this manner
                    prevented from adhering to the sides of the cupels in charging, sufficient
                    despatch being used to obviate the fusion of the assay in its transition. The
                    assays being charged in order on their respective cupels, and the furnace
                    previously filled with fuel, the door of the muffle is partly closed, and the
                    progress of the cupellation watched. Too much air must not enter, or the muffle
                    will be chilled and the progress retarded, whilst if too little enters the
                    operation will be too slow.</p>
                <p>At first dense fumes will be observed to rise from the melted metal, indicating
                    the oxidation and subsequent volatilisation of the lead. These after continuing
                    some time are followed by the appearance of small luminous points on the
                    surface, which increase in size and brilliancy as the operation progresses. Then
                    a minute stream of red fused oxide of lead is seen to flow from the top of the
                    metal globule and circulate round, when it is carried down and absorbed by the
                    cupel. This is caused by the oxidation of the lead by the air, which at the same
                    time oxidises the other metals, except silver, which accompany the gold. As the
                    cupellation advances the fumes gradually lessen in density till· they disappear
                    altogether. The melted button at this stage is observed to become more convex
                    and round, and as the last vestiges of the lead and alloy are being carried off,
                    it assumes a cloudy appearance on the surface, changing to large bright points
                    of the fused oxide, till at length it is nearly freed from all impurity. At this
                    point the gold-silver alloy displays some singular and beautiful
                    characteristics. Deprived of all the base alloy save the last minute portion
                    that tarnished its lustre, it has become bright and pure, and finally it gives
                    forth from its surface iridescent circulating bands of light, which indicate the
                    successful completion of the operation. The globules after being cooled, are
                    removed from the cupels with a pair of pincers and carefully cleaned. They are
                    then placed in their com partments and weighed with the greatest nicety.
                    Finally, they are submitted to the operation of <hi rend="italic">parting.</hi>
                    This is effected by boiling with strong nitric acid, which dissolves the silver
                    and leaves the gold as a sponge. The gold-silver globule is first passed through
                    a flattening mill, and reduced to long thin strips, which are annealed and then
                    rolled up into a corkscrew spiral, so that the acid may penetrate between each
                    fold. The spirals are now transferred in order to small platinum cups arranged
                    on a frame, so that they can be simultaneously lowered into and removed from the
                    nitric acid. They are kept in the hot acid for the requisite time, then washed,
                    and the residual gold sponge, which possesses considerable coherence, and
                    retains the shape of the original spiral, is carefully dried and finally weighed
                    with the greatest possible accuracy.</p>
                <p>We shall now proceed to describe briefly the process of silver assay. The
                    cupellation process does not differ except in details from that of gold,—the
                    outline already given will, therefore, be a sufficient description. Like gold,
                    silver occurs in two classes of combinations,— <hi rend="italic"
                    >mineralised,</hi> as in <hi rend="italic">red silver ore, chloride of silver,
                    argentiferous galena,</hi> &lt;fcc., or as <hi rend="italic">metallic
                    silver</hi> and its alloys. In metallurgical establishments, where silver occurs
                    in small proportion with metallic sulphides, such as those of lead or copper,
                    the process of cupellation is generally adopted not only for quantitative
                    estimation of the amount of silver present in the ore, but also for its
                    extraction on the large scale. In the assay of silver bullion, however, the
                    process of cupellation is now almost entirely superseded by a volumetric
                    process, devised by the distinguished French chemist, Gay-Lussac, by whose
                    influence it was introduced into the Paris Mint. The process consists in
                    determining the fineness of silver bullion by the quantity of a standard
                    solution of common salt necessary to precipitate fully and exactly the silver
                    contained in a known weight of alloy. This process is based on the following
                    principles :—</p>
                <p>The alloy previously dissolved in nitric acid is mixed with a standard-solution
                    of common salt, which precipitates the silver as chloride, a compound perfectly
                    insoluble in water and even in acids. The quantity of chloride of silver
                    precipitated is determined not by its weight, which would be less exact, and
                    occupy too much time, but by the weight or volume of the standard solution of
                    common salt necessary to precipitate exactly the silver previously dissolved in
                    nitric acid. The term of complete precipitation of the silver can be readily
                    recognised by the cessation of all cloudiness when the salt solution is
                    gradually poured into that of the nitrate of silver. One milligramme of that
                    metal is readily detected in 150 grammes of liquid, and even a half or a quarter
                    of a milligramme may be detected if the liquid be perfectly bright before the
                    addition of the salt solution. By violent agitation during a minute or two, the
                    liquid, rendered milky by the precipitation of chloride of silver, becomes
                    sufficiently bright after a few moments’ repose to allow of the effect of the
                    addition of half a milligramme of silver to be perceptible. Filtration of the
                    liquid is more efficacious than agitation; but the latter, which is much more
                    rapid, generally suffices. The presence of copper, lead, or any other metal,
                    with the exception of mercury in the silver solution, has no sensible influence
                    on the quantity of salt required for precipitation; in other words, the same
                    quantity of silver, pure or alloyed, requires for its precipitation a constant
                    quantity of the standard salt solution. Supposing that 1 gramme of pure silver
                    be the quantity operated on, the solution of salt required to precipitate
                    exactly the whole of the silver ought to be of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n793/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0793-0728"/> such strength that, if it be measured by weight,
                    it shall weigh exactly 100 grammes, or if by volume, 100 cubic centimetres. This
                    quantity of salt solution is divided into 1000 parts, called thousandths. The
                    standard of an alloy of silver is generally the number of thousandths of
                    solution of salt, necessary to precipitate the silver contained in a gramme of
                    the alloy.</p>
                <p>The operations of assaying depend for their accuracy on the perfection of the
                    balance used to ascertain the weights of the metals taken, and the resulting
                    globules. In a good assay balance three essentials are indispensable :—(1.) It
                    should be quick in its action; (2.) It should be constant and uniform; (3.) It
                    should be extremely sensitive and delicate, indicating the minutest shades of
                    difference. Assay balances, as now constructed, are capable of indicating a
                    difference of the ten-thousandth of a grain. For a description of the modern
                    chemical balance, see article <hi rend="smallcaps">Balance. (w. c.)</hi></p>
