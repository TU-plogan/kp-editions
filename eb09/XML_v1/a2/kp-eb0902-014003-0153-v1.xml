                    Antony]</hi></label>, grandson oi Antonius the orator, and son of Antonius
                    Creticus, seems to have been born about 83 B.c. While still a child he lost his
                    father, whose example, however, had he been spared, would have done little for
                    the improvement of his character. Brought up under the influence of the
                    disreputable Cornelius Lentulus Sura, w hom his mother had married, Antony spent
                    his youth in profligacy and extravagance. For a time he co-operated with the
                    reprobate Clodius in his political plans, chiefly, it is supposed, through
                    hostility to Cicero, who had caused Lentulus, his stepfather, to be put to death
                    as one of the Catiline conspirators; but he soon withdrew from the connection,
                    on account of a disagreement -which, appropriately enough, arose in regard to
                    his relations to his associate’s wife, Flavia. Not long after, in 58 <hi

                    length, after a short time spent in attendance on the philosophers at Athens,
                    found an occasion for displaying some of the better features of his character in
                    the wars that were being carried on by Gabinius against Aristobulus in
                    Palestine, and in support of Ptolemy Auletes in Egypt. A new chapter in his life
                    was opened by the visit which he made to Julius Caesar in Gaul (54 B.c.)
                    Welcomed by the victorious general as a valuable assistant in his ambitious
                    designs, and raised by his influence to the offices of quaestor, augur, and
                    tribune of the plebs, he displayed admirable boldness and activity in the
                    maintenance of his patron’s cause, in opposition to the violence and intrigues
                    of the oligarchical party. At length his antagonists prevailed, and expelled him
                    from the curia; and the political contest became a civil war. The Rubicon was
                    crossed; Caesar was victorious, and Antony shared in his triumph.
                    Deputy-governor of Italy during Caesar’s absence in Spain (49), second in
                    command in the decisive battle of Pharsalia (48), and again deputy-governor of
                    Italy while Caesar was in Africa (47), Antony was now inferior in power only to
                    the dictator himself, and eagerly seized the opportunity of indulging in the
                    most extravagant excesses of luxurious licentiousness, — excesses which Cicero
                    depicted in the <hi rend="italic">Philippics with</hi> all the elaborate
                    eloquence of political hatred. In 46 he seems to have taken offence at Caesar,
                    because he insisted on payment for the property of Pompey which Antony
                    professedly had purchased, but had merely appropriated. But the estrangement was
                    not of long continuance; for we find Antony meeting the dictator at Narbo the
                    following year, and rejecting the advances of Trebonius, who endeavoured to
                    discover if there was any hope of getting Antony to join in the conspiracy that
                    was already on foot. In 44 he was consul along with Caesar, and seconded his
                    ambition by the famous offer of the crown on the 15th of February, thus
                    unconsciously preparing the way for the tragedy of the 15th of March. To the
                    sincerity of his adherence to Caesar the conspirators themselves bore witness on
                    that memorable day, by the care which they took to keep him engaged -without
                    while the daggers were doing their work within. This was the second great epoch
                    in Antony’s life. A brighter prospect than ever was then opened to his ambition.
                    By his eloquence —a hereditary gift—he managed to stir up the minds of the
                    populace against the assassins of Caesar, and drove them from the city. He made
                    peace with the remaining representatives of the senatorial party, and almost
                    seemed to have succeeded to the power and position of his unfortunate patron.
                    But the youthful Octavius, whom Caesar had adopted as his son, arrived from
                    Illyria, and claimed the inheritance of his “father.” Agreement was impossible,
                    and war ensued. Octavius obtained the support of the senate and of Cicero; and
                    the veteran troops of the dictator flocked to his standard. Antony was denounced
                    as a public enemy; and the city gave its loudest applause to the tirades of his
                    most eloquent accuser. His cause gradually lost ground, and at last seemed to be
                    totally ruined when his army was defeated in the siege of Mutina (43 B.C.) But
                    escaping to Cisalpine Gaul, he formed a junction with Lepidus, and they marched
                    towards Rome with 17 legions and 10,000 cavalry. The wily Octavius now 1 etrayed
                    his party, and entered into terms with Antony and Lepidus. It was agreed that
                    they three should adopt the title—so beautifully ironical—of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Triumviri</hi><hi rend="italic">reipublicoe</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >constituendas,</hi> and share the power and the provinces among them. Gaul was
                    to be Antony’s; Spain fell to the lot of Lepidus, and Africa, Sardinia, and
                    Sicily were to belong to Octavius. A conjunct proscription followed, each of the
                    partners in the vιllanous design bartering the life of his friends for the
                    pleasure of destroying his foes. The detested author of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philippics</hi> was given up to Antony’s revenge; and, according to Appian, the
                    number of the victims amounted to 300 senators and 2000 knights. In the
                    following year Antony and Octavius proceeded against the conspirators Cassius
                    and Brutus, who still maintained themselves in Macedonia; and, in the battles of
                    Philippi, stamped out the last embers of republican Rome. While Octavius
                    returned to Italy, Antony proceeded to Greece, and thence to Asia Minor, for the
                    sake of recruiting his funds, completing the subjugation of the eastern
                    provinces, and obtaining satisfaction about the conduct of the Egyptian queen
                    during the recent contest. On his passage through Cilicia in 41 he was visited
                    by Cleopatra, who came to answer the charges in person. She sailed up tho Cydnus
                    in a gorgeous bark, with a fantastic and brilliant equipage, and brought all her
                    allurements to bear on the heart of the voluptuous Roman. Her success was
                    complete; and he who was to have been her judge, was led captive to Alexandria
                    as her slave. All was forgotten in the fascination and delight of the passing
                    hour; and feasting and revelry found perpetual and ever-varying renewal. At
                    length Antony was aroused by the Parthian invasion of Syria, and the report of
                    an outbreak between Fulvia his wife and Lucius his brother on the one hand and
                    Octavius on the other. On arriving in Italy he found that the war was over, and
                    Octavius the victor; and the chief cause of disagreement being soon after
                    removed by the death of Fulvia, a reconciliation was speedily effected between
                    tho triumvirs, and cemented by the marriage of Antony with Octavia, the sister
                    of his colleague. A new division of the Roman world was agreed on at Brundusium,
                    Lepidus receiving Africa, Octavius the west, and Antony the east. Returning to
                    his province, Antony was for a time successful; his general, Ventidius, beating
                    the Parthians, and Socius capturing Jerusalem and conquering Antigonus. But
                    after another visit to Italy, during which the triumvirate was prolonged for
                    five years, Antony sent away his wife, yielded himself completely to the evil
                    influence of Cleopatra, indulged not only in licentiousness, but in tyranny, and
                    allowed his affairs to be neglected or delayed. An expedition against the
                    Parthians was a failure; but for this his success against Artavasdes, the
                    Armenian king, in some measure compensated. Octavius at length determined to get
                    rid of Antony, and had little need of invention to bring charges sufficient
                    against him. About two years were spent in preparations and delays on both
                    sides, and it was not till the year 31 that the fate of Antony was decided by
                    the battle of Actium. Defeated and deserted, he once more sought refuge and
                    repose in the society of Cleopatra, but was followed even there by his
                    relentless rival. At first he made a gallant effort to defend himself, and
                    partially succeeded. But convinced of the hopelessness of his position, and
                    assured of the suicide of his mistress, he followed the example which he was
                    falsely informed she had given (30 B.c.) Antony had been married in succession
                    to Fadia, Antonia, Fid via, and Octavia, and left behind him a number of
                    children. A short but vivid sketch of Antony is given by De Quincey in his
                    “Essay on the Caesars,” see his <hi rend="italic">Works,</hi> ix. 57-59.</p>
