                    and N.E. by Lincolnshire, S.E. by Northamptonshire, and W. by Leicestershire.
                    Its shape is extremely irregular. The greatest length from north-east to
                    south-west is about <pb break="no"

                    west about 16 miles. The area is 94,889 acres, or about 148 square miles. The
                    surface is pleasantly undulating, ridges of high ground running east and west,
                    separated by rich and luxuriant valleys, generally about half a mile in breadth.
                    The principal valley is that of Catmoss to the south of Oakham, having to the
                    north of it a tract of table-land commanding an extensive prospect into
                    Leicestershire.</p>
                <p>The Welland, which is navigable to Stamford, flows north-east, forming the
                    greater part of the boundary of the county with Northamptonshire. The Gwash or
                    Wash, which rises in Leicestershire, flows eastwards through the centre of the
                    county, and just beyond its borders, enters the Welland in Lincolnshire. The
                    Chater, also rising in Leicestershire and flowing eastwards enters the Welland
                    about two miles from Stamford. The Eye flows south-eastwards along the borders
                    of Leicestershire. The county belongs almost entirely to the Jurassic formation,
                    consisting of Liassic and Oolitic strata—the harder strata, chiefly limestone
                    containing iron, forming the hills and escarpments, and the clay-beds the slopes
                    of the valleys. The oldest rocks are those belonging to the Lower Lias in the
                    north-west. The bottom of the vale of Catmoss is formed of marlstone rock
                    belonging to the Middle Lias, and its sides are composed of long slopes of Upper
                    Lias clay. The Upper Lias also covers a large area in the west of the county.
                    The lowest series of the Oolitic formation is the Northampton sands bordering
                    Northamptonshire. The Lincolnshire Oolitic limestone prevails in the east of the
                    county north of Stamford. It is largely quarried for building purposes, the
                    quarry at Ketton being famous beyond the boundaries of the county. The Great
                    Oolite prevails towards the south-east. Formerly the iron was largely dug and
                    smelted by means of the wood in the extensive forests, and the industry is again
                    reviving.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Agriculture.—</hi> In the eastern and south-eastern districts
                    the soil is light and shallow. In the other districts it consists chiefly of a
                    tenacious but fertile loam, and in the fertile vale of Catmoss the soil is
                    either clay or loam, or a mixture of the two. The prevailing redness, which
                    colours even the streams, is owing to the ferruginous limestone carried down
                    from the slopes of the hills. The name of the county is by some authorities
                    derived from this characteristic of the soil, but the explanation is doubtful.
                    The eastern portions of the county are chiefly under tillage and the western in
                    grass. Out of 94,889 acres no fewer than 86,477 acres in 1885 were under
                    cultivation, corn crops occupying 22,820 acres, green crops 7520 acres, rotation
                    grasses 6553 acres, and permanent pasture 47,816 acres. Over 3000 acres were
                    under woodland. The principal corn crop is barley, which occupied 9484 acres,
                    but wheat and oats are also largely grown. Turnips and swedes occupy about
                    five-sixths of the area under green crops. The rearing of sheep and cattle
                    occupies the chief attention of the farmer. Large quantities of cheese are
                    manufactured and sold as Stilton. Cattle, principally shorthorns, numbered
                    19,810, of which 3054 were cows and heifers in milk and in calf.
                    Sheep—Leicesters and South Downs—numbered 80,881, horses 3062, pigs 3054, and
                    poultry 27,376. According to the parliamentary return of 1873 the number of
                    proprietors was 1425, of whom 861 possessed less than one acre. The largest
                    proprietors were the earl of Gainsborough 15,076, Lord Aveland 13,634, marquis
                    of Exeter 10,713, and George H. Finch 9182.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Railways.—</hi> The main line of the Great Northern intersects
                    the north-eastern corner of the county, and branches of that system, of the
                    London and North-Western, and of the Midland connect it with all parts of the
                    country.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration and Population.—</hi> Rutland comprises five
                    hundreds and contains fifty-seven civil parishes, and part of the parish of
                    Stoke-Dry, which extends into Leicestershire. Formerly represented by two
                    members of parliament, since 1885 it returns one only. There is no municipal or
                    parliamentary borough. The county has one court of quarter sessions, but is not
                    subdivided for petty sessional purposes. Ecclesiastically it is entirely in the
                    diocese of Peterborough. The population was 21,861 in 1861, 22,073 in 1871, and
                    21,434 in 1881. The average number of persons to an acre in 1881 was 0 23, and
                    of acres to a person 4 <hi rend="superscript">-</hi> 43.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History and Antiquities.—</hi> In the time of the Romans the
                    district now included in Rutlandshire was probably inhabited by the Coritani,
                    and was included in Flavia Caesariensis. Ennyn</p>
                <p>Street traversed it in the north-east, and there was an important station at
                    Great Casterton. As a shire it is later than Domesday, when a portion of it was
                    included in Northamptonshire but the greater part in Nottingham. It is referred
                    to as com. Roteland in the fifth year of King Johu, in the document assigning a
                    dowry to Queen Isabella, but for a long time previous to this the name Roteland
                    was applied to Oakham and the country round it. Edward, eldest son of Edmund of
                    Langley, fifth son of Edward III., was created earl of Rutland, but the title
                    became extinct in the royal house when Edward earl of Rutland was stabbed to
                    death at the battle of Clilford. In 1525 the title was revived in the person of
                    Lord Ros, and the tenth earl was created duke in 1703. At the battle of Stamford
                    in 1470 Lancaster was defeated by Edward IV. The only old castle of which there
                    are important remains is Oakham, dating from the time of Henry IL, and
                    remarkable for its Norman hall.</p>
