                <p><label type="entry">RUPERT</label> (1619-1682), prince of Bavaria, the third son
                    of Frederick V., elector palatine and king of Bohemia, and of Elizabeth, sister
                    of Charles I. of England, was born at Prague on December 18, 1619. In 1630 he
                    was placed at the university of Leyden, where he showed particular readiness in
                    languages and in military discipline. In 1633 he was with the prince of Orange
                    at the siege of Rhyn-berg, and served against the Spaniards as a volunteer in
                    the prince’s life-guard. In December 1635 he was at the English court, and was
                    named as leader of the proposed expedition to Madagascar. In 1636 he visited
                    Oxford, when he was made master of arts. Returning to The Hague in 1638, he made
                    the first display of his reckless bravery at the siege of Breda, and shortly
                    afterwards was taken prisoner by the Austrians in the battle before Lemgo. For
                    three years he was confined at Linz, where he withstood the endeavours made to
                    induce him to change his religion and to take service with the emperor. Upon his
                    release in 1642 he returned to The Hague, and from thence went to Dover, but,
                    the Civil War not having yet begun, he returned immediately to Holland. Charles
                    now named Rupert general of the horse, and he joined the king at Leicester in
                    August 1642, being present at the raising of the standard at Nottingham. He was
                    also made a knight of the Garter. It is particularly to be noticed that he
                    brought with him several military inventions, and, especially, introduced the
                    “German discipline” in his cavalry operations. He at once displayed the most
                    astonishing activity, fought his first action with success at Worcester in
                    September, and was at Edgehill on October 23. At Aylesbury and Windsor, on the
                    march to London, he received severe checks, but after desperate fighting took
                    Brentford. In 1643 he captured Cirencester, but failed before Gloucester, and in
                    February issued his declaration denying the various charges of inhumanity which
                    had been brought against him. At the end of March he set out from Oxford to join
                    the queen at York, took Birmingham, and, after a desperate resistance,
                    Lichfield, but was there suddenly recalled to the court at Oxford to meet
                    Essex’s expected attack. Chalgrove fight, at which during one of his incessant
                    raids he met Hampden, was fought on June 18. On July 11 he joined the queen at
                    Stratford-on-Avon, and escorted her to the king at Edgehill. He then began the
                    siege of Bristol, which he took on July 26, and he took part in the futile
                    attempt on Gloucester, where he failed to repulse Essex’s relieving force. In
                    the skirmish previous to the first battle of Newbury he checked the enemy’s
                    advance, and in the battle itself displayed desperate courage, following up the
                    day’s work by a night attack on the retiring army. In the beginning of 1644 he
                    was rewarded by being made earl of Holderness, duke of Cumberland, and president
                    of Wales. In February he was at Shrewsbury, from whence he administered the
                    affairs of Wales; in March he went to relieve Newark, and was back at Shrewsbury
                    by the end of the month. He then marched north, relieving Lathom and taking
                    Bolton, and finally relieving York in July. At Marston Moor he charged and
                    routed the Scots, but was in turn completely beaten by Cromwell’s Ironsides. He
                    escaped to York, and thence to Richmond, and finally by great skill reached
                    Shrewsbury on July 20. On November 21 he was repulsed at Abingdon, and on 23d he
                    entered Oxford with Charles. He had meanwhile been made generalissimo of the
                    armies and master of the horse. Against him, however, was a large party of
                    courtiers, with Digby at their head. The influence of the queen, too, was
                    uniformly exerted against him. In May 1645 he took Newark by storm. His advice
                    to march northwards was overruled, and on June 14 the experiences of Marston
                    Moor were repeated at <pb break="no"

                    counselled the king to come to terms with the parliament. In his conduct of the
                    defence of the town, this “boldest attaquer in the world for personal courage”
                    showed how much he “wanted the patience and seasoned head to consult and advise
                    for defence” (Pepys). His surrender of the town after only a three weeks’ siege,
                    though he had promised Charles to keep it four months, caused his disgrace with
                    the king, who revoked all his commissions by an order dated September 14, and in
                    a cold letter ordered him to seek his subsistence beyond seas, for which purpose
                    a pass was sent him. Rupert, however, broke through the enemy, reached the king
                    at Oxford, and was there reconciled to him. He challenged an investigation of
                    his conduct, and was triumphantly acquitted by the council of war. He appears,
                    too, to have remonstrated personally with Charles in terms of indecent violence.
                    He then applied to the parliament for a pass. This, however, was offered only on
                    unacceptable conditions. On June 24 Rupert was taken prisoner by Fairfax at
                    Oxford, and on July 5, at the demand of the parliament, sailed from Dover for
                    France. He was immediately made a marshal in the French service, with the
                    command of the English there. He received a wound in the head at Armentières
                    during 1647. The greater part of the English fleet having adhered to Charles,
                    and having sailed to Holland, Rupert went with the prince of Wales to The Hague,
                    where the charge of it was put into his hand. He immediately set out in January
                    1649 upon an expedition of organized piracy. In February, after passing without
                    molestation through the Parliamentary ships, he was at Kinsale, of which he took
                    the fort. He relieved John Grenville at the Scilly Isles, and practically
                    crippled the English trade. Attacked by Blake, he sailed to Portugal, and was
                    received with kindness by the king; Blake, however, blockaded him in the Tagus,
                    and demanded his surrender. Rupert broke through the blockade and sailed to ûhe
                    Mediterranean, landing at Barbary, and refitting at Toulon; thence he proceeded
                    to Madeira, the Canaries (in 1652), the Azores, Cape de Verd, and the West
                    Indies, sweeping the ocean between the latter places for a considerable time.
                    Finding it impossible, however, to escape the indefatigable pursuit of Blake, he
                    returned to France in 1653. He was now invited to Paris by Louis XIV., who made
                    him master of the horse; he had also an offer from the emperor to command his
                    forces. He travelled for some while, and was again in Paris in 1655. His
                    movements, however, at this time are very uncertain, but he appears to have
                    devoted his enforced leisure to engraving, chemistry, the perfection of
                    gunpowder, and other arts, especially those of military science. Whether he was
                    the actual discoverer of mezzotinto engraving, in which he was skilful, is
                    uncertain, but this seems probable.</p>
                <p>At the end of September 1660 Rupert returned to England; he was abroad during
                    1661, was placed on the privy council in April 1662, and in October was one of
                    the commissioners for Tangiers; in December he became a member of the Royal
                    Society. In August 1664 he was appointed to command the Guinea fleet against the
                    Dutch, and set sail in October. On June 5, 1665, he gained with Monk a great
                    victory over the Dutch, and on his return had his portrait painted by Lely along
                    with the other admirals present at the battle. He again put to sea in May 1666,
                    to hinder the junction of the Dutch and French, and returned in the beginning of
                    June after a heavy defeat, his ship having stuck on the Galloper Sands during
                    the fight. He was obliged to justify himself before the council. In January 1667
                    he was very ill, but recovered after the operation of trepanning. At this time
                    he is mentioned as one of the best tennis players in the nation. On October 22,
                    1667, he received with Monk the thanks of the House of Commons for his exertions
                    against the Dutch at Chatham, and he was again at sea iu April 1668. He was
                    always staunch in his Protestant principles, and was carefully kept in ignorance
                    of Charles’s Catholic plot in 1670. In August of that year he was constable of
                    Windsor, and busied himself with the fitting up of the Round Tower, a turret of
                    which he converted into a workshop. He shared in the prevailing immorality of
                    the time, his favourite mistress being the celebrated actress, Mrs Hughes. In
                    1673 he was appointed lord high admiral, and fought two battles with the Dutch
                    Fleet on May 28 and August 11, but could do little through the backwardness of
                    the French in coming to his assistance. This appears to have so annoyed him that
                    he henceforward eagerly helped the anti-French party. He was an active member of
                    the Board of Trade, and governor of the Hudson’s Bay Company. Till his death, on
                    November 29, 1682, he lived in complete retirement at Windsor. ' (o. <hi
