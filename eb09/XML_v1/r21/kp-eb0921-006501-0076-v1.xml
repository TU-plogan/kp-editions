                <p><label type="entry">RUSSELL</label><hi rend="smallcaps">William Russell,
                    Lord</hi> (1639-1683), the third son of Lord Russell, afterwards fifth earl and
                    still later first duke of Bedford, and Lady Anne Carr, daughter of the infamous
                    countess of Somerset, was born September 29, 1639. Nothing is known of his early
                    youth, except that about 1654 he was sent to Cambridge with his elder brother
                    Francis. On leaving the university, the two brothers travelled abroad, visiting
                    Lyons and Geneva, and residing for some while at Augsburg. His account of his
                    impressions is spirited and interesting. He was at Paris in 1658, but had
                    returned to Woburn in December 1659. At the Restoration he was elected for the
                    family borough of Tavistock. For a long while he appears to have taken no part
                    in public affairs, but rather to have indulged in the follies of court life and
                    intrigue; for both in 1663 and 1664 he was engaged in duels, in the latter of
                    which he was wounded. In 1669 he married the second daughter of the earl of
                    Southampton, the widow of Lord Vaughan, thus becoming connected with
                    Shaftesbury, who had married Southampton’s niece. With his wife Russell always
                    lived on terms of the greatest affection and confidence.</p>
                <p>It was not until the formation of the “country party,” in opposition to the
                    policy of the Cabal and Charles’s French-Catholic plots, that Russell began to
                    take an active part in affairs. He then joined Cavendish, Birch, Hampden,
                    Powell, Lyttleton, and others in vehement antagonism to the court. With a
                    passionate hatred and distrust of the Catholics, and an intense love of
                    political liberty, he united the desire for ease to Protestant Dissenters. His
                    first speech appears to have been on January 22, 1673, in which he inveighed
                    against the stop of the exchequer, the attack on the Smyrna fleet, the
                    corruption of courtiers with French money, and “the ill ministers aboht the
                    king.”</p>
                <p>He also supported the proceedings against the duke of Buckingham. In 1675 he
                    moved an address to the king for the removal of Danby from the royal councils,
                    and for his impeachment. On February 15, 1677, in the debate on the fifteen
                    months’ prorogation, he moved the dissolution of parliament; and in March 1678
                    he seconded the address praying the king to declare war against France. The
                    enmity of the country party against Danby and James, and their desire for a
                    dissolution and the disbanding of the army, were greater than their enmity to
                    Louis. The French king therefore found it easy to form a temporary alliance with
                    Russell, Hollis, and the opposition leaders, by which they engaged to cripple
                    the king’s power of hurting France, and to compel him to seek Louis’s
                    friendship,— that friendship, however, to be given only on the condition that
                    they in their turn should have Louis’s support for their cherished objects.
                    Russell in particular entered into close communication with Rouvigny, who came
                    over with money for distribution among members of parliament. By the testimony
                    of Barillon, however, it is clear that Russell himself utterly refused to take
                    any part in the intended corruption.</p>
                <p>By the wild alarms which culminated in the Popish Terror Russell appears to have
                    been affected more completely than his otherwise sober character would have led
                    people to expect. He threw himself into the party which looked to Monmouth as
                    the representative of Protestant interests, a grave political blunder, though he
                    afterwards was in confidential communication with Orange. On November 4, 1678,
                    he moved an address to the king to remove the duke of York from his person and
                    councils. At the dissolution of the pensionary parliament, he was, in the new
                    elections, returned for Bedfordshire. Danby was at once overthrown, and in April
                    1679 Russell was one of the new privy council formed by Charles on the advice of
                    Temple. Only six days after this we find him moving for a committee to draw up a
                    bill to secure religion and property in case of a Popish successor. He does not,
                    however, appear to have taken part in the exclusion debates at this time. In
                    June, on the occasion of the Covenanters’ rising in Scotland, he attacked
                    Lauderdale personally in full council.</p>
                <p>In January 1680 Russell, along with Cavendish, Capell, Powell, Essex, and
                    Lyttleton, tendered his resignation to the king, which was received by Charles
                    “with all my heart.” On June 16 he accompanied Shaftesbury, when the latter
                    indicted James at Westminster as a Popish recusant; and on October 26 he took
                    the extreme step of moving “how to suppress Popery, and prevent a Popish
                    successor”; while on November 2, now at the height of his influence, he went
                    still further by seconding the motion for exclusion in its most emphatic shape,
                    and on the 19 th carried the bill to the House of Lords for their concurrence.
                    The limitation scheme he opposed, on the ground that monarchy under the
                    conditions expressed in it would be an absurdity. The statement, made by Echard
                    alone, that he joined in opposing the indulgence shown to Lord Strafford by
                    Charles in dispensing with the more horrible parts of the sentence of death—an
                    indulgence afterwards shown to Russell himself—is entirely unworthy of credence.
                    On December 18 he moved to refuse supplies until the king passed the Exclusion
                    Bill. The Prince of Orange having come over at this time, there was a tendency
                    on the part of the opposition leaders to accept his endeavours to secure a
                    compromise on the exclusion question. Russell, however, refused to give way a
                    hair’s breadth.</p>
                <p>On March 26, 1681, in the parliament held at Oxford, Russell again seconded the
                    Exclusion Bill. Upon the dissolution he retired into privacy at his country seat
                    of Stratton in Hampshire. It was, however, no doubt at his wish that his
                    chaplain wrote the <hi rend="italic">Life of Julian the Apos<pb

                    which the lawfulness of resistance in extreme cases was defended. In the wild
                    schemes of Shaftesbury after the election of Tory sheriffs for London in 1682 he
                    had no share; upon the violation of the charters, however, in 1683, he began
                    seriously to consider as to the best means of resisting the Government, and on
                    one occasion attended a meeting at which treason, or what might be construed as
                    treason, was talked. Monmouth, Essex, Hampden, Sidney, and Howard of Escrick
                    were the principal of those who met to consult. On the breaking out of the Rye
                    Plot, of which neither he, Essex, nor Sidney had the slightest knowledge, he was
                    accused by informers of promising his assistance to raise an insurrection and
                    compass the death of the king. Refusing to attempt to escape, ho was brought
                    before the council, when his attendance at the meeting referred to was charged
                    against him. He was sent on June 26, 1683, to the Tower, and, looking upon
                    himself as a dying man, betook himself wholly to preparation for death. Monmouth
                    offered to appear to take his trial, if thereby he could help Russell, and Essex
                    refused to abscond for fear of injuring his friend’s chance of escape. Before a
                    committee of the council Russell, on June 28, acknowledged his presence at the
                    meeting, but denied all knowledge of the proposed insurrection. He reserved his
                    defence, however, until his trial. He would probably have saved his life but for
                    the perjury of Lord Howard. The suicide of Essex, the news of which was brought
                    into court during the trial, was quoted as additional evidence against him, as
                    pointing to the certainty of Essex’s guilt. On July 19 he was tried at the Old
                    Bailey, his wife assisting him in his defence. Evidence was given by an informer
                    that, while at Shaftesbury’s hiding-place in Wapping, Russell had joined in the
                    proposal to seize the king’s guard, a charge indignantly denied by him in his
                    farewell paper, and that he was one of a committee of six appointed to prepare
                    the scheme for an insurrection. Howard, too, expressly declared that Russell had
                    urged the entering into communications with Argyll in Scotland. Howard’s perjury
                    is clear from other witnesses, but the evidence was accepted. Russell spoke with
                    spirit and dignity in his own defence, and, in especial, vehemently denied that
                    he had ever been party to a design so wicked and so foolish as those of the
                    murder of the king and of rebellion. It will be observed that the legality of
                    the trial, in so far as the jurors were not properly qualified and the law of
                    treason was shamefully strained, was denied in the Act of 1 William and Mary
                    which annulled the attainder. Hallam maintains that the only overt act of
                    treason proved against Russell was his concurrence in the project of a rising at
                    Taunton, which he denied, and which, Ramsay being the only witness, was not
                    sufficient to warrant a conviction.</p>
                <p>Russell was sentenced to die. Many attempts were made to save his life. The old
                    earl of Bedford offered £50,000 or £100,000, and Monmouth, Legge, Lady Ranelagh,
                    and Rochester added their intercessions. Russell himself, in petitions to
                    Charles and James, offered to live abroad if his life were spared, and never
                    again to meddle in the affairs of England. He refused, however, to yield to the
                    influence of Burnet and Tillotson, who endeavoured to make him grant the
                    unlawfulness of resistance, although it is more than probable that compliance in
                    this would have saved his life. He drew up, with Burnet’s assistance, a paper
                    containing his apology, and he wrote to the king a letter, to be delivered after
                    his death, in which he asked Charles’s pardon for any wrong he had done him. A
                    suggestion of escape from Lord Cavendish he refused. He behaved with his usual
                    quiet cheerfulness during his stay in the Tower, spending his last day on earth
                    as he had intended to spend the following Sunday if he had reached it. He
                    received the sacrament from Tillotson, and Burnet twice preached to him. Having
                    supped with his wife, the parting from whom was his only great trial, he slept
                    peacefully, and spent the last morning in devotion with Burnet. He went to the
                    place of execution in Lincoln’s Inn Fields with perfect calmness, which was
                    preserved to the last. He died on July 21, 1683, in the forty-fourth year of his
                    age.</p>
