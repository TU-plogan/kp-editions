                <p><label type="entry">ROTIFERA</label>. The <hi rend="italic">Rotifera</hi> (or <hi
                    rend="italic">Rotatoria)</hi> form a small, in many respects well-defined, but
                    somewhat isolated class of the animal kingdom. They are here treated of
                    separately, partly on account of the difficulty of placing them in one of the
                    large phyla, partly on account of their special interest to microscopists.</p>
                <p>Now familiarly known as “wheel animalcules” from the wheel-like motion produced
                    by the rings of cilia which generally occur in the head region, the so-called
                    rotatory organs, they were first discovered by Leeuwenhoek (I), <note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>These numbers refer to the
                    bibliography at p. 8. </p></note> to whom we also owe the discovery of <hi
                    rend="italic">Bacteria</hi> and ciliate <hi rend="italic">Infusoria.</hi>
                    Leeuwenhoek described the <hi rend="italic">Rotifer vulgams</hi> in 1702, and he
                    subsequently described <hi rend="italic">Melicerta mngens</hi> and other
                    species. A great variety of forms were described by other observers, but they
                    were not separated as a class from the unicellular organisms <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Protozoa)</hi> with which they usually occur until the appearance of
                    Ehrenberg’s great monograph (2), which contained a mass of detail regarding
                    their structure. The classification there put forward by Ehrenberg is still
                    widely adopted, but numerous observers have since added to our knowledge of the
                    anatomy of the group (3). At the present day few groups of the animal kingdom
                    are so well known to the micro-scopist, few groups present more interesting
                    affinities to the morphologist, and few multicellular animals such a low
                    physiological condition.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">General Anatomy.—</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Rotifera</hi> are
                    multicellular animals of microscopic size which present a coelom. They are
                    bilaterally symmetrical and present no true metameric segmentation. A head
                    region is generally well marked, and most forms present a definite tail region.
                    This tail region has been termed the “pseudopodium.” Itvaries very much in the
                    extent to which it is developed. It attains its highest development in forms
                    like <hi rend="italic">Philodina,</hi> which affect a Ieech-Iike method of
                    progression and use it as a means of attachment. We may pass from this through a
                    series of forms where it becomes less and less highly developed. In such forms
                    as <hi rend="italic">Brachionus</hi> it serves as a directive organ in swimming,
                    while in a large number of other forms it is only represented by a pair of
                    terminal styles or flaps. In the sessile forms it becomes a contractile pedicle
                    with a suctorial extremity. A pseudopodium is entirely absent in <hi
                    rend="italic">Asplanxhna, Tmarthra, Polyarthra,</hi> and a few other genera. The
                    pseudopodium, when well developed, is a very muscular organ, and it may contain
                    a pair of glands (fig. 2, <hi rend="smallcaps">a,</hi><hi rend="italic">gl)</hi>
                    which secrete an adhesive material.</p>
                <p>The surface of thebody is covered by a firm homogeneous structureless cuticle.
                    This cuticle may become hardened by a further development of chitin, but no
                    calcareous deposits ever take place in it. The cuticle remains softest in those
                    forms which live in tubes. Among the free-living forms the degree of hardening
                    varies considerably. In some cases contraction of the body merely throws the
                    cuticle into wrinkles <hi rend="italic">(Notornmata, Asjdanchna)</hi>; in others
                    definite ring-like joints are produced which telescope into one another during
                    contraction; while in others again it becomes quite firm and rigid and resembles
                    the carapace of one of the <hi rend="italic">Entomostraxa</hi>; it is then
                    termed a “Iorica.” The Iorica may be prolonged at various points into spines,
                    which may attain a considerable length. The surface may be variously modified,
                    being in some cases smooth, in others marked, dotted, ridged, or sculptured in
                    various ways (fig. 1, κ). The curved spines of <hi rend="italic">Philodina
                    aculeata</hi> (fig. 1, <hi rend="smallcaps">g)</hi> and the long rigid spines of
                    <hi rend="italic">Tmarthra</hi> are further developments in this direction. The
                    so-called setae of <hi rend="italic">Polyarthra</hi> on the other hand are more
                    complex in nature, and are moved by muscles, and thus approach the “limbs” of
                    <hi rend="italic">Pedalion.</hi></p>
                <p>Several genera present an external casing or sheath or tube which is termed an
                    “urceolus.” In <hi rend="italic">Eloscularia</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Stejohanxceros</hi> the urceolus is gelatinous and perfectly hyaline; in <hi

                    animal itself, may become covered with foreign particles, and in one species,
                    the well-known <hi rend="italic">Melicerta mngens,</hi> the animal builds up its

                    withdraw itself entirely within the tube.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Locomotor Organs.—</hi> While, as mentioned above, several
                    genera or individual species present long spines, these become movable, and may
                    be spoken of as appendages, in two genera only. In <hi rend="italic"
                    >Polyarthra</hi> (fig. 1, <hi rend="smallcaps">e, f)</hi> there are four groups
                    of processes or plumes placed at the sides of the body, each of which groups can
                    be separately moved up and down by means of muscular fibres attached to their
                    bases, which project into the body. The processes themselves are unjointed and
                    rigid. In <hi rend="italic">Pedalion</hi> (fig. 3), a remarkable form discovered
                    by Dr C. J. Hudson in 1871 (12, 13, 14, and 15), and found in numbers several
                    times since, these appendages have acquired a new and quite special development.
                    They are six in number. The largest is placed ventrally at some distance below
                    the mouth. Its free extremity is a plumose fan-like expansion (fig. 3, A, α, and
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">h).</hi> It is (in common with the others) a hollow process
                    into which ruu two pairs of broad, coarsely transversely striated muscles. Each
                    pair has a single insertion on the inner wall—the one pair near the free
                    extremity of the limb, the other near its attachment; the bands run up, one of
                    each pair on each side and run right round the body forming an incomplete
                    muscular girdle, the ends approximating in the median dorsal line. Below this
                    point springs the large median dorsal limb, which terminates in groups of long
                    setae. It presents a single pair of muscles attached along its inner wall which
                    run up and form a muscular girdle round the body in its posterior third. On each
                    side is attached a superior dorso-lateral and an inferior ventro-lateral
                    appendage, each with a fanlike plumose termination consisting of compound hairs,
                    found elsewhere only among the <hi rend="italic">Crustacea</hi>; each of these
                    is moved by muscles running upwards towards the neck and arising immediately
                    under the trochal disk, the inferior ventro-lateral pair also presenting muscles
                    which form a girdle in the hind region of the body. Various other muscles are
                    present: there are two complete girdles in the neck region immediately behind
                    the mouth; there are also muscles which move the hinder region of the body. In
                    addition to these the body presents various processes which are perhaps some of
                    them unrepresented in other Rotifers. In the median dorsal line immediately
                    below the trochal disk there is a short conical process presenting a pair of
                    muscles which render it capable of slight movement. From a recess at the
                    extremity of this process spring a group of long setose hairs the bases of which
                    are connected with a filament probably nervous in nature. This doubtless
                    represents a structure found in many Rotifers, and variously known as the
                    “calcar,” “siphon,” “tentaculum,” or “antenna.” This calcar is double in <hi
                    rend="italic">Tubicolaria</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Melicerta.</hi> It is very
                    well developed in the genera <hi rend="italic">Rotifer, Philodina,</hi> and
                    others, and is, when so developed, slightly retractile. It appears to be
                    represented in many forms by a pit or depression set with hairs. The calcar has
                    been considered both as an intromittent organ and a respiratory tube for the
                    admission of water. It is now, however, universally considered to be sensory in
                    nature. Various forms present processes in other parts of the body which have
                    doubtless a similar function, <hi rend="italic">e.g., Microcodon</hi> (fig. 1,
                    D, <hi rend="italic">s)</hi> with its pair of lateral organs. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pedalion</hi> presents a pair of ciliated processes in the posterior region of
                    the body (fig. 3, B, c, and D, e), which it can apparently use as a means of
                    attachment; Dr Hudson states that he has seen it anchored by these and swimming
                    round and round in a circle. They possibly re <pb break="no"

                    forms. <hi rend="italic">Pedalion</hi> also has a small ciliated muscular
                    process (fig. 3, <hi rend="smallcaps">a,</hi><hi rend="italic">g)</hi> placed
                    immediately below the mouth, and termed a “chin,” which appears to be merely a
                    greater development of a sort of lower lip which occurs in many Rotifers.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Muscular System.—</hi> All the <hi rend="italic">Rotifera</hi>
                    present a muscular system which is generally very well developed. Transverse
                    striation occurs among the fibres to a varying extent, being well marked in
                    cases where the muscle is much used. The muscles which move the body as a whole
                    are arranged as circular and longitudinal series, but they are arranged in
                    special groups and do not form a complete layer of the body-wall as in the
                    various worms. Some of the longitudinal muscles are specially developed in
                    connexion with the tail or pedicle. Other muscles are developed in connexion
                    with special systems of organs,—the trochal disks, the jaw apparatus, and the
                    reproductive system. The muscles in connexion with the trochal disκ serve to
                    protrude or withdraw it, and to move it about, when extruded, in various
                    directions. The protrusion is probably, however, generally effected by the
                    elasticity of the integument coming into play during the relaxation of the
                    retractor muscles, and by a general contraction of the body wall. The
                    tentaculiferous apparatus of <hi rend="italic">Polyzoa</hi> aud <hi
                    rend="italic">Gephyrca</hi> is protruded in the same manner.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Trochal Disk.—</hi> This structure is the peculiar
                    characteristic of the class. It is homologous with the ciliated bands of the
                    larvae of Echinoderms, Chietopods, Molluscs, &amp;c., and with the
                    tentaculiferous apparatus of <hi rend="italic">Polyzoa</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Gcphyrea,</hi> and has been termed in common with these a “velum.”
                    This velum presents itself in various stages of complexity. It is found as a
                    single circum-oral ring <hi rend="italic">(pilulium),</hi> as a single prae-oral
                    ring (Chaetopod larvae), or as a single prae-oral ring coexisting with one or
                    more post-oral rings (Chaetopod larvae, Holothurian larvae). We may here assume
                    that the ancestral condition was a single circum-oral ring associated with a
                    terminal mouth and the absence of an anus, and that the existence of other rings
                    posterior to this is an expression of metameric segmentation, Ce., a repetition
                    of similar parts. With the development of a prostomiate condition a certain
                    change necessarily takes place in the position of this baud: a portion of it
                    comes to lie longitudinally; but it may still remain a single band, as in the
                    larva of many Echinodenns. Howhave the other above-mentioned conditions of the
                    velum come about? How has the prae-oral band been developed? Two views have been
                    held with regard to this question. According to the one view, the fact whether
                    the single band is a prae-oral or a post-oral one depends upon the position in
                    which the anus is about to develop. H' the anus develops in such a position that
                    mouth and anus lie on one and the same side of the band, the latter becomes
                    prae-oral; if, however, the anus develops so that the mouth and anus lie upon
                    opposite sides of the band, the band becomes post-oral. If we hold this view we
                    must consider any second band, whether prae-or post-oral, to arise as a new
                    development. The other view premises that the anus always forms so as to leave
                    the primitive ring or “architroch” post-oral, i.e., between mouth and anus.
                    Concurrently with the development of a prostomium this architroch somewhat
                    changes its position and the two lateral portions come to lie longitudinally;
                    these may be supposed to have met in the median dorsal line and to have
                    coalesced so as to leave two rings—the one prae-oral (a “cephalo-troch”), the
                    other post-oral (a “branchiotroch”); this latter may atrophy, leaving the single
                    prae-oral ring, or it may become further developed and thrown into more or less
                    elaborate folds. The existing condition of the trochal disk or velum in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Rotifera</hi> seems to the writer of this article to bear out the
                    latter view as to the way in which modifications of the velum ιfiay have come
                    about.</p>
                <p>In its simplest condition it forms a single circum-oral ring, as in <hi
                    rend="italic">Microcodon</hi> (fig. 1, d). The structures at the sides of the
                    mouth in this form are stated to be bristles, and have therefore nothing to do
                    with the velum (fig. 4, a, <hi rend="italic">ρ).</hi> This simple ring may
                    become thrown into folds, so forming a series of processes standing up around
                    the mouth; this is the condition in <hi rend="italic">Stephanoeeros</hi> (fig.
                    4, b,fi). There are, however, but few forms presenting this simple condition;
                    and it must be remembered that the evidence for the assumption here made, that
                    this is a persistent architroch and not a branchiotroch persisting where a
                    Cephalotroch has vanished, is not at present conclusive. This band, may, while
                    remaining single and perfectly continuous, become prolonged around a lobe
                    overhanging the mouth—a prostomium. This condition occurs in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philodina</hi> (fig. 4, E, F, <hi rend="italic">p);</hi> the two sides of the
                    post-oral ring do not meet dorsally, but are carried up and are continuous with
                    the row of cilia lining the “wheels.” There is thus one continuous ciliated
                    band, a portion of which runs up in front of the mouth. This condition
                    corresponds to that of the Auricularian larva. The folding of the band has
                    become already somewhat complicated; <hi rend="superscript">F</hi> a
                    hypothetical intermediate condition is shown in fig. 4,c, D. The next stage in
                    the advancing complexity is that the prostomial portion of the band (fig. 4, G,
                    H, p) becomes separated as a distinct ring, a Cephalotroch; we find such a stage
                    in <hi rend="italic">Laeinularia</hi> (fig. 4,</p>
                <p>G, H), where both Cephalotroch and branchiotroch remain fairly simple in shape.
                    In <hi rend="italic">Mclieerta</hi> (fig. 4, ι, j) both Cephalotroch and
                    branchiotroch are thrown into folds. Lastly, we find that in such forms as <hi
                    rend="italic">Braxhionus</hi> the Cephalotroch becomes first convoluted and then
                    discontinuous (fig. 4, κ, L, c), and further it may become so reduced as to be
                    represented only by a few isolated tufts, as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Asplanchna</hi> (fig. 1, l, <hi rend="italic">x</hi> and x'); in such a form as
                    <hi rend="italic">Lindia</hi> (fig. 6, c) the branchiotroch has vanished and the
                    Cephalotroch has become reduced to the two small patches at the sides of the
                    head.</p>
                <p>The trochal apparatus serves the <hi rend="italic">Rotifera</hi> as a locomotive
                    organ and to bring the food particles to the mouth; the cilia work so as to

                <p><hi rend="italic">Digestive System.—</hi> This consists of the following

                <p>a Polyzoan larva, while <hi rend="italic">Enteroplea</hi> is probably a male
                    Rotifer, and, like the other males, in a reduced condition. There is no reason
                    for considering this mastax as the homologue of either the gastric mill of
                    Crustaceans on the one hand or the teeth in the Chaetopods’ pharynx on the
                    other; it is merely homoplastic with these structures, but has attained a
                    specialized degree of development. Both the pharynx and the oesophagus which
                    follows it are lined with chitin. The oesopliagus varies in length and in some
                    genera is absent <hi rend="italic">(Philo-dinadaeè,</hi> the stomach following
                    immediately upon the pharynx. The stomach is generally large; its wall consists
                    of a layer of very large ciliated cells, which often contain fat globules and
                    yellowish-green or brown particles, and outside these a connective tissue
                    membrane; muscular fibrillae have also been described. Very constantly a pair of
                    glands open into the stomach, and probably represent the hepato-pancreatic
                    glands of other Invertebrates.</p>
                <p>Following upon the stomach there is a longer or shorter intestine, which ends in
                    the cloaca. The intestine is lined by ciliated cells. In forms living in an
                    urceolus the intestine turns round and runs forward, the cloaca being placed so
                    as to debouch over the margin of the urceolus. The cloaca is often very large;
                    the nephridia and oviducts may open into it, and the eggs lodge there on their
                    way outwards; they are thrown out, as are the faecal masses, by an eversion of
                    the cloaca. <hi rend="italic">Asplanchna, Notommata Sieboldii,</hi> and certain
                    species of <hi rend="italic">AScomorpha</hi> are said to be devoid of intestine
                    or anus, excrementitious matters being ejected through the mouth (11).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Nephridia.—</hi> The coelom contains a fluid in which very
                    minute corpuscles have been detected. There is no trace of a true vascular
                    system. The nephridia (fig. 2, B, ri) present a very interesting stage of
                    development. They consist of a pair of tubules with an intracellular lumen
                    running up the sides of the body, at times merely sinuous, at others
                    considerably convoluted. From these are given off at irregular intervals short
                    lateral branches, each of which terminates in a flame-cell precisely similar in
                    structure to the flame-cells found in Planarians, Trematodes, and Cestodes; here
                    as there the question whether they are open to the coelom or not must remain at
                    present undecided. At the base these tubes open either into a permanent bladder
                    which communicates with the cloaca or into a structure presenting apparently no
                    advance in its development upon the contractile vacuole of a ciliate
                    Infusorian.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Nerwus System SeTise-Organs.—</hi> Various structures have been
                    spoken of as nervous which are now acknowledged to have been erroneously so
                    described (18). There is a supra-cesophageal ganglion which often attains
                    considerable dimensions, and presents a Iobed appearance (fig. 2, A and B, g).
                    Connected with this are the eye-spots, which are seldom absent. Where these are
                    most highly developed a lens-like structure is present, produced by a thickening
                    of the cuticle. In the genus <hi rend="italic">Rotifer</hi> and other forms
                    these are placed upon the protrttsible portion of the head, and so appear to
                    have different positions at different moments. The number of eye-spots varies
                    from one to twelve or more. They are usually red, reddish-brown, violet, or
                    black in colour. Other structures are found which doubtless act as sense-organs.
                    The calcar above-mentioned generally bears at its extremity stiff hairs which
                    have been demonstrated to be in connexion with a nerve fibril. On the ventral
                    surface of the body just below the mouth a somewhat similar structure is often
                    developed—the chin. There are besides at times special organs, like the two
                    lateral organs in <hi rend="italic">Microcodon</hi> (fig. 1, d, <hi
                    rend="italic">s),</hi> which no doubt in common with the calcar and chin have a
                    tactile function.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Reproductive Organs and Development.—</hi> The <hi
                    rend="italic">Rotifera</hi> were formerly considered to be hermaphrodite, but,
                    while the ovary was always clear and distinct, there was always some difficulty
                    about the testis, and various structures were put forward as representing that
                    organ. One by one, however, small organisms have been discovered and described
                    as the males of certain species of Rotifers, until at the present time
                    degenerated males are known to occur in all the families except that of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Philodinadae.</hi> The male Rotifers are provided with a single
                    circlet of cilia (a peritroch), a nerve ganglion, eye-spots, muscles, and
                    nephridial tubules all in a somewhat reduced condition, but there is usually no
                    trace of mouth or stomach, the main portion of the body being occupied by the
                    testicular sac. There is an aperture corresponding with the cloaca of the
                    female, where the testis opens into the base of an eversible penis. The males of
                    <hi rend="italic">Ftoscularia</hi> are shown in fig. 1. The male of <hi
                    rend="italic">Pedalion mira</hi> possesses rudimentary appendages. The ovary is
                    usually a large gland lying beside the stomach connected with a short oviduct
                    which opens into the cloaca. The ova often present a reddish hue <hi
                    rend="italic">(Philodina roseola, BraehionUS ηιbens),</hi> due doubtless, like
                    the red colour of many Crustacean ova, to the presence of tetronerythrin.</p>
                <p>Up to the present our embryological knowledge of the group is very incomplete.
                    Many Rotifers are known to lay winter and summer eggs of different character.
                    The winter eggs are provided with a thick shell and probably require
                    fertilization. Two or three of them are often carried about attached to the
                    parent <hi rend="italic">(Brachionus, Notommata),</hi> but they are usually laid
                    and fall into the mud, there to remain till the following spring. The summer
                    eggs are of two kinds, the so-called male and female ova, both of which are
                    stated to develop parthenogenetically. They may be carried about in large
                    numbers in the cloaca or oviduct or attached to the body of the parent. The
                    female ova give rise to female and the male ova to male individuals. Male
                    individuals are only formed in the autumn in time to fertilize the winter
                    ova.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Habitat and Mode of Life.—</hi> The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rotifera</hi> are distributed all over the earth’s surface, inhabiting both
                    fresh and salt water. The greater number of species inhabit fresh water,
                    occurring in pools, ditches, and streams. A few species will appear in countless
                    numbers in infusions of leaves, &lt;kc., but their appearance is generally
                    delayed until the putrefaction is nearly over. Species of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rotifer</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Philodina</hi> appear in this way. A few
                    marine forms only have been described— <hi rend="italic">Brachionus miilleri, B.
                    heptatonus, Synchaeta baltica,</hi> and others.</p>
                <p>A few forms are parasitic. <hi rend="italic">Albertia</hi> lives in the intestine
                    of the earthworm; a form has been described as occurring in the body-cavity of
                    <hi rend="italic">Synapta;</hi> a small form was also observed to constantly
                    occur in the velar and radial canals of the freshwater jelly-fish, <hi
                    rend="italic">Limnocodium. Notommata parasitica</hi> leads a parasitic existence
                    within the hollow spheres of <hi rend="italic">Volvox globator,</hi> sufficient
                    oxygen being given off by the <hi rend="italic">Volvox</hi> for its
                    respiration.</p>
                <p>Many Rotifers exhibit an extraordinary power of resisting drought. Various
                    observers have dried certain species upon the slide, kept them dry for a certain
                    length of time, and then watched them come to life very shortly after the
                    addition of a drop of water. The animal draws itself together, so that the
                    cuticle completely protects all the softer parts and prevents the animal itself
                    from being thoroughly dried. This process is not without parallel in higher
                    groups; <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> many land snails will draw themselves far
                    into the shell, and secrete a complete operculum, and can remain in this
                    condition for an almost indefinite amount of time. The eggs are also able to
                    withstand drying, and are probably blown about from place to place. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Rotifera</hi> can bear great variations of temperature without
                    injury.</p>
                <p>Since their removal from among the <hi rend="italic">Protozoa</hi> various
                    attempts have been made to associate the <hi rend="italic">Rotifera</hi> with
                    one or other large phylum of the animal kingdom. Huxley, insisting upon the
                    importance of the trochal disk, put forward the view that they were “permanent
                    Echino-derm larvae,” and formed the connecting link between the <hi
                    rend="italic">Nemeriidae</hi> and the Nematoid worms. Ray Lankester proposed to
                    associate them with the <hi rend="italic">Chaetopoda</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Arihropoda</hi> in a group <hi rend="italic">Appendiculata,</hi> the
                    peculiarities in the structure of <hi rend="italic">Pedalion</hi> forming the
                    chief reason for such a classification. There is, however, no proof that we thus
                    express any genetic relationship. The well-developed coelom, absence of
                    metameric segmentation, persistence of the trochal disk in varying stages of
                    development, and the structure of the nephridia are all characters which point
                    to the <hi rend="italic">Rotifera</hi> as very near representatives of the
                    common ancestors of at any rate the <hi rend="italic">Mollusca, Arihropoda,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Chaetopoda.</hi> But the high development of the mastax,
                    the specialized character of the lorica in many forms, the movable spines of <hi
                    rend="italic">Polyarthra,</hi> the limbs of <hi rend="italic">Pedalion,</hi> and
                    the lateral appendages of <hi rend="italic">Asplanchna,</hi> the existence of a
                    diminutive male, the formation of two varieties of ova, all point to a
                    specialization in the direction of one or other of the above mentioned groups.
                    Such specialization is at most a slight one, and does not justify the definite
                    association of the <hi rend="italic">Rotifera</hi> in a single phylum with any

                    a worm-like very contractile body and a well-developed mastax. As mentioned
                    above, the ciliation is reduced to a minimum in the curious worm-like form <hi
                    rend="italic">Liudia</hi> (fig. 6, c). <hi rend="italic">Seison nebaliae</hi>
                    (fig. 6, b), living on the surface of <hi rend="italic">Kebalix,</hi> which was
                    described originally by Grube, is the same form as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Saccobddla nebaliae,</hi> which was supposed by Van Beneden and Hesse to be a
                    leech. It has been shown by Claus to be merely an aberrant Rotifer.</p>
                <p>Of the curious aquatic forms <hi rend="italic">Icthydium, Chxtonotus,
                    Turbanella,</hi><hi rend="italic">Dasyditis, Cephalidium, Chxtura,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Hemidasys,</hi> which Mecznikow and Claparède included under the
                    name <hi rend="italic">Gastrotmcha,</hi> no further account can be given here.
                    They are possibly allied to the <hi rend="italic">Rotifera,</hi> but are devoid
                    of mastax and trochal disk.</p>
