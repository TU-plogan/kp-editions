                <p><label type="entry">RUSSELL</label> John Scott (1808-1882), was born in 1808 near
                    Glasgow, a “son of the manse,” and was at first destined for the ministry. But
                    this intention on his father’s part was changed in consequence of the boy’s
                    early leanings towards practical science. He attended in succession the
                    universities of St Andrews, Edinburgh, and Glasgow,— taking his degree in the
                    last-named at the age of sixteen. After spending a couple of years in workshops,
                    he settled in Edinburgh as a lecturer on science, and soon collected large
                    classes. In 1832-33 he was engaged to give the natural philosophy course at the
                    university, the chair having] become vacant by the death of Leslie. In the
                    following year he began that remarkable series of observations on waves whose
                    results, besides being of very great scientific importance, were the chief
                    determining factor of his subsequent practical career. Having been consulted as
                    to the possibility of applying steam-navigation to the Edinburgh and Glasgow
                    Canal, he replied that the question could not be answered without experiments,
                    and that ho was willing to undertake such if a portion of the canal were placed
                    at his disposal. The results of this inquiry are to be found in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh</hi> (vol. xiv.),
                    and in the <hi rend="italic">British Association Reports</hi> (seventh meeting).
                    We need not say more than that the existence of the <hi rend="italic">long
                    wave,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">wave of translation,</hi> as well as many of its
                    most important features, were here first recognized, and (to give one very
                    simple idea of the value of the investigation) that it was clearly pointed out
                    <hi rend="italic">why</hi> there is a special rate, depending on the depth of
                    the water, at which a canal-boat can be towed at the least expenditure of effort
                    by the horse. The elementary mathematical theory of the long wave is very
                    simple, and was soon supplied by commentators on Scott Russell’s work; a more
                    complete investigation has been since given by Stokes; and the subject may be
                    considered äs certainly devoid of any special mystery. Russell held an opposite
                    opinion, and it led him to many extraordinary and groundless speculations, some
                    of which have been published in a posthumous volume, <hi rend="italic">The Wave
                    of Translation</hi> (1885). His observations led him to propose and experiment
                    on a new system of shaping vessels, which is known as the w <hi rend="italic"
                    >ave system.</hi> This culminated in the building of the enormous and unique
                    “Great Eastern,” of which it has been recently remarked by a competent authority
                    that “it is probable that, if a new ‘ Great Eastern ’ were now to be built, the
                    system of construction employed by Mr Scott Russell would be followed
                    exactly.”</p>
                <p>Though his fame will rest chiefly on the two great steps we have just mentioned,
                    Scott Russell’s activity and ingenuity displayed themselves in many other
                    fields,— steam-coaches for roads, improvements in boilers and in marine engines,
                    the immense iron dome of the Vienna exhibition, cellular double bottoms for iron
                    ships, Ac. Along with Mr Stafford Northcote (now Lord Iddesleigh), he was joint
                    secretary of the Great Exhibition of 1851; and he was one of the chief founders
                    of the Institution of Naval Architects, from the twenty-third volume of whose
                    <hi rend="italic">Transactions</hi> we have extracted much of what is stated
                    above. Russell contributed the articles Steam, Steam-Engine, Steam Navigation,
                    &amp;c., to the 7th edition of the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopaedia
                    Britannica.</hi> He died at Ventnor. June 8, 1882.</p>
