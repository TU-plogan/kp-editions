                <p><label type="entry">CUTCH, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Kacπii</hi></label>, a native
                    state in the south-western extremity of Hindustan, situated between 68 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> β</hi> and 72° E. long, and 22° and 25° N^. lat. It is a
                    peninsular tract of land, inclosed towards the W. by the eastern branch of the
                    Indus, or the Koree, on the S. by the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Cutch, and on
                    the N. and E., towards the interior, by the great northern <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ran,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Runn,</hi> an extensive salt morass or lake,
                    which from May to October is flooded with salt water, and communicates in its
                    greatest extent with the Gulf of Cutch on the west and the Gulf of Cambay on the
                    east, these two gulfs being united during the monsoon.</p>
                <p>The interior of Cutch is studded with hills of considerable elevation, and a
                    range of mountains runs through it from east to west, many of them of the most
                    fantastic shapes, with large insulated masses of rock scattered in all
                    directions. In the intervening valleys the country is not deficient in fertility
                    and verdure, and is sufficiently productive in all cases where the nature of the
                    government permits the cultivator to enjoy the fruits of his labour. But this
                    very seldom happens. Many of the hills are covered with jungle, and with the
                    strongholds and dens of petty chiefs, who sometimes protect, but more frequently
                    issue forth to plunder the lower country. The general appearance of Cutch is
                    barren and uninteresting. The greater part is a rock destitute of soil, and
                    presenting the wildest aspect; the ground is cold, poor, and sterile; the rains
                    are generally scanty, and often fail altogether; and the whole face of the
                    country bears marks of volcanic action. From the violence of tyranny, and the
                    rapine of a disorderly banditti, by which this district has from time immemorial
                    been infested, as well as from shocks of earthquakes, the villages have a
                    ruinous and dilapidated appearance; and, with the exception of a few fields in
                    their neighbourhood, the country presents a rocky and sandy waste, with in many
                    places scarcely a show of vegetation. Water is scarce and brackish, and is
                    chiefly found at the bottom of low ranges of hills, which abound in some parts;
                    and the inhabitants of the extensive sandy tracts suffer greatly from the want
                    of it. Owing to the uncertainty of the periodical rains in Cutch, the country is
                    liable to severe famines, which, along with the internal broils by which it has
                    been harassed, have greatly obstructed cultivation, and thinned the inhabitants,
                    many of whom have been induced to emigrate to Bombay and Gujarát; and, in
                    addition to all these evils, an uncommonly violent earthquake, which occurred on
                    the 16th of June 1819, nearly destroyed Bhuj, the capital, and greatly injured
                    the towns of Anjar, Mandávi, and Moondria or Mundra. The soil of Cutch produces
                    grain, cotton, tobacco, ghee, &amp;c.; and iron and coal have been discovered,
                    the latter near the surface of the ground, on the banks of one of the rivers,
                    seven miles north-east of Bhuj, but it is not in general use as fuel.</p>
                <p>The Ran, or Runn, which communicates with the Gulf of Cutch, and sweeps round the
                    northern side of that province, is a very extensive salt morass, varying in
                    breadth from five to eighty miles across, and during the rains nearly impassable
                    for horsemen. The total area of this immense morass may be estimated at about
                    8000 square miles, without including any portion of the Gulf of Cutch, which is
                    in many parts so shallow as to resemble a marshy fen rather than an arm of the
                    sea. The Runn is said to be formed by the overflow of the rivers Pharan, Luní,
                    Banás, and others, during the monsoon; but in December it is quite dry, and in
                    most places hard. The wild ass is very common on the borders of this lake, being
                    seen in herds of from 60 to 70 at a time.</p>
                <p>The temperature of Cutch during the hot season is high, the thermometer
                    frequently rising to 100° or 105°; and in the months of April and May, clouds of
                    dust and sand, blown about by hurricanes, envelop the houses, the glass windows
                    scarcely affording any protection. For nine months of the year the climate is
                    comparatively temperate and agreeable; but the approach of October is equally
                    dreaded by the native and European population as extremely unhealthy, and at the
                    close of the monsoon the oppression of the atmosphere is described as being
                    intolerable. The influence of the monsoon is greatly moderated before it reaches
                    this region, and the rains sometimes fail altogether; but although in this case
                    the necessary consequences are want and misery to the great body of the people,
                    these dry seasons are far more favourable to the health of Europeans. The
                    monsoon generally seis in with <pb break="no"

                    settles in the south-west. The prevailing wind is westerly, and it blows west by
                    south and west by north ten months in the year. The easterly winds, which do not
                    blow more than a month in the year, are always unhealthy and unpleasant, and
                    bring with them, if they continue long, epidemics and locusts. Cutch is
                    considered unhealthy by the natives of other parts of the country; and Dr
                    Burnes, who was stationed there, and gives an account of its medical topography,
                    mentions that he has known many persons from Bombay, especially servants, who
                    were perfectly useless from continued sickness in Cutch, but who recovered their
                    health the moment they left it. He also adds, that he never was at any station
                    where recoveries from fever were so tedious and incomplete. The hospital returns
                    do not, however, he adds, show any extraordinary sickness. Cholera has made no
                    progress in Cutch. The most common diseases among the natives are fever and
                    rheumatism; and fever is also the prevailing disease among Europeans, the first
                    attacks of which are always the most dangerous. These, however, are not
                    ordinarily severe, and easily yield to the remedy σf sulphate of quinine without
                    any serious injury to the constitution. There are some stations at Cutch
                    particularly noxious, such as Narrona, a village in a marsh 24 miles north-east
                    of Bhuj, near the Runn, and Lakshpat Bandar, remarkable for the badness of its
                    water.</p>
                <p>The principal towns are Bhuj, Anjar, Jharrâ, Kantkot, and Katáriá. The principal
                    seaports are Mandávi and Mundra. The town best known to Europeans is Bhuj, which
                    is situated inland, and is surrounded by an amphitheatre of hills, some of which
                    approach within three or four miles of the city. The hill of Bhujá, on which the
                    fort is situated, and under the south-west angle of which is the cantonment of
                    the Cutch brigade, rises to the height of 500 feet in the middle of the plain,
                    and is detached from other high ground. The residency is four miles distant in a
                    westerly direction. There are many mountain streams, but no navigable rivers.
                    They scarcely contain any water except in the rainy season, when they are very
                    full and rapid, and discharge themselves into the Runn, all along the coast of
                    which the wells and springs are more or less impregnated with common salt, and
                    other saline ingredients.</p>
                <p>Various causes have contributed to thin the population of this country. In 1812
                    it was ravaged by a famine and pestilence, which destroyed a great proportion of
                    its inhabitants,—according to some accounts, nearly one-half. This, joined to
                    the tyranny and violence of the Government until the year 1819, and more lately
                    to a succession of unfavourable seasons, has forced many of the cultivators to
                    remove to Sind and other countries. The inhabitants may be estimated at 500,000,
                    of whom one-third are Mahometans and the remainder Hindus of various castes. The
                    Jharijá Rájputs form a particular class, being the aristocracy of the country;
                    and all are more or less connected with the family of the Ráo, or prince. There
                    are in Cutch about 200 of these Jharijá chiefs, who all claim their descent from
                    Sacko Goraro, a prince who reigned in Sind about 1000 years ago. From him also
                    the reigning sovereign is lineally descended, and he is the liege lord of whom
                    all the chiefs or nobles hold their lands in feu, for services which they or
                    their ancestors had performed, or in virtue of their relationship to the family.
                    They are all termed the brotherhood of the Ráo, and supposed to be his
                    hereditary advisers, and their possessions are divided among their male
                    children. To prevent the breaking down of their properties, the necessary
                    consequence of this law of inheritance, there is no doubt that infanticide is
                    common among them, and that it extends to the male as well as the female
                    progeny. The Jharijás consider it unlawful to marry any female of their own
                    tribe, being all descended from a common parent. They accordingly marry into the
                    families of other Rájputs; and to this unfortunate regulation may be chiefly
                    ascribed the destruction of all the female children. The Jharijás have a
                    tradition that when they entered Cutch they were Mahometans, but that they
                    afterward adopted the customs and religion of the Hindus. It is certain, indeed,
                    that they still retain many Mahometan customs. They take oaths equally on the
                    Koran or on the Shastrás; they employ Mussulman books; they eat from their
                    hands; the Ráo, when he appears in public, alternately worships God in a Hindu
                    pagoda and a Mahometan mosque; and he fits out annually at Mandávi a ship for
                    the conveyance of pilgrims to Mecca, who are maintained during the voyage
                    chiefly by the liberality of the prince. The Mahometans in Cutch are of the same
                    degenerate caste with those usually found in the western parts of India. The
                    Miánás forms a par ticular class, who claim the same descent as the Jharijás,
                    and boast of their constancy to the Mahometan creed, while the latter
                    apostatized; but they have now entirely degenerated, and are little better than
                    banditti, always ready to commit outrages, and to sally out in disorderly bands
                    to plunder the defenceless country. Such has been the weakness and tyranny of
                    the rulers of Cutch, that they have frequently had recourse to these wretched
                    auxiliaries in order to aid them in their inordinate exactions, while at other
                    times they recruited the army from the same race. They were nearly extirpated
                    under the rigorous rule of Fathi Muhammad, but of late years they have returned
                    in considerable numbers to their villages among the hills. In the seasons of
                    scarcity of 1823 and 1824, many of them emigrated to Sind, where, joining with
                    other adventurers, they formed disorderly bands, who made forays into Cutch,
                    several villages of which they plundered and burned. The natives are in general
                    of a stronger and stouter make, and even handsomer, than those of Western India;
                    and the women of the higher classes are also handsome. The peasants are
                    described as intelligent, and the artizans are justly celebrated for their
                    ingenuity and mechanical skill. The palace at Mandávi, and a tomb of one of
                    their princes at Bhuj, are fair specimens of their architectural skill. In the
                    manufacture of gold and silver ornaments they display great taste and nicety.
                    The natives of this country are in general peaceable and obedient subjects, for
                    robberies and murders are seldom committed except by the Miánás. The quantity of
                    opium which they use is enormous; its effects, according to Dr Burnes, are less
                    deleterious to their constitution than might be supposed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The country of Cutch was invaded about the 9th
                    century by a body of Mahometans of the Summa tribe, who under the guidance of
                    five brothers emigrated from Sind, and who gradually subdued or expelled the
                    original inhabitants, consisting of three distinct races. The descendants of
                    these five leaders assumed the name of Jharijá, from a chief named Jharrá, who
                    set an example of female infanticide by putting to death his seven daughters in
                    one day. Cutch continued tranquil under their sway for many years, until some
                    family quarrel arose, in which the chief of an elder branch of the tribe was
                    murdered by a rival brother. His son fled to Ahmadábád to seek the assistance of
                    the viceroy, who was married to his sister, and who reinstated him in the
                    sovereignty of Cutch, and Murvi in Káthiáwár, in the title of Ráo, or Rawul, in
                    the year 1519.</p>
                <p>The succession continued in the same line from the time of this prince until
                    1666, when a younger brother, Prágji, murdered lus elder brother and usurped the
                    sovereignty. This line of princes continued till 1760 without any remarkable
                    event, when, in the reign of Ráo Gor, the country was invaded four times by the
                    Sιnds, who wasted it with fire and sword. The reign of this prince, as well as
                    that of his son Ráo Rahiden, by whom he was succeeded in 17/8, was marked by
                    cruelty and blood. The latter prince was dethroned, and, being in a state of
                    mental derangement, was during his lιie-time confined by Fathi Muhammad, a
                    native of Sind, who continued, with a short interval (in which the party of the
                    ιegal heir, hnaι.ii Bawa, gained the ascendency), to rule the country until his
                    deatn in 1813. It was in the reign of Fathi Muhammad that a communi-eation<pb

                    During the contests for the sovereignty between the usurper and the legal heir,
                    the leader of the royal party, Hansráj, the governor of Mandávi, sought the aid
                    of the British. But no closer connection followed at that time than an agreement
                    for the suppression of piracy, or of inroads of troops to the eastward of the
                    Runn, or Gulf of Cutch. But the Gulf continued notwithstanding to swarm with
                    pirates, who were openly encouraged or connived at by the son of Hansráj, who
                    had succeeded his father, as well as by Fathi Muhammad. The latter left several
                    sons by different wives, who were competitors for the vacant throne. Husain
                    Miyán succeeded to a considerable portion of his father’s property and power.
                    Jugjevan, a Brahman, the late minister of Fathi Muhammad, also received a
                    considerable share of influence; and the hatred of these two factions was
                    embittered by religious animosities, the one being Hindu and the other
                    Mahometan. The late Ráo had declared himself a Mahometan, and his adherents were
                    preparing to inter his body in a magnificent tomb, when the Jharijas and other
                    Hindus seized the corpse and consigned it to the flames, according to Hindu
                    custom.</p>
                <p>The administration of affairs was nominally in the hands of Husain Miyan and his
                    brother Ibrahim Miyán. Many sanguinary broils now ensued, in the course of which
                    Jugjevan was murdered, and the executive authority was much weakened by the
                    usurpations of the Arabs and other chiefs. In the meantime Ibrahim Miyán was
                    assassinated; and after various other scenes of anarchy, the Ráo Bharmulji, son
                    of Ráo Rahiden, by general consent, assumed the chief power. But his reign was
                    one continued series of the grossest enormities; his hostility to the British
                    became evident, and accordingly a force of 10,500 men crossed the Runn in
                    November 1815, and were within five miles of Bhuj, the capital of the country,
                    when a treaty was concluded, by which the Ráo Bharmulji was confirmed in his
                    title to the throne, on agreeing, among other stipulations, to cede Anjar and
                    its dependencies in perpetuity to the British. He was, however, so far from
                    fulfilling the terms of this treaty that it was determined to depose him; and an
                    army being sent against him, he surrendered to the British, who made a provision
                    for his maintenance, and elevated bis infant son to the throne.</p>
                <p>In 1822 the relations subsisting between the ruler of Cutch and the British were
                    modified by a new treaty, under which the territorial cessions made by the Ráo
                    in 1816 were restored in consideration of an annual payment. The sum fixed was
                    subsequently thought too large, and in 1832 the arrears, amounting to a
                    considerable sum, were remitted, and all future payments on this account
                    relinquished. From that time the Ráo has paid a subsidy of £20,000 per annum to
                    the British for the maintenance of the military force stationed within his
                    dominions. Suttee has been prohibited in Cutch; and, under British influence,
                    various other measures of a salutary and beneficent character have been
                    adopted.</p>
