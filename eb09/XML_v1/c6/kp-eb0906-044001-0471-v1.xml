                    (1820-1875), a distinguished German philologist, was born at Bremen, January 20,
                    1820, and received bis school education in the Prussian town of Schwedt, to
                    which his father, a merchant, had removed. After spending some time at the
                    Joachimsthal Gymnasium in Berlin, where his interest in philological pursuits
                    was awakened by the Rector Meinike, he proceeded to the university, and there
                    came especially under the influence of Boeckh and Lachmann. His first important
                    appearance in literature was as the author of <hi rend="italic">Origines</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Poesis</hi><hi rend="italic">Romance,</hi> by which he had
                    obtained the prize offered by the “philosophical” or “arts” faculty of the
                    university. In 1846 he was called from Stettin, where he had for nearly two
                    years held a post in the gymnasium, to occupy the position of lecturer in the
                    royal academy at Pforta (near Naumburg), and there he continued to labour for
                    the next twenty years. The philosophico-historical class of the Royal Prussian
                    Academy of Sciences having, in 1854, offered a prize for the best work on the
                    pronunciation and accent of Latin, he gained the day by means of a treatise
                    which at once took rank, on its publication under the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ueber</hi><hi rend="italic">Aussprache,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Vokalismus,</hi><hi rend="italic">und Betonung der Lateinischen Sprache</hi> (2
                    vols. Leipsic, 1858-59), as one of the most erudite and masterly works in its
                    department. This was followed in 1863 by his <hi rend="italic">Kritische
                    Beiträge zur Lat. Formenlehre,</hi> which were supplemented in 1866 by <hi
                    rend="italic">Kritische Nachträge zur Lat. Formenlehre.</hi> In the discus sion
                    of the pronunciation of Latin he was naturally led to consider the various old
                    Italian dialects, and the results of his investigations appeared in
                    miscellaneous communications to Kuhn’s <hi rend="italic">Zeitschrift für
                    vergleichende Schriftforschung.</hi> The state of his health obliged him to give
                    up his professorship at Pforta, and return to Berlin, in 1866; but it produced
                    almost no diminution of his literary activity. In 1867 he published an elaborate
                    archaeological study entitled the <hi rend="italic">Alterthümer und
                    Kunstdenkmale</hi><hi rend="italic">des C ister denser-klosters St</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Marien und der Landesschule Pforta,</hi> in which he gathers
                    together all that can be discovered about the history of the establishment where
                    he had taught so long; and in 1868-69 he brought out a new edition of his work
                    on Latin pronunciation. From a very early period he had been attracted to the
                    special study of Etruscan remains, and had at various times given occasional
                    expression to his opinions on individual points; but it was not till 1870 that
                    he had the opportunity of visiting Italy and completing his equipment for a
                    formal treatment of the whole subject by personal inspection of the monuments.
                    In 1874 appeared the first volume of <hi rend="italic">Ueber die</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Sprache der Etrusker,</hi> in which with great ingenuity and
                    erudition he endeavours, it cannot be said with complete success, to prove that
                    the Etruscan language was cognate with that of the Romans. Before the second
                    volume had received the last touches of his hand he was cut off by a
                    comparatively early death, which had in all probability been hastened by those
                    long hours which he had spent in “damp grave-chambers,” painfully deciphering by
                    candle-light the faded and fragmentary inscriptions of forgotten days. Whatever
                    may be the ultimate decision of criticism on the great question at issue, <pb

                    proved by later investigators, it cannot be denied that he has brought the
                    matter one step nearer to a final conclusion. The posthumous volume appeared in
                    1875, having been edited by E. W. A. Kuhn.</p>
