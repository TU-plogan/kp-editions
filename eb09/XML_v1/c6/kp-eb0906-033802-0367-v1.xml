                <p><label type="entry">CO-OPERATION</label>, a term in social economics, which,
                    though of generic significance in the science of industry and trade, has a
                    specific and technical sense, implying the association of any number of
                    individuals or societies for mutual profit, whether in the purchase and
                    distribution of commodities for consumption, or in the production of
                    commodities, or in the borrowing and lending of capital among workmen.</p>
                <p>The most powerful co-operative force in the industrial system is what economists
                    have termed “the division of labour,” but that is in reality also a union and
                    graduation of labour towards productive ends, and has its counterpart in the
                    multiform divisions of capital in its application to the maintenance and
                    extension of industry.</p>
                <p>Co-operation, as technically understood, occupies a middle position between the
                    doctrines of the communists and socialists (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Communism)</hi> on the one hand, and the private property and freedom of
                    individual labour and enterprize on the other. It takes its departure from
                    communism at a very definite and significant point. While the latter would
                    extinguish the motive of individual gain and possession <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n368/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0368-0339"/> in the sentiment of a universal happiness or
                    good, and remodel all the existing rights, laws, and arrangements of society on
                    a basis deemed consonant to this end, co-operation seeks, in consistency with
                    the fundamental institutes of society as hitherto developed, to ameliorate the
                    social condition by a concurrence of increasing numbers of associates in a
                    common interest.</p>
                <p>The co-operative societies, springing from this idea, though attended with the
                    most varied fortune, have greatly increased in number and in amount of business
                    in recent years. The form, particular objects, and organic rules of these
                    associations are by no means uniform. But, as we find them in the principal
                    countries of Europe, they may be divided into three general classes :—1.
                    Societies of consumption, the object of which is to buy and sell to members
                    alone, or to members and non-members under differing conditions, the necessaries
                    of life or the raw materials of their industry; 2. Societies of production, the
                    object of which is to sell the collective or individual work of the members; 3.
                    Societies of credit or banking, the object of which is to open accounts of
                    credit with their members, and advance them loans for industrial purposes. There
                    are numerous modifications of the principle, such as friendly societies, burial
                    societies, societies of workmen which undertake the execution of work by
                    contract, arrangements of private firms by which the workmen share in the
                    profits of the employers, and building societies, now rife in most large towns,
                    the object of which is to enable members to become owners of dwelling houses.
                    But the above three categories define the distinguishing characteristics of the
                    co-operative society proper; and it is somewhat remarkable that the three kinds
                    of association have attained marked success in three different European
                    countries. England stands at the head in societies of consumption; France, in
                    societies of production; Germany, in societies of credit. With reference to this
                    variety of result it may be observed that the social equality resulting from the
                    great Revolution, in connection with the character of much of the manufacturing
                    industry of France, has given that country a larger number of artizans who work
                    in their own houses, and have a passion for independence in their handicraft,
                    than is to be found in any other country. On the other hand, the masses of
                    operatives in the factories and other great works of England, while retaining
                    their position as wage-earners, have put forth most energy and attained their
                    highest co-operative s access in societies for the purchase, and in some degree
                    the production, of their own immediate necessaries of life. The less abundant
                    capital, and the want of banks and other institutions of credit in the smaller
                    towns and remoter parts of Germany, may explain in some measure the notable
                    development of societies of credit in that country. But no account of the
                    phenomena in Germany would be satisfactory without placing at the head of
                    influences the personal agency of one man—Μ. Schulze, of Delitzsch (a town of
                    only 6000 inhabitants)—who had the sagacity to perceive that societies of credit
                    were the necessary foundation of the co-operative system, and who reasoned out
                    principles, planned, and laboured with a skill, disinterestedness, and
                    perseverance which have crowned his idea with remarkable success.</p>
                <p>The Credit Society of Μ. Schulze is practically a bank, but a bank organized on
                    principles specially adapted to the working classes within certain limits of
                    transaction, to which it is strictly confined. The members of the society must
                    be men of “self-help,” able to work and in regular employment, and they must
                    hold each one equal share of the stock-capital of the society, which may be paid
                    up in full, or by regular instalment. Dividends are only paid to the members who
                    have paid in full, the profits due on the partly-paid shares being added to
                    these till they reach their full amount. It follows from the principle of the
                    society— “in proportion to the chance of gain the risk of loss—” that when the
                    share-capital has to be called upon to liquidate the debts, it is the capital
                    actually paid in that loses. Equality of shares and equality of advantages and
                    risks are thus attained. But in addition to the share-capital there is a reserve
                    fund formed out of entrance fees and a percentage of the net profits. The order
                    of liability for deficits in the balance sheets is thus (1) reserve fund, (2)
                    paid-in capital, and (3) private property of the members— the final principle
                    being that of unlimited liability. Every member is responsible for the debts of
                    the society, and the society for the debts of every member. It is obvious that a
                    company thus constituted, and composed of the most saving and industrious
                    workmen of a town or district, offers a solid security, and consequently the
                    share-capital is supplemented by loans for given periods of time, debentures,
                    and savings deposits, the last having to be guarded by conditions as to notice
                    of withdrawal. At the beginning of a society the paid-up share-capital may not
                    be more than the proportion of 10 to 90 of borrowed funds, but it has to be
                    brought up as rapidly as possible to 25 per cent., and should reach a maximum of
                    50 per cent. The share-capital, as originally fixed, has also to be increased as
                    the business, and the amount of funds necessary for its transaction, increase;
                    so that the amount of each share has thus to be supplemented <hi rend="italic"
                    >plus</hi> the increase of business <hi rend="italic">minus</hi> the increase of
                    members. By these means the society is protected from too small a share-capital
                    for its liabilities, and from the temptation of appropriating large dividends
                    out of the surplus profit, accruing from borrowed funds. Another peculiarity of
                    the German “credit union” is that it makes advances of the funds of which it is
                    possessed to its own members only. The two great ends to be secured being the
                    minimum of risk and the maximum of responsibility, the first is promoted by
                    advancing money only for industrial purposes, within due limits, among borrowers
                    whose requirements and circumstances are or may be thoroughly known to the
                    society, and the second by the fact that every member of the society is
                    unlimitedly liable for any errors or losses that may arise in the
                    administration. The advances are made in the usual forms of promissory notes
                    with the indorsation of sureties ordinary bills of exchange, and occasionally
                    mortgages over real property in current accounts. Advances are not made for
                    longer periods than the society can itself borrow; partial repayment at dates is
                    sometimes conditioned within the period of advance; and the interest charged
                    follows the public money-market rate. It is thus that Μ. Schulze, through a
                    series of skilful regulations beyond our space to follow, solved the problem,
                    which vexed and puzzled the socialists of a past generation, of bringing capital
                    direct to the workman or “immediate producer.”</p>
                <p>When the little “credit union” of Delitzsch was fully organized in 1852, popular
                    opinion was so well prepared and enlightened on the subject by Μ. Schulze’s
                    efforts in the Prussian Parliament and on the platform, that similar societies
                    were rapidly organized in other parts of the country. While each society had
                    full powers of self-regulation, they were all much on the Delitzsch model, and a
                    general affiliation was brought about for mutual counsel and encouragement. Μ.
                    Schulze then applied in the legislature for corporate rights and legal status to
                    the associations, and after tedious labours obtained them. In 1865 he
                    established a central credit bank at Berlin, by which the societies, while
                    depending mainly on local credit supplies, might have access, in case of need,
                    to the general loan market. The “credit unions,” though now numerous, are only a
                    section of the co-operative movement in Germany.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n369/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0369-0340"/>
                <p>The law of the Prussian Parliament granting corporate rights to loan and credit
                    associations extends the same privileges to “raw material and store unions,”
                    “unions for the production and sale of finished wares on a common account,”
                    “unions for the purchase of the necessaries of life wholesale and the selling of
                    them retail,” and “unions for providing their members with dwelling-houses.”</p>
                <p>The history of the co-operative movement in France is much too extensive to be
                    traced here. But it may be observed that the French co-operators have
                    discovered, at various periods, a strong leaning to the opinion that, while they
                    supply the labour, the state is under obligation to supply in whole or in part
                    the capital and other means of labour; and under this idea co-operation merges
                    very nearly into communism. “L’état! c’est moi,” said Louis XIV., and in the
                    days of democracy the same idea not unnaturally suggests itself to an
                    overwhelming majority of the people. This was precisely the argument which the
                    late Μ. Lasalle, following the French socialists, used against Schulze and the
                    economists in Germany. “Society,” he in effect argued, “consists of 96 <hi
                    rend="italic">prolétaires</hi> and four capitalists. There is the state! The
                    prolétaires have no capital, can save nothing, have nothing to save from. But
                    the state, of which they are 96 out of 100, can come forward, cover the
                    prolétaires with its credit, and give a new departure to the production and
                    distribution of wealth. Capital in its personal accumulation is merely the spawn
                    of ages of slavery, craft, and plunder.” The discussion of this question had
                    been exhausted in France more than once. Bastiat and Proudhon had quite recently
                    fought it out between them. But there were also practical experiments and
                    illustrations. On the revolution of February 1848, the French state recognized
                    to some extent its duty to the prolétaires, organized national workshops, and
                    voted 3,000,000 francs for the use of fifty-six co-operative societies.
                    Three-fourths of these societies perished after a brief period. The state lost
                    its money, and the members did themselves no good. Only a remnant, by organizing
                    themselves on sounder principles, survived. The “Société des Tourneurs en
                    Chaises,” which refused assistance from the state, and declined the principle of
                    equality of wages, is flourishing to this day. The Society of Masons, of
                    Piano-Makers, of “Ouvriers Lunettiers,” and others, have established a strong
                    position, beginning with small capital, and increasing it to large amounts. In
                    Lyons there are the “Société des Tisseurs,” of 1800 members, and others; at St
                    Étienne the “Association des Rubanniers,” of 1200 members, said to have half a
                    million sterling of capital. The “society of production,” of which there are at
                    least forty examples∙in Paris alone, is found in nearly all the French
                    provinces, and has proved the capacity of workmen by union to carve out business
                    for themselves and be their own masters, while, in many cases, employing other
                    workmen or auxiliaries at wages, who have no share in the profits. There are
                    also in France more examples, probably, than in any other country, of workmen
                    sharing in the profits of the firms by which they are employed, under
                    arrangements offered and regulated by the employers or capitalists
                    themselves.</p>
                <p>Of the “society of consumption” there are innumerable examples in the United
                    Kingdom, the chief being the Rochdale, Leeds, and Halifax Societies, embracing
                    nearly the whole working population of a large manufacturing district, an 1
                    carrying out their operations, from the wholesale and retail stores to dairies,
                    flour-mills, and other auxiliary branches, including libraries and newsrooms.
                    The supply associations in London organized by members of the Government civil
                    service have also attained much importance; but, as these trade with the public,
                    and divide large profits among privileged holders of shares, it has been
                    questioned whether they can be properly regarded as co-operative societies.
                    Nearly every town of the kingdom has a “cooperative store;” and when these are
                    numerous in a district they usually affiliate, and open a common wholesale
                    department in Liverpool, Glasgow, or some other emporium. The advantages in many
                    cases may not be great, and after a brjef existence the societies not
                    unfrequently wind up. But when properly conducted and supported, they secure
                    wholesome commodities, encourage among their members readymoney payments, and as
                    the goods are sold at a fair margin of profit, there is every quarter or half
                    year a dividend at the rate of 5 to 10 or more per cent, to the members on their
                    share-capital, and a bonus to nonmembers on the amount of their purchases. One
                    of the indirect advantages of the co-operative store, when established in a
                    community, is its influence as a formidable rival on private grocers and
                    dealers.</p>
                <p>The most signal instances of failure of the co-operative principle in the United
                    Kingdom have occurred in the sphere of “production,” where France has given many
                    successful examples. The united coal-miners of South Yorkshire purchased the
                    Shirland Collieries in 1874 at a price of £70,000, of which they paid down
                    £31,000, raising the remainder of the purchase money in debenture bonds. The
                    working and proprietary company thus formed has never been able to pay the
                    interest due on its bonds, and the collieries have now passed into other hands
                    for £11,000 with the liabilities attaching to them, and the whole capital of the
                    workmen has been lost. The purchase of collieries at a period when the coal
                    trade and wages of mining labour were in a state of inflation, followed sharply
                    by successive collapses, may account for this unfortunate result. The
                    engineering factory at Ouseburn, bought up and worked for a time by operatives,
                    is again, after a stoppage, re-established on a co-operative basis. But the
                    failure of co-operative production has been recently illustrated in another
                    form. In 1865 Messrs Briggs &amp; Co., proprietors of the Whitwood and Methley
                    Junction Collieries, entered into a permanent contract with their workmen,
                    whereby the latter were to receive, in addition to the current rate of wages,
                    one-half of the profits above 10 per cent, for the redemption of capital
                    invested. As long as there were profits, and the rate of wages presented no
                    difficulty, this answered well enough; but when the tide turned, and there were
                    no profits, but only loss unless wages were reduced, the situation was wholly
                    altered in the estimate of the workmen, and the compact was broken up in 1874 on
                    the demand of the men themselves, who said they would prefer to be simply
                    members of the “Miners’ Union.”</p>
                <p>The numerous cotton factories in Lancashire, on a basis of small joint-stock
                    shares, yielding in some cases large dividends, might almost be considered as
                    great an example of co-operative production as any effort of the kind in France.
                    The operatives have a large stake and much advantage in those factories; but
                    since the spinner or weaver does not necessarily work in the factory of which he
                    has a small proprietary share, these joint-stock establishments are probably to
                    be regarded more as investments of the savings of the operatives than as
                    co-operative societies. The co-operative idea, as would probably be held by its
                    most staunch propounders, requires identity of purpose and interest, with
                    community of advantages and risks, though not necessarily absolute equality or
                    uniformity of individual relations, among the co-operators. When the association
                    passes into a mere investment and trading company, the idea would seem to be
                    lost.</p>
                <p>The co-operative system in the United Kingdom has attained such magnitude as well
                    as variety of development that our literature on the subject cannot be deemed so
                    complete as would be desirable.</p>
