                    >Cacao</hi></label>, is a valuable dietary substance yielded by the seeds of
                    several small trees belonging to the genus <hi rend="italic">Theobroma,</hi> of
                    the natural order <hi rend="italic">Sterculiaceae.</hi> The whole genus, which
                    comprises nine or ten species, belongs to the tropical parts of the American
                    continent; and although the cocoa of commerce is probably the produce of more
                    than one species, by far the greatest and most valuable portion is obtained from
                    the <hi rend="italic">Theobroma</hi><hi rend="italic">Cacao</hi> of Linnaeus.
                    The generic name is derived from öcos (god) and <hi rend="italic">βpwμa</hi>
                    (food), and was bestowed by Linnaeus as an indication of the high appreciation
                    in which he held the beverage prepared from the seeds, which he considered to be
                    a food fit for the gods.</p>
                <p>The common cocoa tree is of low stature, seldom exceeding 16 or 18 feet in
                    height, but it is taller in its native forests than it is in cultivated
                    plantations. The leaves are large, smooth, and glossy, elliptic-oblong and
                    acuminate in form, growing principally at the ends of branches, but sometimes
                    springing directly from the main trunk. The flowers are small, and occur in
                    numerous clusters on the <pb break="no"

                    peculiarity which gives the matured fruit the appearance of being artificially
                    attached to the tree. Generally only a single fruit is matured from each cluster
                    of flowers. When ripe the fruit or “pod” is elliptical-ovoid iu form, from 7 to
                    10 inches in length, and from 3 to 4∣ inches in diameter. It has a hard, thick,
                    leathery rind of a rich purplish yellow colour, externally rough and marked with
                    ten very distinct longitudinal rib,s or elevations. The interior of the fruit
                    has five cells, in each of which is a row of from 5 to 10 seeds embedded in a
                    soft delicately piħk acid pulp. Each fruit thus contains from 20 to 40 or more
                    seeds, which constitute the raw cocoa or “cocoa beans” of commerce.</p>
                <p>The tree appears to have been originally a native of Mexico; but it can be
                    cultivated in suitable situations within the 25th parallels of latitude. It,
                    however, flourishes best within the 15th parallels, at elevations ranging from
                    near the sea-level up to about 2000 feet in height. It is now cultivated in
                    Mexico, Honduras, Guatenſala, Nicaragua, Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, New Granada,
                    Venezuela, Guiana, and most of the West Indian Islands. Its cultivation has also
                    been attempted in other tropical regions of the globe; but the industry has
                    hitherto not been developed on any considerable scale away from the American
                    continent and the West Indian Islands.</p>
                <p>For the successful cultivation of the cocoa tree a rich well-watered soil and a
                    humid atmosphere, with freedom from cold winds and protection from violent
                    storms, are necessary. As the young plants are extremely delicate and tender,
                    they are reared in nursery grounds till they attain a height of from 15 to 18
                    inches, and after planting out they still require protection from the wind and
                    sun, which is provided by growing “provisions” (food-yielding plants), aud the
                    coral-bean tree, <hi rend="italic">Erythrina CoraUodendron,</hi> among the young
                    trees. The trees begin to bear in the fourth or fifth year, but they do not
                    attain their full productive vigour till about their eighth year, and they ought
                    to continue prolific for from thirty to forty years thereafter. As the trees
                    carry buds, flowers, and fruit in all stages at the same time, ripe pods may be
                    collected at any period of the year, but there are periodical harvests dependent
                    on the suitability of the weather for collecting the fruit and curing the seeds.
                    In Venezuela, where the famous Caracas cocoa is grown, the gathering takes place
                    in June and December, these being the crop of St John and the Christmas crop
                    respectively. In gathering the workman is careful to cut down only fully ripened
                    pods, which he adroitly accomplishes with a long pole armed with two prongs or a
                    knife at its extremity. The pods are left in heaps on the ground for about
                    twenty-four hours; they are then cut open, and the seeds are taken out, and
                    carried in baskets to the place where they undergo the operation of sweating or
                    curing. There the acid juice which accompanies the seeds is first drained off,
                    after which they are placed in a sweating box, in which they are enclosed and
                    allowed to ferment for some time, great care being taken to keep the temperature
                    from rising too high. The fermenting process is, in some cases, effected by
                    throwing the seeds into holes or trenches in the grounα, and covering them with
                    earth or clay. The seeds in this process, which is called claying, are
                    occasionally stirred to keep the fermentation from proceeding too violently. The
                    sweating is a process which requires the very greatest attention and experience,
                    as on it to .a great extent depend the flavour of the seeds and their fitness
                    for preservation. The operation varies in duration according to the state of the
                    weather, but a period of about two days yields the best results. Thereafter the
                    seeds are exposed to the sun for drying, and those of a fine quality should then
                    assume a warm reddish tint, which characterizes beans of a superior quality.</p>
                <p>The cocoa tree was cultivated, and its produce held in the highest esteem, in
                    Mexico and Feru previous to the discovery of the American continent by Columbus.
                    Prescott, in his <hi rend="italic">Conquest of Peru,</hi> says of the followers
                    of Pizarro, that as they sailed along the Pacific coast they saw “hill-sides
                    covered with the yellow maize and the potato, or checkered in the lower levels
                    with blooming plantations of cacao.” The same writer, referring to the use of
                    cocoa in Mexico, says of the Emperor Montezuma that “he was exceedingly fond of
                    it, to judge from the quantity, no less than 50 jars or pitchers being prepared
                    for his own daily consumption; 2000 more were allowed for that of his
                    household.” “Traffic,” he adds again, “was carried on partly by barter and
                    partly by means of a regulated currency of different values. This consisted of
                    transparent quills of gold dust, of bits of tin cut in the form of a T, and bags
                    of cacao containing a specified number of grains.”</p>
                <p>A knowledge of this valuable article of food was first brought to Europe by
                    Columbus, but some time elapsed ere its virtues were appreciated in the Old
                    World. Spain was the first nation in which its use became common; and to this
                    day cocoa is much more extensively consumed among the Spaniards than by any
                    other European community. The earliest intimation of the introduction of cocoa
                    into England is found in an announcement in the <hi rend="italic">Public
                    Advertiser</hi> of Tuesday, 16th June 1657, notifying that “In Bishopgate
                    Street, in Queen’s Head Alley, at a Frenchman’s house, is an excellent West
                    India drink, called chocolate, to be sold, where you may have it ready at any
                    time, and also unmade, at reasonable rates.” About the beginning of the 18th
                    century chocolate had become an exceedingly fashionable beverage, and the cocoa
                    tree was a favourite sign and name for places of public refreshment. Cocoa and
                    chocolate are frequently mentioned-in contem porary literature, and among others
                    Pope, in his <hi rend="italic">Rape of the Lock,</hi> alludes to it; the
                    negligent spirit, fixed like Ixion—</p>
                <p>“In fumes of burning chocolate shall glow, And tremble at the sea that froths
                    below.”</p>
                <p>The high price at which it was retailed kept chocolate among the luxuries of the
                    wealthy; and coffee, which had been introduced two or three years before
                    chocolate, and tea, which came a year later, both soon far out-stripped their
                    rival beverage in public estimation.</p>

                <p>Raw cocoas arc distinguished iu commerce by the name of the localities of their
                    growth; and it is found that the produce of particular regions maintains, pretty
                    constantly, a distinctive character and appearance. The most esteemed of all
                    varieties is that obtained from Venezuela, known in commerce as Carácas cocoa,
                    next to which in value stand the red “nuts” of Trinidad. The finest qualities
                    are in form and size not unlike thick round almonds; they have a husk of a clear
                    brick-red colour, and the cotyledons, which are of a deep chocolate brown, have
                    a fine membrane permeating their entire substance, and dividing them into
                    numerous irregular segments, into which the seeds are easily broken down. The
                    kernels are astringent in taste, with a mild, not disagreeable flavour. In
                    chemical composition, as well as in physical characteristics, they vary within
                    certain limits; but the analysis by Payen may be taken as representing their
                    average constitution. It is as follows :—</p>

                <p>The constituent upon which the peculiar value of cocoa depends is the
                    theobromine, an alkaloid substance which till recently was supposed to be
                    distinct from, though closely allied to, the theine of tea and coffee. It is
                    now, however, known that the alkaloid in these and in two or three ether
                    substances similarly used is identical, and their physiological value is
                    consequently the same. The fat or cocoa butter is a firm, solid, white substance
                    at ordinary temperatures, haviug an agreeable taste and odour, and very
                    remarkable for its freedom from any tendency to become rancid. It consists
                    essentially of stearin with a little olein, and is used in surgical practice,
                    and in France as a material for soap and pomade manufacture. The starch grains
                    present in raw cocoa are small in size, and of a character so peculiar that
                    there is no difficulty iu distinguishing them under the microscope from any
                    other starch granules. As an article of food cocoa differs essentially from both
                    tea and coffee. While only an infusion of these substances is used, leaving a
                    large proportion of their total weight unconsumed, the entire substance of the
                    cocoa seeds is prepared as an emulsion for drinking, and the whole is thus
                    utilized within the system. While the contents of a cup of tea or coffee can
                    thus only be regarded as stimulant in its effect, aud almost entirely destitute
                    of essential nutritive properties, a cup of prepared cocoa is really a most
                    nourishing article of diet, as, in addition to the value of the theobromine it
                    contains, it introduces into the system no inconsiderable proportion of valuable
                    nitrogenous and oleaginous elements.</p>
                <p>The manufacturing processes through which raw cocoa passes have for their object
                    the development of the aroma peculiar to the substance, aud its preparation in a
                    soluble palatable and digestible form. The first operation consists in roasting
                    the seeds, whereby the empyreumatic aromatic substance is formed, and the starch
                    particles are changed into dextrin. The roasting is accomplished in large
                    revolving cylinders, after the completion of which the roasted seeds are taken
                    to the crushing and winnowing machine. Here the seeds are reduced to the form of
                    nibs, which are separated from the shells or husks by the action of a powerful
                    fan blast. The nibs are next subjected to a process of winnowing in small
                    quantities in hand sieves, by which the hard cocoa “germs” are sifted out, and
                    mouldy or discoloured fragments are at the same t;mo removed by hand. Nibs so
                    prepared constitute the simplest and purest preparation in which manufactured
                    cocoa is sold; but they require prolonged boiling to effect their complete
                    disintegration. The nibs when ground to a fine meal can be cooked with much
                    greater facility. Another form in which the pure seeds are prepared is in
                    •flaked cocoa, which consists of the nibs ground up into a rather coarse uniform
                    paste. Tlιe grinding is effected in cylinder machines, having an outer fixed
                    casing within which a drum revolves. The nibs are fed in by a hopper on the
                    upper part of the apparatus, and are carried round its circumference by the
                    revolution of the drum, and delivered as a thin uniform pasty mass, the heat
                    developed by the friction within the cylinder being sufficient to liquefy the
                    oil, which again sets on cooling of the paste. Of late years a preparation
                    called extract of cocoa has come into extensive use. It is made by removing a
                    certain proportion of the fat from the seeds, whereby the remaining substance
                    can be ground to an impalpable powder, which yields a beverage much more
                    palatable and agreeable to many stomachs then either entire nibs or the
                    so-called soluble cocoas. The removal of the fat is effected by placing nibs,
                    after they have been reduced by grinding to a fine smooth paste, in bags, and
                    subjecting them to powerful pressure in heated presses. The fat exudes slowly
                    and quickly solidifies, and a solid compact cake is left in the press, which
                    only requires to be broken up and finely powdered for use.</p>
                <p>Most other preparations, whether sold as cocoa or chocolate, are mixtures of
                    various substances with ground nibs, the object of the mixture being to mask the
                    presence of the cocoa fat, and to render the whole readily miscible with boiling
                    water. The ordinary distinction between these soluble cocoas and chocolate is
                    that the cocoa is usually sold in the form of a powder, the chocolate being made
                    up in cakes, which require to be scraped down, boiled, and “milled” or frothed
                    before being ready for drinking. In making the soluble cocoa, which is sold
                    under such names as homoeopathic, Iceland moss, pearl cocoa, &lt;fcc., the nibs
                    are first ground up in a heated stone mill, and, while in a soft pasty
                    condition, thoroughly mixed with certain proportions of sugar and arrowroot, or
                    other and inferior starches. The compound is afterwards ground to fine powder
                    and sold under various names and at different prices, according to the quality
                    of the cocoa and the nature and proportion of the ingredients which are combined
                    with it. The finer chocolates are combinations of cocoa with sugar alone,
                    flavoured with some aromatic substanςp, generally vanilla; but into the
                    composition of cheap qualities starchy substances enter. The nibs for chocolate
                    are brought to a fine pasty state iu a heated mill, and the sugar or sugar and
                    starch with vanilla are then added aud thoroughly incorporated in the mill. The
                    paste is next passed several times between heavy horizontal rollers to produce a
                    thoroughly homogeneous mixture. It is lastly cast into moulds while still in a
                    thin pasty state, aud after cooling it forms hard solid cakes, and is ready to
                    wrap up for the market. Chocolates for eating are prepared with large
                    proportions of sugar and various flavouring substances, and the elegant
                    preparations of these aud of chocolate creams by Ménier of Paris and Fry and
                    Sons of Bristol undoubtedly form most wholesome, palatable, and nutritious
                    confections. To the last-named firm we have to express our obligation for
                    information courteously placed at our disposal.</p>
                <p>Preparations of cocoa are still much more largely consumed in Spain than in any
                    other European country. In Great Britain the consumption, partly stimulated by
                    the improvements effected in its manufacture, is steadily increasing, although

                <p>In addition to these quantities of raw cocoa, a considerable quantity of prepared
                    cocoa and chocolate is now imported from France. In 1820 the imports of
                    manufactured cocoa only amounted to 14 B⅛, but in 1874 91,466 ft&gt; were im
                    ported. An import duty of Id. per lb on raw and 2d. per tt&gt; on manufactured
                    cocoa is levied in Great Britain.</p>
