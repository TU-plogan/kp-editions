                    Cusanus</hi></label>] cardinal fl401-1464), was the son of a poor fisherman
                    named Krypffs or Krebs, and derived the name by which he is known from the place
                    of his birth, Cues or Cusa, on the Moselle, in the archbishopric of Treves. In
                    his youth he was employed in the service of Count Ulrich of Manderscheid, who,
                    seeing in him evidence of exceptional ability, sent him to study at the school
                    of the Brothers of the Common Life at Deventer, and afterwards at the university
                    of Padua, where he took his doctor’s degree in law in his twenty-third year.
                    Failing in his first cause he abandoned the legal profession, and resolved to
                    enter the church. After filling several subordinate offices he became archdeacon
                    of Liège. He was a member of the Council of Basel, and dedicated to the
                    assembled fathers a work entitled <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Concordantia Catholica,</hi> in which he maintained the superiority of councils
                    over popes, and assailed the false decretals and the story of the donation of
                    Constantine. A few years later, however, he had reversed his position, and
                    zealously defended the supremacy of the Pope. He was intrusted with various
                    missions in the interests of Catholic unity, the most important being to
                    Constantinople, to endeavour to bring about a union of the Eastern and Western
                    churches. In 1448 he was raised by Pope Nicolas V. to the dignity of cardinal;
                    and in 1450 he was appointed bishop of Brixen against the wish of the Archduke
                    Sigismund, who opposed the reforms the new bishop sought to introduce into the
                    diocese. In 1451 he was sent to Germany and the Netherlands to check
                    ecclesiastical abuses and bring back the monastic life to the original rule of
                    poverty, chastity, and obedience,—a mission which be discharged with
                    well-tempered firmness. Soon afterwards his dispute with the Archduke Sigismund
                    in his own diocese was brought to a point by his claiming certain dues of the
                    bishopric, which the temporal prince had appropriated. Upon this the bishop was
                    imprisoned by the archduke, who, in his turn, was excommunicated by the Pope.
                    These extreme measures were not persisted in; but the dispute remained unsettled
                    at the time of the bishop’s death, which occurred at Lodi in Umbria on the 11th
                    August 1464. In 1459 be had acted as governor of Rome during the absence of his
                    friend Pope Pius II. at the assembly of princes at Milan; and he wrote his <hi
                    rend="italic">Crébratio Alcorani,</hi> a treatise against Mahometanism, in
                    support of the expedition against the Turks proposed at that assembly. Some time
                    before his death he had founded a hospital in his native place for thirty-three
                    poor persons, the number being that of the years of the earthly life of Christ.
                    To this institution he left his valuable library.</p>
                <p>The interest of Cusa for later times lies in his philosophical much more than in
                    his political or ecclesiastical activity. As in religion he is entitled to be
                    called one of the “Reformers before the Reformation,” so in philosophy he was
                    one of those who broke with scholasticism while it was still the orthodox
                    system. In his principal work, <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">docta
                    ignorantia</hi> (1440), supplemented by <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Conjecturis libri</hi><hi rend="italic">duo</hi> published in the
                    same year, he maintains that all human knowſledge is mere conjecture, and that
                    man’s wisdom is to recognize his ignorance. From scepticism he escapes by
                    accepting the doctrine of the mystics that God can be apprehended by intuition
                    <hi rend="italic">(intuitio,</hi><hi rend="italic">speculatio),</hi> an exalted
                    state of the intellect in which all limitations disappear.</p>

                <p>God is the absolute maximum and also the absolute minimum, who can be neither
                    greater nor less than He is, and who comprehends all that is or that can be
                    (“deum c∙sse omnia, ut non possit esse aliud quam est ”). Cusa thus laid himself
                    open to the charge of pantheism, which did not fail to be brought against him in
                    his own day. His chief philosophical doctrine was taken up and developed more
                    than a hundred years later by Giordano Bruno, who calls him the divine Cusanus.
                    In mathematical and physical science Cusa was much in advance of his age. In a
                    tract, <hi rend="italic">Reparatio Calendarii,</hi> presented to the Council of
                    Basel, he proposed the reform of the calendar after a method resembling that
                    adopted by Gregory. If he was not before his own age he was not behind many in
                    the present day in a treatise <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Quadratura Circuli,</hi> in which he professes to have solved the problem; and
                    the same remark applies to a prophecy that the world would come to an end in
                    1734, which he hazarded in his <hi rend="italic">Conjectura,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">novissimis diebus.</hi> Most noteworthy,
                    however, in this connection is the fact that he anticipated Copernicus by
                    maintaining the theory of the rotation of the earth.</p>
                <p>The works of Cusanus were published in a complete form by Henri Petri (1 vol.
