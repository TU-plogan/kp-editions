                    Charles</hi></label> (1795- 1868), French Protestant divine, president of the
                    Presbyterian Council of Paris, was born in that city, August 27, 1795. He
                    received his early education from his aunt, Helen Maria Williams, an
                    Englishwoman, who at the close of the 18th century made herself a reputation by
                    various translations and by her <hi rend="italic">Letters from. France.</hi> He
                    completed his theological studies at the Protestant faculty of Montauban, and in
                    1816 was ordained pastor. During the following twelve years he resided in
                    Holland, and preached with acceptance before Calvinistic congregations at
                    Amsterdam, Leyden, and Utrecht. In 1830, at the suggestion of Cuvier, who then
                    filled the office of minister of Protestant worship, Coquerel was called to
                    Paris; and there he spent the rest of his life. Ardently attached to liberal
                    ideas, he was not content with advocating them from the pulpit, but resolved to
                    speak also through the press. In the first year of his Paris life he therefore
                    established a periodical entitled <hi rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Protestant,</hi> which was continued till December 1833. In the course of this
                    year he was chosen a member of the consistory. In January 1834 appeared the
                    first number of the <hi rend="italic">Libre</hi><hi rend="italic">Examen,</hi>
                    under the jointeditorship of Coquerel and Artaud, which was carried on till July
                    1836. Coquerel rapidly acquired the reputation of a great pulpit orator, and the
                    liberal views which he announced with fearless freedom brought him more and more
                    into antagonism with the rigid Calvinists. He took a warm interest in all
                    matters of education, and distinguished himself so much by his defence of the
                    university of Paris against a sharp attack, that in 1835 he was chosen a member
                    of the Legion of Honour. Pained by the doctrinaldivergencieswhich separated the
                    Protestants of France, and longing to bring about a real union, he originated,
                    in 1841, a periodical entitled <hi rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Lien,</hi> of which such union was the avowed object. The same year appeared
                    his <hi rend="italic">Réponse</hi> to the <hi rend="italic">Leben Jesu</hi> of
                    Strauss. After the revolution of February 1848, Coquerel was elected a member of
                    the National Assembly, where he sat as a moderate republican, subsequently
                    becoming a member of the Legislative Assembly. He supported the first ministry
                    of Louis Napoleon, and gave his vote in favour of the expedition to Rome and the
                    restoration of the temporal power of the Pope. After the <hi rend="italic">coup
                    d'etat</hi> of December 2, 1851, he confined himself to the duties of his
                    pastorate, which he had not ceased to discharge. He was one of the most prolific
                    of French sermon-writers, as well as one of the most famous orators of his day,
                    and retained his popularity to the last. He died at Paris, January 10, 1868.</p>
                <p>A large collection of his sermons was published in 8 vols, between 1819 and 1852.
                    And in addition to the works already named, he was author of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Biographic</hi><hi rend="italic">sacrée</hi> (1825-1826); <hi rend="italic"
                    >Histoire sainte et analyse de la Bible</hi> (1839); <hi rend="italic"
                    >Orthodoxie moderne</hi> (1842); <hi rend="italic">Christo</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >logie</hi> (1858), &amp;c. These works have had a large circulation, and most
                    of them have been translated into English, German, and Dutch.</p>
