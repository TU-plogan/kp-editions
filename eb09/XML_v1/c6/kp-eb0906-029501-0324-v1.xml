                    (1774-1827), the well-known Edinburgh publisher, was born in the parish of
                    Carnbee, Fifeshire, on the 24th February 1774. Having been educated at the
                    parish school, he was, at his own request, apprenticed to a bookseller in
                    Edinburgh, named Peter Hill. From the first he took a great interest in books;
                    and he obtained permission from his master to attend book sales, and purchase
                    rare works, of which he drew up carefully executed catalogues. When not yet
                    twenty-one years of. age he had married and commenced business on his own
                    account. He took special interest in Scottish literature; the rare works in that
                    department which he offered for sale soon brought him into notice, and from this
                    and from his genial disposition and his unprecedented liberality towards
                    authors, his business grew rapidly. In 1801 he became proprietor of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Farmers' Magazine</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Scots'
                    Magazine,</hi> and on the 10th October 1802 he published the first number of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review.</hi> Constable was for many years on the
                    most intimate and friendly relations with Sir Walter Scott. In January 1802 he
                    had a share in the publication of the <hi rend="italic">Minstrelsy of the
                    Scottish Border,</hi> and afterwards published a large proportion of Scott’s
                    poems and novels. Besides these, he published the <hi rend="italic">Annual
                    Register,</hi> and the works of Dugald Stewart, Brown, Playfair, and Leslie. In
                    1812 he purchased the copyright of the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopa-dia
                    Britannica,</hi> to which he added the supplement to the 4th, 5th, and 6th
                    editions (1815-1824), extending to six volumes, and containing the celebrated
                    dissertations by Stewart, Playfair, and Brande. Not the least important of his
                    undertakings was <hi rend="italic">Constable’s Miscellany,</hi> projected in
                    1825, consisting of a series of original works, and standard works republished
                    in a cheap form, the earliest and one of the most famous of the attempts to
                    popularize wholesome literature. In 1826 pecuniary difficulties in which the
                    firm of Constable and Co. became involved (its liabilities exceeding £250,000)
                    obliged it to stop payment. From this time Constable’s health gave way, and he
                    died on 2lst July 1827, having, by his generous dealings with authors, his
                    literary enthusiasm, and his efforts to promote the diffusion of standard
                    literature, gained for himself one of the most distinguished names among British
                    publishers.</p>
