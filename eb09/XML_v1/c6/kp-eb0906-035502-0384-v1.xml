                <p><label type="entry">COPYHOLD</label>, in English law, is an ancient form of land
                    tenure, legally defined as a “holding at the will of the lord according to the
                    custom of the manor.” Its origin is to be found in the occupation by villani, or
                    non-freemen, of portions of land belonging to the manor of a feudal lord. In the
                    time of the Domesday survey the manor was in part granted to free tenants, in
                    part reserved by the lord himself for his own uses. The estate of the free
                    tenants is the freehold estate of English law; as tenants of the same manor they
                    assembled together in manorial court or court baron, of which they were the
                    judges. The portion of the manor reserved for the lord (the <hi rend="italic"
                    >demesne,</hi> or domain) was cultivated by labourers who were bound to the land
                    <hi rend="italic">(adscripti glebae).</hi> They could not leave the manor, and
                    their service was obligatory. These villani, however, were allowed by the lord
                    to cultivate portions of land for their own use. It was a mere occupation at the
                    pleasure of the lord, but in course of time it grew into an occupation by right,
                    recognized first of all by custom, and afterwards by law. This kind of tenure is
                    called by the lawyers <hi rend="italic">villenagium,</hi> and it probably marks
                    a great advance in the general recognition of the right when the name is applied
                    to lands held on the same conditions not by villeins but by free men. The
                    tenants in villenage were not, like the freeholders, members of the court baron,
                    but they appear to have attended in a humbler capacity, and to have solicited
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n385/mode/1up"

                    father, or the admission of a new tenant who had purchased the good-will, as it
                    might be called, of the holding, paying for such favours certain customary fines
                    or dues. In relation to the tenants in villenage, the court baron was called the
                    customary court. The records of the court constituted the title of the villein
                    tenant, held by copy of the court roll; and the customs of the manor therein
                    recorded formed the real property law applicable to his case. Each manor might
                    have peculiar customs of its own, and as a matter of fact there has been a great
                    variety in the conditions under which copyhold lands are held.</p>
                <p>Copyhold had long been established in practice before it was formally recognized
                    by the law. At first it was in fact, as it is now in the fictitious theory of
                    the law, a tenancy at will, for which none of the legal remedies of a freeholder
                    were available. In the reign of Edward IV., however, it was held that a tenant
                    in villenage had an action of trespass against the lord. In this way a species
                    of tenant-right, depending on and strongly supported by popular opinion, was
                    changed into a legal right. The nature of the change is vigorously described by
                    Sir Edward Coke, “As I conjecture in Saxon’s, sure I am in the Norman’s time the
                    copyholders were so far subject to the lord’s will, that the lords upon the
                    least occasion (sometimes without any colour of reason, only upon discontentment
                    and malice, sometimes again upon sudden fantastic humour, only to make evident
                    to the world the height of their power and authority) would expel out of house
                    and home their poor copyholders, leaving them helpless and remediless by any
                    course of law, and driving them to one by way of petition; but now copyholders
                    stand upon a sure ground; now they weigh not their lord’s displeasure and shake
                    at every blast of wind; they eat, drink, sleep securely; only having a special
                    care of the main chance, to perform exactly what duties and services soever
                    their term doth require: then let lord frown, the copyholder cares not, knowing
                    himself safe and not within any danger.”</p>
                <p>While copyhold was thus converted into a legal estate of the same security as any
                    other, it retained and does still retain many incidents characteristic of its
                    historical origin. The life of copyhold assurance, it is said, is custom.
                    Copyhold is necessarily parcel of a manor, and the freehold is said to be in the
                    lord of the manor. The court roll of the manor is the evidence of title and the
                    record of the special laws as to fines, quit rents, heriots, &amp;c., prevailing
                    in the manor. When copyhold land is conveyed from one person to another, it is
                    surrendered by the owner to the lord, who by his payment of the customary fine
                    makes a new grant of it to the purchaser. The lord must admit the vendor’s
                    nominee, but the form of the conveyance is still that of surrender and re-grant.
                    The lord, as legal owner of the fee-simple of the lands, has a right to all the
                    mines and minerals and to all the growing timber, although the tenant may have
                    planted it himself. Hence it appears that the existence of copyhold tenures may
                    be traced in some parts of the country by the total absence of timber from such
                    lands, while on freehold lands it grows in abundance. Hence also the popular
                    saying that the “oak grows not except on free land.” The copyholder must not
                    commit waste either by cutting down timber, &amp;c., or by neglecting to repair
                    buildings. In such respects the law treats him as a mere lessee,—the real owner
                    being supposed to be the lord. On the other hand, the lord may not enter the
                    land to cut his own timber or open his mines. The limitations of estates usual
                    in respect of other lands, as found in copypold, become subject of course to the
                    operations of its peculiar conditions as to the relation of lord and tenant. An
                    estate for life, or <hi rend="italic">pour autre vie</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(i.e.,</hi> for another’s life), an estate entail, or in fee-simple, may be
                    carved out of copyhold.</p>
                <p>A species of tenure resembling copyhold prevails in some parts of the country
                    under the name of <hi rend="italic">customary freehold.</hi> The land is held by
                    copy of court-roll, but not by will of the lord. The question has been raised
                    whether the freehold of such lands is in the lord of the manor or in the tenant,
                    and the courts of law have decided in favour of the former. In some instances
                    copyhold for lives alone is recognized, and in such cases the lord of the manor
                    may ultimately, when all the lives have dropped, get back the land into his own
                    hands.</p>
                <p>The feudal obligations attaching to copyhold tenure have been found to cause much
                    inconvenience to the tenants, while they are of no great value to the lord. One
                    of the most vexatious of these is the <hi rend="italic">heriot,</hi> under which
                    name the lord is entitled to seize the tenant’s best beast or other chattel in
                    the event of the tenant’s death. The custom dates from the time when all the
                    copyholder’s property, including the copyholder himself, belonged to the lord,
                    and is supposed to have been fixed by way of analogy to the custom which gave a
                    military tenant’s habiliments to his lord in order to equip his successor.
                    Instances have occurred in quite recent times of articles of great value being
                    seized as heriots for the copyhold tenements of their owners. A race horse worth
                    £2000 or £3000 was thus seized. The fine payable on the admission of a new
                    tenant, whether by alienation or succession, is to a certain extent arbitrary,
                    but the courts long ago laid down the rule that it must be reasonable, and
                    anything beyond two years’ improved value of the lands they disallowed. The
                    inconvenience caused by these feudal incidents of the tenure has led to a series
                    of statutes, having for their object the conversion of copyhold into
                    freehold.</p>
                <p>In 1841 an Act was passed for the commutation of manorial rights in respect of
                    lands of copyhold and customary tenure, and in respect of other lands subject to
                    such rights, and for facilitating the enfranchisement of such land and the
                    improvement of such tenure.</p>
