                    (1731-1800), the best of English letier-writers and the most distinguished poet
                    of his day, was born on the 26th of November 1731, at Great Berkhamstead,
                    Hertfordshire. His father, who held the living of the parish, was chaplain to
                    George II. He married Ann, daughter of Roger Donne, of Ludham Hall in Norfolk.
                    This lady, after giving birth to several children who died in infancy, expired
                    in childbed in 1737, leaving two sons—William (the poet) and John. Cowper, who
                    retained the most affectionate remembrance of his mother, embalmed her memory in
                    one of the most affecting tributes that ever came from the heart of a son.</p>
                <p>At the age of six years Cowper was placed at Dr Pitman’s school, in Market
                    Street, Bedfordshire. His health was delicate, and he was in consequence exposed
                    to the laughter and ridicule of his rude companions. One boy seems especially to
                    have been the object of his terror. “His savage treatment of me,” he says,
                    “impressed such a dread of his figure on my mind, that I well remember being
                    afraid to lift my eyes upon him higher than his knees, and that I knew him
                    better by his shoe-buckle than by any other part of his dress.” The cruelty of
                    this bey’s conduct was such that on its being discovered he was expelled the
                    school, and Cowper was removed. The mental anguish he endured at this time
                    aggravated, no doubt, the constitutional tendency to despondency which throws
                    such a peculiar interest over much of his after-life. At the period of his
                    removal from Dr Pitman’s school he was afflicted with inflammation in the eyes;
                    specks appeared in both of them, and it was feared that blindness would ensue.
                    He was in consequence placed at the house of an eminent oculist, where he
                    remained two years, deriving little benefit from his residence there, his cure
                    being slow and imperfect.</p>
                <p>At ten years of age Cowper was placed at Westminster School. In after-life he
                    lamented that his learning at this time consisted entirely of Latin and Greek,
                    to the exclusion of the more important matter of religion. Surrounded by
                    strangers, ⅛nd unable from his unconquerable shyness to mingle with them on easy
                    terms, his fits of depression grew darker and more frequent; and those unhappy
                    views of his spiritual condition, which afterwards produced such deplorable
                    results, began to oppress his mind. In his memoir he relates some of his
                    religious experiences. Crossing St Margaret’s churchyard late in the evening,
                    his curiosity was excited by a glimmering light, and he went to see whence it
                    proceeded. A gravedigger was at work with a lantern; and just as Cowper came to
                    the spot a skull was thrown up which struck him on the leg. This circumstance
                    gave an alarm to his conscience, and he afterwards considered it one of the most
                    valuable religious impressions he received at Westminster. His mental excitement
                    was followed by the notion that he was exempted from the penalty of death, which
                    in its turn was displaced by lowness of spirits and intimations of a consumptive
                    tendency. At thirteen he was seized with smallpox, which completely restored his
                    eyesight. Although threatened by consumption he seems to have excelled at
                    cricket and football, and to have distinguished himself in his studies. It is
                    curious to know that Warren Hastings, Churchill, Lloyd, and Colman were his
                    fellow-students in Westminster.</p>
                <p>Cowper was taken from Westminster at eighteen years of age; and, after spending a
                    few months at home, was articled to Mr Chapman, an attorney in London. He seems
                    to have most poetically disliked his new position and duties. Thurlow,
                    afterwards lord chancellor, was engaged in the same office; and Cowper describes
                    their leisure as being spent in “giggling and making giggle, instead of studying
                    the law.” The following is related of his intimacy with Thurlow a few years
                    later. One evening, in tho presence of ladies, Cowper playfully said, “Thurlow,
                    I am nobody, and shall always be nobody, and you will be chancellor, You shall
                    provide for me when you are.” Thurlow replied with a smile, “I surely will.”
                    “These ladies,” rejoined Cowper, “are our witnesses.” “Let them be so,” answered
                    the future chancellor, still smiling, “for I will certainly do it.” After
                    completing his three years’ articles with Mr Chapman, he removed to the Middle
                    Temple in 1752. The solitariness of his life at this time was productive of the
                    most pernicious results. In his melancholy memoir he describes the dejection and
                    unrest, the horror and despair, he underwent during these miserable months. At
                    length relief came. Sitting with a few friends by the sea near Southampton, the
                    cloud of misery which had overshadowed his spirit so long rolled away, and so
                    happy did he feel that he could have wept for transport had he been alone.
                    Returning to London, and actuated by what he afterwards considered the
                    instigation of Satan, he burned his prayers, and plunged into pleasure and <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0565-0534"/> gaiety. Tn 1754 he was called to the bar, but,
                    instead of following his profession, he seems to have yielded himself up to the
                    charms of literature and social intercourse. About this time his father died,
                    leaving him a small patrimony. In 1759 he removed to the Inner Temple, where law
                    was still deserted for literature. He devoted much of his time to the study of
                    Homer, and, in conjunction with his brother, translated some of the books of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Henrτade.</hi> This appears to have been the gayest part of
                    Cowper’s life. He had formed literary acquaintances amongst whom were many of
                    his old schoolfellows; he became a member of the Nonsense Club, and occasionally
                    contributed prose and verse to the periodicals of the day.</p>
                <p>While in Mr Chapman’s office, Cowper was a frequent visitor at the house of his
                    uncle, Mr Ashley Cowper, in Southampton Row,—the attraction being his fair
                    cousin. Miss Theodora Jane Cowper was the younger of two daughters (the elder of
                    whom, afterwards Lady Hesketh, is well known as the poet’s constant
                    correspondent for many years), and by her brilliant beauty and fascinating
                    manners won the heart of her shy relative. Excited by her presence and sparkling
                    spirits, Cowper became cheerful and even gay, his bashfulness began to wear off;
                    he mixed in company, and occasionally attempted to shine in conversation. He
                    became fastidious in his attire, a critic in ruffles, a haunter of
                    looking-glasses. Seeing how matters were tending, Mr Cowper opposed their
                    contemplated union on prudential considerations. His daughter pooh-poohed his
                    fears. He asked what she would do if she married her cousin <hi rend="italic"
                    >1</hi> “Do, sir,” answered the high-spirited girl,</p>
                <p>“Wash all day, and ride out on the great dog at night.” Mr Cowper afterwards
                    changed his position, and objected to their marriage on the score of nearness of
                    connection. The lovers pled, but he was inexorable. Miss Cowper thought it her
                    duty to obey her father. They parted and never met again.</p>
                <p>During this courtship, Cowper addressed several poems to his cousin, which
                    exhibit all the gentleness and tenderness of his nature. They are unlike the
                    love-poems of every other poet. They have no fervour, no emotion, no fire.
                    Perhaps Cowper’s nature was incapable of strong and devouring passion. The
                    memory of his love and his disappointment seems to have been soon and painlessly
                    effaced. With the lady it was different; she could not so easily forget. The
                    little poems which, in his brief dream of passion, he had addressed to her, she
                    carefully treasured up. Unknown to him, her hand was unwearied in its kind and
                    delicate attentions. She never forgot him, and although surviving his death many
                    years, died unmarried.</p>
                <p>Cowper’s pecuniary resources being at this time slender, he became naturally
                    anxious to obtain suitable employment. An influential kinsman presented him with
                    the lucrative office of clerk to the committees of the House of Lords. Some
                    difficulty, however, being raised as to his relative’s right of appointment, an
                    examination at the bar of the House was demanded to test Cowper’s fitness for
                    the performance of his duties. Although the prospect of such a public appearance
                    must have been exceedingly painful to him, he resolved to prepare for the
                    ordeal. He attended regularly at the office, and thus describes the result :—
                    “The journal books were thrown open to me—a thing which could not be refused,
                    and from which, perhaps, a man in health and with a head turned to business
                    might have gained all the information he wanted; but it was not so with me; I
                    read without perception, and was so distressed that had every clerk in the
                    office been my friend it could have availed me little, for I was not in a
                    condition to receive instruction, much less to elicit it out of manuscripts
                    without direction.” The dreadful trial that awaited him filled his days, and re
                    appeared in dreams. He found no rest. At a tavern he met some miserable men, and
                    suicide became the subject of conversation. The idea was new to him, and held
                    him with a horrid fascination from which he could not escape. He was pursued and
                    goaded by imaginary voices, until at last in a paroxysm of madness he attempted
                    self-destruction. The garter by which he was suspended broke, and he fell
                    heavily to the ground. His laundress hearing the fall, and thinking him in a
                    fit, ran to his assistance; but by the time she reached him he had crept into
                    bed. His mind now became a prey to the keenest remorse. The wrath of God seemed
                    hanging over him on account of his sin. In these circumstances, every thought of
                    his official employment was, of course, abandoned; measures were adopted for his
                    security, and in 1763 he was placed under the care of Dr Cotton of St
                    Albans.</p>
                <p>After remaining two years at St Albans he removed to Huntingdon. Here he first
                    met the Unwins, and so charmed was be with their society, that in a short time
                    he became the inmate of their home. On the death of Mr Unwin in 1767 the family
                    removed to Olney; and on the recommendation of Mr Newton, the curate of the
                    parish, Cowper accompanied them. About this time his brother died; and in the
                    winter of 1773 his malady returned. Through his long illness he was attended by
                    Mrs Unwin with the most affectionate care. To beguile tho tedium of recovery, he
                    occupied himself with carpentry and gardening, and in domesticating his famous
                    hares. Up till this time he had only written a few hymns; he now, at Mrs Unwin’s
                    suggestion, commenced a poem on the <hi rend="italic">Progress of Error,</hi>
                    Composition, once begun, was so ardently prosecuted that in a few months his
                    first volume, consisting, with the poem already mentioned, of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Table Talk, Conversation, Truth, Expostulation, Hope, Charity,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Retirement,</hi> was ready for the press. It attracted little
                    attention. One critic declared that “Mr Cowper was certainly a good pious man,
                    but without one spark of poetic fire.” In 1781 he met Lady Austen, and the
                    casual acquaintance soon ripened into the warmest intimacy. Her lively spirits
                    chased from his mind the demon of melancholy. He wrote songs which she set to
                    music and sang to the harpsichord. It is said that observing him one evening in
                    a fit of depression, she related the story of John Gilpin, with which he was so
                    delighted that after retiring to rest he turned it into verse, and repeated it
                    with great glee when they met next morning at the breakfast-table. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Task,</hi> undertaken at the suggestion of his new friend, was
                    begun in the winter of 1783 and published in 1785. Its success was complete, and
                    his reputation was at once established. Never, perhaps, in England had poetry
                    been at so low an ebb as at this time. The brilliant point and antithesis of
                    Pope had degenerated into the inflated diction of Darwin and the feeble
                    sentimentalities of Hayley. Cowper’s hearty and natural verse extinguished these
                    weaklings for ever. Although Cowper cannot be placed in the first rank of
                    English poets, yet few are attended with such retinues of love and blessing. His
                    verse is a transparent medium through which you look into a gentle and most
                    lovable human spirit, and you come to know him as thoroughly as if you had lived
                    in the same house with him for years. His muse does not sit apart in sublime
                    seclusion—she comes down into the ways of men, mingles in their everyday
                    concerns, and is interested in crops and rural affairs. You see by the slight
                    tan on her cheek that she has been much in the harvest-fields. Cowper rather
                    talks than sings. His blank verse makes no pretensions to majesty; it is
                    colloquial sometimes in its bareness, yet in its artless flow is ever delightful
                    as the conversation of a beloved and gifted companion.</p>
                <p>Cowper brought back nature to poetry, and his influence <pb break="no"

                    certain extent, the prototype of Wordsworth. Indeed, many passages in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Excursion</hi> read like extracts from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Task.</hi> It is curious also to observe in Cowper’s verse that subjectivity
                    which is supposed to be the characteristic of more recent times. His ailings,
                    his walks, his musings, his tamed hares, his friends, his indignation at
                    slavery, his peculiar views of religion, are the things he delights to
                    portray—the <hi rend="italic">Task</hi> is a poem entirely about himself.</p>
                <p>On Lady Austen leaving Olney, her place was filled by the Throgmortons, whose
                    acquaintance Cowper had made on the occasion of a <hi rend="italic">fête</hi>
                    which they gave to the surrounding gentry. He was delighted with his new friends
                    and spent much time in their society. During this period he was not idle; he had
                    commenced his translation of Homer, and in the winter of 1785 had advanced as
                    far as the 20th book of the <hi rend="italic">Iliad.</hi> Owing to the rigorous
                    care he bestowed upon his work it did not advance so rapidly as he at first
                    anticipated, and was not published till 1791. Cowper was now in the zenith of
                    his reputation, Rumours of his fame were wafted to the quiet residence of Olney
                    from that world which he had so long forsaken, he was hailed the first poet of
                    the day, and his old friend Thurlow (whose greatness he had foreseen) opened a
                    correspondence with him and thanked him for his translation, To the mild spirit
                    of Cowper the last circumstance must have been peculiarly grateful. While
                    engaged upon Homer, his dreaded malady returned, but was happily driven away by
                    the charms of society and constant literary occupation. He well knew that if he
                    remained inactive the dark spirit would regain his throne; and no sooner was
                    Homer given to the world than we find him engaged on an edition of Milton. But
                    the labour was too much; his brain sunk beneath the incessant demands made on
                    its energies, and so great was his distress that he was obliged to relinquish
                    the undertaking. The clouds were now closing dark and heavy over the evening of
                    Cowper’s life. Mrs Unwin was an invalid; he was ever by her bedside, and nursed
                    her with a tenderness, if possible, deeper than her own. Beneath the tension of
                    sorrow the cord snapped. His malady returned, which was never destined in this
                    life to be rolled away. Mrs Unwin died on the 17th of December 1796. Cowper,
                    with wandering brain and feeble as a child, was led into the room; the presence
                    of the dead drew from him one wild passionate exclamation, he then relapsed into
                    silence, and it is said never more uttered her name. The deepest dejection,
                    alternating with fits of spiritual despair, hung over him to the end. Dropsy
                    appeared in his limbs; and after being reduced to the last stage of feebleness,
                    he died peacefully on the 25th of April 1800. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.
