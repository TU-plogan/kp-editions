                <p><label type="entry">CYRIL</label>,, of Alexandria (376-444), is a more
                    distinguished father of the church than his namesake of Jerusalem. He was born
                    in 376, and died in 4¾4. Becoming patriarch of Alexandria about 412, he soon
                    made himself known by the violence of his zeal against Jews, pagans, and
                    heretics or supposed heretics alike. He had hardly entered upon his office when
                    he closed all the churches of the Novatians and seized their ecclesiastical
                    effects. He assailed the Jewish synagogues with an armed force, drove the Jews
                    in thousands from the city, and exposed their houses and property to pillage.
                    The prefect of Egypt, Orestes, who endeavoured to withstand his furious zeal,
                    was in turn denounced himself, and had difficulty in maintaining his ground
                    against the fury of the Christian multitude. It was during one of the violent
                    commotions kindled by the strifes of these parties in Alexandria that the
                    illustrious Hypatia, famed for her beauty and her eloquent advocacy of the
                    Neo-Flatonic philosophy in opposition to Christianity, was murdered. Her murder
                    has been attributed to the direct instigation of the patriarch himself; but this
                    charge is held unsupported by others, although there can be no doubt that “the
                    perpetrators were officers of his church,” and undoubtedly drew encouragement
                    from his ow n violent proceedings. Hypatia was a friend of Orestes, and the
                    hostility betwixt the prefect and the patriarch overflowed towards her, and
                    undoubtedly led to her destruction.</p>
                <p>But Cyril’s violence was not merely confined to those who might be considered
                    enemies of the church. He inherited from Theophilus, his uncle and predecessor
                    in the see of Alexandria, a strong aversion to John Chrysostom, the noble bishop
                    of Constantinople, and even after his death opposed for a time all attempts to
                    remove the unjust sentence of condemnation which had been passed upon him.
                    Afterwards he so far yielded to remonstrances, and allowed the name of
                    Chrysostom to appear in the list of distinguished martyrs and bishops mentioned
                    in the prayers of his church. These names were inserted in what were called
                    “diptychs” (διτrτυχα v∈κpωv), or two-leaved tablets preserved in the churches—a
                    usage which the Greek Church has preserved to this day. Nestorius, a succesor of
                    Chrysostom in the see of Constantinople, received a still larger share of
                    Cyril’s <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n787/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0787-0752"/> intemperate opposition. Nestorius had refused to
                    apply the title “Mother of God” to the Blessed Virgin. The patriarch of
                    Alexandria denounced this heresy to Nestorius himself, to the emperor (the
                    feeble Theodosius IL), and to the empresses, the mother and sister of
                    Theodosius. The altercation grew in bitterness as it advanced, until at length
                    Nestorius was excommunicated and driven from his see in 430. The two opponents
                    met at the oecumenical council summoned at Ephesus in the following year to
                    dispose of the intricate question raised by the use of the terminology in
                    dispute. Each came “accompanied by a rabble of followers—Cyril by the bath men
                    and a multitude of women from Egypt, Nestorius by a horde of peasants and some
                    of the lower populace of Constantinople” (Milman’s <hi rend="italic">Latin
                    Christ.,</hi> i. 160). The result was the condemnation of Nestorius, although
                    Cyril also incurred the charge of heresy from the Oriental bishops. Satisfied,
                    however, with the deprivation and exile of his opponent, he returned to
                    Alexandria in triumph as the great champion of the faith, and thence continued,
                    by the “unscrupulous use of all the means at his command,” the theological
                    strife for years.</p>
                <p>Altogether Cyril presents a character not only unamiable, but singularly
                    deficient in all the graces of the Christian life. He may, as Milman says <hi
                    rend="italic">(Latin Christ.,</hi> i. 145), be a hero or even a saint to those
                    “who esteem the stern and uncompromising assertion of certain tenets the one
                    paramount Christian virtue; but, while ambition, intrigue, arrogance, rapacity,
                    and violence are proscribed as unchristian means—barbarity, persecution,
                    bloodshed, as unholy and unevangelic wickednesses, posterity will condemn the
                    orthodox Cyril as one of the worst of heretics against the spirit of the
                    Gospel.” Baur, however, says that Cyril must be placed high as a theologi in,
                    and that he sought upon the whole to preserve faithfully the spirit of the
                    Alexandrian school. He has left, besides commentaries, and homilies and letters
                    chiefly relating to the Nestorian controversy, a treatise on the Trinity and the
                    Incarnation, and an apologetic work in defence of Christianity against the
                    attack of the Emperor Julian, also a definite treatise against Nestorius — Kατα
