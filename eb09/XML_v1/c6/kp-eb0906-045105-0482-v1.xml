                <p><label type="entry">COSTS</label>. When a person brings an action in law against
                    another and succeeds, it is only fair that the defendant, besides paying the sum
                    which he ought to have paid, should also recoup the expenses incurred by the
                    plaintiff in prosecuting a rightful claim. On the other hand, when the action
                    fails, the defendant is justly entitled to be repaid the expenses he has
                    incurred in defending a wrongful claim. That costs should follow the event may
                    therefore be taken as the first principle of the law relating to this subject;
                    but there are many special circumstances which interfere to modify its
                    application. The action, though successful, may be in its nature frivolous or
                    vexatious, or it may have been brought into a higher court where a lower court
                    would have been competent to deal with it; and on the other hand the defendant,
                    although he has escaped a judgment against him, may by his conduct have rendered
                    the action necessary, or otherwise justifiable. In such cases the rule that
                    costs should follow the event would be felt to work an injustice, and exceptions
                    to its operation have therefore to be devised. The law of England as to costs,
                    simple as the subject may appear, is in reality highly complicated, <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n483/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0483-0452"/> At common law, costs were not given either to
                    plaintiff or defendant, although the damages given to a successful plaintiff
                    would include the expense he had been put to in taking proceedings. The
                    defendant in a wrongful action could not even recover his costs thus indirectly,
                    and the indirect costs given to a plaintiff under the name of damages were often
                    inadequate and uncertain. Costs were first given under the Statute of Gloucester
                    (6 Edward I. cl), wſhich enacts that “the demandant shall recover damages in an
                    assize of novel disseisin and in writs of mort d’ancestor, cosinage, aiel, ana
                    beziel, and further that the demandant may recover against the tenant the <hi
                    rend="italic">costs</hi> of his writ purchased together with the damages above
                    said. And t his Act shall hold in all cases when the party is to recover •
                    lamages.” The words <hi rend="superscript"> κ</hi> costs of his writ ’’ were
                    extended t &gt; mean all the legal costs in the suit. The clause gives costs,
                    wherever damages are recovered, and no matter what the amount of the damages may
                    be. Costs were first given to a defendant by the Statute of Marlebridge in a
                    case relating to wardship in chivalry (52 Henry III. c. 6); but costs were not
                    given generally to successful defendants until the 23 Henry VIII. c. 15, which
                    provides that “ii in the actions therein mentioned the plaintiff after
                    appearance of the defendant be nonsuited, or any verdict happen to pass by
                    lawful trial against the plaintiff, the defendant shall have judgment to recover
                    his costs against the plaintiff, to be assessed and taxed at the discretion of
                    the court, and shall have such process and execution for the recovery and paying
                    his costs against the plaintiff, as the plaintiff should or might have had
                    against the defendant, in case the judgment had been given for the plaintiff.”
                    By the 4 James I. c. 3, this “good and profitable law” was extended to other
                    actions not originally specified, although within the mischief of the Act, so
                    that in any action wherein the plaintiff might have costs if judgment were given
                    for him, the defendant if successful should have costs against the plaintiff.
                    The policy of these enactments is expressed to be the discouragement of
                    frivolous and unjust suits. This policy was carried out by other and later Acts.
                    The 21 James I. c. 16 § 6 (the statute for the limitation of actions) orders
                    that if the plaintiff in an action of slander recover less than 40s. damages,
                    the plaintiff shall be allowed no more as costs than he gets os damages. By the
                    43 Elizabeth c. 6 it had been enacted that in any personal action not being for
                    any title or interest in land, nor concerning the freehold or inheritance of
                    lands nor for battery, where the damages shall not amount to 40s. no more costs
                    than damages shall be allowed. By 3 and 4 Vict. c. 24 (Lord Denman’s Act), where
                    the plaintiff in an action of tort recovers less than 40s., he shall not be
                    allowed costs unless the judge certifies that the action was really brought to
                    try a right besides the right to recover damages, or that the injury was wilful
                    or malicious. Not to speak of other enactments on this subject, the County Court
                    Acts, 1867, laid down the following rule :—If in any action in any of the
                    superior courts the plaintiff shall recover a sum not exceeding £20 if the
                    action is rounded on contract, or £10 if founded on tort, whether by verdict,
                    judgment by default, or on demurrer, or otherwise, he shall not be entitled to
                    any costs of suit unless the judge certify on the record that there was
                    sufficient reason for bringing such action in such superior court, or unless tho
                    court or a judge at chambers shall by rule or order allow such costs.</p>
                <p>Costs in equity were subject to the discretion of the court, but as a general
                    rule the maxim of the civil law, <hi rend="italic">victus victori</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic">expensis condemnatus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">est,</hi> was followed. The successful party has a <hi
                    rend="italic">prima</hi><hi rend="italic">facie</hi> claim to costs, but the
                    court might, on sufficient cause shown, not only deprive him of his costs, but
                    even in some rare cases order him to pay the costs of his unsuccessful opponent.
                    There was a dass of cases in which the court generally gave costs to parties
                    sustaining a certain character, whatever might bo the result of the suit (e.y.,
                    heirs-at-law, mortgagees, &amp;c). A defendant would have been exempted from
                    costs if he had made such a tender of payment as would have rendered a suit
                    unnecessary—such tender to be full and unconditional,, and to include costs
                    already incurred, as well as the principal claim.</p>
                <p>The following rule as to costs is laid down in the Rules of Court appended to
                    Judicature Act, 1875, order 55 :— “Subject to the provisions of the Act the
                    costs of and incident to all proceedings in the High Court shall be in the
                    discretion of the court; but nothing herein contained shall deprive a trustee,
                    mortgagee, or other person of any right to costs out of a particular estate or
                    fund to which ho would be entitled under the rules hitherto acted upon in courts
                    of equity: provided that, where any action or issue is tried by a jury, the cost
                    shall follow the event, unless-upor. application made at the trial, for good
                    cause shown, the judge before whom such action or issue is tried, or the court,
                    shall otherwise order.” The provisions of the County Court Act, 1867, above
                    referred to, still hold good, as well as those of Lord Denman’s Act, depriving a
                    plaintiff of costs when he recovers less than 40s. on an action of tort,, unless
                    the judge certifies; and of 21 James I. c. 16, making costs no more than damages
                    in actions of slander where damages are assessed under 40s.</p>
                <p>In the taxation of costs certain principles are observed which may be briefly
                    adverted to. Thus in some cases costs are to be taxed as “between party and
                    party,” in others as between solicitor and client. “No definite rules can be
                    laid down with respect to the difference between the costs to be allowed upon
                    one principle of taxation and those allowed upon the other. In general, however,
                    in taxations as between party and party, only those charges will be allowed
                    which are strictly necessary for the purposes of the prosecution of the
                    litigation, or are contained in the table of fees annexed to the general orders
                    and regulations of the court; while in taxations as between solicitor and client
                    the party will be allowed as many of the charges which he would have been
                    compelled to pay his own solicitor, as being costs of suits, as fair justice to
                    the other party will permit” (Daniel’s <hi rend="italic">Chancery
                    Practice).</hi> Costs are taxed between party and party unless otherwise
                    specially directed. Costs of interlocutory motions made in the course of a
                    litigation are sometimes said to be “costs in the cause,” that is, they abide
                    the result of the principal issue. A party succeeding in an interlocutory
                    motion, and paying the costs therein made costs on the cause, would recover the
                    amount of such costs if he had a judgment for costs on the result of the whole
                    trial, but not otherwise.</p>
                <p>When one of the parties makes default, as in failing to proceed to trial
                    according to notice at the time appointed, he becomes liable to the other for
                    what are called the “costs of the day.”</p>
                <p>Regulations as to costs of proceedings in the Supreme Court of Judicature will be
                    found in order vi. of the Additional Rules of Court under the Judicature Act,
                    1875. Two scales of fees which may be charged by solicitors are printed—the
                    lower to be the general charge for matters assigned to the different divisions
                    of the court (except causes relating to sums over £1000 in the Chancery
                    division) and actions for special injunctions. But a court or judge may in any
                    case direct the fees in either scale to be allowed “to all or either or any of
                    the parties and as to all or any part of the costs.”</p>
                <p>The court of appeal shall have power to make such order as to the whole or any
                    part of the costs of the appeal as may seem just (Rules of the Judicature Act,
                    1875). <hi rend="smallcaps">(e.</hi> R.) <pb break="no"
