                    (1776-1837), landscape painter, was bom at East Bergholt, in the Stour valley,
                    Suffolk, June 11, 1776. Under the guidance of a certain John Dunthune, a
                    plumber, he acquired in early life some insight into the first principles of
                    landscape art, together with a habit of studying in the open air that was
                    afterwards of much service to him. His father, who was a yeoman farmer, did not
                    care to encourage this tendency, and set him to work in one of his windmills.
                    The incessant watchfulness of the weather which this occupation required laid
                    the foundation of that wonderful knowledge of atmospheric changes and effects of
                    which his works give evidence. From an introduction to Sir George Beaumont, an
                    amiable man but a poor painter, he became acquainted with the works of Claude
                    and Girtin. In 1795 he was sent to London with a letter to Farington, the
                    landscape painter. Farington encouraged him with predictions of coming eminence;
                    and for two years he plodded on, drawing cottages, studying anatomy, and copying
                    and painting, sometimes in London and sometimes in Suffolk. His progress,
                    however, was not encouraging; and in 1797 he returned home, and for some time
                    worked in his father’s counting-house. In 1799 he again went to London to
                    perfect himself as a painter; and on the 4th of February he was admitted a
                    student of the Royal Academy. The lights and shadows of his studies from the
                    antique at this period are praised by Leslie, but they were sometimes defective
                    in outline. He worked from dawn till dusk, and was an untiring copyist of such
                    masters as he had sympathy with, as Wilson, Ruysdael, and Claude. Drawings from
                    nature made during the next year or two, in Suffolk or in Derbyshire, were of no
                    great promise. Being naturally slow, he was yet groping blindly for something
                    not to be found for many years. In 1802 he attended Brookes’s anatomical
                    lectures, exhibited his first picture, and, refusing a drawing mastership
                    offered him by Dr Fisher, gave himself wholly to his vocation. He exhibited a
                    number of paintings during the next eight years, but it was not till 1811 that
                    he gave to the world, in his Dedham Vale, the first work in which his
                    distinctive manner and excellences are evident. In 1816, having inherited £4000
                    on his father’s death, he emerged from a painful state of poverty with which he
                    had been struggling, and married. In 1818 he exhibited four of his finest works;
                    and next year he sent to Somerset House the largest picture he had yet painted,
                    the landscape known as Constable’s White Horse. In the November following he was
                    made associate of the Academy. His power at this time, though unrecognized, was
                    at its highest. In 1823, however, after the exhibition of such masterpieces as
                    the Stratford Mill, the Hay Cart, and the Salisbury Cathedral, he did not
                    disdain to copy two Claudes. In 1824 two of his larger pictures, which he sold,
                    were taken to Paris, and created there a profound sensation. Allowing a great
                    deal for the influence of Bonington, who died four years afterwards, much of the
                    best in contemporary French landscape may be said to date from them. Constable
                    received a gold medal from Charles X., and his pictures were honourably hung in
                    the Louvre.</p>
                <p>In 1825, he painted his Loch (“silvery, windy, delicious” is his own description
                    of it), and sent his White Horse to Lille for exhibition. It made, like the
                    others, a great impression, and procured the painter a second gold medal. Other
                    great works followed; and in 1829 he was elected Academician, to the
                    astonishment and ill-concealed displeasure of many, and began to devote himself,
                    in conjunction with Lucas, to the preparation of his book of <hi rend="italic"
                    >English Landscape Scenery.</hi> Hard work brought on ill-health and low
                    spirits; rheumatism laid hold of him, and for some time he could neither write
                    nor paint. In 1832, however, he exhibited his Waterloo Bridge (painted, said his
                    enemies, with his palette-knife only), with three other pictures and four
                    drawings. In 1834 he painted his Salisbury from the Meadow’s, more generally
                    known as the Rainbow, a picture he valued greatly; and in 1836 he delivered a
                    course of lectures on his art at the Royal Institution. He died suddenly on the
                    1st of April 1837, leaving his Arundel Castle and Mill wet on his easel.</p>
                <p>The principles on which this great painter worked are not far to seek. He himself
                    has said, “Ideal art in landscape is all nonsense ;” and this sentence may be
                    said to sum up the whole of his theory and practice of painting. Turner’s
                    pictures to him were merely “golden dreams ;” Both and Berghem were only fit for
                    burning; if he proclaimed the greatness of Claude and Titian, it was that he
                    recognized their truth. Truth in its broadest and finest sense was his only aim.
                    He studied the country untiringly and intently, sacrificing mere detail to the
                    larger necessities of tone (“tone is the most seductive and inviting quality a
                    picture can possess ”), reproducing to an eminent degree the sentiment of what
                    he saw, flooding his canvas with light and shadows as one finds them, and
                    faithfully translating such glimpses as were revealed to him of the geniality of
                    nature. His range was limited; he sue-ceeded<pb break="no"

                    boyhood; but his repetitions of manner and subject are in reality so many
                    tentatives towards perfection. His merits were recognized in France; but his
                    studio was full of unsold pictures at his death, and it is certain that he could
                    not have earned a livelihood by his art without abandoning his theories. Since
                    his death, however, his pictures have greatly increased in value; and his
                    influence on contemporary French and English landscape is recognized as both
                    great and good.</p>
