                <p><label type="entry">COURT-MARTIAL</label>. Courts-martial have inherited part of
                    the jurisdiction of the old <hi rend="italic">Curia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Militaris,</hi> or Court of the Chivalry, in which a single marshal and at one
                    time the High Constable proceeded “according to the customs and usages of that
                    court, and, in cases omitted according to the civil law, <hi rend="italic"
                    >secundtιm</hi><hi rend="italic">legem</hi><hi rend="italic">armorum</hi>”
                    (Coke, 4 Ins. 17). The modern form of the courts was adopted by ordinance in the
                    time of Charles I., when English soldiers were studying the “articles and
                    military laws” of Gustavus Adolphus and the Dutch military code of Arnhem; it is
                    first recognized by statute in the first Mutiny Act, 1 Will, and Mary c. 5. The
                    royal prerogative of issuing commissions under the sign-manual for holding
                    courts-martial, although superseded as regards the United Kingdom by the express
                    power to make certain articles of war which the Mutiny Acts confer on the
                    sovereign, still exists as regards courts-martial held abroad. But the Mutiny
                    Acts also provide for the issue to commanders abroad of warrants to convene
                    courts-martial, or to authorize field-officers to convene them, and even make it
                    lawful in special cases beyond sea for any officer to convene a detachment
                    general court-martial without warrant or commission. The trial of the militia,
                    yeomanry, and volunteers is provided for by “The Volunteer Act, 1863,” and “The
                    Paegulation of the Forces Act, 1871.” In India the <hi rend="italic"
                    >punchayats,</hi> or native military tribunals, are frequently employed. All
                    commissioned officers on full pay, officers of the general staff, although on
                    half staff pay, and officers on brevet rank, are eligible as members of a
                    court-martial. The president of the court is necessarily the senior combatant
                    officer present, unless it has been his duty to investigate the charges against
                    the prisoner; and it is a general rule that the members should be of equal, or
                    superior, rank to the prisoner. Impartiality is secured by the system of
                    “roster;” <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the “tour of duty” is from the senior
                    downwards. The jurisdiction of courts-martial is not confined to purely military
                    offences, but, as regards felonies and misdemeanours mentioned in the Mutiny Act
                    or the Articles, is concurrent with, though subordinate to, the jurisdiction of
                    the ordinary criminal courts. The Mutiny Act, indeed, directs that soldiers
                    charged with common offences against the peace should be delivered up to the
                    magistrate. Officers tried in an ordinary court can be punished afterwards by
                    court-martial only by cashiering or reduction. There is a wholesome regulation
                    against sending home fortrial accused officers or men, except in cases of
                    unavoidable necessity, but the jurisdiction extends to offences wherever
                    committed. No court-martial can sit in one of H. Μ. ships in commission, but the
                    “Naval Discipline Act, 1866,” subjects land forces on board to its provisions.
                    Half-pay officers are not subject to martial law, but it is thought they ought
                    to be made so, as they derive advantage from retaining their commissions. Even
                    the licensed sutlers, who follow the autumn manoeuvres, are under the Mutiny
                    Act. So are paid recruiting officers, though not themselves enlisted, and, to a
                    certain extent, the “army reserve.” But a prisoner of war on parole cannot be
                    brought to trial, and all military offences prescribe in three years. From the
                    administration of martial law must carefully be distinguished the procedure by
                    court-martial authorized by the l43d Article of War in places where there is no
                    “form of civil judicature in force,” and with regard to civil crimes. In such
                    cases the court-martial applies the civil law, but its jurisdiction is ousted
                    wherever there is a competent civil court under the royal authority, although
                    that court may itself administer not British law, but French, or Roman-Dutch, or
                    any other form of colonial law, and may do so <pb break="no"

                    British soldiers. This special jurisdiction of courts-martial in nonmilitary
                    offences would also exist where the ordinary courts had been closed by a
                    declaration of martial law (see case of Rev. John Smith of Demerara, June 1824,
                    2 Hansard xi. 976).</p>
                <p>The old form of field or drum-head court-martial (in which no notice was given,
                    no oath administered, and no written record kept) being now happily extinct,
                    there remain three forms—(1) general and detachment general courts-martial, (2)
                    district and garrison courts-martial, and (3) regimental and detachment
                    courts-martial, which are distinguished by their powers of awarding punishment,
                    and by the dress of the Officers attending them—viz., review order, marching
                    order, drill order. The two latter are called minor courts, and commissioned
                    officers are not amenable to their jurisdiction. A great many offences are, by
                    the Articles of War, made appropriate to the different courts, the general rule
                    being that the general court is not to be resorted to except in aggravated
                    cases, punishable by penal servitude or death. By permission of a general
                    officer the regimental court may try an offence expressly assigned to a higher
                    court, but in no case may it try desertion. To a certain extent these rules are
                    set aside on the line of march or on board ship, but there is always a maximum
                    of punishment which each court is bound to observe. In 1868 the number of
                    members required for a general court at home was reduced from thirteen to nine,
                    a judge-advocate being in attendance. The general court can try all military
                    offences in whatever regiment under the command committed, and it is the only
                    martial court which takes cognizance of civil offences; it also hears appeals
                    from regimental courts. The detachment general court which is since 1860 only
                    competent “beyond seas,” where it is impracticable to hold a general court, was
                    introduced by Wellington, “to repress the spirit of plunder and outrage which
                    had broken out in the army after the battle of Vitoria” <hi rend="italic">(Supp.
                    Desp.</hi> viii. 104). It consists of three commissioned officers, summoned
                    without royal warrant, to investigate any offence against the person or property
                    of an inhabitant of the country where the detachment is. The sentence must be
                    confirmed by the general officer. The district or garrison court, which
                    superseded in 1829 the older general regimental court, consists of seven
                    members, the president doing the work of a judge-advocate in summoning
                    witnesses, administering oaths, and transmitting the proceedings to the
                    judgeadvocate-general in London. The power of this court to imprison
                    non-commissioned officers and privates was in 1864 extended from six months to
                    two years; and in 1869 it received additional power to impose forfeitures and to
                    discharge with ignominy. Another form of district court was that formerly called
                    detachment court for the trial of warrant officers (f.e., officers appointed by
                    warrant under the signature of colonels or commandants of corps). The regimental
                    court, summoned by the colonel, consists of five or three members, with power to
                    inflict limited sentences of imprisonment, corporal punishment, solitary
                    confinement, and also fines, stoppages, and other punishments not peculiar to
                    this court. There are also courts or boards of inquiry, called by an exercise of
                    the royal prerogative to inquire into such questions as the failure of an
                    expedition, or the necessity for an armistice or convention, often in order to
                    determine whether or not a court-martial should be held. It was found in the
                    well-known cases of Lord Bentinck (1820) and Lieutenant-Colonel Dawkins (1873)
                    that the Crown may withhold the proceedings of these courts from the courts of
                    law, and that military witnesses are protected from actions of damage in respect
                    of their evidence before such a court. Where an officer is called before the
                    court of inquiry he is not put on oath, or even bound to answer questions which
                    he thinks may be prejudicial to him; and in connection with the celebrated Simla
                    court-martial (1867) this rule was extended to the production of documents. The
                    Articles of War of 1860 introduced a regimental court of inquiry for the purpose
                    of hearing the complaints and redressing wrongs of non-commissioned officers
                    “and soldiers in any matter respecting their pay or clothing.” This court, which
                    is generally held by the captain, also inquires into cases of maiming and
                    mutilation, and all its judgments may be appealed against to a general court.
                    Smaller courts of inquiry examine cases of illegal absence, loss of medals, and
                    the return of officers who may have been taken prisoner by the enemy by their
                    own neglect.</p>
                <p>All members of a court-martial take an oath not only to try according to the
                    evidence, but to keep the sentence of the court secret until approved, and to
                    keep secret the votes and opinions of particular members. Even a peer, if
                    serving on a court-martial, cannot use his privilege of giving judgment on
                    honour. As might be expected, the army has a very varied experience in the forms
                    of swearing witnesses. Besides the ordinary Protestant mode of kissing the Bible
                    or Testament, and the ordinary Catholic mode of marking a cross on the closed
                    book, Mahometans are sworn by kissing or placing on their head the Koran, Sikhs
                    upon the Grinth, Hindus upon the Vedas, or by touching the Brahman’s foot; and,
                    according to caste custom, Indian witnesses sometimes insist on the oath being
                    administered by a Brahman. But in India affirmations are now generally taken.
                    While a Jew insists on wearing his hat, as in the synagogue, all soldiers,
                    though bound to remain covered before the court, remove their caps in swearing,
                    just as a Protestant witness ungloves his hand. Kaffir witnesses before a
                    court-martial have sworn by their own chief, and a Kaffir chief by the king of
                    England. The colonial legislatures, however, have generally made provision for
                    receiving unsworn evidence tf barbarous and uncivilized people who have no
                    religious belief. The judge-advocate is a legal assessor and clerk, but in no
                    sense the prosecutor, although the judge-advocate-general still frames and
                    sanctions the formal charger in the indictment. The latter is a Parliamentary
                    officer appointed on change of ministry, and a member of the Privy Council. He
                    advises the Crown as to the legality of courts-martial, reviews proceedings
                    brought under his notice, confidentially advises the commander-in-chief, and is
                    the custodier of the court records. The prosecutor is a staff officer, or the
                    prisoner’s commanding officer, or a field-officer of the regiment, or an
                    adjutant. The prisoner is generally entitled to have legal assistance, and also
                    a private interpreter as a check on the translation of the interpreter for the
                    prosecution. He has no peremptory challenges; but he may challenge on the
                    grounds cf defect of rank, inexperience, prejudice, <hi rend="smallcaps">ob</hi>
                    malice. Formerly, if the prisoner “stood mute,” tne court-martial entered a
                    verdict of guilty, but this is now altered in conformity with common sense.
                    Where ħe does not adduce evidence in defence, the prisoner (contrary to the rule
                    uuder Denman’s Act in criminal courts) has a right to the last word. The
                    judgment of the court is by simple majority, except in capital charges, which
                    require the concurrence of two-thirds. The same distinction holds iu the
                    subsequent voting on the sentence. Since 1868 the word “honourably” has
                    disappeared from verdicts of acquittal; and the finding “that the charge has not
                    been proved" has been discontinued. Capital punishment awarded for military
                    offences is generally carried out by shooting, but hanging is also competent. In
                    trifling cases between officers the court frequently dictate the terms of a
                    written or verbal apology; and in separate remarks they often observe on the
                    conduct of the prosecutor, ou the frivolous or groundless nature of the charges,
                    or the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit06newyrich/page/n550/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0550-0519"/> intemperate defence of a prisoner whom they
                    acquit. Such remarks are acted on at headquarters. As a general rule the
                    sovereigri’s confirmation is required to the decision of a general court.
                    Officers commanding abroad (except in India) have a limited power of
                    confirmation depending on the nature of the sentence. The commander-in-chief in
                    India may confirm all sentences; and this absolute power was also given to Lord
                    Baglan in the Crimea. Even in India, however, a capital sentence by
                    court-martial for a civil offence requires the approval of the governor-general.
                    When a decision, not of acquittal, comes up for approval, it is indispensable
                    that the judge-ad vocate-general should have a personal audience with the queen.
                    Her Majesty may not only disapprove, but may also order revision of the
                    proceedings; and where the conviction is sustained, the sentence may be remitted
                    or mitigated, but the professional penalties which martial law attaches to
                    conviction cannot be remitted. The members of courts-martial and those who
                    carryout their sentences are of course liable for illegal sentences or
                    irregularities. Thus in 1861, owing to a defect in the Acts regulating the
                    transfer of colonial prisoners, Lieutenant Allen recovered £200 from H.R.H. the
                    duke of Cambridge for false imprisonment.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, it may be stated that treason and other nonmilitary offences,
                    which, if committed in England, would be punishable in the ordinary criminal
                    courts, are tried by a general court-martial, if committed on service at
                    Gibraltar, or in India, 120 miles distant from any cf the three presidencies; or
                    elsewhere in the queen’s dominions, where there is no competent civil court, or
                    out of the queen’s iominions.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Naval Courts Martial.—</hi> The administration of the barbarous
                    naval law of England was long entrusted to the discretion of commanders acting
                    under instructions from the lord high admiral, who was supreme over both the
                    royal and merchant navy. It was the leaders of the Long Parliament who first
                    secured something like a regular tribunal by passing in 1615 an Ordinance and
                    Articles concerning Martial Law for the Government of the Navy. Under this
                    ordinance Blake, Monk, and Penn issued instructions for the holding general and
                    ship courts-martial with written records, the one for captains and commanders,
                    the other for subordinate officers and men. Of the latter the mate, gunner, and
                    boatswain were members, but the admirals reserved a control over the more
                    serious sentences. Under the Act 13 Car. II. c. 9, the high admiral again
                    received power to issue commissions for holding courts martial—a power which
                    continues to be exercised by the Board of Admiralty. During the 18th century,
                    under the auspices of Anson, the jurisdiction was greatly extended, and the
                    Consolidation Act of 1749 was passed in which the penalty of death occurs as
                    frequently as the curses in the commination service. The Naval Articles of War
                    have always been statutory, and the whole system may now be said to rest on the
                    Naval Discipline Acts of 1860 and 1866. The navy has its courts of inquiry for
                    the confidential investigation of charges “derogatory to the character of an
                    officer and a gentleman.” Under the Act of 1866 a court martial must consist of
                    from five to nine officers of a certain rank, and must be held publicly on board
                    of one of H.M. ships of war, and where three such ships are together. The rank
                    of the president depends on that of the prisoner. A judge-advocate attends, and
                    the procedure resembles that in military courts, except that the prisoner is not
                    asked to plead, and the sentence, if not one of death, does not require the
                    confirmation of the commander-in-chief abroad or of the Admiralty at home. The
                    court has a large and useful power of finding the prisoner guilty of a less
                    serious offence than that charged, which might well be imitated in the ordinary
                    criminal courts. The death sentence is always carried out by hanging at the
                    yard-arm; Admiral Byng, however, was shot in 1757. The Board of Admiralty have,
                    under the Naval Discipline Acts, a general power of suspending, annulling, and
                    modifying sentences which are not capital. The jurisdiction extends to all
                    persons belonging to the navy, to land forces and other passengers on board,
                    shipwrecked crews, spies, persons borne on the books of H.M. ships in
                    commission, and civilians on board who endeavour to seduce others from
                    allegiance. The definition of the jurisdiction by locality includes harbours,
                    havens, or creeks, lakes or rivers, in or out of the United Kingdom; all places
                    within the jurisdiction of the Admiralty; all places on shore out of the United
                    Kingdom; the dockyards, barracks, hospitals, &amp;c , of the service wherever
                    situated; all places on shore in or out of the United Kingdom for all offences
                    punishable under the Articles of War except those specified in section 38 of the
                    Naval Discipline Act, 1860. Under the Marine ^Iutiny Acts the royal marine
                    forces are, while on board, or borne on the books of H.M. ships, subject to
                    naval courts martial. In other circumstances the Articles of War made by the
                    Lord High Admiral for the government of the royal marines are carried out by
                    general courts-martial, district or garrison courts-martial, divisional and
                    detachment courts-martial, courts-martial on the line of march or in transport
                    ships, all held under the authority, mediate or immediate, of the lord high
                    admiral. The regulations of these different courts in the Marine Mutiny Act are
                    very much the same as in the case of courts martial for the land forces.
