                <p><label type="entry">CONSUL</label> (í+ccroc), the highest magistrate of the
                    republic of ancient Rome. It is probable that the word is compounded of <hi
                    rend="italic">con</hi> and <hi rend="italic">salio,</hi> so that <hi
                    rend="italic">consules</hi> signifies those who go together. They were in early
                    times called <hi rend="italic">praetores,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >imperatores,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">judices.</hi></p>
                <p>From the abuse of the power which had been vested in the kings, the Romans were
                    induced not only to expel the hated Tarquins from the city, but even to abolish
                    the monarchical form of government altogether. Brutus and his companions, after
                    the rape of Lucretia, made the people swear that no king should ever again reign
                    at Rome. The state was henceforth ruled by two supreme magistrates called
                    consuls. The consular office was instituted after the expulsion of the kings,
                    510 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and continued, with few interruptions, till
                    the establishment of the empire—a period of nearly 500 years. The leaders of the
                    revolution which had expelled the kings were first raised to this rank. All the
                    royal insignia were preserved except the crown. Twelve lictors preceded them
                    alternately. The elder of the two, or he who had most children, or who had been
                    'first elected, had the <hi rend="italic">fasces</hi> first, the other meanwhile
                    being preceded by a public officer called <hi rend="italic">accensus,</hi> and
                    followed by the lictors. Sometimes they agreed to enjoy the <hi rend="italic"
                    >fasces</hi> on alternate days, but generally for alternate months. By the law
                    of Poplicola, the axe was taken from them and their <hi rend="italic"
                    >fasces</hi> were lowered when they entered the assemblies of the people. A
                    cloak with a scarlet border, and an ivory staff, were badges of their office. On
                    public occasions they used a seat of ornamented ivory called the curule
                    chair.</p>
                <p>From the great power which their order originally possessed in the state, the
                    patricians succeeded for a long time in retaining the’ consulship among
                    themselves. It was not till the year 445 B.c. that the plebeians acquired
                    sufficient courage and strength to make any attempts to acquire the right of
                    being elected to this office. Having once begun the struggle, however, they

                    resolution which made even a foreign war desirable as a relief from internal
                    contests. Livy relates that for five years (375-371 B.c.) the opposition raised
                    by the plebeians, under the guidance of the tribunes L. Licinius Stolo and L.
                    Sextius, was so formidable that neither consuls nor any other magistrates could
                    be appointed, and there was what he calls a <hi rend="italic">solitudo
                    magistratuum.</hi> At length the patricians, after attempting an evasion by the
                    appointment of five military tribunes, were compelled to accede to the Liciniau
                    law, by which it was ordained (367 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> that in all
                    time coming one of the consuls should be a plebeian. L. Sextius was the first
                    plebeian consul. But the power which was effectual in the passing of the law was
                    not equal to its enforcement, for in 355 B.C. both consuls were patricians; and,
                    as was often the case with Roman laws, it was found necessary to re-enact it.
                    This time, however, the demands of the plebeians increased; and not satisfied
                    with having one consul, they tried to add a clause ordaining it to be lawful for
                    the people to elect both consuls from their own number. Although the attempt was
                    successful, no example of the appointment of two plebeian consuls occurs till
                    the year 215 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The honour seems for the most part
                    to have been equally divided between the two orders. The first foreigner who
                    obtained the consulship was Cornelius Balbus, a native of Cadiz, and a man of
                    extraordinary wealth.</p>
                <p>The legal age for enjoying the consulship was forty-five; but this regulation was
                    not strictly observed. Pompey was made consul in his thirty-sixth year, Μ.
                    Valerius Corvus in his twenty-third, T. Quinctius Flaminius was created consul
                    before he was thirty, Scipio Africanus the Elder at twenty-eight, and the
                    Younger at thirty-eight. It was necessary for candidates to have discharged the
                    inferior duties of quaestor, aedile, and praetor before they were eligible; and
                    a regulation was made that they should be present at the election in a private
                    capacity. It was also enacted that no one should be made consul a second time
                    till after the lapse of ten years. But we find cases in which all these
                    conditions were disregarded. Some were elected who had not previously borne any
                    curule magistracy; and others were appointed in their absence. Some continued in
                    office more than a year, as Marius, who was seven tinaes consul without
                    intermission; and others were elected before the allotted time had elapsed.</p>
                <p>The election of consuls was made by the <hi rend="italic">comitia centuriata</hi>
                    in the Campus Martius. The assembly at which they were elected was always
                    convoked and presided over by a consul, dictator, or interrex. It generally took
                    place in the month of July, that an opportunity might be afforded for
                    investigating the conduct of the successful candidates before they entered on
                    their office, and that they might have time to become conversant with their
                    duties. From their appointment to the day of their induction they were called
                    <hi rend="italic">consules designati,</hi> or consuls elect* and had the
                    privilege of being first asked their opinion in the senate. The day upon which
                    they assumed office was repeatedly changed. It seems originally to have been the
                    Ides of September, when, in the rude days of Roman history, the consuls used
                    annually to fix a nail in the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus to mark the year;
                    but as it sometimes happened, when one died before the term of his office had
                    expired, that another was immediately chosen to fill his place, the year of his
                    successor was naturally finished before the usual time, and this necessitated a
                    repeated change in the days of their appointment and induction. Sometimes, too,
                    civil commotions prevented the election taking place at the usual time. As the
                    consul whose year was completed could not in such cases discharge any of the
                    consular duties, it was customary for the senate to nominate a temporary
                    magistrate called interrex. His authority being limited to five days, a
                    succession of interreges had frequently to be chosen before tranquillity was
                    restored. At length (154 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> it was enacted that
                    consuls and all the ordinary magistrates, with the exception of the tribunes of
                    the people, should begin their duties on the 1st of January. That day was marked
                    by peculiar solemnities. At daybreak the consuls arose and consulted the
                    auspices. Afterwards the senate and people waited upon them at their houses, and
                    then, with the new magistrates clad in their state robes at their head, they all
                    marched in solemn procession to the capitol. There victims were offered, and
                    prayers presented for the safety and prosperity of the Roman people. After the
                    conclusion of the religious rites a meeting of the senate was held, and the new
                    consuls first exercised their functions by consulting it about the performance
                    of religious ceremonies. Within five days after their induction they were
                    obliged to swear, as they had done at their election, that they would strictly
                    observe the laws; and at the close of their consulship they were required to
                    take a similar oath declaring that they had done nothing contrary to the
                    constitution.</p>
                <p>The power of the consuls appears at first to have been similar to that of the
                    kings; but in process of time several distinctions arose which combined to
                    render the consular authority inferior to the regal. The office of high priest,
                    which had been discharged by the kings, was in the time of the consulship
                    executed by a special magistrate, called <hi rend="italic">rex</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">sacrorum,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">rex</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >sacrificulus.</hi> The power of life and death was afterwards denied to the
                    consuls, and the symbolic axe removed from the <hi rend="italic">fasces.</hi>
                    While there was only one king, there were two consuls. The obvious design of the
                    Romans in dividing the consulship was that their power might be weakened, and
                    the safety of the people made more secure by the resistance which the ambitious
                    designs of the one would receive from the other. For the same reason they
                    elected them annually, and thus prevented that insolence of authority which the
                    long continuation of it is apt to produce. They were restrained from illegal
                    measures still further by fear of punishment when their term of office had
                    expired; for the people had reserved to themselves the right of bringing them to
                    trial for misconduct. The Valerian law weakened their authority by decreeing
                    that no magistrate should scourge or put to death a Roman citizen who appealed
                    to the people. Even the decision of one consul could be repealed by the other.
                    But it was the creation of the tribunes of the people that especially con
                    tributed to limit their prerogatives, and strengthen the cause of liberty. And
                    as additional magistracies were instituted, many of their old privileges were
                    taken from them. Their judicial power was transferred to the praetors, and their
                    censorial to the censors, while other duties originally discharged by them
                    devolved upon aediles and other new magistrates.</p>
                <p>But notwithstanding these limitations, the power of the consuls was at all times
                    very great. As civil magistrates they were at the head of the government, and
                    all others, with the exception of the tribunes of the people, were subject to
                    them. They assembled and presided over the senate and <hi rend="italic">comitia
                    centuriata;</hi> they introduced subjects of deliberation, proposed laws, and
                    executed the decrees of both senate and people. The laws proposed by them
                    generally received their name. The year was called after them. They gave
                    audience to embassies, and communicated with other states. Before the
                    establishment of the praetorship and censorship, they discharged the highest
                    judicial functions, and superintended the assessment of the citizens. They had
                    the right of summoning and enforcing the presence of any one they pleased. Every
                    person was bound to turn out of the way, dismount, rise up, uncover the head, or
                    show some similar token of respect, on passing them.</p>

                <p>The consul Acilius ordered the curule chair of the praetor Lucullus to be broken
                    in pieces for a breach of this regulation. As military commanders they had
                    absolute authority. They had the power of life and death over the lives of their
                    soldiers; and accordingly they had axes in their fasces when in the field. When
                    any great danger threatened the state the consuls were invested by the senate
                    with extraordinary powers, which made them supreme in the city as well as out of
                    it. Accordingly, in the early days of the republic, when the patricians were in
                    sole possession of the consulship, and wished to subdue any outbreak of the
                    plebeians, they feigned that some powerful enemy was marching against the city,
                    and thus succeeded in obtaining extraordinary powers for the consuls.</p>
                <p>After the consuls had resigned their office, they were commissioned by the senate
                    to assume the government of provinces under the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >proconsuls.</hi> It was the prerogative of the senate to determine the
                    provinces for the consuls, although it was left to themselves to decide by lot
                    or agreement which of them each should receive. When the time arrived for a
                    proconsul to set out for his province, he was furnished by the senate with the
                    troops appointed for him, and everything requisite for his command. Surrounded
                    by a train of friends, and a numerous personal staff, he marched out of the city
                    with great pomp. He was bound to travel direct to his province; and the towns
                    through which he passed had to supply him with necessaries for his journey.
                    Within his province he had the command of the troops, and could employ them as
                    he pleased. He was supreme judge both in criminal and in civil causes, and could
                    inflict the punishment of death—except on Roman citizens, who could appeal to
                    Rome. Justice was generally administered at circuit courts, held once a year in
                    the principal towns. The proconsulship continued likewise for one year only, but
                    it was often prolonged by a decree of the senate.</p>
                <p>Under the empire the consuls were superseded by the emperors. The title, indeed,
                    remained, and all the ceremonies were performed with exactness, and perhaps even
                    with more magnificence than formerly. It would seem as if they attempted to
                    conceal the loss of real power by the trappings of external pomp. The day of
                    their induction was even more than ever a day of note in the city. Sitting on
                    curule chairs, which were placed on lofty chariots, arrayed in rich dresses in
                    imitation of those which used to be worn by generals in a triumph, with shoes of
                    cloth of gold upon their feet and sceptres in their hands, they passed through
                    the city, scattering money among the crowd, and bestowing gifts upon their
                    friends. Their first duty, however, no longer consisted in consulting the senate
                    about the religious duties of the state, but in formally returning thanks to the
                    emperor for their election. The emperors had arrogated the right of assuming the
                    consulship to themselves, or disposing of it as they thought proper. Julius
                    Caesar was dictator and consul at the same time. Augustus made himself consul
                    thirteen times during his reign. Vespasian proclaimed himself perpetual consul.
                    And in bestowing it upon others, the emperors were not content with having one
                    pair of consuls for one year. Desirous to conciliate as many of their friends as
                    possible, they greatly shortened the duration of the office. It was held
                    generally for two months, which allowed twelve consuls during one year. But
                    sometimes it lasted only a few weeks, a few days, or even a few hours, according
                    to the pleasure of the emperor. There happened to be twenty-five consuls in the
                    year 189 <hi rend="smallcaps">à.d.</hi> But those who entered upon their office
                    on the 1st of January were held in greater respect, and gave their names to the
                    year. They were called, as in the time of the republic, <hi rend="italic"
                    >consules ordinarii</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> while those who were raised to
                    the office at other times were termed <hi rend="italic">consules suffecti,</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">consules minores.</hi></p>
                <p>While the republic lasted, the time that elapsed between the election and
                    ordination of consuls was short, generally from July to January. In the time of
                    the emperors, ordination was sometimes deferred several years. The triumvirs in
                    39 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> nominated consuls for eight succeeding years.
                    In this way the title of <hi rend="italic">designatus</hi> was frequently
                    enjoyed long before the actual consulship. Caius, the grandson of Augustus, was
                    consul designatus for five years. Nero was fourteen years old when he was
                    nominated consul designatus, and twenty when he became consul.</p>
                <p>Besides these different kinds of consuls, all of which existed in the republic,
                    we find another class peculiar to the later days of the empire—honorary consuls.
                    These enjoyed the titles and badges of consuls, but nothing more. They possessed
                    their honours, though altogether free from their duties. All the consuls, in
                    truth, during the period of which we speak, may with propriety be termed
                    honorary, for the substance of their power had been taken from them. They had
                    become the mere slaves of the emperors, although they still continued the formal
                    discharge of their functions. Nevertheless, even in this degraded condition, the
                    consulship was always regarded with veneration, and considered the highest
                    dignity to which a Roman citizen could aspire.</p>
