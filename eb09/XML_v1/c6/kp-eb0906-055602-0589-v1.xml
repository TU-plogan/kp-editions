                    >σωζeLv,</hi> to save), is a product of the distillation of wood-tar, more
                    especially that made from beech-wood; tar from tho wood of conifers contains it
                    in but small quantity. Tho distillation of the tar is carried on till only a
                    thick pitchy substance is left. From the lowermost layer of the distillate is
                    obtained by the action of sodium carbonate a yellowish oil, the heavier part of
                    which is isolated by rectification in a glass retort, and mixed with potash
                    solution to dissolve out its creasote. The creasote is separated from the
                    filtered potash solution by sulphuric acid, is distilled with alkaline water,
                    and again treated with potash and acid, till its purification is effected; it is
                    then distilled at 200° C. (392' Fahr.), and dried by means of calcium chloride.
                    Creasote is ∩ highly refractive, colourless, oily liquid, first obtained by
                    Reichenbach, in 1832, from beech-wood tar. It consists mainly of a mixture of
                    the compounds—phenol, <hi rend="smallcaps">C</hi><hi rend="subscript smallcaps">

                    less impure carbolic acid, containing paracresol and other bodies. Creasote has
                    a strong odour and hot taste, is a non-conductor of electricity, and burns with
                    a smoky flame. Its specific gravity is 1O37 at 20° C.; its boiling point is 203°
                    C. (397° Fahr.); and it is still liquid at - 27’ C. ( - 16'6° Fahr.) Rhenish
                    creasote can be distilled for tho most part between 199° and 208° C., giving a
                    liquid of specific gravity 1O77 at 14° C. Creasote dissolves sulphur,
                    phosphorus, resins, and many acids and colouring matters; and is soluble in
                    alcohol, ether, and carbon disulphide, and in 80 parts by volume of water. It is
                    distinguished from carbolic acid or phenol by the following qualities :—it turns
                    the plane of a ray of polarized light to the right, forms with collodion a
                    transparent fluid, and is nearly insoluble in glycerine; whereas carbolic acid
                    has no effect on polarized light, gives with about two-thirds of its volume of
                    collodion a gelatinous mass, and is soluble in all proportions in glycerine;
                    further, alcohol and ferric chloride produce with creasote a green solution,
                    turned brown by water, with carbolic acid a brown, and on the addition of water,
                    a blue solution. Creasote, like carbolic acid, is a powerful antiseptic, and
                    readily coagulates albuminous matter; wood-smoke and pyroligneous acid or
                    wood-vinegar owe to its presence their efficacy in preserving animal and
                    vegetable substances from putrefaction. Creasote is given in medicine combined
                    with acetic acid, syrup, spirit of juniper, and water. In small quantities it
                    acts as a sedative of the stomach, but in over-doses it is a violent poison,
                    causing severe pain in the abdomen, nausea, headache, giddiness, and stupor. It
                    is administered in cases of vomiting, diarrhoea, cholera, intestinal bleeding,
                    and chronic gleet, and to assuage hunger and thirst in diabetes; in the form of
                    a gargle it is of service in excessive salivation, and its vapour, mixed with
                    that of water, is sometimes recommended for inhalation. Externally it is applied
                    as a stimulant and styptic, and for the treatment of decayed teeth; and an
                    ointment containing it is used as a remedy for ring-worm. Creasote is also
                    employed for preserving timber from dry-rot, and for the curing of fish and
                    hams. The principal supplies of creasote are brought from Archangel, Stockholm,
                    and America.</p>
