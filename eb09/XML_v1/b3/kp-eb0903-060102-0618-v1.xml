                <p><label type="entry">BERNARD, <hi rend="smallcaps">St</hi></label>; one of the
                    most illustrious Christian teachers and representatives of monasticism in the
                    Middle Ages, was born at Fontaines, near Dijon, in Burgundy, in 1091. The son of
                    a knight and vassal of the duke of Burgundy who perished in the first crusade,
                    Bernard may have felt for a time the temptations of a military career, but the
                    influence of a pious mother and his own inclinations towards a life of
                    meditation and study led him to the cloister. While still a youth he is said to
                    have been “marvellously cogitative” (“<hi rend="italic">mire cogitativus,”</hi>
                    St Bern. <hi rend="italic">Op.,</hi> vol. ii. coL 1063), and the ascendency of
                    his mind and character were soon shown. He joined the small monastery of Citeaux
                    in 1113 when twenty-two years of age, and such were the effects of his own
                    devotion and eloquent enthusiasm in commending a religious life, that he drew
                    after him not only his two younger brothers, but also his two elder ones, Guido
                    and Gerard, both of whom had naturally taken to soldiering, and the elder of
                    whom was married and had children. The effect of his preaching is said to have
                    been that “mothers hid their sons, wives their husbands, companions their
                    friends,” lest they should be drawn away by his persuasive earnestness.</p>
                <p>The monastery of Citeaux had attracted St Bernard not only on account of its
                    neighbourhood (it was only a few miles distant from Dijon), but by its
                    reputation for austerity. The monks were few and very poor. They were under an
                    Englishman of the name of Stephen Harding, originally from Dorsetshire, whose
                    aim was to restore the Benedictine rule to its original simplicity and give a
                    new impulse to the monastic movement. In Bernard, Harding found a congenial
                    spirit. No amount of self-mortification could exceed his ambition. He strove to
                    overcome his <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n619/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0619-0602"/> bodily senses altogether and to live entirely
                    absorbed in religious meditation. Sleep he counted a loss, and compared it to
                    death. Food was only taken to keep him from fainting. The most menial offices
                    were his delight, and even then his humility looked around for some lowlier
                    employment. Fortunately he loved nature, and found a constant solace in her
                    rocks and woods. “Trust one who has tried it,” he writes in one of his epistles,
                    “you will find more in woods than in books; trees and stones will teach you what
                    you can never learn from masters.” (“Experto crede: aliquid amplius invenies in
                    silvis quam in libris; ligna et lapides docebunt te quod a magistris audire non
                    possis,” <hi rend="italic">Epist.</hi> 106.)</p>
                <p>So ardent a nature soon found a sphere of ambition for itself. The monks of
                    Citeaux, from being a poor and unknown company, began to attract attention after
                    the accession of St Bernard and his friends. The fame of their self-denial was
                    noised abroad, and out of their lowliness and abnegation came as usual
                    distinction and success. The small monastery was unable to contain the inmates
                    that gathered within it, and it began to send forth colonies in various
                    directions. St Bernard had been two years an inmate, and the penetrating eye of
                    the abbot had discovered beneath all his spiritual devotion a genius of rare
                    power, and especially fitted to aid his measures of monastic reform. He was
                    chosen accordingly to head a band of devotees who issued from Citeaux in 1115 in
                    search of a new home. This band, with Bernard at their head, journeyed
                    northwards till they reached a spot in the diocese of Langres—a thick-wooded
                    valley, wild and gloomy, but with a clear stream running through it. Here they
                    settled and laid the foundations of the famous abbey of Clairvaux, with which St
                    Bernard’s name remains associated in history The hardships which the monks
                    endured for a time in their new abode were such as to drive them almost to
                    despair, and their leader fell seriously ill, and was only rescued from what
                    seemed impending death by the kind compulsion of his friend William of
                    Champeaux, the great doctor of the age, who besought and received the direction
                    of Bernard for a year from his superior at Citeaux. Thanks to his considerate
                    friend the abbot of Clairvaux was forced to abandon the cares of his new
                    establishment, and in retirement and a healthful regimen to seek renewed health.
                    The effect was all that could be desired, and in a few years Bernard had not
                    only recovered his strength, but had begun that marvellous career of literary
                    and ecclesiastical activity, of incessant correspondence and preaching, which
                    was to make him in some respects the most influential man of his age.</p>
                <p>Gradually the influence of Bernard’s character began to extend beyond his
                    monastery. His friendship with William of Champeaux and others gave currency to
                    his opinions, and from his simple retreat came by voice or pen an authority
                    before which many bowed, not only within his own order but within the church at
                    large. This influence was notably shown after the death of Pope Honorius II. in
                    1130. Two rival popes assumed the purple, each being able to appeal to his
                    election by a section of the cardinals. Christendom was divided betwixt the
                    claims of Anacletus II. and Innocent IL The former was backed by a strong
                    Italian party, and drove his adversary from Rome and even from Italy. Innocent
                    took refuge in France. The king, Louis the Fat, espoused his cause, and having
                    summoned a council of archbishops and bishops, he laid his commands on the holy
                    abbot of Clairvaux to be present also and give the benefit of his advice. With
                    reluctance Bernard obeyed the call, and from the depths of seclusion was at once
                    plunged into the heart of the great contest which was afflicting the Christian
                    world. The king and prelates put the question before him in such a way as to
                    invite his decision and make him arbiter. After careful deliberation he gave his
                    judgment in favour of Innocent, and not only so, but from that time forward
                    threw himself with characteristic fervour and force into the cause for which he
                    had declared. Not only France, but England, Spain, and Germany were won to the
                    side of Innocent, who, banished from Rome, in the words of St Bernard, was
                    “accepted by the world.” He travelled from place to place with the powerful
                    abbot by his side, who also received him in his humble cell at Clairvaux.
                    Apparently, however, the meanness of the accommodation and the scantiness of the
                    fare (one small fowl was all that could be got for the Pope’s repast), left no
                    wish on the part of Innocent or his retinue to continue their stay at Clairvaux.
                    He found a more dainty reception elsewhere, but nowhere so powerful a friend.
                    Through the persuasions of Bernard the emperor took up arms for Innocent and
                    Anacletus was driven to shut himself up in the impregnable castle of St Angelo,
                    where his death opened the prospect of a united Christendom. A second anti-pope
                    was elected, but after a few months retired from the field, owing also, it is
                    said, to St Bernard’s influence. A great triumph was gained not without a
                    struggle, and the abbot of Clairvaux remained master of the ecclesiastical
                    situation. No name stood higher in the Christian world.</p>
                <p>The chief events which fill up his subsequent life attest the greatness of his
                    influence. These were his contest with the famous Abelard, and his preaching of
                    the second crusade.</p>
                <p>Peter Abelard was twelve years older than Bernard, and had risen to eminence
                    before Bernard had entered the gates of Citeaux. His first intellectual
                    encounter had been with Bernard’s aged friend William of Champeaux, whom he had
                    driven from his scholastic throne at Paris by the superiority of his dialectics.
                    His subsequent career, his ill-fated passion for Heloise, his misfortunes, his
                    intellectual restlessness and audacity, his supposed heresies, had all shed
                    additional renown on his name; and when a council was summoned at Sens in 1140,
                    at which the French king and his nobles and all the prelates of the realm were
                    to be present, Abelard dared his enemies to impugn his opinions. St Bernard had
                    been amongst those most alarmed by Abelard’s teaching, and had sought to stir up
                    alike Pope, princes, and bishops to take measures against him. He did not
                    readily, however, take up the gauntlet thrown down by the great hero of the
                    schools. He professed himself a “stripling too unversed in logic to meet the
                    giant practised in every kind of debate.” But “all were come prepared for a
                    spectacle,” and he was forced into the field. To the amazement of all, when the
                    combatants met and all seemed ready for the intellectual fray, Abelard refused
                    to proceed with his defence. After several passages considered to be heretical
                    had been read from his books he made no reply, but at once appealed to Rome and
                    left the assembly. Probably he saw enough in the character of the meeting to
                    assure him that it formed a very different audience from those which he had been
                    accustomed to sway by his subtilty and eloquence, and had recourse to this
                    expedient to gain time and foil his adversaries. Bernard followed up his assault
                    by a letter of indictment to the Pope against the heretic. The Pope responded by
                    a sentence of condemnation, and Abelard was silenced. Soon after he found refuge
                    at Cluny with the kindly abbot, Peter the Venerable, who brought about something
                    of a reconciliation betwixt him and Bernard. The latter, however, never heartily
                    forgave the heretic. He was too zealous a churchman not to see the danger there
                    is in such a spirit as Abelard’s, and the serious consequences to which it might
                    lead.</p>
                <p>In all things Bernard was enthusiastically devoted to the church, and it was this
                    enthusiasm which led him at last into the chief error of his career. Bad news
                    reached <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n620/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0620-0603"/> France of the progress of the Turkish arms in the
                    East. The capture of Edessa in 1144 sent a thrill of alarm and indignation
                    throughout Christian Europe, and the French king was urged to send forth a new
                    army to reclaim the Holy Land from the triumphant infidels. The Pope was
                    consulted, and encouraged the good work, delegating to St Bernard the office of
                    preaching the new crusade. Weary with growing years and cares the abbot of
                    Clairvaux seemed at first reluctant, but afterwards threw himself with all his
                    accustomed power into the new movement, and by his marvellous eloquence kindled
                    the crusading madness once more throughout France and Germany. Not only the
                    French king, Louis VII., but the German emperor, Conrad III., placed himself at
                    the head of a vast army and set out for the East by way of Constantinople.
                    Detained there too long by the duplicity of the Greeks, and divided in counsel,
                    the Christian armies encountered frightful hardships, and were at length either
                    dispersed or destroyed. Utter ruin and misery followed in the wake of the
                    wildest enthusiasm. Bernard became an object of abuse as the great preacher of a
                    movement which had terminated so disastrously, and wrote in humility an
                    apologetic letter to the Pope, in which the divine judgments are made as usual
                    accountable for human folly. This and other anxieties bore heavily upon even so
                    sanguine a spirit. Disaster abroad and heresy at home left him no peace, while
                    his body was worn to a shadow by his fasting and labours. It was, as he said,
                    “the season of calamities.” Still to the last, with failing strength, sleepless,
                    unable to take solid food, with limbs swollen and feeble, his spirit was
                    unconquerable. “Whenever a great necessity called him forth,” as his friend and
                    biographer Godfrey says, “his mind conquered all his bodily infirmities, he was
                    endowed with strength, and to the astonishment of all who saw him, he could
                    surpass even robust men in his endurance of fatigue.” He continued absorbed in
                    public affairs, and dispensed his care and advice in all directions often about
                    the most trivial as well as the most important affairs. Finally the death of his
                    associates and friends left him without any desire to live. He longed rather “to
                    depart and be with Christ.” To his sorrowing monks, whose earnest prayers were
                    supposed to have assisted his partial recovery when near his end, he said, “Why
                    do you thus detain a miserable man? Spare me. Spare me, and let me depart.” He
                    expired August 20, 1153, shortly after his disciple Pope Eugenius III.</p>
                <p>His character appears in our brief sketch as that of a noble enthusiast, se,lfish
                    in nothing save in so far as the church had become a part of himself, ardent in
                    his sympathies and friendships, tenacious of purpose, terrible in indignation.
                    He spared no abuse, and denounced what he deemed corruption to the Pope as
                    frankly as to one of his own monks. He is not a thinker nor a man in advance of
                    his age, but much of the best thought and piety of his time are sublimed in him
                    to a sweet mystery and rapture of sentiment which has still power to touch
                    amidst all its rhetorical exaggerations.</p>
                <p>His writings are very numerous, consisting of epistles, sermons, and theological
                    treatises. The best edition of his works is that of Father Mabillon, printed at
                    Paris in 1690 in 2 vols, folio, and reprinted more than once—finally in 1854 in
                    4 vols. 8vo. His life, written by his friend and disciple Godfrey, is also
                    contained in this edition of his works. (j. τ.)</p>
