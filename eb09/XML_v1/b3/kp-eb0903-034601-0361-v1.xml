                <p><label type="entry">BÄNKURÄ</label>, a district of British India, within the
                    BardwAn division, under the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, situated in 22° and
                    23° N. lat., and 86° and 87° E. long., bounded on the N. and E. by BardwAn
                    district; on the S. by Midnapur district; and on the W. by MAnbhιim district.
                    BAnkurA forms a connecting link between the delta of the Ganges on the E. and
                    the mountainous highlands of ChhotA NAgpur on the W. Along its eastern boundary
                    adjoining BardwAn district the country is flat and alluvial, presenting the
                    appearance of the ordinary paddy lands of Bengal. Going N. and W., however, the
                    surface gradually rises into long undulating tracts; rice lands and swamps give
                    way to a region of low thorny jungle or forest trees; the hamlets become smaller
                    and more scattered, and nearly disappear altogether in the wild forests along
                    the western boundary. The principal hills are—MAnjiA hill, on the south bank of
                    the DAmodar; Koro hill, S. of the foregoing; SusuniA hill, W. of Koro; and
                    BehArinAth hill, in the N.W. corner of the district. The rivers are merely
                    mountain torrents—the largest, the DAmodar, being only navigable by country
                    boats during the rains. The census of 1872 returned the population of the
                    district at 526,772 souls, inhabiting 2028 villages, and 104,687 houses; average
                    density of population, 391 to the square mile. The Hindus numbered 487,786, or
                    92 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 6 per cent, of the total population;
                    Mahometans, 13,500; Christians, 70; and persons of unspecified religion, chiefly
                    aboriginal tribes, 25,416.</p>
                <p>District area, after recent transfers to and from the districts of BardwAn and
                    MAnbhAm in 1872, 1346 square miles. Before these transfers the area was returned
                    at 1350 square miles, of which 630 were said to be cultivated, 540 cultivable
                    but not cultivated, and 180 uncultivable waste. Agricultural products—rice,
