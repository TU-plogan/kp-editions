                <p><label type="entry">BALASOR</label>, a district of British India in the Orissa
                    division, under the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, lies between 20° and 21° N.
                    lat., and in 86° and 87° E. long., and is -bounded on the N. by the district of
                    Midnapur; on the S. by Cattack district, from which it is separated by the
                    Baitarani river; on the W. by the tributary states of Keunjhar, Nilgiri, and
                    Morbhanj; and on the E. by the Bay of Bengal. Balasor district forms a strip of
                    alluvial land between the hills and the sea, varying from about 9 to 34 miles in
                    breadth; area, 2066 sq. miles. The hill country rises from the western boundary
                    line. The district naturally divides itself into three well-defined tracts—(1.)
                    The Salt Tract, along the coast; (2.) The Arable Tract, or rice country; and
                    (3.) The Submontane Tract, or jungle lands. The Salt Tract runs the whole way
                    down the coast, and forms a desolate strip a few miles broad. Towards the beach
                    it rises into sandy ridges, from 50 to 80 feet high, sloping inland, and covered
                    with a vegetation of low scrub jungle. Sluggish brackish streams creep along
                    between banks of foetid black mud. The sand hills on the verge of the ocean are
                    carpeted with creepers and the wild convolvulus. Inland, it spreads out into
                    prairies of coarse long grass and scrub jungle, which harbour wild animals in
                    plenty; but throughout this vast region there is scarcely a hamlet, and only
                    patches of rice cultivation at long intervals. From any part of the Salt Tract
                    one may see the boundary of the inner arable part of the district, fringed with
                    long lines of trees, from which every morning the villagers drive their cattle
                    out into the saliferous plains to graze. The Salt Tract is purely alluvial, and
                    appears to be of recent date. Towards the coast the soil has a distinctly saline

                <p>Salt is largely manufactured in this tract by evaporation. The following is the
                    process followed :—At the beginning of December the contractor selects his
                    locality, about a quarter to half a mile from the sea, and engages a class of
                    men called <hi rend="italic">chuliyds,</hi> or heads of salt gangs. These men
                    receive Is. a cwt. for whatever amount of salt they turn out. They, in their
                    turn, engage working parties of <hi rend="italic">malangis,</hi> who are paid at
                    the rate of 3d. to 5d. a day. The ground is first marked out by a shallow
                    trench, and the grasses and bushes are carefully dug up and removed. A deep
                    ditch is next dug from the sea, by means of which, twice a month, the spring
                    tides overflow the saltfield, and fill a number of reservoirs, 4 feet in
                    diameter, and 2 or 3 feet deep. A mound of earth is then piled up to the height
                    of 2 feet, and from 3 to 4 in diameter. It is next hollowed out into the shape
                    of a bowl, plastered inside with clay, and furnished with a hole at the bottom,
                    covered with a layer of graes 6 inches thick. The salt-makers fill this bowl
                    with saline earth scraped off the adjacent land, and pour the sea-water on it
                    from the top. By the end of six hours the water has drained through into a pit
                    at the bottom, and runs down a thatched trench towards a reservoir, whence it is
                    transferred to the evaporators. The latter consist of from 160 to 200 little
                    unglazed earthenware pots, fastened together by stiff tenacious mud, and holding
                    two quarts each. The neighbouring plains supply grasses for the fuel. Six hours’
                    boiling completes the process. The brine, which consisted in the first place of
                    sea-water charged to its maximum power of solution by percolating through the
                    bowls of salt earth, subsides into dirty crystals at the bottom of the pots. It
                    is then ladled out in spoons made of half cocoa-nuts. The whole process is as
                    rude and careless as can well be imagined. The total cost of manufacture is
                    estimated at 2s. Id. a cwt., which with the Government duty of 8s. 8d., makes a
                    total cost of 10s. 9d.</p>
                <p>The Arable Tract lies beyond the salt lands, and embraces the chief part of the
                    district. It is a long dead level of rich fields, with a soil lighter in colour
                    than that of Bengal or Behar; much more friable, and apt to split up into small
                    cubes with a rectangular cleavage. A peculiar feature of the Arable Tract is the
                    <hi rend="italic">Pats,</hi> literally the Cups, or depressed lands near the
                    river banks. They were probably marshes that have partially silted up by the
                    yearly overflow of the streams. These Cup-lands bear the finest crops. As a
                    whole, the Arable Tract is a treeless region, except around the villages, which
                    are encircled by fine mango, <hi rend="italic">pipal,</hi> banyan, and tamarind
                    trees, and intersected with green shady lanes of bamboo. A few palmyras, date
                    palms, and screw pines (a sort of aloe, whose leaves are armed with formidable
                    triple rows of hook-shaped thorns) dot the expanse, or run in straight lines
                    between the fields. The Submontane Tract is an undulating country with a red
                    soil, much broken up into ravines along the foot of the hills. Masses of
                    laterite, buried in hard ferruginous clay, crop up as rocks or slabs. At Kopâri,
                    in Kila Ambohatâ, about 2 square miles are almost paved with such slabs, dark
                    red in colour, perfectly flat, and polished like plates of iron. A thousand
                    mountain torrents have scooped out for themselves picturesque ravines, clothed
                    with an ever-fresh verdure of prickly thorns, stunted gnarled shrubs, and here
                    and there a noble forest tree. Large tracts are covered with Sâl jungle, which
                    nowhere, however, attains to any great height.</p>
                <p>Balasor district is watered by six distinct river systems: 1. The Subanrekhâ,
                    literally the streak of gold, forms the boundary between Balasor and Midnapur,
                    flowing in a tortuous southern course, with gigantic bends from east to west
                    till it reaches the sea in lat. <hi rend="italic">21° 35'</hi> N. and long. 87°
                    23' E. It is navigable by country craft as high as Kâlikâpur, about 16 miles
                    from the mouth, to which point the tide also runs. Rice boats of 2 tons’ burden
                    can make their way up to the end of the Balasor district, and during the rains
                    far into the tributary state of Morbhanj. 2. The intermediate country on the
                    south of the Subanrekha and the north of the Burâbalang, forms a great line of
                    drainage down from Morbhanj. It is watered by a number of small streams, of
                    which the principal are the Jamira, Bans, and Bhairingi. They unite, bifurcate,
                    and re-unite in the wildest confusion, and at length enter the sea as the
                    Pânclipârâ, in lat. 21° 31' N. and long. 87° 10' E. 3. South of this network of
                    rivers is the Burâbalang, literally the Old Twister. It rises among the Morbhanj
                    hills, in lat. 21° 24' and long. 86° 36', and after receiving two small
                    tributaries, the Gangahar and Sunai, wriggles into the sea in lat. 21 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> β</hi> 28' and long. 87° 5'. Brigs, sloops, and sea-going
                    steamers can navigate this river as far as the town of Balasor, about 16 miles
                    up its twisting course, but the sand-bar across the mouth of the river renders
                    the entrance difficult. 4. South of the Burabalang, a network of rivers, known
                    as the Jâmkâ, find their way down the line of drainage from the western Nilgiri
                    hills, and enter the sea by many channels. 5. The Kânsbâns, rising in Kila
                    Ambohatâ, runs in a south-easterly direction, at first almost parallel with the
                    Nilgiri hills, and receives from them a number of nameless drainage streams on
                    its northern bank. At Birpârâ it bifurcates, the northern branch retaining its
                    original name, and entering the sea in lat. 21° 12' 25", long. 86° 52' 10". The
                    southern branch receives the name of Gammai, and falls into the sea 6 miles
                    south of the Kânsbâns. This river is navigable only <pb break="no"

                    floods and the vast extent of country which it submerges in the rainy season. 6.
                    The Baitarani enters the district at the village of Balipur, and flows for about
                    45 miles in a south-westerly direction till it joins the Dhâmra, 5 miles from
                    its mouth. The united stream enters the sea under the name of the Dhàmrâ, in
                    lat. 20" 47', long. 87°. The Dhamrä is a fine navigable estuary, but, like all
                    the Orissa rivers, it is rendered perilous by a bar across its mouth.</p>
                <p>Population of Balasor in 1872, 770,232 souls, residing in 3266 villages, and

                    530, or Ί per cent., Christians; 1 Buddhist; and 12,427, or 1’6 per cent., of
                    aboriginal origin. The proportion of males to the total district population was
                    49∙2 per cent.; number of male’adult agriculturists, 150,391, and male adult
                    non-agriculturists, 82,542. Brahmans, Karans, Khandâits, and other castes,
                    compose the Hindu population. There are two settlements of Christian
                    missionaries in the district belonging to the Freewill Baptists, from Dover, New
                    Hampshire, U.S. The district contains only one town with upwards of 5000
                    inhabitants, viz., Balasor itself, with 18,263. Almost the whole population of
                    the district lives by agriculture. Rice forms the staple crop of the district,
                    and is divided into 5 great <hi rend="italic">genera,</hi> and 49 principal
                    varieties. Pulses, oil-seeds, hemp, tobacco, cotton, sugar-cane, &amp;c., makeup
                    the other agricultural products of Balasor. Balasor husbandmen consist of two
                    classes, <hi rend="italic">thdni or</hi> cultivators, with a right of occupancy,
                    and <hi rend="italic">pdht,</hi> or tenants at will. Roughly speaking, one half
                    of the district is under tillage, and the other half incapable of cultivation.
                    Exports —Grain, sugar, oil-seeds, timber, hides, horns, &amp;c. Imports— Native
                    cloths, English piece-goods, &amp;c. Total revenue of the Balasor district in
                    1870-71, £102,052, of which £41,408, or 40 percent., was from land; total
                    expenditure in the same year, £51,620. In 1872 the police force of the district
                    consisted of 566 officers and men of the regular police, maintained at a total
                    cost of £8879, 8s.; 32 officers and men of the municipal police, maintained at a
                    cost of £224,12s; and 2320 men of the village watch, maintained by grants of
                    service lands and by subscriptions from villages, which amounted to £2745 in
                    1872; total strength of police, 2918 men; total cost, £11,849. Balasor contained
                    1053 schools in 1872, attended by 11,538 pupils. The Government and aided
                    schools were 43 in number, attended by 1631 pupils, and maintained at a total
                    cost of £1559, to which Government contributed £748, 16s. The climate of Balasor
                    greatly varies according to the seasons of the year. The hot season lasts from
                    March to June, but is tempered by cool sea breezes; from June to September the
                    weather is close and oppressive; and from October to February the cold season
                    brings the northeasterly winds, with cool mornings and evenings. (W. W. H.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Balasor,</hi> the principal town and administrative
                    headquarters of the above district, situated on the River Burâbalang, in 21° 28'
                    45" N. lat., and 86° '59 33* E. long., about 8 miles from the sea-coast as the
                    crow flies, and 16 by the river. The English settlement of Balasor, formed in
                    1642, and that of Pippli in its neighbourhood, seven years earlier, became the
                    basis of the future greatness of the British in India. The servants of the East
                    India Company here fortified themselves in a strong position, and carried on a
                    brisk investment in country goods, chiefly cottons and muslins. They flourished
                    in spite of the oppressions of the Mahometan governors, and when needful
                    asserted their claims to respect by arms. In 1688, affairs having come to a
                    crisis, Captain Heath, commander of the Company’s ships, bombarded the town. In
                    the 18th century Balasor rapidly decl·lned in importance, on account of a
                    dangerous bar which formed across the mouth of the river. At present the bar has
                    12 to 15 feet of water at spring tides, but not more than 2 or 3 feet at low
                    water in the dry season. Large ships have to anchor outside in the open
                    roadstead. The town contains a population of 18,263; municipal income in 1872,
                    £519; expenditure, £514; rate of taxation, 6∣&lt;L per head of population. (w.
