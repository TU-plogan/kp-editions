                <p><label type="entry">BECCAFUMI, <hi rend="smallcaps">Domenico</hi></label>, was a
                    distinguished painter of the school of Siena at the beginning of the 16th
                    century. In the early days of the Tuscan republics Siena had been in artistic
                    genius, and almost in political importance, the rival of Florence. But after the
                    great plague in 1348 the city declined; and though her population always
                    comprised an immense number of skilled artists and artificers, yet her school
                    did not share in the general progress of Italy in the loth century. About the
                    year 1500, indeed, Siena had no native artists of the first importance; and her
                    public and private commissions were often given to natives of other cities. But
                    after the uncovering of the works of Raphael and Michel Angelo at Rome in 1508,
                    all the schools of Italy were stirred with the desire of imitating them. Among
                    those accomplished men who now, without the mind and inspiration of Raphael or
                    Michel Angelo, mastered a great deal of their manner, and initiated the
                    decadence of Italian art, several of the most accomplished arose in the school
                    of Siena. (See articles <hi rend="smallcaps">Peruzzi</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Soddoma.)</hi> Among these was Domenico, born about 1488, of a
                    peasant, one Giacomo di Pace, who worked on the estate of a well-to-do citizen
                    named Lorenzo Beccafumi. Seeing some signs of a talent for drawing in his
                    labourer’s son, Lorenzo Beccafumi took the boy into his service and presently
                    adopted him, causing him to learn painting from masters of the city. Known
                    afterwards as Domenico Beccafumi, or by the nickname of Mecarino, signifying the
                    littleness of his stature, the peasant’s son soon gave proof of extraordinary
                    industry and talent. In 1509 he went to Rome and steeped himself in the manner
                    of the great men who had just done their first work in the Vatican. Returning to
                    his native town, Beccafumi quickly gained employment and a reputation second
                    only, if second, to Soddoma. He painted a vast number both of religious pieces
                    for churches and of mythological decorations for private patrons, many of which
                    are still to be seen where they were executed. But the work by which he will
                    longest be remembered is that which he did for the celebrated pavement of the
                    cathedral of Siena. For a hundred and fifty years the best artists of the state
                    had been engaged laying down this pavement with vast designs in <hi
                    rend="italic">commesso</hi> work,— white marble, that is, engraved with the
                    outlines of the subject in black, and having borders inlaid with rich patterns
                    in many colours. From the year 1517 to 1544 Beccafumi was engaged in continuing
                    this pavement. He made very ingenious improvements in the technical processes
                    employed, and laid down multitudinous scenes from the stories of Ahab and
                    Elijah, of Melchisedec, of Abraham, and of Moses. These are not so interesting
                    as the simpler work of the earlier schools, but are much more celebrated and
                    more jealously guarded. Such was their fame that the agents of Charles I. of
                    England, at the time when he was collecting for Whitehall, went to Siena
                    expressly to try and purchase the original cartoons. But their owner would not
                    part with them, and they are now the property of the cathedral works. The
                    subjects have been engraved on wood, by the hand, as it seems, of Beccafumi
                    himself, who at one time or another essayed almost every branch of fine art. He
                    made a triumphal arch and an immense mechanical horse for the procession of
                    Charles V. on his entry into Siena. In his later days, being a solitary liver

                    by over-exertion upon the processes of bronze-casting. He died in 1551. (Vasari,
