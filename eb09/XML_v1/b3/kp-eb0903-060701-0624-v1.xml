                <p><label type="entry">BEROSUS</label> was a Chaldean priest who lived in the time
                    of Alexander the Great and his immediate successors. He translated the history
                    of his native country, Babylonia, into the Greek language, and dedicated the
                    work to one of the Greek kings of Syria named Antiochus. His work is principally
                    known through the fragments of Polyhistor and Apollodorus, two writers in the
                    1st century before the Christian era, who are quoted by Eusebius and
                    Syncellus.</p>
                <p>The work of Berosus professed to commence with the creation of the universe, and
                    the history was carried down to his own time. A few quotations at second or
                    third hand, and the bare outlines of his system of chronology, are all that has
                    been transmitted to us through the copyists of Berosus; but the close connection
                    throughout between his story and the Bible, and the knowledge that he drew his
                    information from the records of Babylonia, have always invested these fragments
                    with great importance,—an importance which has been increased of late, since the
                    discovery of several cuneiform inscriptions confirming different parts of his
                    history.</p>
                <p>The history of Berosus first described the chaos before the creation, presided
                    over by the female Thalatth or Omoroca (the chaotic sea), called Tiamat and
                    Tisallat in the inscriptions; she was destroyed by Belus, and then the gods
                    created the heavens and the earth. After this ho gave the chronology of the
                    Babylonian kingdom as follows :—</p>

                <p>The later part of the scheme of Berosus is lost, but detached extracts are quoted
                    by some ancient historians.</p>
                <p>In comparing the notices of Berosus with the Babylonian and Assyrian
                    inscriptions, considerable difficulty is met with on account of the deficient
                    information on both sides. The absence of chronological landmarks in the
                    inscriptions, and the doubts as to the length of the third and fourth periods of
                    Berosus, are serious difficulties in the way of the chronology, but in the
                    absence of more satisfactory information the list of Berosus must be taken as
                    the framework of Babylonian chronology.</p>
                <p>The first period of Berosus, reaching from the creation to the flood, is said to
                    have included 10 reigns and 432,000 years. The last two of these names are the
                    only ones found with any certainty in the cuneiform inscriptions,—these are
                    Ubara-tutu and Adra-hasis, the Otiartes and Xisuthrus of Berosus. The deluge,
                    which closed this period, is described in Berosus, and in the cuneiform
                    inscriptions of the Izdubar legends.</p>
                <p>The next period given by Berosus includes 86 kings, and a period of 34,080 or
                    33,091 years,—the number is uncertain, and certainly unhistorical. It is
                    probable that the later sovereigns of this period were historical, and some of
                    the names which are preserved are ordinary Babylonian compounds. Three names in
                    a fragment of BabyIonian<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n625/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0625-0608"/> chronology appear to belong to this period,—these
                    are Ilu-kassat, Mulagununna, Abilkisu, who are given as successive sovereigns;
                    and there is another probable king of the period, Izdubar, who most likely
                    represents the Biblical Nimrod. During this period the language and people of
                    Babylonia are supposed to have been Turanian, and in round numbers it may be
                    said to end about 2400 B.c.</p>
                <p>About 2400 B.c., according to Berosus, Babylonia was overrun by a conquering
                    tribe called by him ‘'Medes.” He has preserved in connection with this event the
                    name of Zoroaster, and has given the dynasty 8 kings, the length of the period
                    being placed variously at 234, 224, and 190 years. Where our authorities differ
                    so much we can only make shift with a round number, and say the period was
                    probably about 200 years, from 2400 to 2200 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> There
                    is one name in the inscriptions supposed to belong to this period,—that of
                    Kudur-nanhundi, king of Elam, who conquered Babylonia about 2280 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Nothing is known as to the race here called Medes by
                    Berosus, but it is conjectured that they were Elamites.</p>
                <p>The next period of Berosus included 11 kings, the duration of the dynasty not
                    being preserved. In the margin we have the number 48 years, but nothing is known
                    of the origin of this number, and it appears too small for 11 kings. Perhaps we
                    may provisionally allow about 200 years for this dynasty, 2200 to 2000 B.c.
                    Nothing is known of the race or names of the monarchs.</p>
                <p>About 2000 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> commenced a period including, according
                    to Berosus, 49 kings and 458 years. The kings are called Chaldean, and appear to
                    correspond with a famous line of sovereigns reigning at the cities of Ur,
                    Karrak, and Larsa, commencing with the reign of Urukh, king of Ur. The centre of
                    Babylonian power in their time lay in the south of the country, and many of the
                    well-known temples and other buildings in this region were raised during their
                    dominion. One of the monarchs in this period bore the name of Sargon; he was
                    very celebrated, and of him a story is related similar to that of the infancy of
                    Moses. He is said to have been concealed by his mother in an ark and floated on
                    the River Euphrates. This great period ended with the defeat of Rim-agu, king of
                    Larsa, by Hammurabi, who established a new dynasty, and made Babylon the capital
                    about 1550 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi></p>
                <p>The dynasty founded by Hammurabi appears to be the Arabian line of Berosus, which
                    lasted under 9 kings for 245 years. Many of the kings of this period are known
                    from the inscriptions. They first had extensive relations with the Assyrians,
                    and about 1300 B.c. Tugulti-ninip, king of Assyria, conquered Babylon, and
                    expelled the last Arab monarch. From this time commenced the direct influence of
                    Assyria in Babylonia, and the period of this dynasty is counted by Berosus as
                    526 years. It probably ended with the time of Pul, a great king and conqueror,
                    about whose personality and date there is much difference of opinion.</p>
                <p>The next epoch in Babylonian history is that of Nabonassar, whose era commenced
                    747 B.c. From his time the history of Babylonia presents a constant series of
                    conquests by the Assyrians, and revolts against them by the Babylonians, down to
                    the time of Nabopolassar, who, after quelling a revolt in Babylonia, was made
                    ruler of the country by the king of Assyria, and afterwards revolting against
                    his master took Nineveh in concert with the Medes.</p>
                <p>Nebuchadnezzar, son of Nabopolassar, who ascended the throne of Babylon 605 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> was one of the most celebrated kings in history, and
                    is mentioned at length by Berosus, who then notices the revolutions at Babylon
                    until the taking of the city by Cyrus 539 B.c.</p>
                <p>The history of Berosus continued down to the conquest of Alexander the Great, and
                    the reign of his patron Antiochus.</p>
                <p>The writings and notices of Berosus were collected and published in Germany by
                    Richterin 1825, aud in England by Cory, in his <hi rend="italic">Ancient
                    Fragments.</hi> Later and excellent extracts and notices have been given by
                    Canon Rawlinson and Μ. Lenormant, while the chronology of Berosus has exercised
                    the ingenuity of Brandis, Oppert, Lenormant, Rawlinson, Hincks, and many other
                    scholars. There is. however, no probability that&lt;any published system has
                    correctly restored the dates of Berosus; the materials are at present
                    insufficient for such a work. <hi rend="smallcaps">(g. s.)</hi></p>
