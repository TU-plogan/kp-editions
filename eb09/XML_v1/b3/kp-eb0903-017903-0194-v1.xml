                    earliest of the French socialists, was born in 1762, in the department of Aisne.
                    From his father, a major in the Austrian army, he received special instruction
                    in mathematics, but was deprived of him by death at the age of sixteen.
                    Established as a land-surveyor at Roye, in the Somme department, he became a
                    fervid advocate of the Revolution, and wrote articles in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Correspondant</hi><hi rend="italic">Picard,</hi> for which he was prosecuted in
                    1790. He was acquitted on that occasion, and was afterwards elected an
                    administrator of the department; but a charge of forgery being brought against
                    him, he was condemned by the Somme tribunal to twenty years’ imprisonment in
                    1793. Escaping to Paris, he became secretary to the Relief Committee of the
                    Commune, and joined Garin in his denunciation of the Committee of Public Safety.
                    This led to his incarceration, ostensibly under the former sentence. This was,
                    however, annulled by the Court of Cassation; and he was also discharged by the
                    Aisne tribunal &lt;(18th July 1794), to which he had been remitted. Returning to
                    Paris, he entered on a violent crusade against the remains of the Robespierre
                    party, and started the <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi><hi rend="italic">de la
                    Liberté de la Presse</hi> to maintain his views. In the following year (1795)
                    the Girondists acquired supremacy in the Convention; Babeuf’s journal was
                    suspended, and himself imprisoned—first in Paris and then at Arras. Thrown into
                    the society of certain partisans of Robespierre, he was won over by them, and
                    was ready, on his release, to become the indiscriminating defender of the very
                    men whom he had previously attacked (No. 34 of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tribun,</hi> as he now called his journal). In April 1796 Babeuf, Lepelletier,
                    and others, constituted themselves a “Secret Directory of Public Safety,” and
                    took the title of the “Equals;” while another association of self-styled
                    “Conventionais” and “Patriots” met at the house of Amar. The latter party aimed
                    at the re-establishment of the revolutionary government, while Babeuf and his
                    friends wanted besides to realise their schemes for the organisation of common
                    happiness. Disputes naturally arose; and to reconcile the Equals and the
                    Patriots, it was agreed, first, to re-establish the constitution of 1793; and
                    secondly, to prepare for the adoption of true equality by the destruction of the
                    Government. Everything was ready by the beginning of May 1796, and the number of
                    adherents in Paris was reckoned at 17,000; but on the 10th the Government
                    succeeded in arresting the main leaders of the plot. The army protected the
                    «Government, and the people of Paris looked on. The trial was opened at Vendôme
                    on Feb. 2, 1797, and lasted three months. Babeuf and Darth6 were sentenced to
                    death; Germain, Buonarroti, and five others, to transportation; Amar, Vadier,
                    Duplay, and the remaining fifty-three, were acquitted. On the announcement of
                    the sentence, Babeuf and Darthé stabbed themselves, but the wounds were, not
                    mortal. They passed a frightful night, and next morning were borne bleeding to
                    the scaffold. Ardent and generous, heroic and self-sacrificing, Babeuf had
                    neither solid knowledge nor steadiness of judgment. “The aim of society is
                    happiness, and happiness consists in equality,” is the centre of his doctrine.
                    Propagated under the name of Babouvism, it became the germ of contemporary
                    communism. Babeufs influence was fatal in a threefold way,— because he
                    re-established the memory of Robespierre among French Republicans, connected
                    them with the theories of Rousseau, and paved the way for that school of
                    Socialists which left the lessons of experience and observation for Utopian
                    dreams.</p>
