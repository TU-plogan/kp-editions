                    gave it the name of <hi rend="italic">Pontus</hi><hi rend="italic">Axenos,</hi>
                    or “sea unfriendly to strangers.” But when the repeated visits of the Greeks had
                    rendered these tribes more familiar with strangers, and commercial intercourse
                    had softened down the original ferocity of their character, Grecian colonies
                    were established at different points on the shores of this sea, and the epithet
                    <hi rend="italic">Axenus</hi> was changed into <hi rend="italic">Euxinus,</hi>
                    which has the opposite import, and mèans “friendly to strangers.” The modern
                    name seems to have been given to it by the Turks, who, being accustomed to the
                    navigation of the Aegean, the islands of which furnish numerous harbours of
                    refuge, were appalled by the dangers of a far wider expanse of water without any
                    shelter, subject to sudden and violent storms, and often covered with dense
                    fogs.</p>
                <p>The basin of the Black Sea is of an irregular ovate form, its long diameter lying
                    nearly E. and W. Its greatest length, from the head of the Bay of Burghaz in
                    Rumilia on the west to the boundary between Transcaucasia and Asiatic Turkey
                    near Batum on the east, is about 720 miles. Its greatest breadth is in its
                    western portion, between the estuary of the Dnieper on the north and the mouth
                    of the Sakaria on the south, where it is 380 miles; its middle portion is
                    narrowed, by the projection of the Crimean peninsula on the north and of the
                    coast line of Anatolia between Cape Kerempe and Sinope on the south, to 160
                    miles; but further east it widens out again between the Strait of Kertch on the
                    north and the mouth of the Kizil Irmak (the ancient <hi rend="italic"
                    >Halys)</hi> on the south, to 260 miles. Its total area, including the Sea of
                    Azoff, is about 172,500 square miles. The western coast line of the Black Sea,
                    for some distance northwards from the Bosphorus, is high and rocky, having
                    ranges of hills at its back; and the water rapidly deepens to from 30 to 40
                    fathoms. Between their northern extremity and the range of the Balkans (the
                    ancient <hi rend="italic">Hoemus),</hi> which extends east and west, terminating
                    in Cape Emineh, there is a large bay, named after the town of Burghaz at the
                    head of it, which affords a safe anchorage for large ships, the only one on this
                    coast. Between Cape Emineh and Varna the coast line is again low and the shore
                    shallow; and the same condition extends, with but little interruption, along the
                    low-lying region called the Dobrudscha, which extends to the mouth of the
                    Danube. This great river discharges itself by seven mouths, among swampy islands
                    and shifting banks; and the quantity of <hi rend="italic">detritus</hi> brought
                    down by it is so large as not only to form a very extensive bar, but also to

                    from the bel of the navigable channels. The same low coast-line continues along
                    the southern boundary of the Russian steppes, to the shallow inlet which forms
                    the estuary of the Dniester, and of which the mouth is nearly closed by a bar;
                    beyond which, towards Odessa, the coast-line is more lofty, and the waters
                    deepen more rapidly, so that it has been possible to construct a harbour in
                    which ships of considerable tonnage can lie securely. Between Odessa and the
                    mouth of the Dniester the shore again becomes low, and the water shallow; and
                    the outlet of that river, which also receives the River Bog or Bug, is a long
                    shallow bay bordered by shifting sand-banks, which is called the Gulf of Leman
                    or the Bay of Kherson. Only ships of light draught of water can navigate these
                    rivers, of which the Bug is the deeper; and vessels of war, which are built and
                    repaired at the arsenals of Kherson and Nicolaieff, are artificially floated up
                    and down. The Crimean peninsula is separated from the mainland on the western
                    side by the Gulf of Perekop, the northern boundary of which is formed by a
                    narrow belt of sand that runs nearly straight for a distance of 80 miles, and
                    was celebrated by ancient geographers as the <hi rend="italic">δρόμος
                    Άχιλλέως.</hi> The inner portion of this gulf is so shallow that only vessels of
                    very light draught can make their way to Perekop, which is situated on the
                    narrow isthmus that divides it from the Sea of Azoff. Along the western coast of
                    the Crimea, however, the coast-line gradually rises, and the shore deepens more
                    rapidly; and’at Eupatoria there is a good harbour for ships of moderate size
                    South of Eupatoria, the coast is formed by cliffs, sometimes of considerable
                    height; and the water is deep almost to their base. The harbour of Sebastopol
                    somewhat resembles that of Valetta in being a deep inlet, subdividing into
                    several branches, in any one of which the largest vessels may find good
                    anchorage, and lie within a cable’s length of the shore. Between Sebastopol and
                    Cape Chersonese are six other bays running inland parallel to each other; and on
                    rounding this we arrive at the harbour of Balaclava, which is a remarkable
                    inlet, having a very narrow entrance, and almost entirely surrounded by lofty
                    heights. Eastward from Balaclava there commences an almost continuous chain of
                    lofty cliffs, with mountains behind them, whose height ranges from 4000 to 5800
                    feet; the commencement of this chain is formed by Cape Aia or Tarchanskoi,
                    probably the <hi rend="italic">Parthenium</hi> of Strabo, the most remarkable
                    headland in the Crimea. Along the whole south-east coast of the Crimean
                    peninsula the water is deep; but there is no good harbour between Balaclava and
                    the Bay of Kaffa, which furnishes an excellent and sheltered anchorage for large
                    vessels, and was formerly much frequented when Kaffa or <hi rend="italic"

                    The peninsula of Kertch and the island of Taman, which separate the Sea of Azoff
                    from the Black Sea, are for the most part low and sandy, the most elevated land
                    in each being near the border of the Strait of Yenikale. On the western side of
                    this strait the town of Kertch is situated, upon what was formerly known as the
                    Hill of Mithridates.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Sea of Azoff</hi> may be considered as the wide shallow
                    estuary of the Kiver Don, which discharges its waters into the north-eastern
                    prolongation of the sea, sometimes distinguished as the Gulf of Taganrog; its
                    area is estimated at about 14,000 square miles; and its depth, which is nowhere
                    more than 7⅛ fathoms, diminishes near the shores to 4⅛ fathoms, and is less than
                    2 fathoms opposite the town of Taganrog. These depths show a tendency to yet
                    further diminution through the deposit of river <hi rend="italic"
                    >detritus,—</hi> vessels which could formerly pass up the gulf as far as
                    Taganrog being no longer able to do so, whilst during certain winds the bottom
                    becomes dry enough to be crossed between Taganrog and Azoff. The western portion
                    of this basin is separated from the rest by a long narrow strip of low sandy
                    land, enclosing what was named by the Greeks the Putrid Sea,—into which, when
                    the wind is easterly, the water of the Sea of Azoff passes through a narrow
                    opening at the northern extremity of the bar, but which at other times consists
                    of a series of swamps and quagmires, equally impassable to men and animals, and
                    giving fortlι noxious exhalations that render the adjacent country nearly
                    uninhabitable. The water of the Sea of Azoff is always less salt than that of
                    the Black Sea; and when the Don is at its fullest, the large quantity of fresh
                    water which is mingled with the water of the sea renders the latter nearly
                    drinkable, and tends to empty the basin of its salt. When, on the other hand,
                    the river brings down but little water, and the wind is from the south, there is
                    a considerable reflux of the more saline water outside; and thus the average
                    salinity of the water of the Sea of Azoff is maintained,—just as is seen to be
                    the case on a larger scale with the Baltic. See Baltic, p. 297.</p>
                <p>The whole of the portion of South Russia that lies between the Dnieper and the
                    Don is an almost unbroken <hi rend="italic">steppe,</hi> but very little
                    elevated above the sea-level; and there are abundant indications of its having
                    been at no remote period covered by salt water. For not only are there numerous
                    salt lakes and marshes at a long distance, inland from the present coast-line,
                    but extensive beds of sea-shells, which have become mineralized into strata of
                    solid limestone, sometimes 30 or 40 feet in thickness. The like features prevail
                    over the plain which lies between the Don and the Kuban, and which forms the
                    eastern boundary of the Sea of Azoff; this plain, inhabited by nomade Kalmucks
                    and Cossacks, extends eastward to the desert of Astrakhan; and as salt marshes
                    and beds of sea-shells are found there also, it is evident not only that both
                    the Black Sea and the Caspian extended farther north than they do at present,
                    but that they were then in continuity with each other over the plain of South
                    Russia, though separated towards the south by the Caucasian Highlands. It is
                    interesting to note that Pliny expressly stated that the Tauric Chersonese was
                    not only surrounded by the sea, but that the sea covered all that northern
                    portion of it which is now an alluvial level.</p>
                <p>The island or peninsula of Taman, which forms the eastern border of the Strait of
                    Yenikale, is for the most part an expanse of salt-marshes and lagoons, into
                    which the River Kuban discharges itself,—one portion of its water passing into
                    the Sea of Azoff and the rest into the Black Sea. At Anapa, a little to the
                    east, the Caucasian range comes down to the sea; and thence around the shore of
                    Circassia, the coast-line is high with a mountainous back-ground, and the water
                    rapidly deepens. As the great mountain range trends inland, however, the coast
                    becomes lower; and the region now termed Mingrelia, the ancient <hi
                    rend="italic">Colchis,</hi> is a fertile plain, through which run the River Rion
                    (the ancient <hi rend="italic">Phasis)</hi> having the important port of Poti at
                    its mouth, and the Khopi, at the mouth of which is Redout Kale. Through these
                    channels the merchants of Tiflis export the produce of the interior, and import
                    European goods. Passing the boundary between Russia and Turkey, the coast -line
                    begins to trend westwards, to the outlet of the large river Chouruk (the ancient
                    <hi rend="italic">Batys),</hi> where the fortified town of Batoum is situate at
                    the base of the northern mountain range of Asia Minor. This range extends, with
                    occasional interruptions,' along the whole southern coast of the Black Sea,
                    sending down spurs that form headlands and promontories, sometimes of
                    considerable height. Owing to the steepness of the shores, there are few good
                    anchorages here, except in the Bay of Samsoun, which receives the River Yeshil,
                    and the Bay of Sinope, which receives the Kizil-Irmak,-at the mouths of which
                    rivers there are plains formed by their alluvial deposit. From Cape Injeh
                    westward to the Bosphorus, the coast-line of Anatolia is continuously elevated,
                    with high mountains in the back-ground, occasionally projecting seawards as
                    lofty promontories, of which Cape Kerempe is the most noteworthy; numerous
                    rivulets come down from the mountains, and discharge themselves into <pb

                    ancient <hi rend="italic">Sangarius),</hi> there is no considerable river, and
                    the water deepens very rapidly to 20 fathoms or more.</p>
                <p>Although it is known that the depth of the central part of the basin of the
                    Euxine reaches 1070 fathoms, the extent of this deep depression is not known.
                    The increase of depth off the low-lyiug western and north-western shores is very
                    gradual and regular, the lines of 20, 30, and 60 fathoms maintaining a general
                    parallelism to the coast,—so that within this range the distance of a ship from
                    land can be approximately ascertained by sounding. But outside the 60 fathom
                    line the bottom deepens more rapidly and less regularly, depths of from 600 to
                    700 fathoms being met with in some parts within a few miles of it. The depth of
                    the eastern portion of the basin has not been ascertained, but it is probably
                    considerable.</p>
                <p>The basin of the Euxine communicates with that of the Sea of Marmora by the
                    Bosphorus, a strait about 20 miles long, from f to 2∣ miles wide, and a depth of
                    from 30 to 40 fathoms, resembling a broad river with high banks, which maintain
                    a general parallelism, although the strait has seven distinct reaches. The
                    region on either side presents distinct evidence of recent volcanic action.</p>
                <p>The Sea of Marmora lies in the course of the channel that connects the Black Sea
                    with the Aegean. Its bottom is depressed to a depth far greater than that of the
                    channel of which it is an expansion. Its length from strait to strait is 110
                    geographical miles, and its greatest breadth is 43 miles. Round the shores, the
                    depth generallyranges from 10 to 30 fathoms; but it rapidly increases in most
                    parts; and depths of 100, 133, 266, and even 355 fathoms have been met with,
                    chiefly near the line connecting the two straits.</p>
                <p>The channel which connects the Sea of Marmora with the Aegean is properly termed
                    the Hellespont,—the name Dardanelles, by which it is commonly known, being
                    really that of the fortifications erected ©n the two sides of the strait by
                    which its passage is guarded. The Sea of Marmora narrows to a breadth of ten
                    miles towards the north-eastern entrance of the channel; at Gallipoli, the
                    distance between the two shores suddenly contracts to about two miles; and
                    between this and the Aegean end of the strait, that distance is further
                    diminished at certain points to even less than a mile. The depth of the channel
                    is considerable, being for the most part between 30 and 50' fathoms.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate.—</hi> The climate of the Black Sea is very peculiar,—
                    the <hi rend="italic">range</hi> of temperature between the summer and winter
                    extremes being remarkably great. The <hi rend="italic">summer</hi> isotherm of
                    70° runs a little way inland, nearly parallel to its northwestern coast-line,
                    whilst the summer isotherm of 80° passes along its southern coast-line, which is
                    as warm as the southern coast-line of the Mediterranean, nearly 10° nearer the
                    equator. Thus the whole area of the Black Sea lies, like that of the
                    Mediterranean, between these two summer isotherms; and the evaporation from its
                    surface during the warmer part of the year will consequently be enormous. During
                    the winter months, on the other hand, the Black Sea is exposed to the chilling
                    winds which come down to it from the Arctic regions, sweeping over the
                    snow-covered plains of Russia, without any interruption from high mountain
                    ranges; and nearly the whole of its area lies between the <hi rend="italic"
                    >winter</hi> isotherms of 30° and 40°, the former passing round its northern
                    coast, while the latter passes from the Bosphorus to Poti in Mingrelia. Thus it
                    happens that, notwithstanding their high summer temperature, the northern shores
                    of the Black Sea are more or less blockaded with ice during the winter,—this
                    being most the case where the water is shallowest, and has its salinity lowered
                    by the entrance of rivers. Thus the Sea of Azoff and the Strait of Yenekale are
                    always frozen over, as are also the northern ports between the Crimea and
                    Odessa; while, on the other hand, the harbours of Kaffa and Sebastopol are never
                    closed, and that of Odessa but seldom. It is recorded, however, that in 401 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> the surface of the Euxine was almost entirely frozen
                    over, and that when the ice broke up enormous masses were seen floating in the
                    Sea of Marmora for thirty days. In 762 <hi rend="smallcaps">a,d.,</hi> again,
                    the sea is said to have been frozen from the terminal cliffs of the Caucasus to
                    the mouths of the Dniester, Dnieper, and Danube; and contemporary writers assert
                    that the quantity of snow which fell on the ice rose to the height of from 30 to
                    40 feet, completely hiding the contour of the shores, and that on the breaking
                    up of the ice in the month of February, the masses of it carried by the current
                    into the Sea of Marmora reunited in one immense sheet across the Hellespont
                    between Sestos and Abydos. No similar occurrence has been subsequently
                    recorded.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">winds</hi> of the Black Sea are variable, except during
                    summer, when they generally blow from the north-east, while at other seasons
                    southerly or south-westerly winds cften prevail. The area is very subject to
                    fogs, which appear to proceed from the precipitation by a cold northerly current
                    of the moisture which has been raised by evaporation from its surface, or has
                    been brought thither by S. or S.W. winds. This sea is remarkable for the
                    rapidity with which violent storms not unfrequently arise, often to subside
                    again with like rapidity.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Drainage Area.—</hi> The drainage area of the Black Sea is one
                    of the largest in the world, being estimated at 939,000 square miles, of which
                    825,000 lie in Europe and 114,000 in Asia. The largest of its rivers is the
                    Danube, which has a total length of 1560 miles, and drains the immense area of
                    306,000 square miles in the southern portion of Central Europe; its western
                    tributaries lie so near the southern tributaries of the Rhine and the Elbe, that
                    a canal-communication has been established between them, by which small vessels
                    can pass between the North Sea and the Black Sea. The Dnieper has a total length
                    of 1050 miles, and drains an area of 195,500 square miles, chiefly in Western
                    Russia and Russian Poland; its northern tributaries approach the southern
                    tributaries of the Niemen; and a canal-communication has thus been established
                    between the Black Sea and the Baltic. The Don, with a length of 1000 miles,
                    drains an area of 176,500 square miles in South-Eastern Russia, which is
                    conterminous with the basin of the Volga, being separated from it by the Sarpa
                    Hills. Between the Dneiper ana Danube, the two smaller rivers, the Bug and the
                    Dniester, traverse respectively 440 and 660 miles in their course, and drain an
                    area of more than 50,000 square miles (ten times greater than that of the
                    Thames). Passing eastwards, we come to the Kuban, which drains the northern
                    slopes of the Caucasus and the plains inhabited by the Black Sea Cossacks, and
                    debouches near the entrance to the Sea of Azoff. But there is no other important
                    river on the eastern coast, most of the water flowing from the mountainous
                    region that separates the Black Sea from the Caspian passing into the latter.
                    The northern slopes of the Armenian mountains furnish tributaries of the River
                    Chouruk, a stream of moderate size, which enters the Black Sea to the east of
                    Trebizond. On the southern coast the principal river is the Kizil Irmak (the <hi
                    rend="italic">Hal·ys</hi> of the ancients’), which drains the large central area
                    of the northern portion of Asia Minor, while towards the western side the River
                    Sakaria drains a large area in the province of Anatolia. Along the whole western
                    coast of the Black Sea, from the Bosphorus to the Danube, no large stream
                    empties itself into the basin,—most of the drainage of Rumilia being carried off
                    by the River Maritza into the Aegean, whilst that of Bulgaria contributes to
                    swell the Danube.</p>
                <p>The greater part of the drainage area of the Black Sea, like that of the Baltic,
                    is covered with snow during the winter months, and comparatively little water is
                    then brought down by the rivers. With the return of spring, however, the melting
                    of the snow increases the volume of fresh water poured into the sea, its rivers
                    being at their highest in early summer. By far the larger part of this water is
                    discharged at its north-western border; and the elevation of level thus produced
                    establishes a current that sets along its western shore towards the outlet of
                    the Bosphorus. But as the narrowness of this channel does <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n815/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0815-0798"/> not allow it to give immediate passage to the
                    overflow, a portion of the current continues to pass onwards along the southern
                    shore, and, when more than usually strong, even completes the entire circuit of
                    the sea. There are no perceptible tides in this basin.</p>
                <p>As might be expected from the foregoing, the salinity of Black Sea water varies
                    (like that of the Baltic) at different periods of the year; but in consequence
                    of the much greater total mass of water contained in the deeper part of this
                    basin, the variation of its salinity is by no means so great as that of Baltic
                    waters,—the usual range of its sp. gr. being from about 1Ό12 to 1Ό14, which
                    corresponds to a little less or a little more than half the salinity of ordinary
                    sea-water.</p>
                <p>The most contradictory notions have prevailed as to the influence of the Euxine
                    waters on those of the Mediterranean,—some writers having represented the rivers
                    of the former as important contributors to the maintenance of the level of the
                    Mediterranean, which the enormous evaporation from that area is always tending
                    to reduce; whilst others assert that the Bosphorus and Dardanelles’ currents are
                    entirely due to the agency of wind. A valuable <hi rend="italic">datum</hi> is
                    afforded by the condition of the Caspian, in the closed basin of which,
                    contracted by a reduction of its level to 80 feet below that of the Black Sea,
                    an equality is now established between the amount of water lost by evaporation
                    and that which is restored by its rivers and by the rainfall on its own surface.
                    The areas of the Caspian and of the Euxine are not very different; and though
                    the axis of the former basin lies north and south, while that of the latter lies
                    east and west,—so that the northern portion of the Caspian is colder, and the
                    southern portion warmer, than the northern and southern portions of the Black
                    Sea,—the annual average temperatures, and consequently the total evaporation, of
                    the two areas cannot differ much. Now, the drainage area of the Volga is equal
                    to that of the Danube, the Dnieper, and the Dniester taken together; the Ural,
                    with the two Transcaucasian rivers, Kur and Araxes, may be considered as
                    equalling the Don; and thus the Bug and the rivers of the Caucasus and Asia
                    Minor may be regarded as furnishing the excess of water discharged into the
                    Black Sea above that which is received by the Caspian. Hence, as the whole of
                    the river and rain water annually discharged into the basin of the Caspian is
                    only sufficient to replace that which is lost by evaporation during the same
                    period, it follows that we may in like manner regard the principal rivers of the
                    Black Sea as only fulfilling the same function; consequently, if the Bosphorus
                    were closed, the water which they pour into the Euxine basin would not produce
                    any elevation of its level, being entirely dissipated by evaporation. Thus the
                    water which the Black Sea has to spare for the Mediterranean only represents the
                    <hi rend="italic">excess</hi> of its river supply above the total river supply
                    of the Caspian; and that this excess is small in amount appears from the fact
                    that the salinity of the water of the Aegean is not sensibly reduced by it below
                    that of the Mediterranean. But that there is some excess is evident from the
                    consideration that if the evaporation of the Black Sea were merely neutralized
                    by the return of fresh water, its water would have the salinity of that of the
                    great basin with which it is in free communication, instead of containing only
                    about half its proportion. It is further evident, on the other hand, that a
                    continual efflux of the half-salt water of the Black Sea, to be replaced only by
                    the fresh water discharged into its basin by rain and rivers, would in time
                    completely drain that basin of its salt; and as its proportion, though liable to
                    seasonal variation, undergoes no sensible diminution from year to year, it is
                    obvious that the salt which passes out must be replaced by a re-entry of Aegean
                    water. The mode in which this replacement is effected has keen recently
                    elucidated by a careful examination of the currents of the Black Sea straits, of
                    which an account will be presently given.</p>
                <p>It is during the winter months, when a large proportion of the drainage area of
                    the Black Sea rivers is covered with snow, that the supply of water is at its
                    minimum; but it is then that the evaporation from its surface is also at its
                    minimum; so that there is no reason to suppose that the level of the Black Sea
                    ever falls below that of the Aegean. There can be no reasonable doubt that
                    during the spring and early summer, when the melting of the snows causes the
                    rivers to swell to their highest, the quantity of fresh water thus brought into
                    the basin,' being greater than that which is lost by evaporation (as is shown by
                    the general reduction which then takes place in the salinity of its contents),
                    would cause a considerable rise of level, if this were not kept down by the
                    outflow through the straits.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Dardanelles</hi><hi rend="italic">and Bosphorus Currents.—</hi>
                    It has been known from very early times that a current, usually of considerable
                    strength, sets outwards through the Black Sea straits during a large part of the
                    year,—its rate being subject, however, to considerable variation in accordance
                    with the breadth of the channel, and also with the force and direction of the
                    wind. Thus, when the N.E. wind is of average strength, the rate of the cuιτent
                    at Gallipoli is about 1 knot per hour; whilst in the “Narrows” at Chanak Kaleski
                    it is about 3 knots, increasing with a strong wind to about 4£ knots. In calm
                    weather the out-current of the Dardanelles is usually slack; and if, as
                    sometimes happens even during the general prevalence of N.E. winds, the wind
                    should suddenly blow strongly from the S.W., the surface outflow may be entirely
                    checked. It requires a continuance of strong S.W. wind, however, to reverse its
                    direction; and its rate, when thus reversed, never equals that of the
                    out-current. The Bosphorus current has not been as carefully studied as that of
                    the Dardanelles; but its rate is greater, in accordance with the limitation of
                    its channel, which is scarcely wider at any point than the “Narrows” of the
                    Dardanelles. It continues to run, though at a reduced rate, when there is no
                    wind, and is not known to be ever reversed except in winter after a S.W. gale of
                    long duration. Even then it appears that the reversal is confined to the
                    superficial stratum,—the direction of the sub-surface water-weeds proving that
                    there is still an outflow from the Black Sea into the Aegean. Hence it cannot be
                    reasonably maintained that it is by this occasional and superficial reversal
                    that the immense mass of salt continually being carried outwards by the
                    Bosphorus and Dardanelles currents is restored to the Black Sea basin.</p>
                <p>The existence of an inward under-current (although controverted by an authority
                    of weight) has been clearly demonstrated by the recent experimental researches
                    of Captain Wharton, B.N., of H.M. surveying ship “Shearwater.” By the use of a
                    “current-drag,” so constructed and suspended as always to present a large
                    vertical surface, it was found that when the outward surface-current was at its
                    strongest there was an inward under-current sufficiently strong and rapid to
                    carry inwards the suspending buoy.</p>
                <p>The difference in specific gravity of water obtained from different depths was
                    found, in Captain Wharton’s investigations (as in those previously made by Dr
                    Carpenter, in conjunction with Captains Calver and Nares, in the Strait of
                    Gibraltar), to afford, under ordinary circumstances, a very sure indication of
                    the direction of the movement of each stratum,—the heavy water of the Aegean, as
                    a rule, flowing inwards, and the lighter water of the Black Sea flowing
                    outwards. And it was indicated alike by both modes of inquiry that the two
                    strata move in opposite directions, one over the other, with very little
                    intermixture <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n816/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0816-0799"/> or retardation,—the transition between tl⅛em
                    being usually very abrupt. The anomalies occasionally met with seemed due to the
                    prevalence of opposite winds at the two ends of the straits.</p>
                <p>Putting aside for the time the influence of wind, the double current of the Black
                    Sea straits may be accounted for as follows :—The excess of fresh water
                    discharged into the basin of the Black Sea is always tending to raise its level;
                    and this produces an outward surface-current, which as regularly tends to keep
                    it down. On the other hand, the reduced salinity of the Euxine column gives to
                    the Aegean column an excess of lateral pressure, which causes its lower stratum
                    to flow back into the Black Sea basin; and as the equality in the amount of salt
                    thus carried back by the under-current to that which escapes by the
                    surface-current is indicated by the maintenance of the standard salinity of
                    Black Sea water, it follows that, as the water which escapes contains about half
                    as much salt in equal measures as the water that enters, the volume of the
                    latter must be about half that of the former</p>
                <p>Now, when the rate of the surface-cιirrent is augmented by a N.E. wind, there
                    will be not only a more rapid lowering of the Black Sea level, but a tendency to
                    elevation at the Aegean end of the strait; and as this will augment the
                    difference between the downward, and therefore the lateral, pressures of the two
                    columns, the force and volume of the inward under-current will be augmented.
                    When, on the other hand, the S.W. direction of the wind reverses the
                    surface-current, it tends, by piling up the water at the N.E. end of the strait,
                    to augment the weight of the Black Sea column,—the excess of which
                    (notwithstanding its lower salinity) over that of the Aegean column, will then
                    produce a reversal of the under-current also. When the S.W. wind is moderate
                    enough to check the surface outflow without reversing it, the inward
                    under-current will likewise be brought to a stand; for a slight rise in the
                    level of the Black Sea column will cause its greater height to compensate for
                    the greater salinity of the Aegean column, so that their lateral pressures will
                    be equalized.—We have here a “pregnant instance” of the potency of slight
                    differences in level and in salinity to produce even rapid movements of
                    considerable bodies of water; and a strong confirmation is thus afforded by
                    direct observation to the doctrine that differences in density produced by
                    temperature are adequate to give rise to still larger, though slower, movements
                    of the same kind in the great ocean basins.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Zoology.—</hi> The basin of the Black Sea is frequented by
                    seals, dolphins, and porpoises; and it is said that in the neighbourhood of the
                    mouths of the Danube the porpoise is perfectly white, so that the Greek
                    mariners, when they catch sight of it, know that they are in the current of that
                    river, although in 30 fathoms water, and many leagues from land. The fish of the
                    Black Sea appear to be for the most part the same as those of the Caspian and
                    the Sea of Arab Its northern rivers bring into it the sturgeon, sterlet, and
                    other fresh-water fish, which can live in and near their estuaries. On the other
                    hand, its waters are elsewhere salt enough for the mackerel, whiting, mullet,
                    turbot, and sole. The <hi rend="italic">pelamys</hi> spoken of by Strabo as

                    the herring, it seems to be a large sprat. The principal fish that enters this
                    basin from the Mediterranean is the tunny, which comes into the Black Sea in
                    large numbers at the spawning season, The other inhabitants of the Black Sea
                    have not been especially studied; but it may be noted that a species of <hi
