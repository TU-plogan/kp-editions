                    rend="smallcaps">Charles,</hi> K.H., the youngest son of the Rev. William Bell,
                    a clergyman of the Episcopal Church of Scotland, was born at Edinburgh, November
                    1774. His mother. Margaret Morice, the elder daughter of an Episcopal clergyman,
                    was remarkable for her piety and general accomplishments, and she exercised a
                    powerful influence over her gifted sons. The father, William Bell, after a life
                    of contending with difficulties, died on 20th of September 1779, aged
                    seventy-five, leaving his wife and six children very slenderly provided for. Of
                    these six children, three became distinguished men, namely, John Bell, the
                    anatomist and surgeon; George Joseph Bell, professor of the law of Scotland in
                    the University of Edinburgh; and Charles Bell, the subject of this notice. After
                    having studied two years at the High School and two years more at the University
                    of Edinburgh, Charles embraced the profession of medicine and devoted himself
                    chiefly to the study of anatomy, under the direction of his brother John, who
                    was twelve years older, and who had already earned a reputation as an anatomist
                    and surgeon. Regarding his early education, he wrote, in 1839, on a copy of
                    Pettigrew’s <hi rend="italic">Medical Portrait Gallery,</hi> opposite a remark
                    that he had been educated at the High School,—“Nonsense! I received no education
                    but from my mother, neither reading, writing, ciphering, nor anything else.” At
                    school and college he does not appear to have distinguished himself, except by
                    his facility in drawing, a hereditary gift acquired from his mother. It was not
                    until he entered on the study of anatomy that he gave evidence of possessing
                    those talents which soon made him a worthy rival of his brother John.</p>
                <p>His first work, entitled <hi rend="italic">A System of Dissections, explaining
                    the Anatomy of the Human Body, the manner of displaying the Parts, and their
                    Varieties in Disease,</hi> was published in Edinburgh in 1798, while the author
                    was still a pupil. The “Introduction” to this work shows much originality of
                    thought, and an aptitude for devising new methods of preparing animal structures
                    for dissection and demonstration. The volume is illustrated by numerous
                    engravings from original drawings, and the text is clear and precise in
                    language. For many years this work was considered to be a valuable guide to the
                    student of practical anatomy.</p>
                <p>On the 1st of August 1799 he became a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of
                    Edinburgh. At that time the fellows of the college were in rotation surgeons to
                    the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. In this position Bell soon gave evidence of
                    great ability. He dissected, drew, described, mounted preparations of
                    anatomical, physiological, or pathological value, improved on the modes of
                    operating in surgery known at that time, and invented a method of making models
                    of morbid parts, of which specimens may still be seen in the museum of the
                    college.</p>
                <p>In 1802 he published a series of engravings of original drawings, showing the
                    anatomy of the brain and nervous system. These drawings are remarkable for
                    artistic skill and finish. They were taken from dissections made by Bell for the
                    lectures or demonstrations he gave on the nervous system as part of the course
                    of anatomical instruction of his brother. In 1804 he wrote volume iii. of <hi
                    rend="italic">The Anatomy of the Human Body,</hi> by John and Charles Bell. This
                    volume contains the anatomy of the nervous system, and of the organs of special
                    sense.</p>
                <p>In 1804 a new arrangement was made regarding the attendance of surgeons at the
                    Edinburgh Infirmary; and Bell, probably as being junior in the profession, was
                    excluded from the hospital. He proposed to the managers to pay £100 a year, and
                    to transferto them, for the use of the students, the museum he had collected, on
                    condition that he should be “allowed to stand by the bodies when dissected in
                    the theatre of the infirmary, and to make notes and drawings of the diseased
                    appearances.” This enthusiastic proposal was rejected, and the consequence was
                    that Bell went to London in November 1804,</p>
                <p>From that date, for nearly forty years, he kept up a regular correspondence with
                    his brother George, much of which has recently been published <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Letters of Sir Charles Bell, dcc.,</hi> 1870). The earlier letters of this
                    correspondence show how rapidly he rose to distinction in a field where success
                    was difficult, as it was already occupied by such men as Abernethy, Sir Astley
                    Cooper, and Cline. He quickly made acquaintance with most of the scientific men
                    of the day, and apparently won friends in the highest social, professional, and
                    artistic circles. After having lodged in Fludyer Street for some months, he
                    settled in Leicester Street, Leicester Square, and immediately commenced a
                    course of lectures on anatomy and surgery. Here he also located his museum,
                    which was sent to him from Edinburgh; and his letters indicate that this was the
                    subject of much interest to scientific and professional men. He lectured to
                    painters, directed private dissections, gave demonstrations to surgeons, and
                    gradually acquired a surgical practice.</p>
                <p>Before leaving Edinburgh in 1804, he had written his work on the <hi
                    rend="italic">Anatomy of Expression.</hi> It was published in London soon after
                    his arrival, and at once attracted attention. His practical knowledge of anatomy
                    and his skill as an artist qualified him in an exceptional manner for such a
                    work. The object of this treatise was to describe the arrangements by which the
                    influence of the mind was propagated to the muscular frame, and to give a
                    rational explanation of the muscular movements which usually accompany the
                    various emotions and passions. One special feature of the author’s system was
                    the importance attributed to the respiratory arrangements as a source of
                    expression. He also showed how the physician and surgeon might derive
                    information regarding the nature and extent of important diseases by observing
                    the expression of bodily suffering. This work, apart from its value to artists
                    and psychologists, is of interest historically, as there is no doubt the
                    investigations of the author into the nervous supply of the muscles of
                    expression induced him to prosecute inquiries which led to <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0556-0541"/> his great discoveries in the physiology of the
                    nervous system.</p>
                <p>In 1807 Bell first published his idea of a new anatomy of the brain, in which he
                    announced the discovery of the different functions of the nerves corresponding
                    with their relations to different parts of the brain. It is now difficult to
                    imagine the confusion which prevailed in the minds of anatomists and
                    physiologists regarding the functions of the various nerves prior to this
                    discovery. The nerves had been noticed by anatomists from the earliest times,
                    and they were divided into cranial and spinal nerves, according as they
                    originated from the brain or spinal cord. Some were supposed to carry from the
                    brain the mandates of the will, while others communicated to the sensorium
                    impressions made on their extremities, which resulted in consciousness. It was
                    supposed, however, that the same nerve, even at the same time, might in some
                    mysterious way transmit either motor or sensory impressions in opposite
                    directions. When a nerve was cut, the parts beyond the incision were found to be
                    destitute of sensibility, and to be beyond the influence of the will. It was
                    consequently correctly inferred to be the cord through which volition acted on
                    the muscles, and through which sensory impressions were transmitted to the
                    sensorium. The idea of two sets of filaments functionally different in the same
                    nerve was not then entertained. Boerhaave asserted that there were two kinds of
                    spinal nerves, the one serving for motion and the other for the use of the
                    senses. Haller states, “I know not a nerve which has sensation without also
                    producing motion.” The first Monro held a similar opinion, and he believed all
                    those spinal nerves which passed through a ganglion to be motor nerves.</p>
                <p>To Sir Charles Bell we owe the discovery that in the nervous trunks there are
                    special sensory filaments, the office of which is to transmit impressions from
                    the periphery of the body to the sensorium, and special motor filaments which
                    convey motor impressions from the brain or other nerve centre to the muscles. He
                    also showed that some nerves consist entirely of sensory filaments and are
                    therefore sensory nerves, that others are composed of motor filaments and are
                    therefore motor nerves, whilst a third variety contain both kinds of filaments
                    and are therefore to be regarded as sensory-motor. Furthermore, he indicated
                    that the brain and spinal cord may be divided into separate parts, each part
                    having a special function—one part ministering to motion, the other to
                    sensation, and that the origin of the nerves from one or other or both of those
                    sources endows them with the peculiar property of the division whence they
                    spring. He also demonstrated that no motor nerve ever passes through a ganglion.
                    Lastly, he showed both from theoretical considerations and from the result of
                    actual experiment on the living animal, that the anterior roots of the spinal
                    nerves are <hi rend="italic">motor,</hi> while the posterior are <hi
                    rend="italic">sensory.</hi> These discoveries as a whole must be regarded as the
                    greatest in physiology since that of the circulation of the blood by the
                    illustrious Harvey. It not only was a distinct and definite advance in
                    scientific knowledge, but from it flowed many practical results of much
                    importance in the diagnosis and treatment of disease. It is not surprising that
                    Bell should have announced it to his friends with exultation. On 26th November
                    1807 we find him writing as follows to his brother George :—“I have done a more
                    interesting <hi rend="italic">nova anatomia cerebri</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >humani</hi> than it is possible to conceive. I lectured it yesterday. I
                    prosecuted it last night till one o’clock; and I am sure it will be well
                    received.” On the 31st of the same month he writes—“I really think this new
                    anatomy of the brain will strike more than the discovery of the lymphatics being
                    absorbents.”</p>
                <p>In 1807 he produced a <hi rend="italic">System of Comparative Surgery</hi>
                    founded on the basis of anatomy. This work indicates the author’s idea of the
                    science of surgery. He regarded it almost wholly from an anatomical and
                    operative point of view, and there is little or no mention of the use of
                    medicinal substances. It placed him, however, in the highest rank of English
                    writers on surgery.</p>
                <p>In 1809 he relinquished his professional work in London, and rendered meritorious
                    services to the wounded from Coruna, who were brought to the Haslar Hospital at
                    Portsmouth. In 1810 he published a series of <hi rend="italic">Letters
                    concerning the Diseases of the Urethra,</hi> in which he treated of stricture
                    from an anatomical and pathological point of view.</p>
                <p>In 1812 he was appointed surgeon to the Middlesex Hospital, and a few years
                    afterwards professor of anatomy, physiology, and surgery to the College of
                    Surgeons of London. He was also for many years teacher of anatomy in the school
                    of Great Windmill Street, no longer in existence. He acted as surgeon to the
                    hospital for twenty-four years, and delivered many courses of lectures on
                    surgery in that institution. In 1815 he did good public service by devoting all
                    his skill and time to the wounded after the battle of Waterloo. On the formation
                    of University College, Gower Street, he was asked to place himself at the head
                    of the medical department. This appointment he held for only a short time, when
                    he resigned in consequence, it is said, of dissensions in the senate.</p>
                <p>In 1816, 1817, 1818, he published a series of <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Reports
                    of Cases in Surgery, treated in the Middlesex Hospital, in the Cancer
                    Establishment, and in Private Practice, embracing an Account of the Anatomical
                    and Pathological Researches in the School of Windmill Street.</hi> In 1821 he
                    issued a volume of coloured plates with descriptive letterpress, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Illustrations of the Great Operations of Surgery, Trepan, Hernia,
                    Amputation, and Lithotomy.</hi> In 1824 appeared <hi rend="italic">An Exposition
                    of the Natural System of Nerves of the Human Body; being a Republication of the
                    Papers delivered to the Royal Society on the subject of the Nerves.</hi> In the
                    same year he wrote <hi rend="italic">Observations on Injuries of the Spine and
                    of the Thigh Bone.</hi> In 1832 he wrote a paper for the Royal Society of London
                    on the “Organs of the Human Voice,” in which he gave many illustrations of the
                    physiological action of these parts.</p>
                <p>Of an eminently pious and reflective mind, he was often in the habit of pointing
                    out in his lectures what he regarded as evidences of creative design to be found
                    in the anatomy of the bodies of animals. These he embodied in a treatise on <hi
                    rend="italic">Animal Mechanics,</hi> written for the Society for the Diffusion
                    of Useful Knowledge. The executors of the earl of Bridgewater selected him as a
                    fit person to maintain the argument which it was the purpose of that nobleman’s
                    bequest to have published. Sir Charles wrote in 1833— <hi rend="italic">The
                    Hand: its Mechanism and Vital Endowments as evincing Design.</hi> Along with
                    Lord Brougham he annotated and illustrated an edition of Paley’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Natural Theology,</hi> published in 1836, in which he followed out
                    his favourite line of thought.</p>
                <p>The Royal Society of London awarded to him in 182√ the first annual medal of that
                    year given by George IV. for discoveries in science; and when William IV.
                    ascended the throne, Charles Bell received the honour of knighthood along with a
                    few other men distinguished in science and literature.</p>
                <p>The chair of surgery in the University of Edinburgh was offered to him in 1836.
                    When the offer was made he was regarded as one of the foremost scientific men in
                    London, and he had a large surgical practice. But his opinion was “London is a
                    place to live in, but not to die in ;” and he accepted the appointment. In
                    Edinburgh he did not earn great local professional success; and, it must be
                    confessed, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n557/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0557-0542"/> he was not appreciated as he deserved. But honou≡
                    came thick upon him. On the Continent he was spoken of as greater than Harvey.
                    It is narrated that one day Roux, a celebrated French physiologist, dismissed
                    his class without a lecture, saying “C’est assez, Messieurs, vous avez vu
                    Charles Bell.” He held the Edinburgh chair from 1836 to 1842. During his
                    professorship, in 1838, he published the <hi rend="italic">Institutes of
                    Surgery, arranged in the order of the Lectures delivered in the University of
                    Edinburgh;</hi> and in 1841 he wrote a volume of <hi rend="italic">Practical
                    Essays,</hi> two of which “On Squinting,” and “On the Action of Purgatives,” are
                    of great value.</p>
                <p>Sir Charles Bell died at Hallow Park near Worcester on Thursday, 28th April 1842,
                    in his sixty-eighth year; and he lies under the yew tree in the peaceful
                    churchyard of Hallow. His epitaph, written by his life-long friend Lord Jeffrey,
                    summarizes his character as follows :—“Sacred to the memory of Sir Charles Bell,
                    who, after unfolding, with unrivalled sagacity, patience, and success, the
                    wonderful structure of our mortal bodies, esteemed lightly of his greatest
                    discoveries, except only as they tended to impress himself and others with a
                    deeper sense of the infinite wisdom and ineffable goodness of the Almighty
                    Creator. He was born at Edinburgh 1774; died, while on a visit of friendship, at
                    Hallow park, in this parish, 1842; and lies buried in the adjoining churchyard.”
