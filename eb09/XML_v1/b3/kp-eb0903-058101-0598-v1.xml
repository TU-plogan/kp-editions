                <p><label type="entry">BENZOIN, <hi rend="smallcaps">Gum</hi></label>, sometimes
                    called <hi rend="smallcaps">Gum Benjamin,</hi> a fragrant gum-resin obtained
                    from <hi rend="italic">Styrax</hi><hi rend="italic">Benzoin,</hi> a tree of
                    considerable size, a native of Sumatra and Java, and introduced into Siam,
                    Borneo, Ac. The gum-resin is obtained by making incisions in the bark of trees
                    after they have attained six years of age, when the benzoin exudes, and after
                    hardening in the air is carefully scraped off with a knife. A tree produces on
                    an average about 3 ft) annually for 10 or 12 years. The produce of the first
                    three years is known as “head” benzoin, and is esteemed the finest and most
                    valuable; that produced in later years goes by the name of “belly” benzoin; and
                    after the trees are cut down a small quantity of a dark-coloured and very
                    inferior quality is obtained, which is called “foot” benzoin. In commerce the
                    gum-resin is distinguished as Siam or Sumatra benzoin, according to the
                    localities from which it is derived. Siam benzoin is generally regarded as the
                    best, and of it two varieties are distinguished. The finest quality is Siam
                    benzoin “in tear,” it being in small flattened drops, from the size of an almond
                    kernel downwards. “Lump” Siam benzoin consists of agglutinated masses of such
                    tears, or of tears imbedded in a darker coloured resinous matrix. Tear benzoin
                    varies in colour from a pale yellow to a reddish-brown colour, and lump benzoin
                    has a conglomerate-like structure from the dissemination of almond-shaped tears
                    throughout the substance. Sumatra benzoin has neither so strong nor so agreeable
                    an odour as that of Siam, but the finest qualities are not found in the English
                    market, being bought up for use in the religious rites of the Greek Church in
                    Russia. Sumatra benzoin occurs in larger rectangular masses of a greyish tint,
                    with few large tears in it, but containing small white opaque pieces, with chips
                    of wood and other impurities, in a translucent matrix. Benzoin is composed of a
                    mixture of three resins, distinguished by their behaviour towards solvents, and
                    of benzoic acid, with sometimes cinnamic acid in addition; in some specimens of
                    Sumatra benzoin cinnamic acid has been found entirely replacing benzoic acid.
                    Usually benzoin contains from 12 to 18 per cent, of benzoic acid, the opaque
                    white portions containing less than the brown resinous substance. It also
                    contains traces of a highly odorous essential oil, like styrol, the aromatic oil
                    present in storax. The quantity of benzoin exported from Sumatra in 1871 was
                    about 16,000 cwt., while Siam sent out only 405 cwt., but very great quantities
                    are used as incense in the religious ceremonies of the East, which indeed is the
                    principal object for which it is brought into the commerce of Western nations.
                    In medicine benzoin is seldom administered except as an adjunct to pectoral
                    medicines. A compound tincture of benzoin is applied to flabby ulcers, and to
                    excised wounds after the edges have been brought together. In these connections
                    benzoin has a popular reputation under the name of Friars’ or Monks’ Balsam,
                    which is a compound tincture of benzoin, and it forms an ingredient in court or
                    black sticking-plaster. Benzoin diminishes the tendency towards rancidity in
                    fats, a circumstance turned to account in the <hi rend="italic">Adeps</hi><hi
