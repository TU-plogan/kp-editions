                    Marquis</hi></label>, a celebrated writer on the principles of jurisprudence and
                    national economy, was born at Milan in the year 1735. He was educated in the
                    Jesuit College at Parma, and showed at first a great fondness and aptitude for
                    mathematics. The study of Montesquieu seems to have directed his attention
                    towards economical questions; and his first publication (in 1762) was a tract on
                    the derangement of the currency in the Milanese states, with a proposal for its
                    remedy. Shortly after, in conjunction with his friends the Verris, he formed a
                    literary society, and began to publish a small journal, in imitation of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Spectator,</hi> called <hi rend="italic">II</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Caffé.</hi> In 1764 Beccaria published his brief but justly celebrated treatise
                    <hi rend="italic">Dei Delitti e delie Pene</hi> (“On Crimes and Punishments ”).
                    The weighty reasonings of this work were expounded with all the additional force
                    of a clear and animated style. It pointed out distinctly and temperately the
                    grounds of the right of punishment, and from these principles deduced certain
                    propositions as to the nature and amount of punishment which should be inflicted
                    for any crime. The book had a surprising success. Within eighteen months it
                    passed through six editions. It was translated into French by Morellet in 1766,
                    and published with an anonymous commentary by Voltaire. An English translation
                    appeared in 1768, and other countries followed the example. Many of the reforms
                    in the penal codes of the principal European nations are traceable to Beccaria’s
                    treatise. In November 1768 the marquis was appointed to the chair of public law
                    and economy, which had been founded expressly for him at the Palatine College of
                    Milan. His lectures on political economy, which are based on strict utilitarian
                    principles, are in marked accordance with the theories of the English school of
                    economists. They are published in the collection of Italian writers on political
                    economy <hi rend="italic">(Scrittori</hi><hi rend="italic">Classici</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Italiani,</hi> vols. xi. and xii.) In 1771 Beccaria was made a
                    member of the supreme economic council; and in 1791 he was appointed one of the
                    board for the reform of the judicial code. In this post his labours were of very
