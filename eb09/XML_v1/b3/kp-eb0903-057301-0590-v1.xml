                <p><label type="entry">BENJAMIN</label> (ΓP*}2, Sept. Bενιαμίν), the youngest son of
                    the patriarch Jacob, by Rachel. His mother, dying in childbed, gave him the name
                    Benoni, “Son of my pain,” which was changed by his father to Benjamin, meaning
                    probably “Son of the right hand,” that is, “Son of prosperity” (Gen. XXXV.
                    16-18). Of his personal history little is recorded. He was the favourite of his
                    father and brothers, and seems to have been of an amiable though somewhat weak
                    character. In this respect he strikingly contrasts with the tribe, whose history
                    was foretold in the dying prophecy of Jacob, “Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf”
                    (Gen. xlix. 27). The tribe of Benjamin, though the least numerous of Israel,
                    became nevertheless a considerable race. In the desert it counted 35,400
                    warriors (Num. i. 37), and at the entrance of Israel into Canaan even as many as
                    45,600 (Num. xxvi. 41). The portion allotted to this tribe was encompassed by
                    the districts of Ephraim, Dan, and Judah. In the time of the judges the tribe of
                    Benjamin became involved in a civil war with the other eleven tribes, which
                    terminated in its almost utter extinction, -600 men alone escaping (Judges xix.,
                    xx.) The tribe speedily revived, however; in the time of David it numbered
                    59,434 able warriors, and in that of Asa, 280,000. This tribe had the honour of
                    giving the first king to the Jews, Saul being a Benjamite. After the death of
                    Saul, the Benjamites declared themselves for his son Ishbosheth, until, after
                    the assassination of that prince, David became king of all Israel. David having
                    expelled the Jebusites from Zion, and made it his own residence, the close
                    alliance that previously existed between the tribes of Benjamin and Judah was
                    cemented by the circumstance that, while Jerusalem belonged to the district of
                    Benjamin, that of Judah was immediately contiguous to it. At the division of the
                    kingdom after the death of Solomon, Benjamin espoused the cause of Judah, and
                    they formed a kingdom by themselves. Indeed, the two tribes stood always in such

                <p>&gt; BENJAMIN, of Tudela, in Navarre, a celebrated Jewish rabbi of the 12th
                    century, whose <hi rend="italic">Itinerary</hi> is a literary curiosity. He
                    visited Constantinople, Egypt, Assyria, and Persia, penetrating to the frontiers
                    of China. He was credulous, but his work contains some curious notices of the
                    countries he visited. It was translated from the Hebrew into Latin by Arias
                    Montanus in 1575, and appeared in a French version by Baratier in 1734, and
                    again in 1830. The latest English translation is that by Asher, 1840.</p>
