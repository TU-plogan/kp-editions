                <p><label type="entry">BARCLAY, <hi rend="smallcaps">William</hi></label>, LL.D., a
                    writer on civil law, was born in Aberdeenshire in the year 1541. He spent the
                    early part of his life, and much of his fortune, at the court of Mary queen of
                    Scots, from whose favour he had reason to expect preferment. In 1573 he went
                    over to Prance, and at Bourges began to study civil law under the famous Cuja3.
                    He continued some years in that seminary, where he took his doctor’s degree; and
                    was soon after appointed professor of civil law in the university of
                    Pont-à-Mousson, recently founded by the duke of Lorraine. The prince afterwards
                    made him counsellor of state and master of requests. In the year 1581 Barclay
                    married Anne de Malleville, a French lady. Their son was the celebrated John
                    Barclay, author of the <hi rend="italic">Ärgernis.</hi> This youth the Jesuits
                    would gladly have received into their society; but his father refused his
                    consent, and thereby incurred their bitter enmity. He was compelled to leave
                    France, and returned to Britain, where King James offered him a considerable
                    preferment, provided he would become a member of the Church of England. He would
                    not accept the post on this condition, and went back again to France in 160 L
                    Soon after his arrival he was appointed first professor of the civil law in the
                    University of Angers, where he died the year following, and was buried in the
                    Franciscan church. Barclay was a man of considerable ability, and his legal
                    writings are still valued. In his political opinions he was directly opposed to
                    his illustrious countryman Buchanan, and was a strenuous defender of the rights
                    of kings; his own speculations on the principles of government are best known to
                    some from an incidental confutation by Locke, in his <hi rend="italic">Treatises
                    on Government.</hi> His most important writings w ere :—</p>
