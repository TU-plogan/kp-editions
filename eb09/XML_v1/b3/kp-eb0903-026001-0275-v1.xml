                    of India, situated between 21° and 23° N. lat. and 80° and</p>
                <p>8I <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi> E. long.; bounded on the N. by the district of
                    Mandlâ; on the E. by the district of Chhattisgarh; on the S. by Chhattisgarh and
                    Bhandârâ; and on the W. by the district of Seoni. Bâlâghât forms the eastern
                    portion of the central plateau which divides the province from east to west.
                    These highlands, formerly known as the Râigarh Bichhiâ tract, remained desolate
                    and neglected until 1866, when the district of Bâlâghât was formed, and the
                    country opened to the industrious and enterprising peasantry of the Waingangâ
                    valley. Geographically the district is divided into three distinct parts (1.)
                    The southern lowlands, a slightly undulating plain, comparatively well
                    cultivated, and drained by the Waingangâ, Bâgh, Deo, Ghisri, and Son rivers.
                    (2.) The long narrow valley, known as the Mau Tâlukâ, lying between the hills
                    and the Waingangâ river, and comprising a long, narrow, irregular-shaped lowland
                    tract, intersected by hill ranges and peaks covered with dense jungle, and
                    running generally from north to south. (3.) The lofty plateau, in which is
                    situated the Râigârh Bichhiâ tract, comprising irregular ranges of hills, broken
                    into numerous valleys, and generally running from east to west. The highest
                    points in the hills of the district are as follows :—Peaks above Lânjf, 2300 or
                    2500 feet; Tepâgarh hill, about 2600 feet; and Bhainsâghât range, about 3000
                    feet above the sea. The principal rivers in the district are the Waingangâ, and
                    its tributaries, the Bâgh, Nahrâ, and Uskâl; a few smaller streams, such as the
                    Masmâr, the Mâhkârâ, &amp;c.; and the Banjâr, Hâlon, and Jamuniâ, tributaries of
                    the Narbadâ, which drain a portion of the upper plateau. Bâlâghât contains very
                    extensive forests, but they do not produce timber of any great value. They teem
                    with wild animals, from the great bison to the fox; 470 beasts and venomous
                    snakes were killed in 1867-68, a total reward of XI56 being paid under this
                    head. The district contained in 1868 an assessed area of 1462Ό8 square miles or
                    935,731 acres, of which 214,587 acres were under cultivation; 488,510 grazing
                    lands; 116,938 culturable, but not actually under cultivation; 115,696
                    unculturable waste. The census report of 1872 returned the area at 2608 square
                    miles. The census of 1866 showed a population of 170,964. This had in 1872
                    increased to 195,008, residing in 37,192 houses and 781 villages; average number
                    of persons per square mile, 74*77; per village, 249’69; per house, 5 <hi

                    Mahometans; 39 Buddhists; 11 Christians; 60,848 or 31 ’ 20 percent, of
                    unspecified religions of aboriginal or imperfectly Hinduised types.</p>
                <p>Since 1867 considerable encouragement has been given to the cultivating tribes of
                    Ponwârs, Kunbis, Marârs, &amp;c., of the low country to immigrate, and take up
                    lands in the upland tracts. By this means a large quantity of jungle lands has
                    lately come under cultivation. The acreage under the principal crops grown in
                    the district is returned as follows :—rice, 188,312 acres; wheat, 585; other
                    food grains, 8770; oil-seeds, 3436; sugar, 505; fibres, 100; tobacco, 638;
                    total, 202,346 acres. Iron is smelted by the Gonds; gold exists in the beds of
                    some of the rivers, but not in sufficient quantities to repay the labour of
                    washing. There are no regularly made roads in the district. Five passes lead
                    from the low country to the highlands, viz., the Bânpur Ghât, the Warai Ghât,
                    the Pancherâ Ghât, the Bhondwâ Ghât, and the Ahmadpur Ghât. For revenue purposes
                    the district is divided into two subdivisions, the Bùrhâ Tahsil and the
                    Paraswârâ Tahsfl. In 1868-69 the total revenue of the Bâlâghât district amounted
                    to £11,746, of which £6754, or 57 per cent., was from land. For the protection
                    of person and property, Government maintained, in 1868, 115 policemen, at a
                    total cost of £1156, 16s. In 1868 only two towns in the district<pb break="no"

                    population, 2608, and Lanjí, population, 2116. About 60 years ago the upper part
                    of the district was an impenetrable waste. About that time one Lachhman Náik
                    established the first villages on the Paraswárá plateau, on which there are
                    about 30 flourishing settlements. But a handsome Buddhist temple of cut stone,
                    belonging to some remote period, is suggestive of a civilization which had
                    disappeared before historic times.</p>
