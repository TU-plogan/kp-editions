                <p><label type="entry">BAPTISTS</label>, a denomination of Christians,
                    distinguished, as their name imports, from other denominations by the views they
                    hold respecting the ordinance of baptism.</p>
                <p>The early history of the Baptists, both in this country and on the Continent, is
                    very obscure. In the great awakening of religious thought' and feeling which
                    characterized the beginning of the 16th century, it was inevitable that amongst
                    those who burst the fetters which bound them to the see of Rome some should be
                    willing to retain as much of the ancient doctrine and practice as they could
                    with a safe conscience, whilst others, rejoicing in their newfound liberty,
                    would desire to cast aside every remnant of what they regarded as superstition,
                    and to advance as far as possible in the path of what they deemed Christian
                    liberty; nor is it at all to be wondered at that strange and wild theories on
                    matters even remotely connected with religion should spring into life. But
                    amidst all the diversities of opinion that existed, it was constantly held by
                    Protestants that “holy Scripture containeth all things necessary to salvation,
                    so that whatsoever is neither read therein nor may be proved thereby, although
                    it be sometime received of the faithful as godly and profitable for an order and
                    comeliness, yet no man ought to be constrained to believe it as an article of
                    faith or repute it requisite to the necessity of salvation” (Articles of King
                    Edward VI.) We must not be surprised that the right of private judgment, which
                    is involved in the principle thus broadly laid down, was nevertheless far from
                    being conceded to the extent that was desired by those who departed farthest
                    from the Church of Rome. In fact, each separate section of Protestants claimed
                    for itself to stand on the ground of holy Scripture, and was prepared to resist
                    alike the tyranny of Rome and what it considered the licence of other bodies of
                    Protestants. Thus it happened that the Baptists, or as their opponents called
                    them, the Anabaptists (or, as Zwingli names them, Catabaptists), were
                    strenuously opposed by all other sections of the Christian Church, and it was
                    regarded by almost all the early reformers to be the duty of the civil
                    magistrate to punish them with fine and imprisonment, and even with death. There
                    was, no doubt, some justification for this severity in the fact that the
                    fanaticism which burst forth in the early times of the Reformation frequently
                    led to insurrection and revolt, and in particular that the leader of the
                    “peasant war” in Saxony, Thomas Münzer, and probably many of his followers, were
                    “Anabaptists.” One result of this severity is, that; the records of the early
                    history of the Anabaptists both on the Continent and in this country are very
                    few and meagre. Almost all that is currently known of them comes to us from
                    their opponents. There is, however, much valuable information, together with
                    detailed accounts of their sufferings, in the Dutch Martyrology of Van Braght,
                    himself a Baptist, which bears the title <hi rend="italic">Martelaers
                    Spiegel</hi><hi rend="italic">der</hi><hi rend="italic">Doops-gesinde</hi> (2d
                    ed. fol., 1685), an English translation of the latter half of which was
                    published in 2 vols. 8vo, Lond. 1850—53, edited by Dr Underhill, now secretary
                    of the Baptist Missionary Society. Probably the earliest confession of faith of
                    any Baptist community is that given by Zwingli in the second part of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Elenchus</hi><hi rend="italic">contra Catabap&gt;tistas,</hi>
                    published in 1527. Zwingli professes to give it entire, translating it, as he
                    says, <hi rend="italic">ad verbum</hi> into Latin. He upbraids his opponents
                    with not having published these articles, but declares that there is scarcely
                    any one of them that has not a written <hi rend="italic">(descriptum)</hi> copy
                    of these laws which have been so well concealed. The articles are in all seven.
                    The first, which we give in full, relates to baptism :—</p>
                <p>“Baptism ought to be given to all who have been taught repentance and change of
                    life, and who in truth believe that through Christ their sins are blotted out
                    <hi rend="italic">(abolita),</hi> and the sins of all who are willing <hi
                    rend="italic">(volunt)</hi> to walk in the resurrection of Jesus Christ, and who
                    are willing to be buried with him into death, that they may rise again with him.
                    To all, therefore, who in this manner seek baptism, and of themselves ask us, we
                    will give it. By this rule are excluded all baptisms of infants, the great
                    abomination of the Roman pontiff. For this article we have the testimony and
                    strength of Scripture, we have also the practice of the apostles; which things
                    we simply and also stedfastly will observe, for we are assured of them.'’</p>
                <p>The second article relates to withdrawment <hi rend="italic">(abstentio)</hi> or
                    excommunication, and declares that all who have given themselves to the Lord and
                    have been baptized into the one body of Christ should, if they lapse or fall
                    into sin, be excommunicated. The third article relates to the breaking of bread;
                    in this it is declared that they who break the one bread in commemoration of the
                    broken body of Christ, and drink of the one cup in commemoration of His blood
                    poured out, must first be united together into the one body of Christ, that is,
                    into the church of God. The fourth article asserts the duty of separation from
                    the world and its abominations, amongst which are included all papistical and
                    semi-papistical works. The fifth relates to pastors of the church. They assert
                    that the pastor should be some one of the flock who has a good report from those
                    who are without. “His office is to read, admonish, teach, learn, exhort,
                    correct, or excommunicate in the church, and to preside well over all the
                    brethren and sisters both in prayer and in the breaking of bread; and in all
                    things that relate to the body of Christ, to watch that it may be established
                    and increased so that the name of God may by us be glorified and praised, and
                    that the mouth of blasphemers may be stopped.” The sixth article relates to the
                    power of the sword. “The sword,” they say, “is the ordinance of God outside the
                    perfection of Christ, by which the bad is punished and slain and the good is
                    defended.” They further declare that a Christian ought not to decide or give
                    sentence in secular matters, and that he ought not to exercise the office of
                    magistrate. The seventh article relates to oaths, which they declare are
                    forbidden by Christ.</p>
                <p>However much we may differ from the points maintained in these articles, we
                    cannot but be astonished at the vehemence with which they w ere opposed, and the
                    epithets of abuse which were heaped upon the unfortunate sect that maintained
                    them. Zwingli, through whom they come down to us, and who gives them, as he
                    says, that the world may see that they are “fanatical, stolid, audacious,
                    impious,” can scarcely be acquitted of unfairness in joining together tw o of
                    them,—the fourth and fifth,—thus making the article treat “of the avoiding of
                    abominable pastors in' the church” <hi rend="italic">(Super</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">devitatione abominabilium pastorum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >in</hi><hi rend="italic">Ecclesia),</hi> though there is nothing about pastors
                    in the fourth article, and nothing about abominations in the fifth, and though
                    in a marginal note he himself explains that the first tw o copies that were sent
                    him read as he does, but the other copies make two articles, as in fact they
                    evidently are. To us at the present day it appears not merely strange but
                    shocking, that the Protestant Council of Zürich, which had scarcely won its own
                    liberty, and was still in dread of the persecution of the Romanists, should pass
                    a decree <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n369/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0369-0354"/> ordering, as Zwingli himself reports, that any
                    person who administered anabaptism should be drowned; and still more shocking
                    that, at the time when Zwingli wrote, this cruel decree should have been carried
                    into effect against one of the leaders of the Anabaptists, Felix Mantz, who had
                    himself been associated with Zwingli, not only as a student, but also at the
                    commencement of the work of Reformation. No doubt the wild fanaticism of some of
                    the opponents of infant baptism seemed to the Reformers to justify their
                    severity. In 1537 Menno Simonis joined himself to the Anabaptists and became
                    their leader. His moderation and piety, according to Mosheim, held in check the
                    turbulence of the more fanatical amongst them. He died in 1561, after a life
                    passed amidst continual dangers and conflicts. His name remains as the
                    designation of the Mennonites, who eventually settled in the Netherlands under
                    the protection of William the Silent, Prince of Orange.</p>
                <p>Of the introduction of Baptist views into England we have no certain knowledge.
                    Fox relates that “the registers of London make mention of certain Dutchmen
                    counted for Anabaptists, of whom ten were put to death in sundry places in the
                    realm, <hi rend="italic">anno</hi> 1535; other ten repented and λvere saved.” In
                    1536 King Henry VIII., as “in earth supreme head of the Church of England,”
                    issued a proclamation together with articles concerning faith agreed upon by
                    Convocation, in which the clergy are told to instruct the people that they ought
                    to repute and take “the Anabaptists’ opinions for detestable heresies and to be
                    utterly condemned.” The document is given <hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">extenso</hi> by Fuller, who further tells us from Stows <hi
                    rend="italic">Chronicles</hi> that, in the year 1538, “four Anabaptists,’'three
                    men and one woman, all Dutch, bare faggots at Paul’s Cross, and three days after
                    a man and woman of their sect was burnt in Smithfield.” In the reign of Edward
                    VI., after the return of the exiles from Zürich, Hooper writes to his friend
                    Bullinger in 1549, that he reads “a public lecture twice in the day to so
                    numerous an audience that the church cannot contain them,” and adds, “the
                    Anabaptists flock <hi rend="italic">(confluunt)</hi> to the place and give me
                    much trouble.” It would seem that at this time they were united together in
                    communities separate from the Established Church. Latimer, in 1552, speaks of
                    them as segregating themselves from the company of other men. In Philpott’s
                    sixth examination in 1555 we are told that Lord Riche said to him, “All heretics
                    do boast of the Spirit of God, and every one would have a church by himself, as
                    Joan of Kent and the Anabaptists.” Philpott was imprisoned soon after Mary’s
                    accession in 1553; and it is very pleasing to find, amidst the records of
                    intense bitterness and rancour which characterized these times, and with which
                    Romanist and Protestant alike assailed the persecuted Baptists, a letter of
                    Philpott’s, to a friend of his, “prisoner the same time in Newgate,” who held
                    Baptist opinions. His friend had written to ask his judgment concerning the
                    baptism of infants. Philpott in a long reply, whilst maintaining the obligation
                    of infant baptism, yet addresses his correspondent as, “dear brother, saint, and
                    fellow-prisoner for the truth of Christ’s gospel and at the close of his
                    argument he says, “I beseech thee, dear brother in the gospel, follow the steps
                    of the faith of the glorious martyrs in the primitive church, and of such as at
                    this day follow the same.” During the whole of the 16th century, and through the
                    greater part of the 17th, whatever changes took place in the state church, the
                    Baptists in England, together with other dissenters, continued to suffer
                    persecution. Archbishop Sandys, about the year 1576, says: “It is the property
                    of fro ward sectaries,” amongst whom he classes Anabaptists, “whose inventions
                    cannot abide the light, to make obscure conventicles;” and though he admits that
                    “when the gospel is persecuted, secret congregations are allowed,” he declares
                    that as the gospel, “strengthened with the civil hand,” is now publicly and
                    sincerely preached, “such stray sheep as will not of their own accord assemble
                    themselves to serve the Lord in the midst of this holy congregation, may
                    lawfully and in reason ought to be constrained thereunto.” There is no doubt
                    that a large number of the Baptists in England at this time came from Holland,
                    but there is little reason to think that Fuller is correct when, after speaking
                    of certain Dutch Anabaptists being seized in 1575, some of whom were banished
                    and two burnt at Smithfield, ho adds, “we are glad that English as yet were free
                    from that infection.”</p>
                <p>About the beginning of the 17th century the severe laws against the Puritans led
                    many dissenters to emigrate to Holland. Some, of these were Baptists, and an
                    English Baptist Church was formed in Amsterdam about the year 1609. In 1611 this
                    church published “a declaration of faith of English people remaining at
                    Amsterdam in Holland.” The article relating to baptism is as follows :— “That
                    every church is to receive in all their members by baptism upon the confession
                    of their faith and sins, wrought by the preaching of the gospel according to the
                    primitive institution and practice. And therefore churches constituted after any
                    other manner, or of any other persons, are not according to Christ’s testament.
                    That baptism or washing with water is the outward manifestation of dying unto
                    sin and walking in newness of life; and therefore in no wise aρpertaineth to
                    infants.” They hold “that no church ought to challenge any prerogative over any
                    other “that magistracy is a holy ordinance of God “that it is lawful in a just
                    cause for the deciding of strife to take an oath by the name of the Lord.”</p>
                <p>The last execution for heresy in England by burning alive took place at
                    Lichfield, April 11, 1612. The condemned person, Edward Wightman, was a Baptist
                    Much uncertainty rests on the history of the Baptists during the next twenty
                    years. It would seem that many members of the Brownist or Independent
                    denomination held Baptist views. An independent congregation in London, gathered
                    in the year 1616, included several such persons, and as the church was larger
                    than could conveniently meet together in times of persecution, they agreed to
                    allow these persons to constitute a distinct church, which was formed on the
                    12th September 1633; and upon this most, if not all, the members of the new
                    church were baptized. Another Baptist church was formed in London in 1639. These
                    churches were “Particular” or Calvinistic Baptists. The church formed in 1609 at
                    Amsterdam held Ar minian views. In 1644 a Confession of Faith was published in
                    the names of seven churches in London “commonly (though falsely) called
                    Anabaptist,” in which were included the two churches just mentioned. The article
                    on baptism is as follows :—“That baptism is an ordinance of the New Testament
                    given by Christ to be dispensed only upon persons professing faith, or that are
                    disciples, or taught, who, upon a profession of faith, ought to be baptized.”
                    “The way and manner of dispensing this ordinance the Scripture holds out to be
                    dipping or plunging the whole body underwater.” They further declare that “a
                    civil magistracy is an ordinance of God,” which they are bound to obey. How well
                    they understood the distinction between the rights of conscience and the rights
                    of the civil magistrate is shown with remarkable clearness ;—</p>
                <quote> “We believe,” they say, “that in all those civil laws which have been acted
                    by them [the supreme magistracy], or for the present are or shall be ordained,
                    we are bound to yield subjection and obedience unto in the Lord, as conceiving
                    ourselves bound to defend both the persons of those thus chosen, and all civil
                    laws made by them, with our persons, liberties, and estates, with all that is
                    called ours, although we should suffer never so much from them in not actively </quote>

                <quote> submitting to some ecclesiastical laws, which might be conceived by them to
                    be their duties to establish, which we for the present could not see, nor our
                    consciences could submit unto; yet are we bound to yield our persons to their
                    pleasures.” </quote>
                <p>They go on to speak of the breathing time which they have had of late, and their
                    hope that God would, as they say, “incline the magistrates’ hearts so for to
                    tender our consciences as that we might be protected by them from wrong, injury,
                    oppression, and molestation;” and then they proceed: “But if God withhold the
                    magistrates’ allowance and furtherance herein, yet we must, notwithstanding,
                    proceed together in Christian communion, not daring to give place to suspend our
                    practice, but to walk in obedience to Christ in the profession and holding forth
                    this faith before mentioned, even in the midst of all trials and afflictions,
                    not accounting our goods, lands, wives, children, fathers, mothers, brethren,
                    sisters, yea, and our own live3, dear unto us, so that we may finish our course
                    with joy; remembering always that we ought to obey God rather than men.” They
                    end their confession thus: “If any take this that we have said to be heresy,
                    then do we with the apostle freely confess, that after the way which they call
                    heresy worship we the God of our fathers, believing all things which are written
                    in the Law and in the Prophets and Apostles, desiring from our souls to disclaim
                    all heresies and opinions which are not after Christ, and to <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> be stedfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of
                    the Lord, as knowing our labour shall not be in vain in the Lord.” The breathing
                    time of which they speak was not of long continuance. Soon after the Restoration
                    (1660) the meetings of Nonconformists were continually disturbed by the
                    constables, and their preachers were carried before the magistrates and fined or
                    imprisoned. One instance of these persecutions will, perhaps, be more impressive
                    than any general statements. In the records, <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> of one
                    of the churches at Bristol still existing, and having, now and for perhaps
                    nearly two centuries, their place of meeting in Broadmead, but at this time
                    meeting in divers places, we find this remark: “On the 29th of November 1685 our
                    pastor, Brother Fownes, diedin Gloucester jail, having been kept there for two
                    years and about nine months a prisoner, unjustly and maliciously, for the
                    testimony of Jesus and preaching the gospel. He was a man of great learning, of
                    a sound judgment, an able preacher, having great knowledge in divinity, law,
                    physic, &amp;c.; a bold and patient sufferer for the Lord Jesus and the gospel
                    he preached.” From the same records we learn that on the 25th March 1683, whilst
                    Mr Fownes was preaching in the wood where they were accustomed secretly to meet,
                    they were surrounded by horse and foot. Mr Fownes was taken and committed “to
                    Gloucester jail for six months on the Oxford Act.” The record adds, “the text
                    Brother Fownes had been preaching from was 2 Tim. ii. 9.” There could scarcely
                    have been found a more appropriate text for his last sermon to the
                    congregation,—“Wherein I suffer trouble as an evil doer even unto bonds; but the
                    word of God is not bound.”</p>
                <p>With the Revolution of 1688, and the passing of the Act af Toleration in 1689,
                    the history of the persecution of Baptists, as well as of other Protestant
                    dissenters, ends. The removal of the remaining disabilities, such as those
                    imposed by the Test and Corporation Acts repealed in 1828, has no special
                    bearing on Baptists more than on other Nonconformists The ministers of the
                    “three denominations of dissenters,”—Presbyterians, Independents, and
                    Baptists,—resident in London and the neighbourhood, had the privilege accorded
                    to them of presenting on proper occasions an address to the sovereign in state,
                    a privilege which they still enjoy</p>
                <p>The Baptists were early divided into two sections,—those who in accordance with
                    Arminian views held the doctrine of “General Redemption,” and those who,
                    agreeing with the Calvinistic theory, held the doctrine of “Particular
                    Redemption ;” and hence they assumed respectively the names of General Baptists
                    and Particular Baptists. In the last century many of the General Baptists had
                    gradually adopted the Arian, or, perhaps the Socinian theory; whilst, on the
                    other hand, the Calvinism of the Particular Baptists had in many of the churches
                    become more rigid, and approached or actually became Antinomianism. In 1770 the
                    orthodox portion of the General Baptists formed themselves into a separate
                    association, under the name of the General Baptist New Connection, since which
                    time the “Old Connection” has gradually merged into the Unitarian denomination.
                    Somewhat later many of the Particular Baptist churches became more moderate in
                    their Calvinism, a result largely attributable to the writings of Andrew Fuller.
                    Up to this time the great majority of the Baptists admitted none either to
                    membership or communion who were not baptized, the principal exception being the
                    churches in Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire, founded or influenced by Bunyan, who
                    maintained that difference of opinion in respect to water baptism was no bar to
                    communion. At the beginning of the present century this question waβ the
                    occasion .ofj great and long-continued discussion, in which the celebrated
                    Robert Hall took a principal part. The practice of mixed communion gradually
                    spread in the denomination. Still more recently many Baptist churches have
                    considered it right to admit to full membership persons professing faith in
                    Christ, who do not agree with them respecting the ordinance of baptism. Such
                    churches justify their practice on the ground that they ought to grant to all
                    their fellow Christians the same right of private judgment as they claim for
                    themselves. It may not be out of place here to correct the mistake, which is by
                    no means uncommon, that the terms Particular and General as applied to Baptist
                    congregations are intended to express this difference in their practice, whereas
                    these terms relate, as has been already said, to the difference'in their
                    doctrinal views. The difference now under consideration is expressed by the
                    terms “strict” and “open,” according as communion (or membership) is or is not
                    confined to persons who, according to their view, are baptized.</p>
                <p>The Baptists early felt the necessity of providing an educated ministry for their
                    congregations. Some of their leading pastors had been educated in one or other
                    of the English universities. Others had by their own efforts obtained a large
                    amount of learning, amongst whom Dr John Gill was eminent for his knowledge of
                    Hebrew. He is said to have assisted Bishop Walton in the preparation of his
                    Polyglot. Mr Edward Terrill, from whose <hi rend="italic">Records</hi> we have
                    already quoted, and who died in 1685, left a considerable part of his estate for
                    the instruction of young men for the ministry, under the superintendence of the
                    pastor of the church now meeting in Broadmead, Bristol, of which he was a
                    member. Other bequests for the same purpose were made, and from the year 1720
                    the Baptist Academy, as it was then called, received young men as students for
                    the ministry amongst the Baptists. Fifty years later, in 1770, a society, called
                    the Bristol Education Society, was formed to enlarge this academy; and it was
                    still further enlarged by the erection of the present Bristol Baptist College
                    about the year 1811. In the North of England a similar Education Society was
                    formed in 1804 at Bradford, Yorkshire, which has since been removed to Rawdon
                    near Leeds. In the metropolis a college was formed in 1810 at Stepney, and was
                    removed to Regent’s Parkin 1856. The Pastors’ College in connection with the
                    Metropolitan Tabernacle was instituted in 1856. Besides these, the General
                    Baptists have maintained a college since 1797 which at present is carried on at
                    Chilwell<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n371/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0371-0356"/>, near Nottingham. A theological institution,
                    intended to promote the views of the “Strict” Baptists, has lately (1866) been
                    established at Manchester. There is also a Baptist theological institution in
                    Scotland, and there are three colleges in Wales. The total number of students in
                    these institutions may be reckoned to be about 200.</p>
                <p>The Baptists were the first denomination of British Christians that undertook the
                    work of missions to the heathen, which has become so prominent a feature in the
                    religious activity of the present century. As early as the year 1784, the
                    Northamptonshire Association of Baptist churches resolved to recommend that the
                    first Monday of every month should be set apart for prayer for the spread of the
                    gospel, a practice which has since, as a German writer remarks, extended over
                    all Protestant Christendom, and we may add over all Protestant Missions. Six
                    years later, in 1792, the Baptist Missionary Society was formed at Kettering in
                    Northamptonshire, after a sermon on Isaiah lii. 2, 3, preached by the afterwards
                    celebrated William Carey, the prime mover in the work, in which he urged two
                    points: “Expect great things from God; attempt great things for God.” In the
                    course of the following year Carey sailed for India, where he was joined a few
                    years later by Marshman and Ward, and the mission was established at Serampore.
                    The great work of Dr Carey’s life was the translation of the Bible into the
                    various languages and dialects of India. The society’s operations are now
                    carried on, not only in the East, but in the West Indies, Africa, and Europe. In
                    1873 there were employed 87 European missionaries and 229 native pastors and
                    evangelists, at 423 stations,—the total number of members of churches being
                    32,444. The funds of the society amounted to upwards of £40,000, exclusive of
                    the amount raised at mission stations. In 1816 the General Baptists established
                    a missionary society, the operations of which are confined to India. It employs
                    16 missionaries, male and female, and 16 native preachers, and has an annual
                    income of £14,000.</p>
                <p>In regard to church government, the Baptists agree with the Independents that
                    each separate church is complete in itself, and has, therefore, power to choose
                    its own ministers, and to make such regulations as it deems to be most in
                    accordance with the purpose of its existence, that is, the advancement of the
                    religion of Christ. A comparatively small section of the denomination maintain
                    that a “plurality of elders” or pastors is required for the complete
                    organization of every separate church. This is the distinctive peculiarity of
                    those churches in Scotland and the north of England which are known as <hi
                    rend="italic">Scotch Baptists.</hi> The largest church of this section,
                    consisting at present of 484 members, originated in Edinburgh in 1765, before
                    which date only one Baptist church—that of Keiss in Caithness, formed about
                    1750—appears to have existed in Scotland. The greater number of the churches are
                    united in associations voluntarily formed, all of them determined by
                    geographical limits except the General Baptist Association, which includes all
                    the churches connected with that body. The associations, as well as the churches
                    not in connection with them, are united together in the Baptist Union of Great
                    Britain and Ireland, formed in 1813. This union, however, exerts no
                    authoritative action over the separate churches. One important part of the work
                    of the union is the collection of information in which all the churches are
                    interested. According to the <hi rend="italic">Baptist Handbook</hi> for the
                    present year (1875), there are in the United Kingdom—Baptist churches, 2612;
                    places of worship, 3321; pastors, 1916; members, 254,998.</p>
                <p>Some of the English settlers in all parts of the world have carried with them the
                    principles and practice of the Baptists. The introduction of Baptist views in
                    America was due to</p>
                <p>Roger Williams, who emigrated to Boston, Massachusetts, in 1630. Driven from
                    Massachusetts on account of his denying the power of the civil magistrate in
                    matters of religion, he formed a settlement and founded a state in Rhode Island,
                    and having become a Baptist he formed, in 1639, the first Baptist church in
                    America, of which he was also for a short time the pastor. It is impossible here
                    to trace the history of the Baptists in the United States. In 1873 there are
                    reported—churches, 20,520; ministers, 12,589; members, 1,633,939. The great
                    majority of the churches practise “strict” communion. Their missionary society
                    is large and successful, and perhaps is best known in this country through the
                    life of devoted labour of Dr Judson in Burmah. There are many Baptist churches
                    also throughout British America. In the more recent colonies of Australia and
                    New Zealand a large number of Baptist churches have been formed during the last
                    twenty-five years, and have been principally supplied with ministers from
                    England. <hi rend="smallcaps">(f. w. g.)</hi></p>
