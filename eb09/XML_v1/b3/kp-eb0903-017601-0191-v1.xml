                <p><label type="entry">BAALBEC</label>, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Ba’albak,</hi> an
                    ancient city of Syria, celebrated for the magnificence of its ruins, which, with
                    the exception of those at Palmyra, are the most extensive in that region. The
                    derivation of the latter part of the name is still dubious, some boldly
                    identifying it with the Egyptian <hi rend="italic">baki,</hi> a city, and others
                    comparing it with the Arabic <hi rend="italic">bakha,</hi> “to be thronged.” It
                    is almost certain that the Greek Heliopolis was intended to be a translation of
                    the name. The town is pleasantly situated on the lowest declivity of the
                    Anti-Libanus, at the opening of a small valley into the plain of El-Bukâ’a or
                    Sahlat Ba’albak, about 35 miles N.N.W. of Damascus, and 38 S.S.E. of Tripoli.
                    The inhabitants have a saying, Burton informs us, that it lies <hi rend="italic"
                    >on the balance,</hi> meaning that it occupies the flattened crest of a
                    watershed. By Russegger its height above the sea is given at 3496 Paris feet,
                    and by Schubert at 3572,— the mean of the observations being 3584 Paris feet, or
                    4502 English feet. A small stream, rising in the immediate neighbourhood from a
                    fountain known as Ra’as-el Ayn, is employed for the irrigation of the
                    valley.</p>
                <p>The origin of Baalbec is lost in remote antiquity, and the historical notices of
                    it are very scanty. The silence of the classical writers respecting it would
                    seem to imply that previously it had existed under another name, and various
                    attempts have been made to identify it with certain places mentioned in the
                    Bible, as with Baalgad, “in the valley of Lebanon” (Josh. xi. 17); Baalath, one
                    of Solomon’s cities (1 Kings ix. 18); Baal-hamon, where Solomon had a vineyard
                    (Cant, viii. 11.); and “the plain of Aven” (Bikath-Aven, Amos i. 5), referred to
                    by Amos; but none of these identifications seem to rest on any very solid
                    support, though they have each in turn met the approval of some writer of
                    authority. In the absence of more positive information, we can only conjecture
                    that its situation on the high road of commerce between Tyre and Palmyra and the
                    farther East rendered it at an early period a seat of wealth and splendour. It
                    is not at all improbable that the statement of Macrobius in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Saturnalia</hi> may be founded on the tradition of a real and
                    potent connection between Heliopolis and its Egyptian namesake. It is mentioned
                    by Josephus <hi rend="italic">(Ant.,</hi> xiv. 3, 4), Pliny <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Nat. Hist., v.</hi> 22), and Ptolemy, and coins of the city have been found
                    belonging to the reigns of almost all the emperors from Nerva to GalEenus. John
                    Malala of Antioch ascribes the erection of a great temple to Jupiter <hi
                    rend="italic">(vax&gt;v τω</hi> ∆d <hi rend="italic">μlγav)</hi> at Heliopolis
                    to Antoninus Pius; and two votive inscriptions still exist on the bases of
                    columns in the Greater Temple, belonging to the age of Septimius Severus. From
                    the civic coins of the reigns of Nerva and Hadrian we learn that the city had
                    been constituted a colony by Julius Caesar, and that it was the seat of a Roman
                    garrison in the time of Augustus, and obtained the <hi rend="italic">Jus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Italicum</hi> from Septimius Severus (Ulpian, <hi rend="italic"
                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Censibus,</hi> lib. i.) Some of the coins of this last
                    emperor bear the figure of a temple and the legend <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    one of the reign of Valerian has the representation of two temples.</p>
                <p>It is evident that in the early Christian centuries Heliopolis was one of the
                    most flourishing seats of Pagan worship, and the Christian writers draw strange
                    pictures of the morality of the place. In 297 it became the scene of the
                    martyrdom of Gelasinus. The Emperor Constantine, according to Sozomen, issued a
                    rescript against the licentious rites of the people, and founded a <hi
                    rend="italic">basilica</hi> among them; but, on the accession of Julian, the
                    Pagan population broke out into violent persecution, and the city became so
                    notorious for its hostility to Christianity, that Christians were banished
                    thither from Alexandria as a special punishment. Theodosius the Great is said to
                    have turned “the temple of <hi rend="italic">Balanius,</hi> the Trilithon,” into
                    a Christian church, and the city seems to have been the seat of a bishop.</p>
                <p>From the accounts of Oriental writers, Baalbec seems to have continued a place of
                    importance down to the time of the Moslem invasion of Syria. They describe it as
                    one of the most splendid of Syrian cities, enriched with stately palaces,
                    adorned with monuments of ancient times, and abounding with trees, fountains,
                    and whatever contributes to luxurious enjoyment. After the capture of Damascus
                    it was regularly invested by the Moslems, and after a courageous defence, at
                    length capitulated. The ransom exacted by the conquerors was 2000 ounces of
                    gold, 4000 ounces of silver, 2000 silk vests, and 1000 swords, together with the
                    arms of the garrison. The city afterwards became the mart for the rich pillage
                    of Syria; but its prosperity scon received a fatal blow from the caliph of
                    Damascus, by whom it was sacked and dismantled, and the principal inhabitants<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n192/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0192-0177"/> put to the sword (748 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.).</hi> It continued, however, to be a place of military importance, and
                    was frequently an object of contest between the caliphs of Egypt and the various
                    Syrian dynasties. In 1090 it passed into the hands of the Seljuk princes of
                    Aleppo and Damascus, who in 1134 were disputing its possession among themselves,
                    and had to yield in 1139 to the power of Genghis Khan. He held the city till
                    1145, when it reverted to Damascus, and continued mostly, from that time, to
                    follow the fortunes of that city. During the course of the century it suffered
                    severely from one or more of the earthquakes that visited the district in 1139,
                    1157, 1170. In 1260 it was taken by the forces of Hulagu, who destroyed the
                    fortifications; but, in the 14th century, it is again described by Abulfeda as
                    enclosed by a wall with a large and strong fortress. Whether it was Baalbec, or,
                    as others say, Cairo, that was, in 1367, the birthplace of Takkieddin Ahmed, the
                    Arabic historian, he appears to have derived the name by which he is best known,
                    El-Makrizi, from one of the quarters of the city. In 1400 it was pillaged by
                    Timur in his progress to Damascus; and afterwards it fell into the hands of the
                    Metaweli, a barbarous predatory tribe, who were nearly exterminated when Djezzar
                    Pacha permanently subjected the whole district to Turkish supremacy.</p>
                <p>The ancient walls of the city are about 4 miles in compass; but the present town
                    is, with the exception of some portions of its Saracenic fortifications and its
                    two mosques, a cluster of mean-looking buildings, which serve only to bring out
                    into greater prominence the grandeur of the neighbouring ruins. These consist of
                    three temples, usually known as the Great Temple (and it well deserves the
                    name), the Temple of Jupiter, Apollo, or the Sun, and the Circular Temple. The
                    Great Temple <hi rend="italic">(vide</hi> Plan), which would seem at one period
                    to have been a kind of pantheon, is situated on a magnificent platform, which
                    raises it high above the level of the ground, and extends from east to west a
                    distance of about 1100 feet. The portico is at the eastern end, and must have
                    been reached by a grand flight of steps. It is 180, or, including the exedrae or
                    pavilions, 260 feet from north to south. A threefold entrance leads into the
                    first court, which is hexagonal in shape, and measures about 250 feet from
                    corner to corner. A portal 50 feet wide, flanked on each side by a smaller
                    aperture of 10 feet, gives admittance to the great quadrangle, which extends
                    from east to west for 440 feet, and has a breadth of 370, thus including an area
                    of between 3 and 4 acres. On all sides, except the eastern, where the “stately
                    stairs” led up to the temple front, this court was surrounded with exedrae of
                    various dimensions, enclosed by costly pillars, and adorned with numerous
                    statues; but statues and pillars and steps are now all involved in a common
                    confusion. The peristyle of the temple proper was composed of fifty-four
                    columns, the front line consisting of ten and the side line of nineteen each.
                    The height of the shafts was about 62 feet, and their diameter 7 feet at the
                    base and about 5 feet at the top. They were crowned with rich Corinthian
                    capitals, and supported an entablature of 14 feet in height (Col. Chesney says
                    11 feet 9 inches). Most of them were formed of three blocks, united without
                    cement by strong iron dowels. Only six of these columns still stand at the
                    western end of the southern side—three having fallen since the visit of Wood and
                    Dawkins in 1750. That part of the great platform on which the peristyle rests
                    consists of immense walls built up about 50 feet from the ground, and formed, as
                    may be easily seen on the northern side, of thirteen courses of bevelled stones
                    in alternate layers of longer and shorter blocks. Outside these walls, at a
                    distance of 291 feet, is another (so-called <hi rend="italic">substruction)</hi>
                    wall on the north, west, and probably, though concealed by rubbish, also on the
                    east side. This is built of large stones, and contains three blocks of such
                    extraordinary proportions that the temple acquired from them its ancient name of
                    Trilithon, or “Three-Stone-Temple.” These measure respectively 64 feet, 63 feet
                    8 inches, and 63 feet in length, are 13 feet in height, and have been raised 20
                    feet from the ground in the western wall. Two underground passages, 17 feet wide
                    and 30 feet high, run from east to west along the sides of the platform of the
                    great quadrangle, and are connected by a transverse tunnel of similar
                    description. They seem, from inscriptions on the walls, to have been tenanted at
                    some time by Roman soldiery.</p>
                <p>Slightly to the north of the Great Temple, and agreeing with it in its
                    orientation, is the Temple of the Sun, which is in much better preservation than
                    its neighbour, and, though small in comparison with it, is larger than the
                    Parthenon at Athens. It likewise is built on a plat form, and was reached by a
                    flight of steps at the eastern end, which, it would seem, were still standing in
                    1688. The arrangement of its peristyle may be seen from the plan. The height of
                    the columns is 45 feet, including the Corinthian capitals, and the circumference
                    of each 19 feet. They supported an entablature of 7 feet in height, from which a
                    ceiling was carried back to the wall of the <hi rend="italic">cella,</hi>
                    consisting of slabs enriched with sculpture of great beauty. The principal
                    ornament of each slab is a hexagonal moulding enclosing the figure of some god
                    or hero; but the profusion and elegance of the fretwork can only be rendered by
                    the artist. After passing the vestibule, which was partly freed from its
                    barbarous screen by Mr Burton in <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n193/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0193-0178"/> 1870, we reach “an exquisitely-carved doorway,
                    having a staircase on each side leading to the top of the building,” which gives
                    entrance to the interior of the temple. On the soffit is the figure of the eagle
                    referred to by so many of the travellers, and regarded by Volney and others as
                    the emblem of the sun-god. This part of the building was greatly damaged in the
                    earthquake of 1759, and if measures are not taken to support the lintel, it must
                    soon fall to the ground. The <hi rend="italic">cella</hi> seems to have been
                    hypaethral; and, like the rest of the building, it was richly ornamented, the
                    floor now presenting a mass of broken sculpture and pillars. A spiral staircase,
                    in the interior of a massive column, leads to the roof on each side of the
                    portal.</p>
                <p>Further east stands the Circular Temple, which is of very small dimensions, but
                    of beautiful workmanship and design. It consists of a semicircular <hi
                    rend="italic">cella</hi> surrounded on the outside by eight Corinthian columns,
                    while within there is a double tier of smaller pillars, the lower row being
                    Ionic and the upper Corinthian. Down to the last century it was used as a Greek
                    church; but it is now in a very ruinous condition, and “choked with wretched
                    hovels.” It is known to the people of Baalbec as Barbàrat-el Atikah (Zα <hi
                    rend="italic">Sainte</hi><hi rend="italic">Barbe).</hi></p>
                <p>The remains of the military works of the Saracens and their successors are only
                    too numerous about Baalbec; but they have left no buildings of greater interest
                    than the mosques already mentioned, the larger of which was built by Melek el
                    As’ad, and the smaller by his father, Melek el Zahir (670 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.h.)</hi> Several interesting excursions maybe made in the neighbourhood, in
                    regard to which the reader may consult Murray’s <hi rend="italic">Handbook,</hi>
                    Joanne and Isambert’s <hi rend="italic">Itinéraire,</hi> and a letter of Mrs
                    Burton’s in <hi rend="italic">Unexplored Syria.</hi></p>
                <p>The ruins of Baalbec have awakened the admiration of European travellers from the
                    16th century down to the present day. Baumgarten visited them in 1507, Belon in
                    1548, Thevet in 1550, Melchior von Seydlitz in 1557, Radzivil in 1583,
                    Quaresmius in 1620, Monconys in 1647, De la Roque in 1688, and Maundrell in
                    1699. In the 18th century Pococke gave a sketch of the ruins, which was followed
                    up by the magnificent work of Wood and Dawkins (1751), to this day one of our
                    principal authorities, and Volney, in 1784, supplied a graphic description.
                    During the present century the number of travellers who have visited Baalbec has
                    enormously increased; it may be sufficient to mention Richardson, Addison,
                    Lindsay, Wilson, the Duke of Ragusa, Lamartine, De Saulcy, Chesney, and
                    Robinson. Of the chapters of the last writer, in his <hi rend="italic">Biblical
                    Researches,</hi> vol. iii., especial use has been made in the present article.
                    In spite, however, of such a series of investigators, much might· still be done
                    to extend our knowledge of those wonderful remains. A few superficial
                    excavations have been made from time to time; but the ruins of Baalbec still
                    wait for their Layard or their Schliemann.</p>
