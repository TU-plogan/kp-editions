                    rend="smallcaps">Chaules</hi> XIV. of Sweden and Norway, was the son of a lawyer
                    at Pau in Béarn, and was born January 26, 1764. He was destined by his parents
                    for the law, but chose the profession of arms, and enlisted in 1780 as a private
                    in the royal marines. When the Revolution swept away the arbitrary distinction
                    of classes, and opened up to all alike the path of preferment, the abilities of
                    Bernadotte were speedily acknowledged. In 1792 he was made a colonel, in the
                    following year a general of brigade, and soon after a general of division. In
                    the campaigns of the Rhine and of Italy his military talents found ample scope
                    for display; and his diplomatic abilities had also been tested as ambassador at
                    the court of Vienna. During Bonaparte’s absence in Egypt Bernadotte was
                    appointed minister of war. He reorganized the whole army, and prepared the way
                    for the conquest of Holland. Notwithstanding the rivalry that all along existed
                    between him and Napoleon, Bernadotte was made a marshal on the establishment of
                    the empire. He was also nominated to the government of Hanover, and took part in
                    the campaign of 1805 at the head of a force of 20,000 men. He distinguished
                    himself at the battle of Austerlitz, and in 1806 he was created prince of
                    PonteCorvo. In 1810 the death of Prince Augustenburg of Sweden having left the
                    throne of that kingdom without an heir, the Swedish States in Council nominated
                    Bernadotte as successor to Charles XIII. of Sweden, a distinction for which he
                    was scarcely less indebted to his nobility of character than to his military
                    talents. During the great campaigns of 1813 and 1814 Bernadotte joined the
                    coalition against Napoleon, and it was his Swedish contingent that mainly
                    decided the battle of Leipsic. It is stated, on good authority, that he had
                    formed the ambitious design of succeeding the emperor on the French throne. As
                    crown prince of Sweden he devoted his whole energies to the welfare of his
                    adopted country. Owingto the infirmities of the king he was intrusted with the
