                    better definition perhaps would be “a ring of coloured light formed by
                    refraction, on the passage of light from one of the heavenly bodies through the
                    aqueous vapour surrounding the earth.” This would include coronae and rainbows,

                <p>They are usually seen surrounding the sun or the moon, but in the tropics small
                    halos were observed by Humboldt round the planet Venus. The formation of
                    encircling halos of the classes A and B is generally attributed to refraction
                    and reflexion of the rays of light by the presence of minute snow crystals in
                    the upper strata of the air, and they occur usually when cirrus or cirro-stratus
                    clouds exist. This theory was originated by Descartes, and was adopted by
                    Marriotte (in 1686), and subsequently followed by Dr Young and Sir Isaac Newton.
                    It is, however, probable that some halos and certainly all coronae (class C) are
                    formed by refraction of light from globules of water suspended in the
                    atmosphere. Simple halos are either about 22⅛ degrees or 47 degrees in diameter.
                    The ice or snow crystals, being hexagonal in form, sometimes produce a double
                    refraction, <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0418-0399"/> and then the large and small halos are seen at
                    the same time, and, reflexion taking place from the surfaces of the crystals,
                    additional halos or parts of halos are formed as in figs. 1 and 2. At the points
                    of intersection of the halos, images of the sun or moon sometimes appear; when
                    seen with the former, they are called <hi rend="italic">parhelia</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">mock-sums,</hi> and when with the latter, <hi rend="italic"
                    >paraselenes</hi> or <hi rend="italic">mockmoons.</hi> They are sometimes
                    accompanied with flaming tails, and are usually of prismatic colours, as also
                    are the halos and coronae. The latter are seen when fleecy clouds or mist
                    intervene between the spectator and the sun or moon, to which they are in
                    immediate proximity, thereby being distinguished from the halos, which are
                    formed at a distance from those luminaries. The predominating colour in coronae
                    is red or orange.</p>
                <p>The second principal division of halos includes those which are seen opposite to
                    the sun and moon. The first class of these comprises rainbows (a), which are
                    occasioned by refraction of the light from the sun or moon, produced by falling
                    rain, causing a bow with the prismatic colours in concentric bands and arranged
                    as they appear in the solar spectrum. When the rain is abundant an inner bow is
                    formed, the colours in which are in inverted order. Rainbows when seen from
                    mountain tops and the topmasts of ships are completely circular. Fog-bows and
                    mist halos <hi rend="italic">(β)</hi> are somewhat similar.</p>
                <p>The former are frequently white in colour, and are seen in the English Channel,
                    and also off the banks of Newfoundland, being called by sailors “fog-eaters,”
                    from their indicating a dispersion of the fog or mist. They appear to be formed
                    in a horizontal or very oblique plane. Mist halos are seen in the vapour of
                    fountains or waterfalls, and resemble rainbows. Mountain spectres (γ) are caused
                    by reflexion, and often appear accompanied by chromatic halos (see fig. 3). They
                    generally occur on mountains when the sky between the observer and the sun is
                    clear and there is a mist or cloud on the side of the mountain opposite to the
                    sun, on which the summit of the mountain and the buildings and persons standing
                    near are reflected. The most notable of mountain spectres is that of the
                    Brocken, in the Harz mountains. Howitt says of this :—</p>
                <p>“If the fog is very dry, you see not only yourself but your neighbour; if very
                    damp, only yourself, surrounded by a rainbow-coloured glory, which becomes more
                    lustrous and beautiful the damper and thicker the fog is, and the nearer it
                    approaches.”</p>
                <p>Many of the ancient descriptions of miraculous appearances in the heavens may be
                    attributed to the phenomena before mentioned. Among the chief of these is the
                    appearance of a cross which the emperor Constantine alleged he saw in the
                    heavens about noon when marching against Maxentius (about 313 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi> and which was the cause of his conversion to
                    Christianity (Eusebius, <hi rend="italic">Vita* Constant.,</hi> i. 27). Some
                    writers have doubted the occurrence; but it is quite possible Constantine saw
                    part of a system of solar halos, and two of these at right angles would form a
                    cross (see fig. 4). The <hi rend="italic">Brighton Herald</hi> of April 10,
                    1852, records a similar phenomenon on April 1st of that year at Brighton :—</p>
                <p>‘ ‘ Sun setting, evening very fine with slight haze westward, when a ray of
                    brilliant light shot upwards about 20 degrees above the horizon, directly
                    perpendicular from the sun, and soon after its appearance it was crossed by a
                    horizontal band of light of a paler colour, but about the some breadth. It
                    formed a perfect cross, and lasted half an hour.”</p>
                <p>Halos and rainbows are considered valuable prognostications of future weather.
                    Fragments of rainbows seen on detached clouds are called <hi rend="italic"
                    >wind-dogs,</hi> and are said to be a sign of wind. When the diameter of a
                    corona contracts it shows the water particles are uniting into larger ones which
                    may fall in rain, whereas if the corona extends, the particles are growing
                    smaller, indicating increasing dryness. The open side of a halo is in some
                    places considered to foretell the quarter from which bad weather may be
                    expected.</p>
