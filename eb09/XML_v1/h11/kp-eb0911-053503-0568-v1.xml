                    (1719-1789), will be permanently remembered as the author of an important work
                    on the history of music. He was born March 30, 1719, in London, the son of an
                    architect who destined his son for his own profession. Ultimately, however,
                    Hawkins took to the law, devoting his leisure hours to his favourite study of
                    music. A wealthy marriage in 1753 enabled him to indulge his passion for
                    acquiring rare works of music, and he bought, for example, the collection formed
                    by Dr Pepusch, and subsequently presented by Hawkins to the British Museum. It
                    was on such materials that Hawkins founded his celebrated work on the <hi
                    rend="italic">General History of the Science and Practice of Music,</hi> in 5
                    vols, (republished in 2 vols., 1876). It was brought out in 1776, the same year
                    which witnessed the appearance of the first volume of Burney’s work on the same
                    subject. The relative merits of the two works were eagerly discussed by
                    contemporary critics. Burney no doubt is infinitely superior as a literary man,
                    and his work accordingly comes much nearer the idea of a systematic treatise on
                    the subject than Hawkins’s, which is essentially a collection of rare and
                    valuable pieces of music with a more or less continuous commentary. But by
                    rescuing these from oblivion Hawkins has given a permanent value to his work. Of
                    Hawkins’s literary efforts apart from music it will be sufficient to mention his
                    occasional contributions to the <hi rend="italic">Gentleman'</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">'s</hi><hi rend="italic">Magazine,</hi> his edition of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Complete Angler,</hi> and his biography of Dr Johnson, with whom
                    he was intimately acquainted. He was one of the original members of the Ivy Lane
                    Club, and ultimately became one of Dr Johnson’s executors. If there were any
                    doubt as to his intimacy with Johnson, it would be settled by the slighting way
                    in which Boswell refers to him. Speaking of the Ivy Lane Club, he mentions
                    amongst the members “Mr John Hawkins, an attorney,” and adds the following
                    footnote, which at the same time may serve as a summary of the remaining facts
                    of Hawkins’s life :—“He was for several years chairman of the Middlesex
                    justices, and upon presenting an address to the king accepted the usual offer of
                    knighthood (1772). He is the author of a <hi rend="italic">History of Music</hi>
                    in five volumes in quarto. By assiduous attendance upon Johnson in his last
                    illness he obtained the office of one of his executors,—in consequence of which
                    the booksellers of London employed him to publish an edition of Dr Johnson’s
                    works and to write his life.” Sir John Hawkins died on the 21st of May 1789, and
                    was buried in the cloisters of Westminster Abbey.</p>
