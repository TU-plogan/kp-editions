                <p><label type="entry">HALL, <hi rend="smallcaps">Robert</hi></label> (1764-1831),
                    one of the greatest of English pulpit orators, was born May 2, 1764, at Arnsby
                    near Leicester, where his father, a man whose cast of mind in some respects
                    resembled closely that of the son, waβ pastor of a Baptist congregation. Robert
                    was the youngest of a family of fourteen. In infancy his physical powers were so
                    feeble that until two years of age he was unable to walk, and, although his
                    expression and gestures indicated great mental vivacity, he was equally slow to
                    acquire the faculty of articulate speech. It even appears that he had learned to
                    read before he was able to imitate spoken sounds, his nurse having taught him
                    the letters of the alphabet and the formation of words from the inscriptions on
                    the tombstones of a churchyard adjoining his father’s dwelling-house. When once
                    the interest in this exercise had loosened his reluctant tongue his progress was
                    remarkably rapid, and before he had attained his third year the fluency of his
                    talk gave some indications of his future oratorical eminence. While still at the
                    dame’s school his passion for books absorbed the greater part of his time, and
                    in the summer it was his custom after school hours to retire to the churchyard
                    with a volume which he continued to peruse there till nightfall, making out the
                    meaning of the more difficult words with the help of a pocket dictionary. From
                    his sixth to his eleventh year he attended the school of Mr Simmons at Wigston,
                    a village 4 miles from Arnsby.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n410/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0410-0391"/>
                <p>There his precocity assumed the exceptional form of an intense interest in
                    metaphysics, partly perhaps on account of the restricted character of his
                    father’s library; and before he was nine years of age he had read and re-read
                    Jonathan Edwards’s <hi rend="italic">Treatise on the Will</hi> and Butler’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Analogy.</hi> This incessant study at such an early period of life
                    seems, however, to have had an injurious influence on his health, and may have
                    been partly the cause of the disease from which he experienced such suffering in
                    after life, and symptoms of whose existence began at this time to manifest
                    themselves. Occasionally he was already troubled with intense pain in the back,
                    and after he left Mr Simmons’s school his appearance was so sickly as to awaken
                    fears of the presence of consumption. In order therefore to obtain the benefit
                    of a change of air, he stayed for some time in the house of a gentleman near
                    Kettering, who with an impropriety which Hall himself afterwards referred to as
                    “egregious,” prevailed upon the boy of eleven to give occasional addresses at
                    prayer meetings. As his health seemed rapidly to recover, he was sent to a
                    school at Northampton conducted by the Rev. John Ryland, where he remained a
                    year and a half, and “made great progress in Latin and Greek.” On leaving school
                    he for some time studied divinity under the direction of his father, and in
                    October 1778 he entered the Bristol academy for the preparation of students for
                    the Baptist ministry. Here the self-possession which had enabled him in his
                    twelfth year to address unfalteringly various audiences of grown-up people seems
                    to have strangely forsaken him; for when, in accordance with the arrangements of
                    the academy, his turn came to deliver an address in the vestry of Broadmead
                    Chapel, he broke down on two separate occasions and was unable to finish his
                    discourse. On the 13th August 1780 he was set apart to the ministry, but he
                    still continued his studies at the academy; and in 1781, in accordance with the
                    provisions of an exhibition which he held, he entered King’s College, Aberdeen,
                    where he took the degree of master of arts in March 1785. At the university he
                    was without a rival of his own standing in any of the classes, distinguishing
                    himself alike in classics, philosophy, and mathematics. He there formed the
                    acquaintance of Mackintosh (afterwards Sir James), who, though a year his junior
                    in age, was a year his senior as a student, and who became attached to him
                    “because he could not help it.” While they remained at Aberdeen the two were
                    inseparable, reading together the best Greek authors·, especially Plato, and
                    discussing, either during their walks by the sea-shore and the banks of the Don
                    or in their rooms until early morning, the most perplexed questions in
                    philosophy and religion. The interest of their conversation seems to have lain
                    more in the difference than the agreement of their opinions; but their
                    controversies, so far from causing any even temporary estrangement, tended only
                    to cement more closely their friendship and to deepen iu each the respect for
                    the mental and moral qualities of the other.</p>
                <p>During the vacation between his last two sessions at Aberdeen, Hall acted as
                    assistant pastor to Dr Evans at Broadmead Chapel, Bristol, and three months
                    after leaving the university he was appointed classical tutor in the Bristol
                    academy, an office which he held for more'than five years. Even at this period
                    his extraordinary eloquence had excited an interest beyond the bounds of the
                    denomination to which he belonged, and when he preached the chapel was generally
                    crowded to excess, the audience including many persons of intellectual tastes.
                    It would appear, however, that, in tfi,e case of Mr Fuller, Dr Ryland, and other
                    theological authorities, his exuberant intellectual energy and his outspoken
                    expression of tolerance for certain aspects of Socinianism caused trembling to
                    be greatly mingled with their admiration; and ultimately, suspicions in regard
                    to his orthodoxy having in 1789 led to a misunderstanding with his colleague and
                    a part of the congregation, he in July 1790 accepted an invitation to make trial
                    of a congregation at Cambridge, of which he became pastor in July of the
                    following year. From a statement of his opinions contained in a letter to the
                    congregation which he left, it would appear that, while a firm believer in the
                    proper divinity of Christ, he had at this time disowned the cardinal principles
                    of Calvinism·—the federal headship of Adam, and the doctrine of absolute
                    election and reprobation; and that he was so far a materialist as to “hold that
                    man’s thinking powers and faculties are the result of a certain organization of
                    matter, and that after death he ceases to be conscious till the resurrection.”
                    It was during his Cambridge ministry, which extended over a period of fifteen
                    years, that his oratory was most brilliant and most immediately powerful. At
                    Cambridge the intellectual character of a large part of the audience supplied a
                    stimulus which was wanting at Leicester and Bristol, but besides this his
                    physical powers were then at their best, and were still unaffected by the
                    constant pain which already so severely tested his powers of endurance and
                    rendered the discharge of his duties such a marvellous triumph of will. Above
                    all it was not till near the close of this period that his intellectual pathway
                    was crossed by the shadow of mental derangement, and an element of weakness and
                    uncertainty introduced into his career which for some time clouded the horizon
                    of his hopes and perhaps placed a permanent check on his highest form of
                    intellectual enterprise. While at Cambridge he gave to the world some of the
                    more important of the few and small publications which, although those who were
                    his constant hearers have affirmed that several of his imperfectly reported
                    sermons convey a juster impression of the usual character of his oratory, are
                    the only correct and properly authenticated records of his style of thought and
                    composition. His first published compositions had apolitical origin. In 1791
                    appeared <hi rend="italic">Christianity consistent with the Love of
                    Freedom,</hi> in which he defende&lt;l the political conduct of dissenters
                    against the attacks of the Rev. John Clayton, minister of Weighhouse, and gave
                    eloquent expression to his hopes of great political and social ameliorations as
                    destined to result nearly or remotely from the subversion of old ideas and
                    institutions in the maelstrom of the French Revolution. In 1793 he expounded his
                    political sentiments in a powerful and more extended pamphlet entitled an <hi
                    rend="italic">Apology for the Freedom of the Press,</hi> which at once obtained
                    an extensive circulation, and doubtless to some extent aided in the formation of
                    that public opinion which has given birth in England to the present remarkable
                    era of gradual and unswerving political progress. On account, however, of
                    certain asperities into which the warmth of his feelings had betrayed him, and
                    his conviction that he had treated his subject in too superficial a manner, he
                    refused to permit the publication of the pamphlet beyond the third edition,
                    until the references of political opponents and the circulation of copies
                    without his sanction induced him in 1821 to prepare a new edition, from which he
                    omitted the attack on Bishop Horsley, and to which he prefixed an advertisement
                    stating that his political opinions had undergone no substantial change. His
                    other publications while at Cambridge were three sermons— <hi rend="italic">On
                    Modern Infidelity</hi> (1801), <hi rend="italic">Reflections on War</hi> (1802),
                    and <hi rend="italic">Sentiments proper to the present Crisis</hi> (1803). From
                    his first attack of insanity, which occurred in November 1804, he recovered so
                    speedily that he was able to resume his duties in April 1805, but a more severe
                    recurrence of the malady rendered it advisable for him on his second recovery to
                    resign his pastoral office, which he did in March 1806. On leaving Cambridge he
                    paid a visit to his relatives in Leicestershire, and then for some time resided
                    at Enderby, preaching occasionally in some of <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0411-0392"/> the neighbouring villages. Latterly he ministered
                    to a small congregation in Harvey Lane, Leicester, from whom at the close of
                    1806 he accepted a call to be their stated pastor. In the autumnof 1807 he
                    changedhis residence from Enderby to Leicester, and in 1808 he married the
                    servant of a brother minister. His proposal of marriage had been made after an
                    almost momentary acquaintance, and, according to the traditionary account, in
                    very abrupt and peculiar terms; but, judging from his subsequent domestic life,
                    his choice did sufficient credit to his penetration and sagacity. His writings
                    at Leicester embraced various tracts printed for private circulation; anumberof
                    contributions to the <hi rend="italic">Eclectic lieview,</hi> among which may be
                    mentioned his articles on “Foster’s Essays” and on “Zeal without Innovation”;
                    several sermons, including those <hi rend="italic">On the Advantages of
                    Knowledge to the Lower Classes</hi> (1810), <hi rend="italic">On the Death of
                    the Princess Charlotte</hi> (1817), and <hi rend="italic">On the Death of Dr
                    Pyland</hi> (1825); and his pamphlet on <hi rend="italic">Terms of
                    Communion,</hi> in which he advocated intercommunion with all those who
                    acknowledged the “essentials” of Christianity. In 1819 he published an edition
                    in one volume of his sermons formerly printed. On the death of Dr Ryland, Hall
                    was invited to return to the pastorate of Broadmead Chapel, Bristol, and as the
                    peace of the congregation at Leicester had been to some degree disturbed by a
                    controversy regarding several cases of discipline, he resolved to accept the
                    invitation, and removed there in April 1826. About this period the malady—renal
                    calculus —which had for many years rendered his life an almost continual
                    martyrdom, and whose influence he had triumphed over with such marvellous
                    fortitude, began to show signs of indirectly obtaining the mastery over his
                    vigorous constitution; and henceforth increasing infirmities and sufferings,
                    which rest and change of scene could do little to alleviate, surrounded with
                    deepening external gloom the spirit whose cheerfulness and peace they seemed to
                    leave almost totally uninjured. Gradually the inability to take proper exercise,
                    by inducing a plethoric habit of body and impeding the circulation, led to a
                    diseased condition of the heart, which resulted in his death, February 21,
                    1831.</p>
                <p>The private manners of Hall were remarkably simple and unaffected; and if his
                    method of expressing his opinions was frequently impetuous, and occasionally
                    some what brusque and imperious, this was owing rather to his constitutional
                    energy and straightforward impulsive honesty than to an overbearing and dogmatic
                    temper. Though exercising his sarcastic powers with great unconstraint, he
                    reserved his severity chiefly for errors which implied some kind of moral
                    culpability, and he was always careful to be respectful to true worth even when
                    concealed or deformed by many superficial defects, or conjoined with humble rank
                    or weak mental capacity. In reality few were more unassuming or unselfish or
                    more continuously actuated by feelings truly charitable and benevolent. His
                    mental absorption led to the contraction of many minor eccentricities, one of
                    which was a frequent obliviousness to the flight of time and a consequent
                    inability to remember his engagements. Towards the close of hie Cambridge
                    ministry he acquired the habit of smoking, and from that time his pipe was his
                    almost constant companion and one of his principal solaces in his bodily
                    suffering. Indeed talk and tobacco may be said to have supplied his chief means
                    of recreation. In his conversation the calibre and idiosyncrasies of his genius
                    were better displayed than in any of the writings he has left us; and it is said
                    to have exercised an even more «captivating charm than did his finest orations.
                    Its most striking characteristics were keen, biting, and original wit, and wild
                    and daring imaginative flights.</p>
                <p>Both physically and mentally Hall possessed a rare combination of qualities
                    fitting him to excel as a public speaker. Hedid not attain success without
                    effortand discipline, but the faults which hampered his capabilities were not of
                    a formidable character. He was of powerful and athletic build, and his great
                    breadth of chest, while it lent an impression of massiveness to his bearing,
                    indicated abundant capacity to sustain the kind of physical exertion which
                    oratory entails. His voice was deficient in strength and volume, but
                    exceptionally pure and melodious, and capable of being thoroughly
                    interpenetrated by emotion. Its inadequacy in tone was also compensated for by
                    its great flexibility, which enabled him by the momentum of rapid utterance to
                    obtain all the vocal force necessary to the highest oratorical effects.
                    According to Foster, his countenance “was formed as if on purpose for the most
                    declared manifestation of power.” The forehead was high and sloping, with
                    well-arched brows, beneath which his dark and brilliant eye, in his more excited
                    moments, burned and glowed with thought and passion. The lower part of his
                    countenance indicated a vehement and headstrong temperament under the control of
                    an iron will—doubtless powerfully reinforced by the strong moral sensibility
                    which gave a peculiar elevation and dignity to features possessing no trait of
                    grace or beauty. Perhaps the “stern, intense, and somewhat formidable
                    expression,” which Foster referred to as wanting in the portrait accompanying
                    his works, had its origin, partly in his constant suffering.</p>
                <p>His gestures in speaking were few and simple, and his manner seemed to be
                    naturally determined by his mental emotions without conscious purpose on his
                    part. He gave the impression of thorough self-forgetfulness and absorption in
                    his subject, and during the latter part of an oration of being wholly possessed
                    and dominated by the thoughts and sentiments which he uttered. It is generally
                    affirmed that in his spoken sermons his style was more easy, graceful, and
                    various than in any of the sermons which he prepared for the press. In the
                    latter the structure of the sentences is often formal and laboured, the rhythm
                    artificial and monotonous; and idiomatic vigour is in some degree sacrificed to
                    elegance and pomp. In the higher flights of his eloquence his language was,
                    however, unsurpassed for purity and happy adaptation to the thought. Indeed one
                    of his most remarkable gifts is said to have been his extemporaneous command of
                    a clear and felicitous vocabulary, which seemed to clothe every shade of his
                    meaning with its appropriate expression, and whose musical cadences formed a not
                    unimportant element in the fascination exercised by bis oratory. It is true that
                    in many cases his language had before he spoke undergone considerable mental
                    elaboration, but he was nevertheless so little enslaved to his memory that,
                    according to his own statement, he never entered the pulpit without omitting
                    something which he wished to say and saying something which he wished to-omit.
                    In preaching his severe taste and deep sense of solemnity restrained every
                    tendency to eccentricity or extravagance, and he never permitted his brilliant
                    wit to emit even the faintest and most momentary sparkle. It may therefore be
                    believed that on a secular platform his oratory would have been more racy and
                    natural, and from the scope afforded for the free exercise of all his powers
                    would have attained to a more varied perfection. In his occasional reviews his
                    style is clear and pointed, but apart from this it is his sarcasm that chiefly
                    conveys the impression of more than average ability. The predominant element of
                    his eloquence was reasoning. His statements and propositions were animated with
                    passion and illuminated, by a vivid and rich if not strikingly powerful and
                    original imagination; but in no instance did passion or imagination seem to
                    obtain the chief sway. It was generally not till towards the close of his sermon
                    that the spell of his eloquence asserted its highest influence over his
                    audience. Then the various trains of thought through which he had been <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0412-0393"/> guiding·them seemed to meet in an intense focus
                    where reason, imagination, and passion were blended together, and in whose light
                    the theme he had been expounding stood revealed in such vivid truth and beauty
                    as to captivate for the moment every heart But though stating truth chiefly in
                    the form of reasoning, Le constantly exhibited it rather in its moral than in
                    its theological aspects. His eloquence was indeed morally more than
                    intellectually powerful; and its moral purpose was besides achieved not so much
                    by the direct inculcation of moral duties, or the detection and exposure of
                    moral deformities, as by his unconscious exhibition of his own moral elevation
                    and of the ardour and purity of his hopes and aims. Indeed in many of his
                    sermon3 both the form and matter of his thought seemed to be determined rather
                    by his own individual interest in his subject than by the consideration of the
                    capacities and wants of his hearers. Though exhibiting a catholicity of spirit
                    much in advance of his time, the range of his thought is completely included
                    within the limits of traditional opinion. In treating of what he regarded as the
                    cardinal truths of religion he is of course oratorically effective, but the
                    dexterous and brilliant manner in which he wields the old controversial weapons
                    does not compensate for their inherent inadequacy. He indulges too frequently in
                    innuendoes against the moral character and motives of his opponents, and fails
                    to sound the full depth of the speculative problems upon which he attempts to
                    dogmatize. His sermons will always be esteemed by the student of English
                    literature for their many passages of splendid and finished eloquence, but his
                    theological writings as a whole are of course without that quaint interest
                    attaching to representations of truth which though now old and effete originally
                    exhibited it with the freshness and vividness of a discovery; while on the other
                    hand they have no sufficient colouring from modern tendencies to give to them a
                    more than superficial value in relation to those phases of religious thought
                    which are predominant at the present time.</p>
