                    >Heiland')</hi> is an Old Saxon poem of the 9th century. According to some
                    critics it is a fragment of a larger work which dealt with the entire historical
                    material of the Old and New Testaments. The part which we now possess sets forth
                    the life of Christ as told by the four evangelists, whose various narratives the
                    author seeks to harmonize. The poem is said to have been composed by a Saxon
                    writer at the request of the emperor Louis the Pious; but who the author wa <hi
                    rend="superscript"> t</hi> ≈, except that he was a Saxon, we have no means of
                    knowing. The general opinion is that he lived in Westphalia, but even this is
                    uncertain. Like all the most ancient remains of Teutonic poetry, <hi
                    rend="italic">Heliand</hi> is written in alliterative verse, of which the writer
                    had a perfect mastery. It is almost the only remnant of the Old Saxon dialect,
                    and has therefore a high philological value, but it is still more interesting
                    from a literary point of view. The poet does not merely repeat his authorities;
                    while true to the main facts of the original story, he allows his imagination to
                    play upon them in a free and poetic spirit. He realized with intense force the
                    incidents in the career of the Founder of Christianity, and gives vitality and
                    definiteness to the received conception of His character. The diction is simple
                    and popular, but marked by an elevation of sentiment adapted to the theme and to
                    its epic treatment; and by a happy phrase the author often succeeds in imparting
                    to his style colour, variety, and animation. The 9th century is remarkable in
                    the history of Old English and of Old Norse poetry; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Heliand</hi> affords proof that the impulse which revealed itself in these two
                    literatures was also experienced to the full by the higher minds of Germany. The
                    historical aspects of this great work are hardly less important than those which
                    claim the attention of the purely literary student. Of all the German tribes the
                    Saxons were the last to submit to the influence of Christianity. They regarded
                    baptism as the symbol of Frankish supremacy, and clung as long as they could to
                    the ancient Teutonic faith. Not until Charlemagne, after more than thirty years
                    of warfare, forced upon them Frankish institutions did they generally accept the
                    new creed, and even then, while they talked of Christ and the saints, they
                    thought of Wodan and Thor, and took delight in the heathen poetry which had been
                    handed down from remote periods. Louis the Pious was of a gentle and
                    conciliatory nature, and by treating the Saxons with kindness obliterated to a
                    large extent the recollection of his father’s severity. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Heliand</hi> was one of the works with which he and the clergy endeavoured to
                    replace pagan literature, so that we may regard it as the monument of a struggle
                    between two civilizations. The author is dominated by the ideals and the
                    sympathies of the Catholic Church, but occasional touches remind us of the order
                    of life that was passing away, and these have been found suggestive by writers
                    on German archaeology.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Hêliand</hi> received its name from A. Schmeller, who edited it
                    (Munich, 1830-40) from the two existing manuscripts, one of which is in the
                    British Museum, the other in Munich (formerly in Bamberg). More recent editions
                    have been issued by Köne (Münster, 1855, accompanied by a modern rendering),
                    Heyιιe (2d ed. Paderborn, 1873), and Rückert (4th volume of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Deutsche Dichtungen des Mittelalters,</hi> Leipsic, 1876). There are renderings
                    into modera German by Kannegiesser (Berlin, 1847), Grein (Rinteln, 1854;
                    improved edition, Cassel, ∙1869), Rapp (Stuttgart, 1856), and Sim rock (2d ed.
