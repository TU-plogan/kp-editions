                <p><label type="entry">HEN RY VI</label>. (1421-1471), king of England, only son of
                    Henry V. and Catherine of France, was born on December G, 1421, and was
                    therefore only eight months old at his father’s death. He can hardly be said
                    ever to have reigned, for his long minority passed into another kind of
                    tutelage, during which the influence of his wife and favourites prepared the way
                    for civil war. Ten years of anarchy culminated in his dethronement, and ten
                    years more of wandering and imprisonment fill the interval between that event
                    and his death. The chief interest of the first thirty years of his life lies in
                    watching the decay of English power in France; that of the last twenty is to be
                    found in the civil wars which resulted from the misgovernment of the preceding
                    period. Although the English had lost some ground towards the end of Henry V.’s
                    reign, their position, when the duke of Bedford undertook the task of continuing
                    his brother’s work, was very favourable. They held the north <pb break="no"

                    eastern districts. The alliance with Duke Philip was strengthened by a marriage
                    between his sister Anne and the duke of Bedford. The Scotch king, James I., was
                    released from captivity, in order that England might be relieved from danger on
                    that side. Thus strengthened, Bedford was able to apply himself vigorously to
                    the conquest of France, towards which the battle of Verneuil (1424) was an
                    important step. But the English cause had already received its first great blow
                    in the marriage of the duke of Gloucester with Jacqueline of Hainault, which
                    destroyed the good understanding between Burgundy and England. Bedford for the
                    time managed to stave off the quarrel, and after renewing his union with
                    Burgundy, laid siege to Orleans, the key of southern France. The capture of the
                    town seemed certain, when the appearance of Joan of Arc turned the scale. The
                    relief of Orleans (1429) was followed by other French successes, and by the
                    coronation of Charles VII. at Rheims. The capture of Joan did little for
                    England, for the spirit she had inspired survived her loss, and her death (May
                    1431) only nerved the French to fresh efforts. It was in vain that Bedford had
                    Henry crowned at Paris (December 17, 1431). · The young king remained in France
                    nearly two years (April 1430 to February 1432), but his presence did not turn
                    the tide of French success. On the side of England the supply of men and money
                    was falling short, while on that of France a new type of commanders was coming
                    to the front, who were not inclined to repeat the disastrous blunders of Crécy
                    and Agincourt. The death of Bedford’s wife (November 1432) broke the link that
                    bound Burgundy to England, and negotiations for peace were set on foot. These
                    culminated in a great congress at Arras (July 1435), but the demands of the two
                    countries were found incompatible, and the war was renewed. Bedford’s death
                    (September 14, 1435) finally destroyed all hope of recovery in France. Burgundy
                    at once made peace with Charles VII., and the English commanders who succeeded
                    Bedford were constantly defeated. Paris was retaken, Normandy overrun. Repeated
                    efforts on the part of England led only to further exhaustion. Meanwhile
                    negotiations for peace had been continued at intervals, and led in 1414 to a
                    truce, during which Henry was married (April 22, 1445) to Margaret, daughter of
                    René of Anjou. It was hoped that this marriage, together with the cession of
                    Anjou and M line, would lead to a permanent peace, and save Normandy and
                    Guienne. But though Anjou and Maine were actually surrendered in 1448, the truce
                    was broken next year, and before the end of 1450 the whole of Normandy was lost.
                    In 1451 Guienne was reconquered by the French, and in 1453 Calais alone remained
                    to England. The war was practically at an end.</p>
                <p>Its conclusion coincides with the period when the two parties that divided
                    England were just about to appeal to arms. The civil war was in great measure
                    the result of the defeats abroad, as those defeats themselves were in part the
                    consequence of discord at home. Quarrels between the chief members of the
                    reigning house were the origin of its weakness; financial embarrassment, a
                    divided foreign policy, and a feeble administration brought disgrace on the king
                    and his advisers; family feuds and a long tale of mutual injuries added
                    bitterness to political differences. Eventually an outburst of popular
                    discontent kindled the train so long prepared, and the champion of order and
                    good government began a struggle in which the original objects were soon lost
                    sight of, and which ended only with the death of the king whose innocent
                    imbecility had caused the disorder. To check the rivalry of Henry’s uncle, the
                    duke of Gloucester, and his great-uncle, Cardinal Beaufort, was beyond the power
                    of the council. Bedford alone could appease the quarrel, and Bedford’s presence
                    in England meant disaster in France. The quarrel between them and their
                    adherents was complicated by the existence of the Lollards, and the question of
                    peace or war. In both matters Gloucester, as persecutor of the Lollards and head
                    of the war-party, appears to have taken the more popular side. The coronation of
                    the young king at Westminster (November 6, 1429) put a formal end to the regency
                    of Bedford and Gloucester, but not to the intrigues of the latter. The House of
                    Commons was unable to interfere with any effect; the Lords were mostly engaged
                    on one side or the other. The death of Bedford removed the only guarantee of
                    peace, and Gloucester attacked Beaufort with more virulence than ever after his
                    brother’s death. In the midst of these troubles Henry VI. came of age (1442).
                    Had he been a great statesman, he would have found an almost hopeless task
                    before him. But, unfit as he felt himself to be, he naturally shrunk from
                    politics, and was much more intent on completing his foundations at Eton and
                    Cambridge than on healing the disorders of his country. The work of government
                    was left mainly in the hands of Cardinal Beaufort and the earl of Suffolk, who
                    did their best to secure peace with France. On the other side the dukes of
                    Gloucester and York headed the opposition, and took up the cry of reform, with
                    the object of infusing vigour into the government at home and abroad. Suffolk,
                    however, won a great victory in the truce with France (1444); and through the
                    young queen Margaret, whose marriage was chiefly due to his exertions, he
                    obtained complete influence over the king. The suspicious death of Gloucester
                    (1447), followed in six weeks by the death of his rival Beaufort, together with
                    the appointment of York to the governorship of Ireland, left Suffolk master of
                    the situation. But such a position could not be long maintained in the face of
                    the odium which always attaches to a favourite, and the complete failure of his
                    foreign policy brought about his fall (1450). The king in vain attempted to save
                    him, and by so doing shared his unpopularity, while the partial concessions he
                    made to the demands of the rebels under Jack Cade only postponed the inevitable
                    outbreak. The duke of York now made himself the mouthpiece of popular
                    discontent. When the final loss of France had exhausted the country’s patience,
                    and the birth of an heir to the throne had destroyed his hope of the succession,
                    he took advantage of Henry’s mental derangement to claim the protectorate
                    (1453). It was granted him early next year, but in 1455 the king recovered his
                    senses, and York was deprived of power. Unable to endure this he marched on
                    London, and on May 22, 1455, the Wars of the Roses began in the battle of St
                    Albans. The effect of the battle was to bring the queen to the front as the
                    leader of the royalists, and to make the quarrel between her and York
                    irreconcilable. During the four years of uneasy quiet which followed the first
                    collision, Henry tried hard to keep the peace. But all his efforts were vain.
                    When the struggle broke out anew, and the Yorkists won the battle of
                    Northampton, he was forced to consent to an arrangement by which his son w as
                    excluded from the succession and York recognized as heir to the kingdom (1460).
                    The settlement was of short duration. York himself lost his life at Wakefield,
                    but his son seized the crown and was acknowledged king (March 4, 1461). The
                    battle of Towton brought the struggle to an end for ten years, and the capture
                    of Henry in 1465 seemed to secure Edw ard IV. on the throne. Five years later a
                    sudden revolution hurled him from it, and restored the wretched prisoner for a
                    while to liberty, but the battle of Barnet destroyed his hopes again. He had
                    time to know that his son had died at Tewkesbury, that his&gt; wife was a
                    prisoner, and that his cause was finally lost, before death released him from
                    captivity on May 21, 1471. Gentle, pure, and generous, full of good intentions,
                    enthu&gt; <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n695/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0695-0662"/> siastic in the cause of religion and learning, he
                    was utterly without the qualities which were indispensable to a mediaeval king,
                    and he paid the penalty of incapacity in a miserable death and in the
                    destruction of his house. But this very incapacity was an element of the utmost
                    importance in the history of his time. The weakness of his character made him
                    the puppet of contending factions, and his well-meant but misguided efforts to
                    govern England as a constitutional king led only to anarchy and the temporary
                    downfall of the constitution.</p>
