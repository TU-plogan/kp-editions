                <p><label type="entry">HERIOT, <hi rend="smallcaps">George</hi></label> (1563-1623),
                    the founder of Heriot’s Hospital, Edinburgh, was descended from an old family of
                    some consideration in the county of Haddington; and his father, a goldsmith in
                    Edinburgh, for some time represented the city in the Scottish parliament. George
                    was born in 1563, and after receiving a good education was apprenticed to his
                    father’s trade. In 1586 he married the daughter of a deceased Edinburgh
                    merchant, and with the assistance of her patrimony set up in business on his own
                    account. At first he occupied a small “buith” at the north-east corner of St
                    Giles’s Church, and afterwards a more pretentious shop at the west end of the
                    building. To the business of a goldsmith he joined that of a money-lender, and
                    in 1597 he had acquired such a reputation that he was appointed goldsmith to
                    Queen Anne, consort of James VI. In 1601 he became jeweller to the king, and on
                    the removal of the court to London, he followed his royal master thither, and
                    occupied a shop opposite the Exchange. Heriot was largely indebted for his
                    fortune to the extravagance of the queen, and to the imitation of this
                    extravagance by the nobility. Latterly he had such an extensive business as a
                    jeweller that on one occasion a Government proclamation was issued calling upon
                    all the magistrates of the kingdom to aid him in securing the workmen he
                    required. He died in London, 10th February 1623. In 1608, having some time
                    previously lost his first wife, he married Alison Primrose, daughter of James
                    Primrose, grandfather of the first earl of Rosebery, but she died in 1612; by
                    neither marriage had he any issue. The surplus of his estate, after deducting
                    legacies to his nearest relations and some of his more intimate friends, was
                    bequeathed to found a hospital for the education of freemen’s sons of the town
                    of Edinburgh; and its value afterwards increased so greatly as to supply funds
                    for the erection of several Heriot foundation schools in different parts of the
                    city. For a notice of Heriot’s Hospital, see <hi rend="smallcaps"
