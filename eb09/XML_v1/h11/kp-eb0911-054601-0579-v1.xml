                    1560-1627), one of tho earliest writers of English history as distinguished from
                    the old chroniclers, was born about 1560 at or near Felixstow on the coast of
                    Suffolk. According to a statement in his will he “received the means of his
                    education” out of the parish of Felixstow. It is affirmed by the old authorities
                    that he studied at Cambridge and took the degree of doctor in civil law, but his
                    name does not occur in any of the registers. In 1599 he published <hi
                    rend="italic">The First Part of the Life and Raigne of King Henrie the I III.,
                    extending to the end of the first yeare of his raigne,</hi> which, from its
                    dedication to the earl of Essex, and a passage it contained on hereditary
                    rights, led to the author’s imprisonment by Elizabeth. The queen also caused
                    Francis Bacon to search the book for “places in it that might be drawn within
                    case of treason,” who reported, “For treason surely I find none, but for felony
                    very many,”—explaining that many of his sentences had been stolen from Cornelius
                    Tacitus. Notwithstanding this jocular exculpation Hayward was continued in
                    prison, in all probability until after the death of the queen. On the accession
                    of J ames I. he courted that monarch’s favour by the publication of two
                    political pamphlets— <hi rend="italic">On the Right of Succession</hi> (1603),
                    and <hi rend="italic">Ä</hi><hi rend="italic">Treatise of Union of England and
                    Scotland</hi> (1604); and in 1610 he was appointed historiographer along with
                    Camden of the college which King James attempted to found at Chelsea. In 1613 he
                    published his <hi rend="italic">Lives of the Three Norman Kings of England,</hi>
                    which he wrote at the request of Prince Henry. In 1616 he was admitted an
                    advocate of Doctors Commons, and in 1619 he received the honour of knighthood.
                    He died 27th June 1627. Among his manuscripts was found <hi rend="italic">The
                    Life and Raigne ofK. Edward VI.</hi>, first published in 1630, and <hi
                    rend="italic">Certain Yeres of Queen Elizabeth’s Raigne,</hi> the beginning of
                    which was printed in an edition of the <hi rend="italic">Reign of Edward
                    VI.,</hi> published in 1636, but which was first published in a complete form in
                    1840, for the Camden Society, under the editorship of John Bruce, who prefixed
                    an introduction on the life and writings of the author. Hayward was
                    conscientious and diligent in obtaining information, and, although his reasoning
                    on questions of morality is often childish, his descriptions are generally
                    graphic and vigorous. Notwithstanding his imprisonment by Elizabeth, his
                    portrait of the qualities of her mind and person is flattering rather than
                    detractive.</p>
