                    >Introduction.</hi></p>
                <p>THE term hieroglyphics is used, with others, by Greek and Latin writers to
                    describe the sacred characters of the ancient Egyptian language in its classical
                    phase. It is used by the moderns for various systems of writing in which figures
                    of objects take the place of conventional siθ∙ns. This article is limited to an
                    account of Egyptian hieroglyphics, with some notice of the derived systems
                    called hieratic and demotic.</p>
                <p>It is no longer necessary in an article like the present to give a history of the
                    interpretation of hieroglyphics and a sketch of the grammar of ancient Egyptian.
                    What students need is a statement of the main results as to the Egyptian
                    characters themselves and a systematic bibliography.</p>
                <p>The written language of the ancient Egyptians remained the same from the date of
                    the earliest monuments (Third Dynasty) until the age of the Ethiopian kings <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(b.c.</hi> cir. 700), when a vulgar dialect expressing the
                    common speech is first found in written documents. Then, if not earlier, the
                    older phase of the language became the classical Egyptian, sometimes called the
                    sacred dialect, to distinguish it from the vulgar dialect. The classical
                    Egyptian was used almost as late as the fall of paganism generally for all
                    documents but legal and commercial ones, for which the vulgar dialect was

                    time of the Empire differences of dialect due to difference of speech in Upper
                    and Lower Egypt had crept into correspondence (Bnigsch, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gram.</hi><hi rend="italic">Hiér.,</hi> 93). Ultimately vulgar forms and
                    constructions are distinctly traceable in the sacred language (Id. 1. c.; cf.
                    Id., <hi rend="italic">Geogr. Iηschr.,</hi> i. 94, 95). There are also natural
                    changes due to development or decay or both, and artificial changes due to
                    fashion. Modifications of grammatical forms and the growth of style are
                    instances of natural changes, and the direct borrowing cf Semitic words by the
                    scribes of the Ramessides, and, what is still more remarkable, the actual
                    Semiticization of Egyptian words, are examples of artificial changes (Maspero,
                    <hi rend="italic">Hist.,</hi> 337, 338).</p></note></p>
                <p>It is necessary to observe that although Egyptian is not proved to be a Semitic
                    language, it contains in its oldest known form undoubted Semitic elements, both
                    in structure and roots. The constant comparison with the Semitic languages which
                    is here necessary is therefore not merely employed for the sake of the analogies
                    that may be discovered, but on the ground of partial affinity, which, however,
                    must not be strained.</p>
                <p>It must also be borne in mind that the grammar of ancient Egyptian is in its
                    infancy. We know many of its principal facts, but we do not know them
                    accurately. For instance, we know the forms of many tenses of the verb, and can
                    perhaps place these tenses in groups, as past, present, and future, but we
                    cannot define the different senses of the various tenses of each group.
                    Similarly, in Coptic we do not always know the shades of difference within a
                    group of tenses. It may be that in Coptic these shades have disappeared through
                    the decay of the language, but it would be rash to affirm this of the classical
                    Egyptian. Thus this essential part of the grammar will not be understood until
                    the verb has been thoroughly worked downwards from the oldest texts through ⅛he
                    classical language, then through the demotic, and then the Coptic, and again in
                    inverted order from the Coptic upwards. The same labour has to be performed for
                    the whole grammar in each of the three phases of the language, before we can
                    speak with any certainty of Egyptian grammar. This is said in no disparagement
                    of the admirable work already done, but as a necessary caution to the
                    student.</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The Systems of Writing.</hi></p>
                <p>The elements of Egyptian writing are composed of a certain number of actual
                    objects, natural or artificial, imitated by drawing or engraving.</p>
                <p>Egyptian writing falls into three systems—(1) hieroglyphic, (2) hieratic, (3)
                    demotic or enchorial, the hieratic being a simplified form of hieroglyphic, and
                    the demotic of hieratic. The complete designing of hiero∙ glyphics required
                    skill and time. They thus came to be reduced in writing to the simplest forms
                    which retained the leading characteristics. These were called by Champoilion
                    linear hieroglyphics. The linear forms not lending themselves with sufficient
                    readiness to very rapid writing, a further abbreviation was made, by which the
                    forms became almost conventional,—the original type usually ceasing to be
                    immediately recognizable: this cursive system Champoilion called hieratic. The
                    demotic writing is a new abbreviation of the hieratic: it gradually departs so
                    far from the original types as to appear to consist of arbitrary signs.</p>
                <p>Hieroglyphics are written either in horizontal lines or vertical columns, and are
                    ordinarily read from the right. The heads of animals and the like shew from what
                    direction to begin reading. Hieratic and demotic are written from right to left,
                    in horizontal lines. In very early times hieratic is sometimes written in
                    vertical columns.</p>
                <p>(The hieroglyphic is a lapidary system, the hieratic and demotic purely systems
                    for common writing. Consequently the hieroglyphic is the most difficult of the
                    three to read, as the engraver or painter paid great attention to the
                    symmetrical appearance of each group of signs, and grammatical forms were hence
                    often omitted. In hieratic and demotic the signs follow each other without
                    interruption of the natural order, and the grammatical forms are usually given,
                    and even more fully.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Characters in Relation to their Use in Writing.</hi></p>
                <p>Egyptian writing is composed of a mixture of signs of two distinct classes—(1)
                    ideographic, each sign representing an idea; (2) phonetic, representing a sound,
                    either (a) a simple articulation (alphabetic) or (β) a complete sound, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> a complete syllable (syllabic). The two classes were
                    combined according to fixed rules in writing words.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Ideographic Signs.</hi></p>
                <p>This class may be best divided into (a) representative signs and (∕3) symbolic
                    (tropical).</p>
                <p>The representative signs exactly express the idea of the object of which they
                    present an image, as a star.</p>
                <p>The symbolic (tropical) signs represent an idea by the aid of certain analogies
                    which the mind sees between the symbol and the idea attached to it. A simple
                    symbol presents a single object, as the sun Q, when used in the symbolic sense
                    <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi> day.” A symbol is complex when uniting more
                    objects than one to convey to the mind a single idea, thus a star suspended
                    beneath the celestial vault <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> &lt; represented <hi
                    rend="superscript"> a</hi> night.” Under <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n832/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0832-0795"/> complex signs should be placed figures of
                    divinities in which the human form has special headdresses or insignia.</p>
                <p>The value of ideographic signs may be discovered in various ways. The
                    representative signs only need that the thing represented should be determined.
                    The symbolic signs are often (rather, sometimes) explained by classical authors;
                    they may also be explained by careful study of bilingual documents, as the
                    Rosetta Stone (and the Decree of Canopus). The sense, and more certainly the
                    reading, can be discovered by an exact knowledge of the words written by
                    phonetic combined with ideographic signs, and above all by the variants allowed
                    in writing the same word with signs of different classes.</p>
                <p>(The result may be thus tabulated:</p>

                <p>Dr. Brugsch in his Gram. Hier. (p. 3) gives the following scheme:</p>

                </table>
                <p>Here the ideographic signs are classed, not according to their nature but
                    according to their use, which will be later noticed. Μ. de Rougé’s seems the
                    more logical classification.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Phonetic Signs.</hi></p>
                <p>As the phonetic signs represent either (a) a simple articulation or (∕3) a
                    complete sound, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> a complete syllable, the
                    hieroglyphic method comprehends (a) an alphabet and (3) a syllabary.</p>
                <p>Champoilion held that the alphabet originated from giving to each object the
                    phonetic value of the initial of its name: thus the mouth &lt;⊂&gt; “ro” would
                    become <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi> r.” This probable principle cannot now be
                    tested for a great part of the alphabet, probably in consequence of the loss of
                    many archaic words.</p>
                <p>The alphabet of the Greek and Roman periods presents a great number of homophones
                    .for each articulation. The more we advance towards antiquity the more the
                    method simplifies, and the alphabet of primitive times admits but a very small
                    number of homophones. Dr. Lepsius <hi rend="italic">{Lettre</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi><hi rend="italic">ßoselhni)</hi> first scientifically
                    treated this distinction.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Articulations of the Egyptian Language.</hi></p>
                <p>The determination of the exact number of articulations which the scribes
                    distinguished in the Egyptian language presents great difficulties. Comparison
                    with the articulations of languages which occur in bilingual texts cannot give
                    sufficiently precise results, for the shades of sound are far from being the
                    same in the languages thus placed in juxtaposition. The Romans and Greeks had
                    many letters which, though quite distinct in their languages, the Egyptians
                    confounded in their transcriptions. On the other hand, there were some Egyptian
                    articulations preserved in the Coptic language which had no special
                    representative in Greek or Latin; hence certain letters derived from the demotic
                    were added to the Greek alphabet on its adoption by the Copts. (It must also be
                    remarked that the Greek and Roman rule was an age of literary decay and ruin for
                    classical Egyptian, in the depression of which little effort seems to have been
                    made to represent accurately foreign sounds. The student must not be misled by
                    the greater accuracy at this time in rendering the vowels, which was merely due
                    to the decay of the system of writing, by which the Egyptian vowels usually
                    following certain consonant signs came to be disregarded.) Happily those
                    Egyptian articulations which were unknown t□ the Greeks and Romans have at least
                    analogues in thι Semitic languages. Moreover, the many transcriptions of Semitic
                    words (made while the Egyptian was iη full vigour), joined to the traditions of
                    the Coptiα language (which has ceased for a hundred years to be a living
                    speech), enable us to appreciate sufficiently those articulations unknown to the
                    Greeks and Romans (and this indication may be followed in the cases of the rest
                    of the letters).</p>
                <p>The words common to Egyptian and Semitic in the earliest known condition of the
                    Egyptian language must be omitted from comparison; the more exact transcriptions
                    of the scribes of the Ramessides (Dynasties XIX., XX.) must take precedence of
                    the looser ones of the earlier period of the Empire (Dynasty XVIII.). Coptic,
                    having long existed in a languishing state and under the influence of Arabic,
                    whence the colouring of the latest dialect, the Bashmuric (Revillout ap. Rossi,
                    <hi rend="italic">Gram. Coρto-Ger.,</hi> 30, n. l),and certain peculiarities of
                    the present pronunciation, is not an absolutely safe guide.</p>
                <p>It might be thought that the study of the various modes in which words are
                    written would furnish an exact table of homophones, and give us at once the list
                    of distinct articulations; thus we might suppose that variants shewing two
                    characters might enable us to assume their identity, as when in reading Greek we
                    assume that <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> is the same as θ. But in Egyptian, as in
                    other written languages, there are certain licensed irregularities of
                    orthography, and also oscillations between the different shades of sound in the
                    same class of letters when, used for the same word: a small number of variants
                    between two letters therefore does not prove their perfect homophony. Hence
                    certain differences of opinion among Egyptologists, according to the weight,
                    greater or less, which they give to this or that series of variants. Thus the
                    number of letters under the “t” group differs with different scholars.</p>
                <p>Without denying that there may have been some shades of sound in the different
                    signs here called homo* phones, as in the sounds represented by the English
                    “th,” the chief guide should be the estimate the Copts made of the elements of
                    their language, when they adopted the Greek alphabet, completing it for their
                    purpose by adding six special letters taken from demotic writing.</p>
                <p>The Egyptian Christians in adopting the Greek alphabet, which had vowels with
                    fixed sounds, made their writing undergo a radical change: up to that time they
                    had only vague vowels which were, as in the Semitic alphabets, simple
                    aspirations, susceptible of being coloured by the sounds of different vowels
                    (but. this vague character must be limited by the vowels falling, as in Semitic,
                    into three groups of sounds; the vagueness was therefore not unlimited. This
                    characteristic of the old Egyptian influenced the Coptic, which presents in the
                    vowels varieties of orthography of the same word, these varieties, however,
                    usually falling within the three ancient groups. It is only in the Coptic
                    helping vowel that absolute vagueness is found, like that of the primitive
                    “shëva” of Hebrew.)</p>
                <p>Following these indications we find 15 leading articulations in Egyptian the
                    shades of sound which may be most certainly distinguished would indicate an
                    alphabet of 21 divisions. They are transcribed by letters taken, one, χ, not to
                    be confused with the Coptic excepted, from the Latin alphabet, according to the
                    principles of the Standard Alphabet. Cf. Lepsius, <hi rend="italic">Standard

                <p>During the Pharaonic periods ten homophone letters were added: one is very
                    ancient; some appear under the Ramessides; others under the Saïtic Twenty-sixth
                    Dynasty. Probably they were introduced in order to render it easier to nil
                    spaces in sculptured inscriptions.</p>
                <p>It must be observed that all simple letters can in writing radical forms be
                    replaced by syllabic signs.</p>
                <p>These articulations have now to be examined under natural classes: their
                    interchange has to be noticed, their use in the transcription of Latin, Greek,
                    and Semitic words, and the rules according to which Egyptian words are
                    transformed into Coptic words in the two chief dialects, the Sahidic and
                    Memphitic. (This branch of the subject is of great importance for comparative
                    philology, as our endeavour should be to ascertain as nearly as we can the
                    fundamental sounds of ancient Egyptian, and then to compare these sounds with
                    those of languages to which it has relation.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Soft Aspirate, and Vague Vowels.</hi></p>
                <p>The Egyptian vowels have two distinct uses—(1) as aspirates, or initials in the
                    syllable, and (2) as vague vowels, either final or medial.</p>
                <p>The Copts have marked no difference of aspiration between the initial vowels of
                    syllables in their language, which correspond to ancient words beginning with
                    [∣, or -—o.</p>
                <p>When these signs are employed as vowels, or “matres lectionis,’’ it does not
                    appear that one of them was used by preference for one sound more than another:
                    they remain vague in the full force of the term. This vague “a” is unlike the ∣
                    of prolongation of the Arabs, which (though otherwise susceptible of being
                    coloured by all the vowels) then becomes a true <hi rend="italic">a.</hi>
                    (Notwithstanding this vagueness it is safest to transcribe this group by <hi
                    rend="italic">a,</hi> as there were special signs for the semi-vowels <hi
                    rend="italic">i</hi> and w, and the helping vowel which we write <hi
                    rend="italic">é</hi> was not written. The <hi rend="italic">a</hi> must,
                    however, be considered a symbol, vague to the extent of the Hebrew X when not
                    vowelled.)</p>
                <p>The final vague vowels do not vary much between themselves in the ancient texts;
                    the orthography of each word was very stable, and, besides, the choice of the ·
                    final vowel depended much on the preceding consonant, each sign having a vague
                    vowel which it seems to prefer. (See the Section on “Expletive Vowels and
                    Complements of Simple Leiters,” and observe the usage of syllabic signs.) They
                    sometimes interchange, and are even replaced by the vowels <hi rend="italic"
                    >u</hi> and <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> which as finals share their vague
                    character. .This system lasted .to the latest periods of demotic writing.
                    (Coptic shews the same instability of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and the kindred
                    vowels.)</p>
                <p>The three signs of the soft aspirate sometimes interchange: (∣ and "⅜X serve
                    equally as initials in Greek and Roman names, as well as in Egyptian words. The
                    group of two a’s, <hi rend="italic">aa,</hi> was ordinarily written <hi
                    rend="superscript"> a</hi> ^' <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi> " <hi
                    rend="superscript"> d</hi> * <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> f° <hi

                <p>ß is used with a marked preference to transcribe the Semitic X.</p>
                <p>On the contrary <hi rend="subscript"> j</hi> —o seems preferentially used to
                    express long vowels, or such as were emphatically pronounced. In the Semitic
                    transcriptions it corresponds habitually to <hi rend="italic">V,</hi> when that
                    letter is initial. But it was not the same articulation. Under the Nineteenth
                    and Twentieth Dynasties, and particularly in the papyri, a great degree of
                    exactness was sought in the transcription of Semitic words. The scribes often
                    then expressed the <hi rend="italic">ÿ</hi> by the syllabic &lt;-=, which has
                    the value of <hi rend="italic">ag,.</hi> It seems that the arm alone did not
                    offer them an approximation which they judged sufficient.</p>
                <p>The Hebrews transcribed o by y in many words. The (J□ of the Copts answers
                    oftener to .—o than to the other vowels (and this seems a convincing proof that
                    the signs of the <hi rend="italic">u</hi> vowel had no stable sound).</p>
                <p>There are also some cases of permutation between <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and the
                    aspirate <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> analogous to the variants between ∏ and X
                    (but we must be careful not to confound true variants with a root in Egyptian
                    augmented by a preformative <hi rend="italic">h).</hi></p>
                <p>When the vowel <hi rend="italic">a</hi> should form a syllable by itself it is
                    often followed by the sign , which indicates the voice, by the representation of
                    a man, his hand to his mouth. Transcriptions of proper names thus beginning, as
                    °(∣t}&gt; Apoplιis, shew that should <hi rend="italic">a PP i</hi> ordinarily be
                    pronounced <hi rend="italic">a.</hi></p>
                <p>Ιhe final vague vowels could be omitted in writing; numerous variants shew there
                    was no rule in this matter; but the hieratic, preserves them more habitually. In
                    writing themedial vowel of a syllable of two (or three) consonants, it was very
                    ordinarily placed after the consonants and not between them; this is true of <hi
                    rend="italic">a, a</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> l</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ä,</hi><hi rend="italic">u, i.</hi> Thus the name of the divinity ® ⅛ <hi

                <p><hi rend="italic">l7</hi> and <hi rend="italic">i</hi> could be initial
                    semi-vowels or vague vowels; «initial answers in many Coptic words to the
                    diphthongs OY(J(J, OYG, &amp;c., without being followed in writing by a second
                    vowel: here it is an initial semi-vowel. Z7 necessarily carried with it its
                    aspiration; there are some variants with the aspirate ∣, <hi rend="italic"
                    >h,</hi> which recalls <hi rend="italic">i.</hi> The two signs , @ , interchange
                    readily, and may be considered to be absolute homophones, but was much more
                    frequently used ir. the earliest times.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">U,</hi> considered as a vowel, was vague, and in a larger
                    measure than the Hebrew 1, for we find it transcribed even by <hi rend="italic"
                    >i</hi> and by <hi rend="italic">e.</hi> It interchanges with <hi rend="italic"
                    >i</hi> in Egyptian words, and sometimes even with <hi rend="italic">a.</hi> In
                    Hebrew we remark frequently the same oscillation between the sounds w and <hi
                    rend="italic">i</hi> in the këri këtib of the Biblical text. In Coptic this
                    vowel has generally produced OY, O, (J□, but very often also G and the other
                    vowels or diphthongs; the group <hi rend="italic">,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >au,</hi> answers to G, e, in the Coptic and the Greek transcriptions; it would
                    be thus equivalent to X in the Masoretic system.</p>
                <p>Of the two signs for <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> Q and ∖∖ , the second is evidently
                    shorthand for the first. <hi rend="italic">I</hi> initial should always be
                    considered to be a semi-vowel with the value <hi rend="italic">ia, iu:</hi> in
                    this use we ordinarily find (j &gt; which better fills the initial space; ∖∖
                    serves oftener for i vague final. Thus the verb <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> “to
                    go,” was written with vague <hi rend="italic">a</hi> initial for the aspirate,
                    and {j , or ∖∖, as final vowels {∣ , _/\ , or</p>

                <p>7∖ , «, which is regular in consequence of the vagueness of the vowels. (The two
                    forms are traceable in Coptic.) The signs Q and ∖∖ interchange as much as their
                    forms permit, which fit very differently into the composition of groups.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">I,</hi> semi-vowel, does not vary with any other letter; it is
                    only found in a very small number of Egyptian words, but it is much used in the

                    which 'comprehends nearly all the vowel sounds.</p>
                <p>(The unwritten aspirate or short vowel is not noticed in this place by Μ. de
                    Rouge. It will be seen, under the Section on “the Transcription of Vowels
                    Omitted,” that he does not admit the transcription of an unwritten vowel except
                    as a makeshift, or in other words, that he does not allow the Egyptians to have
                    had a vowel sound never written. The existence of the supposed vowel seems,
                    however, certain on these grounds. Some syllables never take a vowel except for
                    an unusual form,—the root and the ordinary derivatives never being vowelled, and
                    a vowel only appearing in what is obviously a derivative formed by lengthening
                    the vowel. Further, the Coptic has such a vowel marked by peculiar forms v or —
                    above a letter, or in the latter case above a letter or syllable, indicating
                    that the sound, hero generally G, was omitted in writing by the ancient
                    Egyptians; and still more remarkably the Coptic use is sometimes found where the
                    older writing would lead us to expect it. In ancient Egyptian the use of this
                    helping vowel is implied, as an aspirate in a syllable written with a consonant
                    alone, as <hi rend="italic">n, m, &lt;=&gt; r;</hi> in Coptic</p>
                <p>If, ΛΛ, p, and as a medial vowel in a syllable of two consonants, as <hi
                    rend="italic">tm,</hi> “not,” in Coptic ’ TΛΛ. In Coptic, as already mentioned,
                    it is generally read G, ë, but had this been its constant sound it would have
                    been represented by G, and would of course have been needless. It is safest to
                    read the old Egyptian helping vowel ë. It resembles the Hebrew Shëva, as
                    including its variants Hateph-Pathah, Hateph-Segol, and Hateph-Kames.</p>
                <p>Μ. de Rouge’s section on this subject seems wanting in his usual clearness. This
                    is, however, due to the inherent difficulty of the subject. The Egyptian vowels,
                    except when used as semi vowels, are undoubtedly vague. Thus, in the writing of
                    Semitic words under the Ramessides, while the consonants are most carefully
                    represented, the vowels afiected by those consonants are frequently used, and
                    the apparent pronunciation is distorted. Consequently, though we have no
                    difficulty in separating the vowels into the <hi rend="italic">a, i,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">u</hi> group, adding the helping vowel, or short ë, because
                    the use of the <hi rend="italic">i</hi> and <hi rend="italic">u</hi> vowels as
                    semi-vowels gives them and the third vowel (a) thus limited a certain definite
                    character, yet, when we have to treat of vowels pure and simple, the distinction
                    of these classes vanishes. Thus the idea of fixed vowels, with however wide
                    legitimate extension, is constantly rising in the enquiry to be as constantly
                    suppressed by the vagueness of their use. It must, therefore, be held that the
                    transcriptions we adopt do not give the accurate pronunciation, inasmuch as the
                    vowel constantly, but not always, depended upon the consonant preceding, and
                    vowel complements are even added where they were not pronounced. This is proved
                    by Greek transcriptions, as will be seen later. On the other hand, the vowelling
                    of Greek and Latin proper names shews that the vagueness of the vowels was not
                    absolute, for the Egyptian scribes in the decay of the old style, no longer
                    bound by the ancient usage of complements, employed the vowels with such
                    accuracy as their limitation in sounds permitted, subject to the carelessness of
                    the age. Of course these vowels could not accurately represent the Latin five or
                    the Greek seven. Perhaps it may be suggested, in conclusion, that some idea of
                    the Egyptian vowel system may be formed by a comparison with unpointed
                    Hebrew.)</p>

                    rend="superscript"> for</hi> “Wood,”</p>
                <p>Coptic CΓCOC∣. (Μ. de Rouge calls this letter, so used, a vowel or variant of <hi
                    rend="italic">u,</hi> and in the example just cited characterizes it as a short
                    vowel, but it seems more analogous to 1 after a vowel, when not quiescent, in
                    the present or ordinary Hebrew pronunciation.) In Greek words <hi
                    rend="superscript"> x</hi> y— does not render <hi rend="italic">φ</hi>; the
                    Egyptians used either 0, », or the combination 0 ΓD, <hi rend="italic">ph.</hi>
                    But in the transcription of Semitic words we sometimes find κ— for Ö. In Coptic,
                    besides C∣, this letter sometimes becomes &lt;∣) and β,.</p>
                <p>Like the Hebrew 3 the Egyptian <hi rend="italic">b</hi> comprised the two shades
                    of sound 3 <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and 3 (δ⅛ or) <hi rend="italic">v</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> t</hi> at least in the less ancient periods. The Copts
                    seem also to have known the two sounds, though their one E has been generally
                    transcribed by <hi rend="italic">υ.</hi> The transcriptions of the Greeks do not
                    aid us, for their <hi rend="italic">β</hi> was probably sounded <hi
                    rend="italic">υ.</hi> The evidence of the Semitic words is perhaps more precise
                    in the system of transcription of the (hieratic) papyri of the Nineteenth
                    Dynasty. 3, <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> is rendered either by <hi rend="italic"
                    >p</hi> or by the group J <hi rend="italic">bp;</hi> 3 (⅛Λ) by Jj alone: the
                    ordinary sound of <hi rend="italic">b</hi> should therefore approach <hi
                    rend="italic">v.</hi> In the hieroglyphics they were often content with <hi
                    rend="italic">, b,</hi> homophone of J, for 3. (The weight of this reasoning
                    partly depends upon the antiquity of the Masore(ic punctuation, which is,
                    however, supported by the double rendering of the Egyptians.)</p>
                <p>The compound <hi rend="italic">bp,</hi> introduced for Semitic words, is found
                    later employed in hieratic for Egyptian words, no doubt to characterize the
                    pronunciation <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> 3 , better than by alone, or the group
                    J, which serves as its variant in these same words. The signs J and sometimes
                    interchange; offener J replaces alone; they also exchange, but rarely, with <hi
                    rend="italic">p</hi> and ∕. The ancient <hi rend="italic">b</hi> produced
                    regularly the Coptic 1A <hi rend="subscript">;</hi> and by affinity OY, ∏,
                    &lt;∣&gt;, C∣, and Ut.</p>
                <p>T he two signs of <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> □ and , are complete homophones. The
                    Memphitic dialect aspirated <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> and used φ in many words
                    where the Sahidic used ∏. Here the Sahidic has been more faithful to the ancient
                    pronunciation: in fact <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> Greek was sometimes rendered by
                    the group <hi rend="smallcaps">□ΓlI ,</hi><hi rend="italic">ph,</hi> and the
                    Hebrew D by —, ∕. This ancient Egyptian letter was then y?; it also corresponds
                    exactly to S. It was further used to transcribe approximately 3, as already
                    remarked.</p>
                <p>It produced regularly in Coptic the Sahidic ∏ and the Memphitic ψ. Affinities
                    occasionally introduced C∣ or β,. The ancient <hi rend="italic">p</hi> also
                    presents some instances of varying with <hi rend="italic">b.</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Palatals.</hi></p>
                <p>This class of letters lends itself to great varieties of pronunciation which
                    render them difficult to understand; it is in their nature to modify themselves
                    considerably by the simple change of the vowel which follows them. The Greek and
                    Roman transcriptions would lead us to consider the four signs Zl, , U, and as
                    perfect homophones. But we are led to another opinion, if we consider the
                    transcriptions of Semitic words, and the Coptic derived words.</p>
                <p>The Semitic transcriptions afford the following results: 1, Hand <hi
                    rend="italic">(j}</hi> answering to) £ <hi rend="italic">(plι^)</hi> are almost
                    always rendered by; 2, 3 corresponds to and p to 21; but this second rule is not
                    so faithfully observed as the first.</p>
                <p>In the Coptic language there are here two distinct types; 1, K Sahidic, aspirated
                    as in the Memphitic; 2, <hi rend="italic">6~</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> j</hi> Sahidic corresponding to X Memphitic, but sometimes
                    identical.</p>
                <p>Taking the Copts as guides we distinguish two palatals, which we mark as <hi
                    rend="italic">k</hi> and <hi rend="italic">k.</hi> U did not exist in their
                    writing, but in some rare cases which do not correspond to a special ancient
                    fetter: in a small number of words where it is derived from s. <hi rend="italic"
                    >, lc,</hi> it is produced by the presence of the nasal which precedes; thus
                    ΛHΓ, I, from</p>
                <p>In studying more closely the three signs ZJ, , U, we are easily convinced of the
                    perfect homophony of 1 1 with -&gt;⊂^ι. The equality of <hi rend="italic">Δ</hi>
                    and LJ may seem more doubtful; variants exist, but they are not frequent.
                    However, we find the group /1 LJ, where the first letter only doubles the
                    second, as we have seen in the group J 7χ≥ <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> » and we
                    are thus authorized to connect intimately <hi rend="italic">Δ</hi>, 1 1, and and
                    transcribe them by <hi rend="italic">k.</hi></p>
                <p>To this articulation correspond regularly, in Coptic, K Sahidic and</p>
                <p>Memphitic, 6~ and X less frequently, &lt;⅛) and g, as rare exceptions.</p>
                <p>The rule of derivation is different in what concerns ß , and it is there above
                    all that we recognize the distinct type' preserved in the Coptic <hi
                    rend="italic">(S~</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">.</hi> Tho sign fi , which we
                    transcribe <hi rend="italic">k,</hi> shows s^me ancient cases of variants with
                    the preceding signs, and the Greek transcriptions do not give us sufficient
                    reasons for making a distinction. The Semitic transcriptions are more decisive;
                    the Û, as already noticed, is quite specially set apart to render J, and V
                    answering to £ · Tho Coptic derived forms strengthen this first result; they
                    quite regularly class themselves under the Sahidic (5"Γ answering to the
                    Memphitic <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n835/mode/1up"

                    both dialects. The exceptions are as follows, in order of frequency :—1, <hi

                    in both dialects; 4, X Sahidic, <hi rend="italic">6~</hi> Memphitic.</p>
                <p>The graphic origin of the Coptic <hi rend="italic">(s~'</hi> is doubtful. It is
                    incorrect in our judgment to derive it, as hitherto, from the demotic ® ' ,
                    coming from cΓ * , hieratic of: the suffix of the second person K has been
                    rendered as far as the latest periods, almost contemporary with the Coptic, by
                    this demotic sign; consequently we ought to find it in Coptic under the form
                    (Wif this letter came from that sign; on the contrary, K is used for this
                    pronoun. may have come from the demotic form of fl , through the hieratic.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dentals.</hi></p>
                <p>The exact appreciation of the Egyptian dentals is hard. It seems certain that the
                    three homophones g—&gt; &gt; <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi> ∣ » answer to a <hi
                    rend="italic">t,</hi> and that " <hi rend="superscript"> λ</hi> (<hi
                    rend="subscript"> j</hi> ∣ , are represented in Coptic by the special
                    articulation X . The sign ’ =≡&gt; seems to have the character of an
                    intermediate shade of sound. In the Greek and Roman names, <hi rend="italic">τ,
                    θ,</hi> and δ are transcribed by all the signs without distinction (the Roman
                    being transcribed through Greek forms). In the Semitic transcriptions ∏ and □
                    are rendered by ≡=&gt; ’ <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi> ’ <hi rend="superscript"
                    > ant</hi> ^ <hi rend="superscript"> m0re rare</hi> ly &lt;-~=^⅛; *1 is
                    transcribed by with a marked preference; Î and ¥ answer exclusively to ^ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> v</hi> I and its homophones (including a later sign).</p>
                <p>The Coptic offers two certain types, <hi rend="superscript"> τ</hi> T, becoming
                    θ-Memphitic, and X; the trace of a third variety seems also preserved in the
                    syllabic <hi rend="superscript"> τ</hi> f <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi>. We are
                    thus led to distinguish three consonants <hi rend="italic">t, t,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">i'.</hi></p>
                <p>The three signs ≡=&gt;, ^, ∣, <hi rend="italic">t,</hi> conduct themselves as
                    perfect homophones. The Greek and Roman names shew them to be used for τ, <hi
                    rend="italic">θ, δ</hi>; but the hierogrammats when they sought a more
                    scrupulous transcription of <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> used the group ∣~∣ , <hi
                    rend="italic">th</hi> (cf. □ ΓΠ, <hi rend="italic">ph),</hi> which shews that
                    originally the Egyptian <hi rend="italic">t</hi> did not lend itself to the
                    aspirated sound. The Leyden MS. with Greek transcriptions thus places <hi
                    rend="italic">θav</hi> in correspondence to an Egyptian word, written &lt;=&gt;
                    Γ□ <hi rend="italic">Tqhqn,</hi> in which the first <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is
                    a “mater lectionis,” of no value in pronunciation. In Semitic words ≡⊃ , <hi
                    rend="superscript"> o</hi>, , served to transcribe regularly ∏ and D, sometimes
                    also 1, bt more rarely.</p>
                <p>We observe no preference for transcriptions of 0; this letter, which is not
                    frequently found, corresponds even to &lt;=≡&gt;, <hi rend="italic">t,</hi> in
                    the name of Potiphar. We may conclude that the special sound of the tθ had no
                    existence in old Egyptian. The Coptic derived forms have but one type T for
                    g—&gt; and its homophones; the Memphitic aspiration changes it to Ο; following
                    the rules of affinity we find some cases of</p>
                <p>'¼rivation with X.</p>
                <p>We pass at once to the third dental, <hi rend="italic">t',</hi> of which the
                    differential characteristics are more marked; perhaps the intermediate consonant
                    may be more easily defined afterwards. The two signs, ^* ∣, β which we
                    transcribe <hi rend="italic">t',</hi> interchange in many Egyptian words; they
                    are both varied with the very common syllabic <hi rend="italic">, t’g,</hi>
                    (which became an alphabetic sign though retaining its vowel, like our <hi
                    rend="italic">q)</hi>; they act in exactly the same manner in the transcriptions
                    and in the Coptic derived words. The hierogrammats employed them, but very
                    rarely, to transcribe the Greek τ and δ, and the Greeks felt some difficulty in
                    transcribing this articulation; thus we find <hi rend="italic">t</hi> rendered
                    by τ and δ, or by <hi rend="italic">σ</hi>; thus <hi rend="italic">Sq</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> r</hi><hi rend="italic">n-tlaho</hi> is rendered by
                    Sensaos, and <hi rend="italic">Har-ant’-atef</hi> by Arontotes and
                    Arendotes.</p>
                <p>In the cartouche of Cambyses the Persian articulation <hi rend="italic">z, j</hi>
                    of Rawlinson, , is found; it is transcribed by k , <hi rend="italic">t',</hi>
                    but not constantly; variants shew a simple <hi rend="italic">t,</hi> S=⊃.
                    Therefore there was not a perfect identity between the Egyptian <hi
                    rend="italic">t'</hi> and the Persian <hi rend="italic">z.</hi> The Hebrews had
                    two sibilants more or less shading off into cerebrals, t and; they are
                    constantly transcribed by ^* ∣ , <hi rend="italic">Ü,</hi> and its homophones,
                    and not by <hi rend="italic">t;</hi> but we do not remark a preference in favour
                    of this or that sign for either of the two Semitic letters, and this çonfusion
                    shews that there was but an approximative correspondence.</p>
                <p>The Coptic derived forms from the ancient <hi rend="italic">t</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> ,</hi> are classed according to two rules they are
                    written either (1) with X in the two dialects, or (2) with X Sahidic,
                    corresponding to Memphitic,—the dialect of Upper Egypt shewing a higher
                    exactness. The exceptions shewus— 1, T Sahidic, -θ-Memphitic; 2 <hi
                    rend="subscript"> j</hi> 0~" Sahidic, X Memphitic; 3, &lt;Λ) &gt; 4, the
                    palatals; <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> all the letters which shewa kind of
                    affinity with this dental, of which we cannot now fix the pronunciation beyond
                    saying that it approached the sibilants and the cerebrals. The Copts preserved
                    it in X, which comes from the hieroglyphic , through the hieratic , , becoming
                    in demotic: this was developed and made regular by the Copts. The Copts Cannot
                    now give precise information as to the pronunciation of X; in the last century,
                    an attempt was made to indicate it by <hi rend="italic">sj.</hi> Dr. Brugsch
                    proposes for the ancient letter <hi rend="italic">z,</hi> and Dr. Birch <hi
                    rend="italic">j;</hi> it seems to us that the conventional <hi rend="italic"
                    >t</hi> ’ is more suitable to the Egyptian variants of the articulation, which
                    constantly make it approach <hi rend="italic"> ⅞</hi><hi rend="italic">,
                    t.</hi></p>
                <p>In the eyes of the ancient Egyptians the letter c≡za , <hi rend="italic">t,</hi>
                    was a near neighbour of ^* ∣, <hi rend="italic">t';</hi> it could even be
                    considered as a homophone if we had only the evidence of the variants; for
                    variants between ^ <hi rend="superscript"> l</hi> I and <hi rend="subscript">
                    c</hi> ≡⅛ are numerous, and found in the earliest texts. The variants between
                    &lt;≡⅛ and ≡r⊃ , o <hi rend="subscript"> l ι</hi> are rare enough, and belong
                    above all to the late periods. But the Semitic transcriptions indicate the
                    principle of a distinction. Far from using it to render T and S <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi>, &lt;=≡&gt; is connected with ∏ with a very marked
                    preference. From the Nineteenth Dynasty, when the system of these transcriptions
                    appears to have been made regular, on account of the many relations established
                    with the neighbouring nations by conquests and emigrations (into Egypt), this
                    preference became so constant that it led Dr. Brugsch to transcribe e≡&gt; by a
                    <hi rend="italic">d.</hi></p>
                <p>The exceptions to this rule place the <hi rend="superscript"> c</hi> ≡⅛ beside L3
                    and ∏, rather than the cerebrals.</p>
                <p>In Coptic the derivatives of <hi rend="subscript"> c</hi> ≡&gt;, <hi
                    rend="italic">t,</hi> do not act like those of ancient words usually written
                    with <hi rend="italic">t'.</hi> We find the derivatives of &lt;≈ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi> regularly under the dentals T^, ∙θ∙, <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,c</hi> f <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> J '0metimeβ also
                    under X, but in very small number. The verb <hi rend="italic">tu,</hi> “to
                    give,” ordinarily written ⅛ -∏, becomes in Coptic <hi rend="superscript"> τ</hi>
                    f^∙ This sign, which the earlier Copts pronounced <hi rend="italic">di,</hi> was
                    considered a simple ligature for T’ and I . But Dr. Brugsch has remarked that
                    <hi rend="superscript"> τ</hi> f^ resembles the demotic , corresponding to ∆ 0,
                    “to give,” too much for the likeness to be due to chance; there was here a
                    recollection of the softened sound peculiar to v≡≡, and the Copts took the <hi
                    rend="superscript"> τ</hi> f^ from demotic with their other special letters.</p>
                <p>Evidently these two groups of documents may induce us to mark the c—⅛ as a
                    special letter, but this letter could not be a <hi rend="italic">d.</hi> In
                    fact, the Copts excluded from their native words, and the hierogrammats
                    indicated that the was not a true <hi rend="italic">d:</hi> when they would
                    transcribe more exactly the Latin <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> which they found in
                    foreign names, they employed a double letter, <hi rend="italic">nt.</hi> We
                    notice this in variants of the cartouche of Darius for the Persian <hi
                    rend="italic">d,</hi> and for the Latin <hi rend="italic">d</hi> in the surname

                    Trajan. This wholly artificial orthography aids us to appreciate a peculiarity
                    of the Egyptian dentals, that after the nasal the pronunciation softened in the
                    direction of <hi rend="italic">d.</hi> This explains many Greek transcriptions

                    The example justifies us in .Searching for under the transcription <hi
                    rend="italic">n,</hi> which is more easily explained as the ancient Egyptians
                    originally had not any sign to express the articulation <hi rend="italic"
                    >l.</hi></p>
                <p>The Coptic ft transcribes the ancient <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> but in course of
                    time the liquid <hi rend="italic">I,</hi> ?\, had gained a footing in the
                    pronunciation; a part of the Coptic words in which it figures derive it from the
                    ancient <hi rend="italic">n</hi>; thus, X—∣∣ &lt;l <hi rend="subscript"> s</hi>,
                    <hi rend="italic">nee,</hi> “tongue,” became AÄ.C.</p>
                <p>The nasal presents many peculiarities worthy of remark in the Egyptian writing
                    and language. It influenced certain consonants, in the direction of modifying
                    the pronunciation; thus it softened <hi rend="italic">t,</hi> as in the group
                    <hi rend="italic">nt</hi> for writing <hi rend="italic">d.</hi> The <hi
                    rend="italic">s,</hi> preceded by a nasal, seems to have been also analogously
                    modified; for the Greeks transcribed the particle <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi>
                    —, nes, which begins certain proper names, by a, as we have seen in Zβεpδeτ17s.
                    The similar action of <hi rend="italic">n</hi> on <hi rend="italic">k,</hi>
                    which was thus modified enough for the Sahidic dialect to have sometimes
                    rendered it by T, has been previously observed. <hi rend="italic">N,</hi> as
                    already remarked, sometimes became <hi rend="italic">I,</hi> the Coptic; the
                    combination <hi rend="italic">nr</hi> must have more frequently given occasion
                    to the pronunciation <hi rend="italic">I</hi> through the softening ot <hi
                    rend="italic">r; nr</hi> is oiten written ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ , where ∣ ∣ ∣ represents</p>
                <p>ΛΛAWΛ</p>
                <p>a sounding <hi rend="italic">n.</hi> The group ∣ ∣ ∣ , which has the value <hi
                    rend="italic">ng,</hi> is a syllabic: the <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is of no
                    force in the pronunciation. In illustration of the modification of <hi
                    rend="italic">nr</hi> (where the <hi rend="italic">n</hi> was originally
                    sounding), the Coptic root, “outside,” may be cited; it comes from the
                    Egyptian</p>
                <p>J (3 *j <hi rend="superscript"> w</hi> [*J * <hi rend="superscript"> z</hi> y"*
                    <hi rend="italic">, bunar,</hi> of the same sense.</p>
                <p>The Egyptian grammarians evidently considered the nasal a simple accident of the
                    vowel, to be indicated or omitted at will in writing: thus the same person’s
                    name is written ∣ ∣ ∣ $</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">kgnra,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic
                    "> $</hi><hi rend="italic">, hgra∙</hi> I∏ such cases a bar above the vowel may
                    be used to note the omission of the nasal. Thus the particle Q may be
                    transcribed <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> when we find it written under AΛWΛΛ</p>
                <p>the form Q, which it would be difficult to recognize without this note in
                    transcription. The examples of this curious peculiarity are frequent; it is a
                    grammatical view analogous to the “anusvara” of the Indians; it is known that
                    the omission of the nasal has also been remarked in the ancient monuments of
                    classical epigraphy.</p>
                <p>The Egyptians used very readily the nasalized vowel; they sometimes introduced it
                    into Semitic words which they adopted, or even only transcribed: thus they wrote
                    ^T⅞T⅜T T⅞T⅞T *j*, <hi rend="italic">Sasg,nk,</hi> the name of the king called in
                    the Bible <hi rend="italic">pWW</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> f</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Sisaq,</hi> a name apparently of Semitic origin. (Here the nasal
                    helps to express the sound of the Hebrew p.)</p>
                <p>The Coptic possesses the two letters p and 2∖; it is difficult to ascertain if
                    the ancient dialects of the Egyptian language knew the distinction of these two
                    liquids, but it is certain that the hieroglyphics admitted but one type,
                    represented by the signs &lt;=&gt; and , which serves indifferently to
                    transcribe <hi rend="italic">p</hi> and λ Greek, and S and η; only at certain
                    times we ren ark a preference given to the lioness for transcribing <hi
                    rend="italic">I,</hi> but without regularity, and it is not until the last stage
                    of demotic writing that the letter derived from this sign seems to attach itself
                    regularly to the liquid <hi rend="italic">l.</hi> In Egyptian words is rare; it
                    is sometimes joined to &lt;≡&gt; , as a doubled letter &lt;=&gt; ,≤≥≡5&gt;, like
                    the groups □ , Jj &amp;c. It is frequently employed in the transcription of
                    Semitic words. In the Bible the Egyptian liquid is rendered by Ί in all the
                    words given, never by <hi rend="italic">7:</hi> thus the ancient articulation
                    was <hi rend="italic">r.</hi></p>
                <p>The Coptic derived forms are divided between p and ?\.—See also above for the
                    combination nr.—The Bashmuric dialect is characterized above all by the
                    exclusion of p (and use of 2∖ in its stead, from the influence of Arabic).</p>
                <p>This liquid approached the semi-vowels in its nature; hence it was sometimes
                    permissible to omit it in writing, like the nasal: thus LJ, <hi rend="italic"
                    >ka,</hi> for ∣ ∣ &lt;=&gt;, <hi rend="italic">kar,</hi><hi rend="subscript">
                    n</hi> j ∏ , <hi rend="italic">nes,</hi> for J ∏, <hi rend="italic">neser,</hi>
                    “flame.” By a frequent exception final r (and <hi rend="italic">I</hi> in
                    Bashmuric) is obliterated in Coptic words; thus the particle &lt;=&gt;, er, has
                    become ∈.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sibilant.</hi></p>
                <p>The two signs for s are homophones. The Greek transcriptions have always <hi
                    rend="italic">σ,</hi> and the Semitic render <hi rend="italic">8</hi> by D or
                    <hi rend="italic">V;</hi> an exception which is common enough makes the Egyptian
                    <hi rend="italic">s</hi> equivalent to ⅛y, but probably this is only apparent.
                    We know how easily the pronunciation varies between s and s in the Semitic
                    languages. The celebrated story of the word shibboleth (Judges xii. 6) shews
                    that even among the Hebrews the pronunciation varied according to the tribes.
                    The pronunciation of Ephraim, which doubtless followed that of the different
                    peoples situate north of Palestine, shews why we find sometimes an Egyptian <hi
                    rend="italic">s</hi> in relation to &amp; Hebrew, particularly in the names of
                    Syrian towns or nations. (This should be qualified, for Ephraim was in middle
                    rather than northern Palestine, and it is possible that was always anciently <hi
                    rend="italic">eh.)</hi> The Coptic derivatives of the Egyptian <hi rend="italic"
                    >e</hi> fall under C , but there are many exceptions to this rale, the ancient s
                    sometimes becoming ty, and more rarely <hi rend="italic">(s~';</hi> it seems to
                    have passed into W in -some roots. We also find the sibilant written in Coptic
                    MSS. by ζ; but the instances are so few as to be unauthoritative. It has been
                    already remarked that f was used by the Alexandrian Greeks to transcribe the
                    combination <hi rend="italic">ns.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Hushing
                    Letter</hi><hi rend="italic">(</hi><hi rend="italic">Chuintante).</hi></p>
                <p>(The term Μ. de Rouge uses is important as distinguishing this letter from the
                    sibilant. We can only suggest the English “hushing’ as here equivalent. )</p>
                <p>The letter s (c⅛, French) having no representative in the Greek alphabet, the
                    Copts preserved the demotic regularized as cy I it comes from the hieratic ,
                    hieroglyphic T⅜T⅜T ∙ The Greeks ordinarily rendered <hi rend="italic">e</hi> by
                    <hi rend="italic">σ,</hi> sometimes by <hi rend="italic">χ</hi> and &lt;rχ. The
                    exact sound of <hi rend="italic">s</hi> ’s found in Persian and the Semitic
                    languages; it is constantly rendered by T⅞T⅜T in the names of Persian kings; we
                    also find rw^ι in the cartouches of Darius and Artaxerxes. For the Hebrew <hi
                    rend="italic">ty we</hi> find equally T⅞T⅞T <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi>
                    little oftener than ∣ ~w~ ∣.</p>
                <p>The Coptic derivatives are very regular; they use (Λ); some exceptions shew the
                    ancient s passing into X, and rarely &lt;P and &lt;t).</p>
                <p>The transcriptions and derivations shew us that from a very ancient time T⅞T⅞T
                    <hi rend="superscript"> an</hi> d rarc- ∣ were homophones; but perhaps we cannot
                    affirm that it was so from the origin of Egyptian writing. Dr. Hincks
                    conjectured that ⊂≡o had the value of <hi rend="italic">&lt;rχ.</hi> This idea
                    rests on—(1) the fact that <hi rend="smallcaps">⊂cct</hi> presents a certain
                    number of variants with © , χ; (2) that it seems to double itself with an
                    initial <hi rend="italic">s,</hi> without change of value, so that we sometimes
                    find * instead of t=w□ alone. On the other hand, there has not yet been noted a
                    variant between J⅜RJ and ©. It is then possible that r-w-ι primitively marked
                    some intermediate sha,de of sound of which the trace was afterwards lost in
                    pronunciation. Perhaps we may attribute to this oscillation the most ancient
                    orthography of <hi rend="italic">8eχa, “to</hi> write,” Coptic c&lt;b&lt;M,
                    which in the earliest times was written ,. The sign in question must, however,
                    be classed as homophonous with T⅞T⅜J ·</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Aspirated Guttural.</hi></p>
                <p>The aspirated guttural, here rendered by the Greek χ, is represented in the
                    alphabet by © and . These letters sometimes interchange, and are found grouped
                    as a double letter © , a reduplication analogous to those noted above. «— is a
                    third homophone, of a little rarer use but very old. The Greek transcribed this
                    aspirated guttural by χ; this was but an approximate value, for the Copts, who
                    adopted the for the aspiration of K in the Memphitic dialect, judged it
                    necessary also to take their d⅛ f <hi rend="subscript"> rom</hi> the demotic

                    dialect. The Copts noted carefully shades of sound which appear to us very
                    near.</p>
                <p>The cartouches of the Persian kings render the Persian <hi rend="italic">kh</hi>
                    by and by ®; these two signs answer to ∏ of Hebrew words, but we must here draw
                    a distinction. We know that the ∏ comprises two shades of sound which Arabic
                    distinguishes by ,; the hiero glyphic transcriptions establish the antiquity of
                    this distinction in the pronunciation; for they render the ∏ sometimes by ® or ,
                    the Egyptian χ, and sometimes by ∣, ⅞, as will be shewn later.</p>
                <p>The Coptic derivatives of the ancient <hi rend="italic">χ</hi> are of two
                    classes. In the first the Memphitic dialect faithfully observes the ancient
                    orthography, preserving the; we find in the same words a Sabidic . In a second
                    class of words the ancient <hi rend="italic">χ</hi> is softened, and we find a

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Aspirates.</hi></p>
                <p>The Copts borrowed but one aspirate, g, from the demotic alphabet. The Semitic
                    transcriptions indicate, however, two shades of sound, at least as marked as
                    those which are found in French in the letter <hi rend="italic">h.</hi> The

                    rend="italic">φlβιs</hi> for <hi rend="italic">p-hib,</hi> “the ibis.” As to the
                    hierogrammats, they sometimes used their <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> Γ□, to
                    indicate the breathing at the beginning of Greek words which they transcribed,
                    or in seeking to render aspirated letters by the combination <hi rend="italic"
                    >ph, , th,</hi> for <hi rend="italic">φ, θ.</hi></p>
                <p>The Hebrew ∏ , as already stated, answered to two shades of sound; these also
                    existed in Egyptian, so that the Semitic transcriptions take the following
                    progressive order: 1, ∏ = Γ□, <hi rend="italic">h</hi>; 2, ∏,</p>
                <p>= I, <hi rend="italic">h</hi>; 3, ∏, , = χ. It is therefore needful to distin
                    guish these two aspirates in the point of view of the transcription of foreign
                    (Semitic) words, for they have a considerable importance for the determination
                    of these words. The distinction of jf], <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">, h,</hi> the latter being a strengthened aspirate, would be less
                    useful for Coptic, for this distinction had been lost, the Copts having taken
                    from the demotic the sign of th· strong aspirate , coming from , hieratic ,
                    demotic <hi rend="italic">ÿ</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi></p>
                <p>The Coptic derivatives have almost all preserved faithfully the in the two
                    dialects. The exceptions are rare; they introduce the Memphitic ⅛ , the cy , and
                    the K; it is also possible for the aspiration to be obliterated and the Coptic
                    to present an initial vowel. ^The rare variants which may be remarked in the
                    Egyptian texts between the aspirates and the other letters are limited to <hi
                    rend="italic">χ,</hi> or to the initial vowels.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Syllabic Signs.</hi></p>
                <p>An. ideographic sign could be employed in four different ways. Of this the sign
                    ∙^*, the symbol of “life,” may be taken as an illustration.</p>
                <p>1. It could be used alone, ⅜ , to indicate the idea of <hi rend="superscript">
                    a</hi> life” and the different words conveying this idea (“life,” “to live,”
                    “living”).</p>
                <p>2. The same sign could be written after the phonetic expression of one of the
                    words signifying life, thus «Aw« <hi rend="subscript"> j</hi> Coptic ∞rr⅛&gt;,
                    “life.” Here the sign takes no part in the pronunciation; it simply determines
                    the idea which we should attach to the word ά«χ preceding it: in this use it is
                    called, following Champoilion, a determinative.</p>
                <p>3. The same sign could be accompanied by all or by a part of the letters used to
                    write the word αnχ: the letters thus used have been termed phonetic complements;
                    their choice (as to number) is ordinarily ruled by the necessities of design, in
                    which the squareness of the group was much considered. Thus we. find or dinarily
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">ϋ</hi>, with the second and third complement) but and „ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> d</hi>-^∙ § would be equally in accord with rules. A group of
                    this kind is said to be written in the mixed manner.</p>
                <p>4. The same sign, once attached to a word such as ä/ζχ, could be used in writing
                    for the phonetic value of this word with a complete loss of the primitive sense.
                    This is exactly a rebus in principle. Thus, <hi rend="italic">anχ, “</hi> ear ⅜,
                    “oath,” Coptic, ΛfiΛG). A determinative often indicates to the reader, as in the
                    first example, this radical change in the use of the sign. In this case the sign
                    is said to be employed as a syllabic. (The Assyro-BabyIonian syllabary is
                    remarkable as affording a double system of this kind, arising from the original
                    Akkadian sounds of a sign and the later Assyro-Babylonian ones. The difference
                    is in the extensive polyphony of this syllabary.)</p>
                <p>Probably in principle all hieroglyphics were susceptible of use as syllables ∙,
                    but in fact, it was necessary for this—1, that a symbol should represent a word
                    composed of a simple syllable, and, 2, that we should find this syllable in
                    different words. The list of the most usual syllables of known value, in the
                    Pharaonic period, amounts to considerably over three hundred.</p>
                <p>It is therefore not enough to have established the fact that a certain syllable
                    corresponds in reading to a symbol, for us to consider the symbol as being
                    properly a syllabic. We must also have found it sometimes more or less turned
                    from its ideographic value and corresponding to a simple sound, to write which
                    it takes the place of the letters of the alphabet. Thus the essential character
                    of the syllabic is the abstraction made of the ideographic value for its use as
                    a sound pure and simple. It is only as syllabics and determinatives that the
                    ideographs belong to grammar. Those that do not play these parts have their
                    proper place in the dictionary.</p>
                <p>Syllabics, as well as ideographs, can be written alone or with phonetic
                    complements in the mixed manner; the choice (and arrangement) of the complements
                    depended on the needs of the designer. Thus we find <hi rend="italic">,
                    sent,</hi> grouped thus, p' '2zF <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi>, P</p>
                <p>-Z∖ &gt; ' <hi rend="superscript"> ζ</hi> 'j⅛Ι&gt; ’ &amp; <hi rend="superscript"
                    > c</hi> "’ ^ <hi rend="superscript"> ιe</hi> ^ <hi rend="superscript"> e</hi> ≡
                    <hi rend="superscript"> s</hi> &gt; kθ <hi rend="superscript"> re</hi>
                    determining movement.</p>
                <p>The second phonetic complement is found frequently; ’ the first is more rare, and
                    there are syllabics for which it has not yet been discovered. The writer seems
                    to have had full liberty in this matter. From these facts it is evident that we
                    cannot retain Ch ampoilion’s term, “initial signs,” nor adopt Lepsius’s
                    division, in his <hi rend="italic">Lettre à</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Rosellini,</hi> into “initial signs” ands⅛ns intended for the middle of a
                    group. Bunsen’s division into syllabic signs and mixed signs is equally
                    untenable.</p>
                <p>A sign could wholly lose its ideographic value, although written as a
                    determinative. Thus the word <hi rend="italic">tar,</hi> determined by a
                    shoot(?) of palm, signified “season,” “time but to write the syllaole <hi
                    rend="italic">tar,</hi> in another word, as <hi rend="italic">htar,</hi>
                    “horses,” it was not necessary to drop the determinative £, and the whole group
                    Q £, <hi rend="italic">tar,</hi> could be retained; thus: ∣ [∣ £ <hi
                    rend="italic">, htar,</hi> Coptic</p>
                <p>δ <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> ro, “horse.” This peculiarity may embarrass the
                    interpreter, particularly in texts carelessly written, where the determinative
                    of the idea is often omitted or incorrectly given. (Mr. le Page Renouf
                    distinguishes this use of the determinative by the term deter«</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n838/mode/1up"

                <p>minative of sound from the ordinary use as determinative of sense.)</p>
                <p>Syllables are divided into two classes—1, an articulation and one or more vowels;
                    2, two articulations (usually with a medial helpingvowel unexpressed. All are,
                    no doubt, monosyllables, although a syllabic like <hi rend="italic">sga</hi> has
                    the appearance of a dissyllable; here, either the first <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    has no force, or the two indicate a long vowel.)</p>
                <p>The first class of syllables, an articulation and a vague vowel, is scarcely
                    distinguishable from the letters of the alphabet. The distinction is thus
                    determined: 1, the simple letters were used as phonetic complements; 2, the
                    syllables do not seem to have been used quite indifferently for all kinds of
                    words. We frequently find allusions, relations direct or remote, which have
                    originally induced their choice for the purpose of writing this or that radical.
                    (This is strictly analogous to the principle of the syllabary of
                    Assyro-Babylonian in its Akkadian and Semitic developments, though in its
                    application that principle led to wide polyphony, in consequence of an ideograph
                    taking different sounds according to the cognate senses in which it was
                    used.)</p>
                <p>It is also possible that the syllables were sometimes employed to give an idea of
                    the sound of the vowels. But if they had this use primitively, they did not
                    retain it, for we cannot establish this property in a constant manner in the
                    hieroglyphic transcriptions of Greek or Semitic words. (It is indeed the
                    converse use of the vowel most affected by a consonant or of the syllabic with
                    its vowel which is our chief embarrassment in the reading of Semitic
                    transcriptions.)</p>
                <p>There were also some signs corresponding to three articulations which could be
                    used as syllables. Here the cases of homophony are much more rare; we have to do
                    with different acceptations rather than different radicals, but the ideal bond
                    between these different acceptations may escape us now. (These are still
                    monosyllables.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Polyphony.</hi></p>
                <p>There are characters which had various pronunciations. There are three kinds of
                    polyphones :—</p>
                <p>1. A sign can answer to various words which belong to the same class of ideas;
                    thus, the calf’s ear, answers to the words <hi rend="italic">mest'er,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">dnhh,</hi> and Q <hi rend="subscript"> c</hi>- <hi
                    rend="subscript"> ca</hi>, <hi rend="italic">at,</hi> which seem to have all
                    signified the ear or some special part of this organ. The words <hi
                    rend="italic">ff)</hi><hi rend="italic">sent,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >sctcm,</hi> “to hear,” are two new values, on the same principle. One might add
                    to this first class the very near values produced by variants of pronunciation
                    or writing for the same word, such as <hi rend="italic">tg, tag, tg, at, aat,
                    aat, aatu</hi> for 1× <hi rend="subscript"> j</hi>, and the forms more or less
                    developed of a single root, but these are rather extensions of a word than true
                    instances of polyphony.</p>
                <p>2. The same sign might have been chosen as symbol of a certain number of ideas
                    without any true bond between them, at least to our view: thus V7 answers to the
                    phonetic p <hi rend="italic">useχ,</hi> “largeness,” to <hi rend="superscript">
                    fl</hi> J" <hi rend="superscript"> σ</hi>,</p>
                <p>“offering,” and ∣ ≈ <hi rend="italic">,</hi><hi rend="italic">Tient,</hi>
                    “regent” (fem.)</p>
                <p>3. A sign may have become syllabic and be used for several purely phonetic values
                    taken from the words in which it figures, on the two principles explained. Thus
                    in the syllabary, the sign <hi rend="subscript"> λ</hi><hi rend="subscript">
                    0</hi>, which symbolizes the idea <hi rend="superscript"> ii</hi> gift,” answers
                    to two roots, <hi rend="italic">tu</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ma;</hi> these
                    give in their turn to <hi rend="smallcaps">a_</hi><hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi>
                    the values <hi rend="superscript"> c</hi> J°, <hi rend="italic">tn,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="subscript"> j</hi><hi rend="italic">mä,</hi> even in words where the idea
                    of gift no longer exists.</p>
                <p>Such is the series of facts which has produced Egyptian polyphony. The number of
                    figures suitable to design and with which one could reasonably charge the memory
                    being limited, we should expect to find polyphony more or less developed in
                    every system of writing originally ideographic. The syllabic polyphony of
                    Assyrian seems to have been produced by wholly analogous circumstances, though
                    the change from the original language habitually veils the connection of
                    values.</p>
                <p>Polyphony is a source of great difficulty, and science has still much to do to
                    fix the different phonetic values of the polyphones. Often our decision is made
                    on the evidence of phonetic complements, and in hieratic it is seldom that this
                    aid is wholly omitted.</p>
                <p>Thus is easily recognized as mα. But our ignorance is not always thus aided, and
                    the choice of the suitable word sometimes can only be indicated by a profound
                    study of analogous texts.</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Determinatives.</hi></p>
                <p>Champollion described as determinatives certain ideographic signs which were
                    placed after words phonetically expressed. The use of each of these signs is
                    more or less extended. The greater part are used for one radical, or at least
                    for one and the same idea. For such determinatives the proper place is the
                    dictionary. But there is a class of determinatives placed after different words,
                    often many in number, and therefore called generic determinatives. The
                    determinative is attached to the radical, and has nothing to do with the
                    grammatical use of a word as noun or verb. (Μ. ∙de Rongé gives a list of above a
                    hundred as necessary for the student of Egyptian grammar, leaving out those of
                    more restricted use.) Science has not yet wholly accomplished its task in this
                    section. (Necessarily the exact definition of the range of a determinative
                    requires a careful induction from its use.)</p>
                <p>(The table which follows is but slightly abridged from Μ. de Rouge’s, after
                    comparison with Dr. Brugsch’s in his <hi rend="italic">Grammaire
                    Hiéroglyphique,</hi> where a somewhat fuller but less logical list is given,
                    apparently founded on that of the French savant. The reason for here giving a
                    larger proportion of determinative than of syllabic signs is that the senses of
                    the determinatives when logically arranged, as by Μ. de Rougé, present a key to
                    the whole construction of the Egyptian system of ideographic signs, and afford
                    us a remarkable insight into the genius of the language.)</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The Reading of Ideographic Signs.</hi></p>
                <p>The Egyptians used not only simple letters and syllabic signs, but also
                    ideographs, to write words. The reading of these ideographs is obtained in
                    divers ways. It is often furnished by the analysis of proper names of which
                    there are transcriptions, though the result is sometimes approximative. Another
                    method is the study of variants, when a phonetic form of a word replaces the
                    ideographic sign, in the same text. Often also the ideograph is written as a
                    determinative after the phonetic equivalent. (Hence the great importance of
                    publishing collations of known texts, a work to be recommended to new
                    students.)</p>
                <p>When a word is written by a single ideograph, and above all when it is a
                    substantive, it is most commonly distinguished by the marks ∣, or their
                    combinations <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi> ∣, Thus i w i is the letter «, <hi
                    rend="italic">se,</hi> the basin.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The Combination of Signs of different kinds in Writing
                    Words.</hi></p>
                <p>In texts which shew a certain development, and above all in hieratic manuscripts,
                    where the signs are always more abundant, many words are written phonetically
                    and followed by one or more determinatives. In such a case, the determinative
                    which is most general is written last: thus <hi rend="superscript"> λλλλλ</hi> ^
                    ⅛ <hi rend="superscript"> men</hi> ' “<hi rend="superscript"> to</hi> become
                    weak,feebleness”—Copt. (∏WJT, soft,—where thephonetic letters are followed by
                    the determinatives for (I) repose, feebleness, (2) crossing, bending, (3) evil,
                    unfortunate. A word expressed by an ideograph may be followed by a generic
                    determinative. (The same is the case when a word is written phonetically with
                    its ideograph as a first determinative, of course special.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Expletive Signs.</hi></p>
                <p>There are a few expletives which were not pronounced, and had a purely graphic
                    use. The most important is the roll r-^- <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi>, the
                    determinative of writing, knowledge, <hi rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi> It is
                    sometimes used as a sign of separation or as disjunctive. The signs I, I, o, are
                    often used as pure expletives, adding nothing to the idea or the sound. I or ο
                    is frequently added to a determinative; it is almost the rule, when the space
                    needs it: as <hi rend="superscript"> l</hi> T <hi rend="subscript"> j</hi></p>
                <p>ΛΛΛΛΛΛ (J C J &gt; ζ(√ <hi rend="italic">mennefer,</hi> Memphis. In such cases
                    the expletive ordinarily follows the gender of the substantive, ∣ for masc.,
                    &lt;=&gt;for fem. The phonetic value of <hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> j</hi><hi rend="italic">t,</hi> as feminine final, sometimes causes
                    perplexity, but its expletive character is clear in other cases. The sign 1,
                    which (like o) is not always expletive, has similar uses. It is written after
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">&lt;ξl&gt;,</hi> thus &lt;p&gt;, even for final r. With <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n842/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0842-0805"/> it forms the group Ç&gt; ∣, not only for the
                    substantive <hi rend="italic">har, ha,</hi> “face,” but also for the particle
                    <hi rend="italic">her,</hi> “upon,” &lt;fcc. In hieratic, I is attached to many
                    characters, probably to distinguish them from very similar ones; thus k? for
                    &lt;⊂&gt; is clearly distinguished from f° <hi rend="superscript"> r ω</hi> ∙ i≡
                    ^ <hi rend="superscript"> lus</hi> used as a diacritical sign, though very
                    variably. At the end of words we find, above all in late times, the expletive
                    11.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Expletive Vowels and Complements of Simple Letters.</hi></p>
                <p>Although the vowels were often omitted, sometimes they are added in a wholly
                    expletive manner, which their vagueness can only aid us to understand. This is
                    easily proved from certain words transcribed, such as <hi rend="italic"
                    >θav,</hi> the Egyptian <hi rend="smallcaps">~^^λλλλλλ,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >tahan.</hi> In any other system the first <hi rend="italic">a</hi> would
                    produce a separation of syllable between <hi rend="italic">t</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">h,</hi> transcribed here by θ. (It should be remembered, however,
                    that the Greek could not represent a sound like t’han otherwise than by Ö. The
                    Egyptian vowel may here represent a disjunctive.) The same remark applies in the
                    consideration of the Egyptian transcriptions of divers foreign words, of which
                    the grammatical form is well known. Thus the Hebrew ∏□3"&gt;.0 is written ^∣ f∣
                    <hi rend="italic">,</hi><hi rend="italic">mär-</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >habuta,</hi> and the name of the Hebrew harp ΊΪ33, is written <hi rend="italic"
                    >, hmaanaur.</hi> It has been remarked that each consonant had a kind of
                    favourite complement, and that this complementary sign should often be treated
                    as an expletive in reading·. It has been proposed to admit for these letters
                    inherent vowels, but this idea seems exaggerated: the alphabet is not a
                    syllabary, for most of the letters unite with the different vowels. The
                    knowledge of the ordinary complements of each letter is useful, especially in
                    reference to transcriptions.</p>

                    not unite itself readily to a certain number of letters; hence the introduction
                    of an intermediate letter and the pleonastic forms <hi rend="italic">§

                    full weight in roots which are always monosyllabic, on the other, that we can
                    scarcely deny it some force. Was it used to modify the consonant as when a local
                    pronunciation of <hi rend="italic">g</hi> in English is written by grammarians
                    <hi rend="italic">g'&lt;</hi> as <hi rend="italic">garden?</hi> In
                    transcriptions the expletive vowel appears, but for philological purposes must
                    be disregarded, and the same is sometimes true of the complementary vowel. In
                    English <hi rend="italic">q,</hi> our only syllabic, always requires <hi
                    rend="italic">u</hi> as its complementary vowel: consequently when it is used
                    for its ancestor the Semitic koph, as in <hi rend="italic">qoran,</hi> an
                    uneducated person would read and even write <hi rend="italic">quoraτt.</hi></p>
                <p>On applying these observations to the orthography of <hi rend="italic"
                    >mârkgbuta</hi> for Π□□Ι0 and <hi rend="italic">kanaanaur</hi> for Ί133, it is
                    immediately evident that the deviations from the Semitic are due to the Egyptian
                    vowel-system. In the word <hi rend="italic">mürkgbuta,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">u</hi> is the favourite complement of the δ, and the final <hi
                    rend="italic">t</hi> requires a vowel. In <hi rend="italic">kenqanaur</hi> the
                    doubled <hi rend="italic">n</hi> is resolved into two syllables: it could have
                    been written with the disjunctive sign between the two “<hi rend="italic"
                    >n'</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">s</hi> and a final vowel.</p>
                <p>It has been shewn that the transcriptions of the scribes of the Kamessides from
                    Semitic into Egyptian were very accurate <hi rend="smallcaps">bo</hi> ia√ as the
                    consonants were concerned. ït is equally evident that this was scarcely possible
                    and practically was not the case with the Semitic vowel sounds. This remark
                    should be borne in mind in all comparisons of Hebrew and Semitic.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The Transcription of Vowels Omitted.</hi></p>
                <p>The vowels, particularly the complementary ones noticed above, were omitted at
                    will in writing·, and must often be added in transcription. This is easy when a
                    definite fuller form of a word is known. But there are many words for which the
                    variants give different vowels, and many others for which a vowelled variant has
                    not yet been found. Most Egyptologists here use <hi rend="italic">e</hi> for the
                    absent vowel, which must only be regarded as a conventional sign for a gap to be
                    filled. (There are, however, cases in which a very common word is never
                    vowelled: here we may safely assume a very short vowel best represented by <hi
                    rend="italic">e,</hi> as already noticed.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Abbreviations and Exceptions.</hi></p>
                <p>Abbreviations were rare; ideographs and syllables rendered them needless. But
                    there are cases in usual formulae; as <hi rend="superscript"> c</hi> ∣ , <hi
                    rend="italic">nuter</hi><hi rend="italic">a,</hi> for <hi rend="superscript">

                    rend="italic superscript"> a</hi> divine father,” the title of an order of
                    priests. In the formula -jι I p, αnχ <hi rend="italic">uta senl&gt;,</hi> “life,
                    balance, health,” a kind of good wish added to king’s names and rendered in the

                <p>There are some words of which the writing is exceptional, due to causes which may
                    sometimes be traced. Thus ^^^^^^ , which should according to rule be transcribed

                    it resembles the hieratic group for the three letters and the scribes took
                    occasion to trace i <hi rend="superscript"> n</hi> hieroglyphics for <hi

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secret Writing.</hi></p>
                <p>Intentionally accumulated exceptions in certain texts compose what Champoilion
                    has called the Secret Writing. The most ancient traces we have found are of the
                    Eighteenth Dynasty. In this system we remark—(1) objects rare or unused in
                    ordinary writing; (2) syllabic signs used as simple letters; (3) phonetic values
                    obtained by turning the signs from their ordinary ideographic values; (4)
                    variants between the values of neighbouring sounds. Thus every deviation was
                    made from the usual principles of writing by which it was possible to produce
                    exceptions. This is an enigmatic system intended to be unintelligible to the
                    ordinary reader. The causes of this method are of interest, for from them
                    originated the new values which strangely complicate the hieroglyphic writing of
                    the time of the Greeks and Romans (the secret writing thus passing in a certain
                    degree into the common writing).</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The Use of Hieroglyphics in Grammar.</hi></p>
                <p>Although, as already stated, an outline of ancient Egyptian grammar is not given
                    in this article, it is necessary to explain how hieroglyphics were used for
                    grammatical purposes.</p>
                <p>In expressing roots or derivatives, whether pronominal, verbal, or of particles,
                    both phonetic and ideographic signs could be employed, either apart or in
                    combination. There is, however, in all but verbal roots a marked preference for
                    phonetic expression, with again a preferential use of alphabetic signs.</p>
                <p>The masculine and feminine of nouns are marked, especially when they were
                    ideographically written, by I and: the former was not pronounced; it is doubtful
                    whether the latter was, and if so in what cases (De Bougé, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chrestomathie,</hi> ii. 7, 8).</p>
                <p>The plural of nouns, pronouns, and the pronominal affixes which were also used to
                    indicate the persons of verbs, is indicated by the abstract symbol, III, j . In
                    the case of nouns it may be replaced by a phonetic ending or the trebling of the
                    word when written ideographically or even phonetically. The principle of
                    expressing the dual, which is proper to nouns, appears to have been the same,
                    though as to this there are difficulties.</p>
                <p>The pronouns and cognate words, including the article, are mostly written
                    alphabetically. The affixed personal pronouns, which are identical in form with
                    a very few exceptions, whether used as possessives, as inflexional verbal
                    suffixes, or as direct complements, or in other words, in their genitive,
                    subjective, and objective uses, afford instructive instances of the different
                    modes of writing. It may be observed that in Egyptian these are the primitive
                    forms of the personal pronouns. The following table is taken from Μ. de Kougé’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Chrestomathie,</hi> ii. 42, with the omission of some late

                <p>It will be remarked that' all the phonetic forms but one are written with
                    alphabetic signs, that the introduction of ideographs, either as determinatives
                    or independent symbols, gives the common first person singular a feminine in
                    writing but not in sound, and farther confuses this feminine and the true
                    feminine of the second person singular when represented by the same symbol only.
                    The principle of writing an ideograph to determine the use of the pronoun,
                    phonetically expressed or only represented by that symbol, is carried farther in
                    the first person singular than the table shows, there being special signs for a
                    god, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>In the case of the articles and the pronouns of more common use alphabetical
                    signs are employed with ideographic signs for the pronouns when the necessity
                    occurs. (Syllabic signs are used for some of the less common pronouns, and
                    ideographs for substantives employed as pronouns. The fuller forms of pronouns
                    are produced by alphabetic signs; the same is usually the case with the
                    compounds that introduce no new element.</p>
                <p>The verbal root, identical with that of the noun, is expressed in every mode in
                    which hieroglyphics can be used. It is, however, otherwise with the derivative
                    forms, the inflexions, and the substantive verb, which in its various
                    expressions is really an inflexional word employed in tense-formation. The
                    derivative forms are produced by prefixes which are always alphabetic or by
                    repetition of the radicals (reduplication, sometimes afterwards apocopated). The
                    inflexions are formed by the pronominal affixes for the persons and other
                    prefixes and affixes, these affixes being almost always placed before the
                    pronominal ones,for the moods and tenses; here again the expressionis alphabetic
                    with the exceptions afforded by the pronominal affixes as already shewn. The
                    forms of the substantive verb are phonetic, either alphabetic, Q <hi

                    phonetically, the majority, including nearly all the most common,
                    alphabetically. The simple adverbs, including the negatives, are written
                    phonetically, with perhaps about an equal use of alphabetic ana syllabic forms.
                    The few interjections are written alphabetically. In consequence of this mode of
                    writing, particles of different sense are sometimes identical inform. Thus V∖
                    <hi rend="italic">,</hi><hi rend="italic">ém,</hi> is both “in” and “not,” but
                    most apparent instances or this kind are due to the use of a particle as both
                    preposition and conjunction or adverb.</p>
                <p>The bearing of these results on the problems of the formation of the Egyptian
                    hieroglyphic writing, and the growth and origin of the language is
                    significant.</p>
                <p>The earliest Egyptian writings, which are hieroglyphic, shew a predominant use of
                    ideographic signs. The phonetic signs gradually grow in importance until the
                    full development of the character and language. We are thus led to ask whether
                    there was a period in Egyptian writing when it was wholly ideographic, the
                    supposed first stage of all such systems, when the figure of each object
                    conveyed its name or names and nothing more.</p>
                <p>A .stage of pure picture-writing would express a language in the condition which
                    is supposed to have been the earliest in the case of all monosyllabic languages,
                    the condition before grammar. It is precisely to such a condition that the
                    linguistic phenomena of Egyptian seem to point. For its simple necessities
                    ideographs alone would be sufficient, and the phonetic signs wanted for
                    grammatical machinery would be introduced when a higher condition was
                    reached.</p>
                <p>It may be farther enquired whether the growth of Egyptian was wholly internal, or
                    whether it was influenced from without; in other words, whether there is any
                    reason to assign the roots which serve the purposes of grammar, and even the
                    verbal roots to more than one source. The basis of the inquiry by which this
                    question might be answered lies in the undoubted identity of the personal
                    pronouns in Egyptian and Semitic. The inquiry is beyond the scope and limits of
                    this article. It requires an exhaustive comparison of the Egyptian vocabulary,
                    including the structural words, and of the system of grammar, with the Semitic
                    and with the families of language which geographical and ethnological
                    considerations would lead us to include in the category of possible cognates to
                    the Egyptian. The leading results of a limited examination may, however, be
                    stated. In the verbal roots a certain small number occur apparently common to
                    Egyptian and Semitic. Of these roots a good proportion are proper to
                    civilization, and thus belong to a stage above that of barbarism. In the
                    pronominal roots the personal pronouns are undoubtedly Semitic, whereas the
                    articles seem to be identical in source with a non-Semitic form of the
                    substantive verb. The roots of particles fall into two classes, those which are
                    purely metaphysical, probably including Semitic equivalents, though in the case
                    of practical!, uniliteral forms the comparison ∙. hazardous, and such as have
                    become particles by the diversion of substantives to a tropical sense.</p>
                <p>It would thus appear· that the Egyptian language was originally purely
                    monosyllabic without inflexion and written by ideographic signs, that the first
                    stage towards inflexion was the use of substantives in tropical senses for
                    prepositions and adverbs, the primitive ideographic signs being still sufficient
                    for the purposes of writing, and that the second stage was attained by borrowing
                    from Semitic, so far as was necessary, grammatical forms and particles, with
                    perhaps some verbal roots needed in a civilized condition, and that at this time
                    phonetic signs became absolutely necessary. The importance of the phonetic signs
                    for expressing grammatical forms would tend to their prevalent use for the whole
                    category, except where the radical sense was dominant in the tropical, as in our
                    own use of the word “head” in such prepositional phrases as “at the head of” the
                    table, the army, the administration, &amp;c. This view is put forward as a mere
                    hypothesis, to be sustained or refuted by the study which the subject deserves.
                    The importance of the question is great as its solution will mainly tend to
                    determine whether the Egyptian belongs to an early stage of Semitic, as has been
                    conjectured on very insufficient grounds. In the previous remarks it is assumed
                    that such a view may at present be set aside, otherwise we could not speak of
                    borrowing from Semitic.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The Supposed Derivation of the</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Phoenician</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">from the Egyptian Alphabet.</hi></p>
                <p>Μ. de Bougé endeavoured to shew that the Phoenician alphabet was derived from the
                    Egyptian in its hieratic form. The hypothesis has been accepted by Μ. François
                    Lenormant in his <hi rend="italic">Essai sur</hi><hi rend="italic">la
                    Propagation de</hi><hi rend="italic">ΐ</hi><hi rend="italic">Alphabet</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Phénicien,</hi> 2d ed., of which the first Plate presents a
                    comparative table of hieratic and archaic Phoenician letters. The method leaves
                    nothing to be desired. The conclusion is, however, scarcely established. It must
                    be remembered that the Egyptian alphabet presents one or more alternative forms
                    of more than half its letters. Most of these correspond to a single Phoenician
                    letter. Thus there is in half the Phoenician alphabet a choice between two or
                    more hieratic forms. This diminishes the effect of the comparison. Again the
                    hieratic forms vary, like all cursive forms of writing, with the hand of each
                    scribe. Consequently the writer who desires to establish their identity with
                    Phoenician can scarcely avoid straining the evidence. Any one who will compare
                    Μ. Lenormant’s plate with Μ. de Rouge’s hieratic alphabets in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Chrestomathie,</hi> Pls. I. seqq., will see that the signs chosen
                    for comparison by Μ. Lenormant do not agree throughout with any of the three
                    types given without that object by Μ. de Rouge. It may be remarked in
                    illustration that if we endeavoured to connect the demotic in its latest form
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n845/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0845-0808"/> with the Arabic Koofee in its earliest, which is
                    of course absurd, it would be possible, by selecting the demotic variety nearest
                    in form to the typical Koofee of coininscriptions, to shew a very good apparent
                    agreement of many letters. Any one may try the experiment vith the Koofee
                    alphabet in Soret’s <hi rend="italic">Numismatique Musulmane,</hi> Pl. I. and Μ.
                    de Rougé’s demotic in the <hi rend="italic">Chrestomathie</hi> (l.c.), taking
                    care to use only one type where it was repeated by the Arabs for other letters,
                    and in the case of their alphabet to compare only the isolated or final forms.
                    The result would shew the great caution needed in the inquiry.</p>
                <p>There are two objections to the proposed derivation of the Phoenician alphabet
                    which must have great weight against any but the strongest evidence of
                    resemblance. The Egyptian letters represent objects the names of which begin
                    with these letters; similarly the Phoenician letters had names indicating an
                    origin from a hieroglyphic system on the same principle of acrophony. 11 would
                    be supposed if the Phoenician letters were derived from the Egyptian ones that
                    their names would describe the original signs. This, however, is not the case in
                    a single instance. Aleph signifies an ox and not an eagle, Beth a house and not
                    a bird, Gimel a camel and not a basket, and so, as far as we know, to the end.
                    It is difficult to imagine the complete loss of the original form, and the
                    naming of letters from a supposed resemblance to another form, which form can
                    scarcely be traced in the most archaic Phoenician. Yet, if the derivation from
                    hieratic be true, we are tied to this archaic form on account of its apparent
                    similarity to the hieratic, and any deviation to explain the Semitic names of
                    the letters would weaken, if not destroy, the foundation of the theory.</p>
                <p>Again, it is very noteworthy that the oldest monuments of the Phoenician alphabet
                    are to be found not in Egypt but in Palestine and Assyria. These are the Stele
                    of Mesha, king of Moab, and the inscriptions on the Nemrood bronze lion-weights.
                    These weights take us a step farther in the argument, for they shew us on
                    sfficial documents of a palace of Assyrian kings the use of this alphabet, side
                    by side with the Assyrian character, as a kind of demotic or perhaps commercial
                    writing, of necessity well-known in Assyria itself. Of course it is not to be
                    supposed that the languages expressed were the same, but they were so closely
                    allied that their joint use in Assyria was natural, and particularly to a nation
                    accustomed to the Turanian Akkadian. This appearance of the Phoenician alphabet
                    in Assyria would suggest that it had its origin rather from Assyrian than
                    Egyptian writing. Is there, however, any evidence that any such alphabet was
                    derived from cuneiform?</p>
                <p>Among the systems of writing which present a sufficient similarity to the
                    Phoenician, and its descendant the Greek, to justify our conjecturing their
                    common derivation, though not necessarily their later connexion, is the Cyprian.
                    This is radically different from the Phoenician in being syllabic, and thus
                    having a much larger list of characters, but the formal resemblances suggest the
                    same source. In the case of the Cyprian, Dr. Deecke has endeavoured to shew the
                    source to be the Assyrian cuneiform in its later form. His arguments are very
                    strong; here it is only necessary to mention the syllabic character of the
                    Cyprian, the agreement in form of many signs, without the readjustment of their
                    elements suggested as theoretically possible by the Median and Armenian
                    variants, and the striking fact that the Cyprian is found in two inscriptions
                    written in cuneiform, each stroke having the Assyrian typical shape (Deecke, <hi
                    rend="italic">Der Ursprung der</hi><hi rend="italic">Kyρrisehen</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Silbenschrift,</hi> Strasburg, 1877).</p>
                <p>This probable solution of the Cyprian problem suggested to Dr. Deecke the
                    comparison of the Phoenician alphabet with Mesopotamian cuneiform. The result,
                    published in the <hi rend="italic">Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen
                    Gesellschaft</hi> (xxxi. 102 seqq.), is well worthy the attention of scholars.
                    The inquiry was founded on the comparison of forms and sounds in cuneiform. The
                    forms were much less numerous than the extent of the list of signs would lead us
                    to expect, for the great majority of these signs are far too complex to have
                    been the prototypes of such simple signs as the Phoenician letters. The sounds
                    on the same side present no little difficulty, as the adoption by the
                    Babylonians and Assyrians of the Akkadian system of λvriting produces a
                    confusion of kindred sounds, and excludes some proper to the Semitic alphabets.
                    A further difficulty arises from the polyphony of the Assyro-Babylonian
                    cuneiform signs, whether ideographic or syllabic, which gives a variety of
                    sounds to the same group and thus greatly diminishes the degree of probability
                    in an agreement. These signs are all conventional transcriptions of original
                    hieroglyphics. These hieroglyphics can sometimes be traced in the rare hieratic
                    forms, and even occasionally in the regular cuneiform types. When we know the
                    original form we can sometimes select the radical sound, but where we find more
                    than one cognate sense with a different sound, the selection becomes difficult,
                    if not impossible. Supposing such a sign to be represented by the English figure
                    1, standing for “one” and “first,” the discovery of the radical sound would be
                    apparently hopeless. It would be obviously so if the sign also stood for
                    “beginning” and “union.” The result seems satisfactory to the extent of about
                    one-third of the Phoenician alphabet, signs like the Phoenician having like
                    sounds. This result would have little force did it not seem to be supported by
                    the meaning of some of the signs as compared with the names of the Hebrew
                    letters of which we know the meaning, seventeen innumber. But the difficulty in
                    discovering the original radical sound and sense in cuneiform shakes this
                    conclusion. Consequently the five agreements which might be accepted were we
                    certain of the original Assyrian sound and sense cease to have much weight.
                    There are also some probable agreements which, of course, have still less
                    strength. It is, however, to be noted that the syllable <hi rend="italic">had,
                    &amp;c.,</hi> taken as the origin of Heth, and <hi rend="italic">tip,</hi> as
                    that of Teth,have forms in the hieratic cuneiform agreeable to the meaning of
                    the words from which these syllables are supposed to be abbreviated, <hi
                    rend="italic">hattu,</hi> a “graver,” and <hi rend="italic">dibbu,</hi> a
                    “writing-table.” 'This explanation of the signs Heth and Teth, consecutive, be
                    it remembered, and without certain renderings, in the Hebrew alphabet, is very
                    remarkable as a confirmation of the theory. For the present it is no more than a
                    theory, but perhaps it is as probable as the derivation of the Phoenician
                    alphabet from Egyptian hieroglyphics, through the hieratic types.</p>
                <p>It is of course possible that the old Semitic alphabet had an origin independent
                    of Egyptian hieroglyphics or the conventional hieratic forms of
                    Assyro-Babylonian cuneiform. The discovery of a new hieroglyphic character in
                    the Hittite inscriptions, containing, in a list of greater extent, certain of
                    the forms indicated by the names of the Hebrew letters, is a new factor in the
                    problem, and must be defined before its true value can be ascertained. All that
                    can be said at present is that the Hittite characters w ear the aspect of an
                    Egyptian origin. Considering the geographical position of this mode of writing,
                    its <hi rend="italic">prima</hi><hi rend="italic">facie</hi> evidence is in
                    favour of Μ. de Rougé’s derivation of the Phoenician alphabet from Egyptian.</p>
