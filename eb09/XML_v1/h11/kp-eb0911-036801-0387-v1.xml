                    (170S-1755), one of the most distinguished German poets in the earlier half of
                    last century, was born April 23, 1708, at Hamburg, where his father was Danish
                    minister at the court of Lower Saxony. The father, a man of scientific and
                    literary tastes, possessed a valuable library of French literature, and dabbled
                    also in the science of alchemy. Having by this and other means lost a great part
                    of his fortune, he died in 1722, leaving in poor circumstances a widow and two
                    sons, of whom the poet was the elder. He was educated at the gymnasium of
                    Hamburg, and went later (1726) to study jurisprudence at Jena. Shortly after his
                    return to Hamburg in 1729, he obtained the appointment of private secretary
                    without salary to the Danish ambassador in London, where he lived till 1731, and
                    published two small works in English. His return to Hamburg was followed by a
                    period of great poverty and hardship, a scanty income being derived from the
                    posts which he held in the Hamburg cathedral and among the mining population in
                    Klausthal. In 1733 Hagedorn became secretary to the so-called “English court” in
                    Hamburg, a trading company founded in the 13th century, and formerly known as
                    “Die Societät der Aventurier Kaufleute.” He shortly afterwards married, and from
                    this time, with a settled income and sufficient leisure to pursue his literary
                    occupations, led a pleasant and congenial existence, surrounded by friends and
                    admirers, till his death, at the early age of forty-seven, October 28, 1755.</p>
                <p>Hagedorn is known as the author of satirical, didactic, and moral verses,
                    epigrams, odes, fables, and songs. His popularity during his lifetime was great.
                    Although he held himself aloof from any poetical school, he nevertheless
                    exercised an important influence on the German poetry of his time; for, besides
                    being a learned man and well-read in the ancient and modern classics, he was a
                    special admirer of French literature, the study of which gained for him an ease
                    and mobility before unknown in German versification. He has been called the
                    originator in Germany of the modern song, and some of his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lieder</hi> were set to music by the favourite composers of his day. His
