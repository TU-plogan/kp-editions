                <p><label type="entry">HAMPTON</label>, a village in the county of Middlesex,
                    England, is situated on the north bank of the Thames, 12 miles W.S.W. from Hyde
                    Park Corner. The parish church erected in 1830, with a square tower at its
                    western end, is without architectural merit, but the churchyard contains a
                    number of interesting old monuments. Among the many fine residences in the
                    vicinity is Garrick Villa, formerly, under the name of Hampton House, the
                    residence of Garrick the famous actor. In the neighbourhood there are a number
                    of large pumping works for supplying London with water. The free grammar school
                    founded in 1556 was reopened in 1878 as a middle-class school, for which the
                    usual fees are charged. The population of the village in 1871 was 2207.</p>
                <p>About a mile from Hampton village and close to the river stands Hampton Court
                    Palace, one of the finest extant specimens of the Tudor style of architecture,
                    and formerly a royal residence. It was originally erected by Cardinal Wolsey,
                    who in 1515 received a lease of the old mansion and grounds for 99 years. As the
                    splendour of the building seemed to awaken the cupidity of Henry VIII., Wolsey
                    in 1526 thought it prudent to make him a present of it. It became Henry’s
                    favourite residence, and he made several additions to the building, including
                    the great hall and chapel in the Gothic style. Of the original five quadrangles
                    only two now remain, but a third was erected by Sir Christopher Wren for William
                    III. The fine gardens, extending to 44 acres, were laid out at the desire of
                    William III. in the Dutch style, with elevated terraces, long shady walks, and a
                    labyrinth called the “Maze,” which is the source of great amusement to visitors.
                    Bushy Park, opposite the palace gardens, is open to the public, and contains a
                    celebrated avenue of chestnut trees. The palace was sold by the parliament in
                    1641, but afterwards came into the hands of Cromwell; and it continued to be one
                    of the principal residences of the English sovereigns until the time of George
                    II. It was the birthplace of Edward VI., and the meeting-place of the conference
                    held in the reign of James I. to settle the dispute between the Presbyterians
                    and the state clergy. It is now partly occupied by persons of rank in reduced
                    circumstances; but its state apartments, picture gallery, and gardens are open
                    to the public free of charge. The celebrated cartoons of Raphael which it
                    formerly possessed have lately been removed to the South Kensington <pb

                    collection of pictures, including a number of fine specimens of the old masters,
                    and a large collection of portraits of persons famous in English history.</p>
