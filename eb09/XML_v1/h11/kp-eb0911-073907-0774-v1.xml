                    political economy, was born on 5th December 1795, at Dinkelsbühl in Bavaria.
                    After finishing his primary education he was for some time employed in a
                    draughtsman’s office. He then resumed his studies, partly at the gymnasium in
                    his native town, partly at the universities of Erlangen and Würzburg. His
                    attention seems principally to have been given to mathematics and political
                    economy. In 1817 he took up a private school at Nuremberg, where he remained for
                    four years. After filling an appointment as teacher of mathematics at the
                    gymnasium of Erlangen, he became in 1823 privat-docent at the university in that
                    town. His inaugural dissertation was on the notions of political economy among
                    the Romans <hi rend="italic">(Disserta-</hi><pb break="no"

                    did not remain long at Erlangen, for a year or two after this date we find him
                    acting as professor of mathematics at the gymnasium and polytechnic school in N
                    uremberg, where he continued till 1827. During his stay there he published an
                    elementary treatise on arithmetic and algebra <hi rend="italic">(Lehrbuch
                    der</hi><hi rend="italic">Arith. u. Algeb.,</hi> 1826), and made a journey to
                    France to inspect the organization and conduct of technical schools in that
                    country. The results of his investigation were published in 1826 and 1828 <hi

                    professor extraordinarius of political science at the university of Munich, and
                    in 1833 he was advanced to the rank of ordinary professor in the same subject.
                    In 1832 appeared the first edition of his great work on political economy, <hi
                    rend="italic">Staatswirthschaftliche</hi><hi rend="italic">Untersuchungen</hi>
                    (Economical Researches). In 1835 he was made member of the Royal Bavarian
                    Academy of Sciences.</p>
                <p>From this time onwards Hermann’s life was one of great and varied practical
                    activity. From the year 1836 he acted as inspector of technical instruction in
                    Bavaria, and made frequent journeys to Berlin and Paris in order to study the
                    methods there pursued. In the state service of Bavaria, to which he devoted
                    himself, he rose gradually but rapidly. In 1837 he was placed on the council for
                    superintendence of church and school work; in 1839 he was entrusted with the
                    direction of the bureau of statistics; in 1845 he was one of the councillors for
                    the interior; in 1848 he sat as member for Munich in the national assembly at
                    Frankfort. In this assembly Hermann, with Heckscher and Sommaruga, was mainly
                    instrumental in organizing the so-called “Great German” party, and was selected
                    as one of the representatives of their views at Vienna. Warmly supporting the
                    customs union (Zollverein), he acted in 1851 as one of its commissioners at the
                    great industrial exhibition at London, and published an elaborate report on the
                    woollen goods. Three years later he was president of the committee of judges at
                    the similar exhibition at Munich, and the report of its proceedings was drawn up
                    by him. In 1855 he became councillor of state (Staatsrath im ordentlichen
                    Dienst), the highest honour in the service to which he could attain.</p>
                <p>It is hardly surprising that in the midst of such varied and weighty practical
                    occupations Hermann did not find time for carrying on systematically his work in
                    the pure science of economics. Yet the long series of reviews, mainly of works
                    on economical subjects, published in the <hi rend="italic">Münchener Gelehrte
                    Anzeigen</hi> from 1835 to 1847, attest his unabated industry and constant
                    interest in the subject on its theoretical side, while his more elaborate papers
                    in Rau’s <hi rend="italic">Archiv der politischen</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Oekonomie</hi> and in the <hi rend="italic">Augsburger Allgemeine Zeitung</hi>
                    show the wide extent of his practical knowledge. As head of the bureau of
                    statistics he published a series of annual reports <hi rend="italic">(Beiträge
                    zur Statistik des Königreichs Bayern,</hi> Heft 1-17, 1850-1867) which are of
                    very high value, especially as regards the growth of population. His only
                    complete work in economic science, the <hi rend="italic">Researches,</hi> had
                    gone out of print a very few years after the book was published, but not until
                    near the close of his life did Hermann find an opportunity of undertaking a
                    revision of it. Upon this task he was engaged at the time of his death, 23d
                    November 1868, and he had recast, enlarged, and amended nearly two-thirds of the
                    volume. The second edition, prepared from his MS., and including those parts of
                    the first edition which had not been revised or superseded, was published in
                    1870 by his friends Dr Helferich and Dr Mayr. There have since been several
                    reprints.</p>
                <p>Although the <hi rend="italic">Siααtsudrthschαflliche</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Untersuchungen</hi> is not a systematic treatise on political economy, it must
                    nevertheless be regarded as in many respects the most important contribution to
                    the science since the <hi rend="italic">Wealth of Nations.</hi> It cannot,
                    indeed, be said to contain principles which are in themselves novel or original;
                    Hermann’s merits are not so much those of a discoverer as of a most acute and
                    subtle critic. Like Ricardo he excels in abstract analysis, in resolution of
                    complex phenomena into their simpler elements, but he has a more firm hold than
                    Ricardo ever seems to have possessed of the true nature of these elementary
                    facts, and a remarkable power of precisely stating and comprehensively combining
                    them. The peculiar value of the <hi rend="italic">Researches</hi> consists in
                    the strict analysis to which the primary notions of economics are subjected, in
                    the general conception of the method and plan of the science which emerges from
                    this analysis, and in the masterly way in which fundamental principles are
                    carried out in the detailed problems of the science. Only in the fashion
                    indicated by Hermann can we hope to render clear the position of a pure theory
                    of economic facts as an indispensable and independent branch of social science.
                    The historic method of inquiry, fatal to much that has been regarded as
                    distinctive of the abstract or English school of political economy, harmonizes
                    perfectly with the theory of the elementary facts from which economical
                    development takes its start, as stated by Hermann and those Continental wrjters
                    who have followed him.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Researches,</hi> in the 2d edition, consists of ten
                    separate essays, of which the first, on the fundamental notions of economics (
                    “Grundlegung,” pp. 1-77), the fifth (pp. 143-389, on “Production”), the
                    sixth(pp. 390-459, on “Price”), the eighth (pp. 448-581, on “Profit”), and the
                    ninth (pp. 582-598, on ‘ ‘ Revenue”) are of the greatest importance. In the
                    “Grundlegung,” a clear and lucid description is given of the simple phenomena,
                    in family, community, and state, upon which economical inquiries are founded.
                    Human wants and the satisfaction to be obtained for them by labour exercised on
                    natural agents are recognized as the primitive facts. But in the satisfaction of
                    wants there are two aspects, the technical and the economical. Technically we
                    consider solely the process by which commodities of a quality suited to satisfy
                    want are obtained. Economically we have always to estimate the ratio between the
                    effort expended and the result obtained. An “economy” is a distribution of
                    forces so that the result, satisfaction, may be obtained with least expenditure
                    of effort, with least loss of utility. The influence of this economical
                    principle, the institutions to which it gives rise, the conditions under which
                    it is possible, and the circumstances which affect, modify, or counteract it,
                    are traced with reference to the individual, the family, the community, and the
                    state or nation. The increasing complexity of the phenomena does not alter the
                    nature of the principle which lies at the basis of them, and it is the business
                    of economic theory to analyse these phenomena under guidance of the general
                    principle. Economics is therefore defined by Hermann as the “quantitative theory
                    of goods and, though he is sparing in the use of symbols, his method of
                    treatment is throughout mathematical. Deserving of attention is the manner in
                    which he points out the influence of collective feeling and collective wants as
                    giving rise to special institutions (government, defence) in the community. To
                    this first fundamental essay the three succeeding papers (“Wants,” “Goods,”
                    “Economy,” pp. 78-142) are appendices. The treatment of these, the
                    classifications given, the detailed discussion of particular points, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the productivity of labour, and the distinction drawn
                    between economical estimates from the individual or the collective point of
                    view, make up a solid contribution to the science.</p>
                <p>The fifth essay is an elaborate treatise on the theory of production, treating
                    the agents of production—free goods, labour, and capital—separately, then the
                    interests of the several parties engaged, and the changes due to variations in
                    the cost of producing. Under “Labour” is given the most complete and systematic
                    discussion of separation of employments. Capital is defined so as to include
                    land, but careful reference is made to the distinctive peculiarities of this
                    form of wealth. Especially remarkable is Hermann’s treatment of what he calls
                    <hi rend="italic">Nutz-capital {i.e.,</hi> servicecapital), with regard to which
                    he accepts almost entirely the view of J. B. Say. Under fixed capital a very
                    elaborate treatment of the nature and economic influence of machines is given,
                    while the handling of changes in the cost of production, both here and in the
                    essay on “Profit, is acute and luminous.</p>
                <p>The sixth essay analyses the forces which underlie supply and demand. These are
                    stated to be:—(a) on the side of the purchaser—(1) his desire for the commodity
                    in question, or its utility to him, (2) his means, (3) the competition of
                    sellers; <hi rend="italic">(b)</hi> on the side of the seller—(1) cost of
                    production, (2) competition of the buyers, (3) the value of the medium of
                    exchange. The same considerations are shown to hold good in the case of the
                    price of labour, though unfortunately the seventh essay, on “Wages,” is
                    incomplete. The eighth essay, on “Profit, ’’ discusses very elaborately the rate
                    of return on the various species of capital and the circumstances that determine
                    it, distinguishes interest from profit in general, and marks as a special form
                    the profit of the <hi rend="italic">entrepreneur (Unternchmergcwinn).</hi> This
                    last he regards as distinct from wages of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n776/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0776-0741"/> superintendence, and from insurance for risk. The
                    ninth and tenth essays, on“Revenue’’and “Consumption,’’are perhaps specially
                    interesting from the clear mode in which the theory, afterwards called that of
                    the wages fund, is rejected, and from the precision with which the diverse
                    points of view for estimating net revenue are discriminated.</p>
                <p>This brief analysis is sufficient to show the high value of Hermann’s work as a
                    contribution to pure economics. On practical questions, those of economic
                    legislation, his opinions are only to be gathered with difficulty from the
                    papers in the <hi rend="italic">Gelehrte Anzeigen,</hi> and generally were
                    expressed with such reference to special circumstances as to render doubtful
                    their full import. It seems probable, however, that his views on protection were
                    far from clear, and that he was somewhat under the sway of the dangerous
                    principle that the best financial policy is encouragement of national industry.
                    It is difficult, however, to speak definitely on this subject.</p>
