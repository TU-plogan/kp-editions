                <p>I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Harbours.</hi></p>
                <p>ALL harbours may be classed either as havens for the protection of ships during
                    storms, or as ports suited for commercial purposes. Of the first mentioned
                    class, or those which are called harbours of refuge, some are natural and some
                    artificial.</p>
                <p>The designing of harbours constitutes confessedly one of the most difficult
                    branches of civil engineering. In making such a design the engineer, of course,
                    avails himself of the information which is derived from past experience, and
                    endeavours, to the best of his power, to institute a comparison between the
                    given locality and some existing harbour which he supposes to be similarly
                    situated. Perfect identity, however, in the physical peculiarities of different
                    localities seldom if ever exists, and all that can be done in deriving benefit
                    from past experience is to select the harbour which seems most nearly to
                    resemble the proposed work.</p>
                <p>In order the better to understand the nature of the difficulties which beset the
                    marine engineer, let us suppose that he is called upon to design works for the
                    accommodation of shipping in a given locality. The questions which immediately
                    press on his attention are—(1) What is the cheapest kind of design that is
                    suitable for the place and sufficient for the class of shipping which has to be
                    accommodated <hi rend="italic">1</hi> and (2) What are the smallest sizes of
                    materials and thickness of walls that are admissible in its construction? as on
                    these the cost of the work will materially depend. Before considering how far it
                    is possible to answer such questions, let us endeavour to define the varieties
                    of design into which all sorts of harbours may, with propriety, be resolved.</p>
                <p>In the first place they may be all classified under two nain heads—viz., <hi
                    rend="italic">interior works</hi> and <hi rend="italic">exterior works.</hi></p>
                <p>The interior works are provided for the accommodation and repair of vessels,
                    while the exterior works may be con-eniently enough divided into the following
                    five classes.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Harbours of Refuge and Anchorage Breakwaters.—</hi> These
                    consist of one or more breakwaters, so arranged as to form a safe roadstead,
                    which shall be easily accessible to the largest vessels in all states of the
                    weather and tide. A breakwater forms a barrier either complete or partial to the
                    progress of the waves, and is intended for sheltering the anchorage ground under
                    its lee. It is not used for commercial traffic as are piers or quays, and
                    therefore a parapet is not necessarily required for preventing the waves from
                    breaking over the top, although this may be useful as a protection against the
                    wind.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Deep-water and Tidal Harbours for Commercial Purposes</hi>
                    (fig. 1, <hi rend="italic">a, b).—</hi> A harbour for commercial purposes is any
                    arrangement of piers or breakwaters, or of both, which encloses and so
                    tranquillizes a sheet of water, that vessels may be moored at the quay walls or
                    wharves which form the inner sides of the piers. Where the coast line lies open
                    to a very heavy sea it is often found necessary to make a double or compound
                    harbour (fig. 1, δ). In such a case the entrance to the inner basin is situated
                    within the sheltered area formed by the outer works.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Kanted or Curved Piers</hi> (fig. 1, c).—Where there is a
                    single pier of this kind vessels lie under the lee of the kant or kauts, and the
                    sheltered side of the pier is therefore finished as a quay. As the outer end of
                    any such single pier is surrounded by the open sea, it may be convenient to call
                    it a “free end” in contradistinction to the outer end of a close harbour, where
                    the sea room in the fairway is limited to the breadth of the entrance which
                    ought, for sheltering the basin, to be made as narrow as is consistent with the
                    safe passage of vessels. Both extremities of all single insulated breakwaters
                    are of course free ends, as are also the seaward ends of all single breakwaters
                    which are connected with the land.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Straight Piers</hi> (fig. 1, <hi rend="italic">di).—</hi> A
                    straight pier generally projects at right angles to the coast line, with a free
                    end at its seaward extremity; and, unless when the wind blows right in upon the
                    shore, a straight pier will always afford some shelter on its lee side.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Quay or Wharf</hi> (fig. 1, e).—A quay wall is usually built
                    parallel to the line of shore. It affords no shelter of any kind, and the only
                    advantage which it possesses is that of enabling vessels to load and unload
                    without their having to “beach,” or, where the shores are steep, even to take
                    the ground.</p>
                <p>It will be observed that all the kinds of piers or harbours just enumerated
                    differ materially from each other in the amount of shelter which they afford,
                    and are suitable for places having very different degrees of exposure. The first
                    step to be taken, therefore, is to select from the different classes of designs
                    which have been enumerated the one which is best adapted to the physical
                    peculiarities of the situation. The engineer in order to make this selection
                    judiciously must keep in view the essential elements of stability, economy,
                    safety of ingress and egress, and convenient accommodation for the trade of the
                    port. If the place be much exposed, he must therefore arrange the different
                    parts of the work so as to produce a harbour which may be easily taken and left
                    in stormy weather, without endangering the tranquillity of the internal area;
                    for it is <hi rend="italic">the combination of the qualities of an easy and safe
                    entrance and exit, with a good</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> ii</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">loose” and a smooth interior, which alone constitutes a good
                    harbour.</hi> Lastly, he must fix the width of the piers and height of the
                    parapets.</p>
                <p>The local characteristics which at the outset demand our consideration are—(1)
                    the geological and other physical peculiarities of the shore; (2) the exposure;
                    (3) the force of the waves due to the exposure; (4) the strength, direction, and
                    range of the tides; (5) the depth of the bay or sea in which the harbour is to
                    be built; (6) the proximity of deep water to the works, or in other words, the
                    slope of the foreshore; and (7) the angle at which the heaviest waves impinge on
                    the coast line and on the works.</p>
                <p>Before considering some of these questions the reader may refer to figs. 2 and 3,
                    on which are marked the technical names of different parts of harbour works.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Generation of Waves.</hi></p>
                <p>Mistakes as to the level of the highest tides are sometimes made by drawing too
                    hasty conclusions from the presence of vegetable life. In the Shetland Islands
                    there may often be seen large blocks of rock (and to these reference will
                    afterwards be made), which during storms have <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n477/mode/1up"

                    than that at which vegetation commences and far above the ordinary run of the
                    surf.</p>
                <p>The level below the surface of low water at which mud reposes will be found of
                    very considerable value in judging of the exposure of a coast. It may appear
                    unlikely that the disturbance of the surface of the sea occasioned by storms
                    should be propagated to great depths, but there is no want of evidence on this
                    head. Sir G. B. Airy, the astronomerroyal, has shown, on theoretical grounds,
                    that at a depth equal to the length of the wave the motion is - <hi
                    rend="subscript"> b</hi>-⅞ <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> ∙ of that at the
                    surface, and mentions that heavy ground swells break in a depth of 100 fathoms.
                    Sir J. Coode found, from underwater examinations made with the diving dres3,
                    that the shingle of the Chesil Bank was moved during heavy winter storms at a
                    depth of 8 fathoms; and Captain E. K. Calver, R.N., has seen waves 6 or 8 feet
                    high change their colour from the abrasion of the bottom after passing into
                    water of 7 or 8 fathoms. Captain Cialdi maintains that waves may excavate the
                    bottom at a depth of 655 feet in the ocean, of 163 feet in the Mediterranean,
                    and of 132 feet in the English Channel and Adriatic. From these statements it
                    may easily be inferred that in exposed situations mud cannot repose near the
                    surface. Applying such a test to the German Ocean, it is found that in Shetland
                    mud lies in from 80 to 90 fathoms below low water, and its level gradually rises
                    till, on the coast of Holland, it is found at a depth of from 16 to 12 fathoms
                    at the mouth of the Elbe. Now, the violence of the waves upon the shores of the
                    German Ocean certainly corresponds with the rise in the level of the mud, there
                    being a gradual decrease as we come from Shetland and the north of
                    Scotland—where, as will be afterwards shown, wonderful energy is displayed by
                    the sea—to the coasts of Holland, where the waves are much modified. Although it
                    is no doubt true that the flatbottom vessels of the Dutch are built purposely
                    for resisting a heavy surf, still the fact of their being able to take the open
                    beach in nearly all weathers without any protection from harbours proves that
                    the waves are very much reduced before they reach the Dutch coast. Mr Hyde
                    Clarke says —“On the coast of Zealand the Dutch reckoned 8∣ feet as the greatest
                    height to which any wave would be thrown.”</p>
                <p>Tn comparing an existing harbour with a proposed one, perhaps the most obvious
                    element is what may be termed the <hi rend="italic">line of maximum
                    exposure,</hi> or, in other words, the line of greatest fetch or reach of open
                    sea, and this can be easily measured from a chart. But though possessed of this
                    information, the engineer still does not know in what ratio the height of the
                    waves increases in relation to any given increase in the line of exposure.</p>
                <p>In 1852, in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Hew</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Philosoph.</hi><hi rend="italic">Journal,</hi> Mr Thomas Stevenson stated as
                    the result of experimental observation that the heights of the waves were most
                    nearly <hi rend="italic">“in the ratio of the square roots of their distances
                    from the windward shoref</hi> or, when <hi rend="italic">h =</hi> height of wave

                <p>Some of these earlier results have also been laid down in fig. 4, so as to form a
                    storm curve, but since the diagram was made many more observations have been
                    obtained which corroborate the law.</p>
                <p>The formula <hi rend="italic">h —</hi> 1 ’ 5 <hi rend="subscript"> λ</hi> ∕&lt;7
                    is represented by the parabolic curve in the diagram, which indicates pretty
                    nearly the height of waves during heavy gales, at least in seas which do not
                    greatly differ in depth from those where the observations were made. This
                    formula is of course inapplicable where the water is not of sufficient depth to
                    allow the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n478/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0478-0457"/> waves to be fully formed, or where it becomes so
                    shallow as to reduce their height after they are formed.</p>
                <p>It must be observed that in short fetches, as in narrow lochs or arms of the sea,
                    waves are raised higher during very violent gales than the formula indicates;
                    though it does not appear that such waves go on progressing in height in the
                    same high ratio for any considerable distance.</p>
                <p>For short reaches and violent squalls, the formula given in column 5 of the
                    foregoing table will be found more suitable, viz.: —</p>

                <p>The Comte de Marsilli, in 1725, observed waves 14 feet 10 inches in height where
                    the longest possible fetch is 600 miles. At Wick, with much the same exposure,
                    waves of about 40 feet have been seen to strike the breakwater. But the highest
                    which are known to have been accurately measured were by Dr Scoresby in the
                    Atlantic, where they attained the height of 43 feet above the hollow. Cialdi
                    gives observations of others which were from 60 to 108 feet high, but he does
                    not state how the heights were ascertained.</p>
                <p>It does not follow, however, that the line of the maximum exposure is in every
                    case the line of maximum <hi rend="italic">effective</hi> force of the waves,
                    for this must depend, not only on the length of fetch, but on the angle of
                    incidence of the waves on the walls of the harbour. What may be termed the line
                    of <hi rend="italic">maximum effective exposure</hi> is that which, after being
                    corrected for obliquity of impact, produces the maximum result, and this can
                    only be ascertained from the chart by successive trials.</p>
                <p>Let as— the greatest force that can assail the pier, <hi rend="italic">h =</hi>
                    height of waves which produce (after being corrected for obliquity) the maximum
                    effect, and which are due to the line of maximum effective exposure, α =
                    azimuthal angle formed between the directions of pier and the line of exposure;
                    then, when the force is resolved normal to the line of pier,—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">X</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">ocä</hi> sin <hi rend="superscript">
                    2</hi> α; but if the force be again resolved in the direction of the waves
                    themselves, the expression becomes <hi rend="italic">x&lt;×h</hi> sin <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 3</hi> α.</p>
                <p>It should not, however, be forgotten, in connexion with this subject, that in
                    some cases there are modifying elements to which special attention requires to
                    be given. The waves, for example, when approaching the land obliquely, alter
                    their direction when they get close to the shore, in consequence of the change
                    of depth, and from this cause they approach more nearly at right angles to the
                    general line of the beach, and thus strike with greater force than the line of
                    maximum effective exposure would lead us to expect.</p>
                <p>The extraordinary difference between waves which impinge at right angles and
                    others which have even a very slight amount of obliquity has been shown in the
                    most unmistakable manner at the Wick breakwater, where all attempts to make the
                    work stand when exactly at right angles to the waves have hitherto been
                    unsuccessful. It was found by observation that while waves coming from the
                    direction of S. by E. struck the outer part at normal incidence, they struck the
                    landward end of the same kant at an angle of 81°, giving 9° of obliquity. This
                    small measure of relief was found to make a great difference in the impact upon
                    the wall.</p>
                <p>The value of the line of effective exposure varies in certain localities with the
                    geographical configuration of the land, a3 in Loch Fyne, where the wind seems to
                    alter its direction with the winding of the loch, so that the effective fetch is
                    greater than the width of free water at the place. On the other hand, where the
                    channel expands, the height of the waves is decreased, as at Craignure in Mull,
                    where the highest wave observed during the winter of 1853-4 was very much less
                    than the formula indicates.</p>
                <p>In a case such as représente 1 in fig. 5, the waves which enter the entrance
                    channel or harbour mouth B, though generated apparently in the fetch AB, are
                    largely due to the fetch CB. For the waves generated in the length CA pass round
                    the point A, and are thereafter subject to the impulse of the wind along the
                    line AB. The waves then which enter the harbour mouth, instead of having their
                    point of genesis at A, really take their origin at C, and their height is due to
                    the fetch CB, though reduced by a deflexion round the point A.</p>
                <p>Lateral friction is due to the passage of the end of the wave along the face of a
                    vertical wall, while lateral erosion is due to the end of the wave breaking as
                    it passes along the face of long talus walls or sloping beaches.</p>

                <p>Smeaton, in referring to the propriety of using joggles in the masonry of the
                    Eddystone Lighthouse, says—“When we have to do with and to endeavour to control
                    those <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n479/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0479-0458"/> powers of nature that are subject to no
                    calculation, I trust it will be deemed prudent not to omit, in such a case,
                    anything that can without difficulty be applied, and that would be likely to add
                    to the security.” This statement of our greatest marine engineer indicates the
                    propriety of carefully collecting any facts that may help us to a more accurate
                    estimation of those forces which he regarded as being “subject to no
                    calculation.”</p>
                <p>At the Bishop Rock lighthouse, a bell was broken from its attachments at the
                    level of 100 feet above the high water mark during a gale in the winter of 1860,
                    and at Unst, the most northern of the Shetland Islands, a door was broken open
                    at a height of 195 feet above the sea. To these facts"it may be added that, as
                    proved by the testimony of an eye-witness, a block of 50 tons was moved by the
                    sea at Barrahead, one of the Hebrides. But still more extraordinary effects have
                    been observed at Whalsey in Shetland, where heavy blocks have been quarried, or
                    broken out of their beds <hi rend="italic">in situ,</hi> on the top of the Bound
                    Skerry at a great elevation above the sea. On thé south-east side, about 370
                    feet from the low water mark, and at a height of 62⅛ feet above its level, there
                    occurs a remarkable beach of angular blocks varying in size from 9⅜ tons
                    downwards, which are huddled together just as one would have expected to find,
                    had they been elevated only a few feet above the high water level. Towards the
                    north-east at the lffvel of 72 feet above the sea, in addition to many smaller
                    blocks which had evidently been recently detached, there was one 5⅛ tons in
                    weight. It presented the appearance of recent detachment, having a fresh
                    unweathered look. Within 20 feet of the spot where it lay, there was a
                    comparatively recently formed void in the rock, which upon examination and
                    comparison by measurement was found to suit exactly the detached block. Here
                    then was a phenomenon so remarkable as almost to stagger belief--a mass of 5⅛
                    tons not only moved but actually quarried from its position <hi rend="italic">in
                    situ</hi> at a level of 72 feet above high water spring tides; and higher up
                    still there was another detached rock weighing no less than 13⅜ tons tilted up
                    in a peculiar position, and underneath which numerous angular masses had been
                    wedged, obviously by aqueous action.</p>
                <p>But by far the most striking effects as yet recorded were at the harbour works of
                    Wick, which were commenced in 1863, and consisted of blocks of from 5 to 10 tons
                    set on edge, first built above high water neap tides with hydraulic lime, then
                    with Roman and latterly with Portland cement. In October 1864, 300 feet of the
                    contractor’s staging were carried away; and greenheart were afterwards
                    substituted for Memel piles, but these too were broken by the sea. The first
                    portion of the wall was, in conformity with usual practice, founded at 12 feet
                    below low water, but 18 feet was subsequently adopted, and the nibble has since
                    been washed down to 15 feet below that· level. In 1872 a huge monolithic block
                    of concrete, weighing in all 1350 tons, was removed <hi rend="italic">en</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">masse</hi> out of its position and carried to leeward of the
                    breakwater. Extraordinary as this may appear, it was surpassed in 1873, when
                    another concrete mass which had been substituted for the one that was moved, was
                    in like manner carried away, though it contained 1500 cubic yards of cement
                    rubble, the weight of which was about 2600 tons.</p>
                <p>The marine dynamometer was constructed by Mr T. Stevenson for the purpose of
                    ascertaining the force of the waves against an obstacle. DEFD (fig. 6) is a
                    cast-iron cylinder, which is firmly bolted at the projecting flanges G to the
                    rock where the experiments are to be made. This cylinder has a circular flange
                    at D. Lis a door which is opened when the observation is to be read off. A is a

                    rods B, which pass through a circular plate C (which is screwed down to the
                    flange D), and also through holes in the bottom of the cylinder EF. Within the
                    cylinder there is attached to the plate C a very strong steel spring, to the
                    other or free end of which is fastened the small circular plate K, which again
                    is secured to the guide rods B. There are also rings of leather T, which slide
                    on the guide rods, and serve as indices for registering how far the rods have
                    been pushed through the holes in the bottom EF, or, in other words, how far the
                    spring has been drawn out by the action of the waves against the disk A. These
                    disks were from 6 to 9 inches in diameter.</p>
                <p>The greatest result obtained by the dynamometer at Skerryvore Lighthouse, in the
                    Atlantic, was during the heavy westerly gale of 29th March 1845, when there was
                    registered a force equivalent to 6083 lb, or nearly 3 tons, per square foot,
                    deduced from the area exposed. The next highest was 5323 lb. In the German Ocean
                    the greatest result obtained at the Bell Rock was 3013 lb per square foot. But
                    subsequent and much more extended observations at Dunbar, in the county of East
                    Lothian, gave 3⅜ tons; while at the harbour works of Buckie, on the coast of
                    Banffshire, the highest result of observations, extending over a period of
                    several years, was 3 tons per square foot.</p>
                <p>Mr David Stevenson, when referring, in 1835, to the lakes in North America,
                    pointed out that the general depth of water must, in order to allow the waves to
                    be fully formed, be considerable, and that the sea must be unobstructed by
                    shoals, and also of sufficient area to admit of the wind acting fully on the
                    water.</p>
                <p>If in front of a harbour shoal water extends seawards for a considerable distance
                    so as to form an extensive flat foreshore, the depth of water above it becomes
                    the true limit of the maximum wave, whatever may be the general depth of the sea
                    outside. But at Arbroath harbour and at Alne mouth, the heaviest waves are
                    tripped up by the shoal water near the mouths of the harbours, and are not found
                    so dangerous to the works inside as the smaller waves which reach the beach in
                    an unbroken state.</p>
                <p>Mr Scott Russell states that waves break when they come into water of the same
                    depth as their height. At Wick, however, the height of the waves above the mean
                    level was about two-thirds of their height. In 1870, at Scarborough, it was
                    found that waves of from 5 to 6∣ feet broke when the depth was 10 feet 3 inches
                    below their troughs, and 6 feet waves broke in water 13 feet 8 inches deep,
                    which would for waves of this class give Λ = ∣&lt;7, where <hi rend="italic"
                    >d</hi> is depth below mean level, and <hi rend="italic">h</hi> the height from
                    hollow to crest.</p>
                <p>The late Dr Macquorn Rankine has shown that, theoretically, the mean water level
                    is not situated half way between the crest and trough of the sea. The following
                    formulae furnished by him give the mean level of the sea from the height and
                    length of the wave. These formulae are exact only for water of considerable
                    depth as compared with the length of the wave. For shallower water they are only
                    approximate :—</p>
                <p>Let L be the length of a wave, H the height from trough to crest; then, diameter
                    of rolling circle, radius of orbit of particle = ⅛H, and elevation of middle

                <p>Harbours of refuge are distinguished from tidal harbours mainly by the superior
                    depth of water which they possess and the larger area which they enclose. The
                    requisites are—shelter during storms, good holding ground, and easy access for
                    shipping at any time of tide and in all states of the weather A breakwater,
                    though a passive, is yet a real agent, having true work to do. During storms
                    many thousand tons of water are elevated and maintained above <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n480/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0480-0459"/> the sea-level; and a breakwater has to stop their
                    onward motion within a given space or else to change the direction of their
                    movement. There are two ways in which this work can be performed. One is by
                    means of a plumb wall to alter the direction of the moving water by causing it
                    to ascend vertically, and then to allow it to descend vertically, by which
                    process the waves are reflected and sent back seawards. Another mode is to
                    arrest the undulations by a sloping wall of length sufficient to allow the mass
                    of elevated water to fall down upon the slope. If, however, the slope is not
                    long enough to enable the waveβ to destroy themselves, they will, though reduced
                    in height, pursue their original direction and pass over the top of the
                    breakwater. In this case the breakwater does not do its full amount of work, and
                    imperfect shelter is obtained.</p>
                <p>The principle asserted in favour of the vertical wall is that oceanic waves in
                    deep water are purely oscillatory, and exert no impact against vertical
                    barriers, which are therefore the most eligible, as they have only to encounter
                    the hydrostatic pressure due to the height of the impinging billows which are
                    reflected without breaking.</p>
                <p>From the effect of winds and tide-currents already referred to, and perhaps from
                    other causes, the action of which seems to have been overlooked by the advocates
                    of the upright wall, we have good reason for believing that any form of barrier,
                    in whatever depth of water it may be placed, must occasionally be subjected to
                    heavy impact. The possibility of waves of translation being generated in the
                    deepest water is. established by the following facts :— <hi rend="italic"
                    >first,</hi> that oceanic waves break, partially at least, long before they
                    reach the shore, because (as admitted by the advocates of the purely oscillatory
                    character of oceanic undulations) the depth of water is too small to admit of
                    their being fully propagated; <hi rend="italic">secondly,</hi> that waves in
                    strong tideways break in deep water during calm weather—a phenomenon which is
                    apparent to the eye and familiar to all sailors; <hi rend="italic">thirdly,</hi>
                    and negatively, that to leeward of those races which produce broken water, and
                    which certainly do not reflect the incoming waves, there is comparatively smooth
                    water both at sea and on the adjoining shore until the strength of the tide is
                    exhausted and the race has disappeared, after which violent action is again
                    fully manifested on the shore. Even a vertical wall, if built of ordinary
                    masonry in courses, must during its formation present to the action of the waves
                    at its unfinished end a sloping or at least a stepped face like a talus wall,
                    but which, unfortunately for its stability, possesses none of the advantages of
                    such a finished work. In short, during the most critical period of the history
                    of every built vertical wall, the face work and hearting are exposed, at the
                    outer end, to the force of breaking waves. At Dunbar the force against the
                    unfinished end of a nearly vertical wall was found by the marine dynamometer to
                    be nearly six times greater than on the face of the finished wall, where the
                    waves were at the time purely oscillatory.</p>
                <p>An important advantage of the sloping wall is the small resistance which it
                    offers to the impinging wave, but it should also be borne in mind that the
                    weight resting on the face-stones in a talus wall is decreased in proportion to
                    the sine of the angle of the slope. If we suppose the waves which assail a
                    sloping wall to act in the horizontal plane, the component of their impulsive
                    force at right angles to the surface of the talus will be proportional to the
                    sine of the angle of inclination to the plane, while the effective force
                    estimated in the horizontal plane will be proportional to the square of the sine
                    of the angle of inclination. But if we assume the motion of the impinging
                    particles to be horizontal, the number of them which will be intercepted by the
                    sloping surface will be also reduced in the ratio of the sine of the angle of
                    inclination, or of the inclination of the wall to the vertical. Hence the
                    tendency of the waves to produce horizontal displacement, on the assumption that
                    the direction of the impinging particles is horizontal, will be pro portional to
                    the cube of the sine of the angle of elevation of the wall.</p>
                <p>If it further happens that, owing to the relative direction of the pier and of
                    the waves, there is an oblique action in azimuth as well as in altitude, there
                    will be another similar reduction in the ratio of the squares or cubes of the
                    angle of incidence, according as the component of the force is reckoned at right
                    angles to the surface of the pier or in the direction of the waves.</p>
                <p>Let ∕= force of the wave on unit of surface of wall for perpendicular incidence;
                    <hi rend="italic">f'≈</hi> force on unit of surface at vertical incidence <hi
                    rend="italic">&lt;ρ</hi> and azimuthal incidence <hi rend="italic">ψ;</hi> then

                <p>The amount of shelter which is produced by a breakwater must be measured by the
                    length of the portion of wave which is either destroyed or reflected by it. The
                    amount of work done by it decreases from the maximum, which is at normal
                    incidence, to zero when the waves come upon it “end on,” in which last case it
                    ceases to act as a breakwater at all, unless to the extent due to lateral
                    friction or erosion where there is a wall or a slope on which the end of the
                    waves can break.</p>
                <p>If a breakwater be so situated in relation to the coast line that waves may
                    strike obliquely upon its inner or sheltered side, an extension of its length in
                    the same direction will increase the amount of sea intercepted by it. The
                    lengthening of a breakwater may therefore, during certain winds, increase the
                    sea within the harbour instead of reducing it. In such a case the extension
                    should, if possible, be made in a different direction, or a separate breakwater
                    may be brought from the shore so as to shelter the inner side. If these works
                    cannot be undertaken, then an addition to the sheltered space within must be
                    provided in which the waves can spread, or additional slopes be provided on
                    which they can break.</p>

                    which would give about four vessels per acre. Captain Calver allows three
                    vessels per acre for a small sheltered harbour of refuge. At Cardiff Flats there
                    were at one time 224 vessels anchored as close to each other as they could well
                    be, in an open roadstead, and occupying a space of 560 acres, which would give 0

                <p>We have hitherto been considering outer breakwaters erected in deep water, and
                    which are constantly exposed to the waves; we now turn to piers and sea-walls
                    which are placed within the range of the breaking surf, and which are exposed to
                    its force for a limited period only, being sometimes left nearly or altogether
                    dry by the receding tide.</p>
                <p>In dealing with waves which are admitted by all to exert a true percussive force,
                    the question arises as to how this force may be best resisted—whether by
                    opposing to it dead weight, or a comparatively light structure, the stability of
                    which is dependent on strong fixtures connecting it with the bottom. On this
                    subject the late Mr Alan Stevenson made the following remarks, in relation to
                    lighthouse towers, but his views are equally applicable to piers and breakwaters
                    :—</p>
                <p>‘ ‘ A primary inquiry in regard to towers in an exposed situation is the question
                    whether their stability should depend upon their <hi rend="italic">strength
                    or</hi> their <hi rend="italic">weight,</hi> or, in other words, on their <hi
                    rend="italic">cohesion</hi> or their t'nerti*α? In preferring weight to strength
                    we more closely follow the course pointed out by the analogy of nature, and this
                    must not be regarded as a mere notional advantage, for the more close the
                    analogy between nature and our works the less difficulty we shall experience in
                    passing from nature to art, and the more directly will our observations on
                    natural phenomena bear upon the artificial project. If, for example, we make a
                    series of observations on the force of the sea as exerted on masses of rock, and
                    endeavour to draw from these observations some conclusions as to the amount and
                    direction of that force as exhibited by the masses of rock which resist it
                    successfully, and the form which these masses assume, we shall pass naturally to
                    the determination of the mass and form of a building which maybe capable of
                    opposing similar forces, as we conclude with some reason that the mass and form
                    of the natural rock are exponents of the amount and direction of the forces they
                    have so long continued to resist. It will readily be perceived that we are in a
                    very different and less advantageous position, when we attempt, from such
                    observations of natural phenomena in which weight is solely concerned, to deduce
                    the strength of an artificial fabric. Another very obvious reason why we should
                    prefer mass and weight to strength as a source of stability is that the effect
                    of mere inertia is constant and unchangeable in its nature, while the strength
                    which results even from the most judiciously disposed and well-executed fixtures
                    of a comparatively light fabric is constantly subject to be impaired by the
                    loosening of such fixtures, occasioned by the almost incessant tremor to which
                    structures of this kind must be subject from the beating of the waves. Mass
                    therefore seems to be a source of stability, the effect of which is at once
                    apprehended by the mind as more in harmony with the conservative principles of
                    nature, and unquestionably less liable to be deteriorated, than the strength
                    which depends upon the careful proportion and adjustment of parts.”<note

                    swept off the rock, while the thin panes of crown glass in the lantern of
                    Winstanley’s Eddystone tower, which were only about 5 feet higher, resisted the

                    between the height of the waves at the place and the height and configuration of
                    the rock itself above and below low water, and perhaps also on the configuration
                    of the bottom of the sea near the rock.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    forms a protection against the smaller waves, it operates as a dangerous
                    conductor to the larger waves, enabling them to exert a powerful action at a
                    much higher level than if the rock had been lower. It is of great importance
                    that these facts should be kept in view, and that the Eddystone should not be
                    regarded as a safe model for imitation at all rocks which are exposed to a heavy
                    sea.</p>
                <p>The impact of the waves against the outside of a sea wall or pier gives rise to
                    four distinct forces, namely—(1) the direct horizontal force, which tends to
                    shake loose, or drive in, the blocks of which the masonry consists; (2) the
                    vertical force acting upwards on any projecting stone or protuberance, as well
                    as against the lying beds of the stones; (3) the vertical force acting
                    downwards, which results either from the receding wave striking upon the toe of
                    a talus wall, or from its passing over the parapet and falling upon the pitching
                    behind, so as to plough it up; (4) the “backdraught,” which tends by reaction
                    from the wall to remove the soft bottom, and in this way to undermine the lower
                    courses or to suck loose stones out of the work.</p>
                <p>It may be concluded from the above that the points which require to be most
                    attended to are—the contour and quality of masonry of the wall itself; the
                    parapet, which if not of proper form, or of insufficient height, leads to damage
                    in the pitching behind it; and lastly, the foundationcourses, in the design and
                    construction of which, if similar precautions be not attended to, underwashing
                    of the bottom may take place, so as to leave the lowest courses without
                    protection.</p>
                <p>Within the masonry, as well as without, the waves exert force in the following
                    different ways :—(1) by the propagation of vibrations produced by the shock of
                    the waves on the outer or sea-wall, through the body of the pier to the inner or
                    quay-wall; (2) by the direct communication of the impulses through the particles
                    of the fluid occupying the interstices of the hearting, so as to act against the
                    back joints of the face stones of the inner quay; (3) by the sudden
                    condensations and expansions of the air in the hearting, so as to loosen, and at
                    last to blow out, the face stones of the quay; combined with (4) the hydrostatic
                    pressure of the water, which is forced through the sea-wall, and, from want of
                    free exit, is retained and acts as a head at the back of the quay, and which,
                    however small in quantity, will, as in a Bramah press, act with equal force upon
                    all surfaces exposed to its pressure, however large those surfaces may be. The
                    last three causes are probably the most efficient agents in the work of
                    destruction.</p>
                <p>From a comparison of different piers in the German Ocean where we have most
                    examples, and from careful consideration of the other data, it appears that
                    vertical piers, fully exposed to the ordinary waves of that sea, should be not
                    less than from 35 to 45 feet broad at the level of high water. Of course this
                    remark does not apply to anomalous cases where waves are exceptionally high,
                    but, as already stated, to works exposed to the ordinary waves.</p>
                <p>The positions in which the piers are to be placed depend on the nature and
                    configuration of the shore and of the bottom. After a correct plan, with
                    soundings, has been obtained, the next step is to lay down contour lines of the
                    different depths which make the limits of the deep and shoal water at once
                    obvious to the eye. The lines of the piers may then be sketched so as, without
                    disregarding other conditions, to keep the works as much as possible on the
                    shoal ground, while they at the same time enclose the greatest possible area of
                    deep water.</p>
                <p>The entrance should be fixed seaward of every part of the works; and its
                    direction, unless where the internal area is small and the sea very heavy,
                    should if possible be made to coincide with that of the heaviest waves, so that
                    they may run along with and guide vessels into the harbour.</p>
                <p>The outer pier should in such a case be extended sufficiently far seaward of the
                    end of the inner pier head to give it a free end, as in fig. 7, thus allowing a
                    ship plenty of sea room to shape an easy course before taking the entrance to
                    the sheltered basin of the harbour.</p>
                <p>There should be sufficient distance landward of a harbour mouth to allow a
                    vessel, having full weigh on her, to shorten sail. For this Minard recommends
                    that, where vessels of ordinary size require to alter their course in order to
                    reach the inner basin, no circle with a less radius than 200 yards in smooth
                    water should, if possible, be adopted, and it should not be forgotten that a
                    vessel requires a larger radius in turning where the water is shoal than where
                    it is deep.</p>
                <p>If the beach consist of travelling detritus, the entrance must be so devised as
                    not to form a trap for the passing shingle. This danger is most to be dreaded on
                    the coasts where heavy waves strike obliquely upon the shore. Finally, there
                    must be a good “loose,” so that vessels on leaving the harbour shall be able to
                    shape their course free of rocks or a lee-shore; and Minard very properly
                    remarks that the mouths of harbours should be designed rather to suit the
                    entering, which is far more important, than the exit of vessels.</p>
                <p>Preference should generally be given to a pier of horizontal convex outline, or a
                    polygonal form, than to one long straight pier. The principal objection to a
                    straight pier does not, however, extend to cases where the heaviest waves strike
                    upon it obliquely, and roll landwards along the sea-wall. Especial care,
                    however, must in all cases be taken that a sea-work nowhere presents to the sea
                    a surface of concave horizontal outline, or, what is still worse, abrupt faces
                    which form a re-entrant angle; for the waves will then act with an almost
                    explosive violence, the breaking of a free wave being a very different thing
                    from the breaking of a wave confined by a barrier of masonry. While the first
                    may be compared to the harmless ignition of a loose heap of gunpowder, the other
                    resembles the dangerous explosion produced by the discharge of a cannon.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n483/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0483-0462"/>
                <p>It may in some cases be found better, in designing a seawall for protecting a
                    sinuous coast, to carry the bulwark straight across ledges of rock which extend
                    landwards, than to follow the line of the high water margin. For although with
                    the straight wall we may have to encounter a greater depth of water and a
                    heavier surf, still with the other we may have to oppose the waves with a wall
                    which has at some places a concave horizontal curvature, by which the force is
                    concentrated and rendered more destructive. Moreover, the straight wall may be
                    considerably shorter than the curved.</p>
                <p>The general gradient of a fragmentary beach depends upon the size and nature of
                    the particles, and the force of the sea. The dissimilarity between its slopes
                    near the levels of high and low water arises from a decrease in the force of the
                    waves, caused by their being broken before they reach the high water mark. The
                    great object, therefore, is to design the profile of the wall so as to alter as
                    little as possible the symmetry of the beach. For the reasons already stated, it
                    is plain that unless near high water mark a vertical wall is in most cases
                    unsuitable for a sandy beach. Instead of altering the direction of the wave at a
                    distance from its foundation, the whole change is produced at that very point;
                    and, unless the wall bo founded at a considerable depth, its destruction is all
                    but certain. A curved profile will prevent to a considerable extent the danger
                    of reaction, by causing the alteration in the direction of the wave to take
                    place at that part where the wall is strongest, and which is also at the
                    greatest possible distance from the toe or curb course. But a very serious
                    objection to all forms of curved walls, unless the radius be large, is the
                    weakness which results from the use of wedge-shaped face-stones. The impact of
                    the sea on materials of that form may be compared to a blow directed upwards
                    against the intrados of a stone arch—the direction of all others in which the
                    voussoirs are most easily dislocated. This action can only be resisted by very
                    careful workmanship in the dressing and setting of the backing. Another
                    objection, applicable to all except tideless seas, such as the Mediterranean,
                    arises from the varying level of the surface of the water; for what may be best
                    at one time of the tide cannot be equally suitable at another.</p>
                <p>When a wave encounters an obstacle such as a breakwater, the portion which
                    strikes it is either entirely destroyed or reflected seawards; while the portion
                    which is not so intercepted passes onwards, and spreading laterally under lee of
                    the barrier suffers a reduction of its height. From a very few observations in
                    the sea under lee of the breakwater at Wick, and from some experiments made in a
                    brewer’s cooling vat by Mr Thomas Stevenson, it appeared that after passing an
                    obstruction the reduction in the height of a wave varies as the square root of
                    the angle of deflexion. When <hi rend="italic">x</hi> represents the ratio of
                    the reduced to the unreduced wave and α the angle of deflexion, the formula,
                    which must however, be regarded as only approximate, is x=l ’ 00- ∙06√~</p>

                    this formula, or one for a logarithmic spiral, represents the effect of lateral
                    divergence very fairly. Providing the materials of the beach are homogeneous and
                    easily moved, the incursions of the waves into the land will be measures of the
                    forces, all of which become <hi rend="italic">nil</hi> at the high water mark.

                <p>The tranquillity of close harbours with the same exposure depends on the relative
                    widths of the entrance and the interior, the depth of water, and the form and
                    direction of the entrance in relation to the line of maximum exposure. A formula
                    for the reductive power of harbours has been given by Mr Thomas Stevenson <hi
                    rend="italic">(Edin. Phil. Journal</hi> for 1853).</p>
                <p>Where the piers are high enough to protect the enclosed area from the wind, and
                    the width of entrance not veιy great in comparison with the breadth of the wave,
                    the quay walls nearly vertical, and the distance from the entrance to place of
                    observation not less than 50 feet, then·</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">x</hi> =H— _ 1 ( II + H≤l) √D ,</p>
                <p>√B 50 ∖ √B∕ ’</p>
                <p>where II - height of wave at entrance, <hi rend="italic">b</hi> — breadth of
                    entrance, B =∙ breadth of harbour at place of observation, D = distance from
                    mouth of harbour to place of observation, <hi rend="italic">x≈</hi> height of
                    reduced or residual wave at place of observation,—all in feet. If H be taken as
                    unity, <hi rend="italic">x</hi> will be a fraction representing the reductive
                    power of the harbour.</p>
                <p>Actual measurements at the harbours of Kingstown, Sunderland, Macduff, Fisherrow,
                    and Buckie gave the mean of observations (which at Buckie alone numbered upwards
                    of 2000) = 2 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 64 feet, while that of results
                    calculated by the formula gave 2’62 feet.</p>
                <p>The size as well as the ratio of widths of entrance and basin must also bear a
                    proper relation to the height of waves to which the harbour is exposed. The
                    formula for the reductive power assumes that the waves after being reduced by
                    lateral expansion shall have time to sink and be ultimately destroyed. But if
                    instead of this they are again reflected towards the entrance, such recoil will
                    destroy the tranquillity of the basin and prevent vessels from answering their
                    helm when taking the entrance. Also where a spending beach which is only
                    partially effective in destroying the waves is formed very near the entrance, it
                    may do little or no good by causing a back wash or recoil wave which will
                    injuriously affect vessels when entering.</p>
                <p>As before mentioned, it is essential when the exposure is great that there be
                    either a considerable internal area, or else a separate basin opposite the
                    entrance to the inner basin, for the waves to destroy or spend themselves. Such
                    a basin should, if possible, enclose a portion of the original shore for the
                    waves to break upon, and when circumstances preclude this there should be a flat
                    talus wall of at least 3 or 4 to 1, as recommended by the late Mr Bremner of
                    Wick. Mr Scott Russell has found that talus walls of 1 to 1, or steeper, will
                    not allow the waves to break fully, but will reflect them in such a manner as
                    might in some cases make the entrance difficult or even dangerous of access, and
                    the berthage within unsafe.</p>
                <p>The following cases in which traffic has been successfully carried on at quays
                    unprotected by covering piers, may be found useful as a guide :—</p>
                <p>At Scrabster the quay is at right angles to a fetch of 6 miles. At Invergordon
                    there is a fetch of 5 miles; at Burntisland, 6; Kilcreggan, 4; Londonderry, 1⅜;
                    Greenock, 6|; Albert Quay, Greenock, 7 miles. The last two are, however,
                    somewhat sheltered by the low-water banks near Greenock.</p>
                <p>Five miles is probably not far from the limit that should be observed, which by
                    the ordinary formula, A=1'5√D, gives a wave of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n484/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0484-0463"/> 3 ’ 8 feet; but the formula for distances so
                    short as these would give waves about a foot higher, and in heavy storms perhaps
                    waves not much less than 5 feet may exist, but on such occasions vessels could
                    not safely use the quay.</p>
                <p>In order to tranquillize harbours of small reductive power, logs of timber called
                    booms, having their ends secured by projecting into grooves cut in the masonry
                    on each side, are placed across the entrance of the inner basin or dock. From 15
                    to 25 logs are usually dropped into those grooves, or as many more as will
                    insure close contact of the lowest log with a sill-piece placed in the bottom of
                    the harbour. They are also warped down or fixed with an iron hasp at the coping
                    course, without which precaution the swell is found to enter the harbour from
                    underneath. By this contrivance, which forms a temporary wall, the waves are
                    checked, and completely prevented from spreading into the interior basin.</p>
                <p>Twelve-inch booms of pine timber about 33 feet long have been broken at the small
                    fishing village of Mousehole, near Penzance, and elm logs have in consequence
                    been substituted. At Hynish in Argyllshire, booms of the same timber and
                    scantling and 20 feet long have been very frequently broken. The marine
                    dynamometer at this place gave 1⅜ ton per square foot.</p>
                <p>The capacity of commercial harbours for trade varies so much with the exposure
                    and size of vessels, that it is difficult to approximate to the truth. At
                    Ramsgate, for instance, there were found to be about 6 vessels to an acre in the
                    outer harbour, while there were about 14 in the inner and better protected
                    basin, where too there was perhaps a greater proportion of small vessels. In the
                    Scotch fishing harbours the number of boats used to be reckoned at from 85 to
                    115 per acre; but of late their size has been much increased, and probably not
                    more than from 80 to 90 could be accommodated. The Cornish boats at New Lynn,
                    according to the Channel pilot, vary from 60 to 80 per acre.</p>
                <p>The employment of timber in harbour works is of great antiquity. It seems first
                    to have been used in forming boxes which were filled with stones, and at a more
                    recent period in the formation of open frameworks through which the current
                    could pass freely. Vitruvius mentions moles, consisting of timber filled with
                    stones and cement, as having been used by the harbour-builders in his days.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It was probably to some such
                    work that Horace refers in Ode 1, Book iii. :—</p><p>“Contracta pisces aequora

                    redemptor.”</p><p>A harbour contract dated 1394, in all probability the earliest
                    which has been preserved, appears in the <hi rend="italic">Regisirurn Nigrum de
                    Aberbrοthοc—</hi> a collection of ancient documents printed by the Bannatyne
                    Club, and edited by the late Professor Cosmo Innes.</p></note> The earliest
                    drawing of timber piers that we have met with is that of the ancient port of
                    Dunkirk in 1699, a cross section of which from Belidor’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Architecture</hi><hi rend="italic">Hydraulique</hi> is given in Plate VIII.,
                    fig. 4. This kind of structure is still not uncommon on the coasts of the
                    English Channel.</p>
                <p>In sheltered bays where a deep-water landing-place is all that is required, and
                    where the bottom is sandy or soft, timber may be employed with great advantage.
                    Even in somewhat exposed situations it can also be used for tidal harbours; but
                    the fatal evil in places where there is no admixture of fresh water is its rapid
                    destruction by marine insects. In the Atlantic Ocean the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Teredo navαlis,</hi> and at many places in the German Ocean the <hi
                    rend="italic">Limnoria terebrans,</hi> which was first discovered by the late Mr
                    Robert Stevenson at the Bell Rock Lighthouse in 1810, are very destructive of
                    most kinds of timber. Mr Stevenson found that memel was destroyed by the <hi
                    rend="italic">Limnoria</hi> at the rate of about 1 inch inwards per annum. He
                    found that greenheart, beefwood, African oak, and bullet tree were scarcely
                    attacked, while teak stood remarkably well and locust tolerably well, though
                    suffering at last. Greenheart timber, though not absolutely impenetrable, as
                    appears from Mr Stevenson’s experiments, is the great specific in seas where the
                    worms are destructive. But subsequent experience has proved that on the coasts
                    of Scotland it is, in some cases, readily attacked, and at these places
                    creosoting is of comparatively little use, as the worm manifests no repugnance
                    to timber which has been even very recently impregnated.</p>
                <p>In addition to the experiments on timber, twenty-five different kinds and
                    combinations of iron were tried at the Bell Rock, including specimens of
                    galvanized irons. All the ungalvanized irons were found to oxidize with much the
                    same readiness. The galvanized specimens resisted oxidation for three or four
                    years, after which the chemical action went on as quickly as in the others.
                    Although the association of zinc with iron protects, so long as it lasts, the
                    metal with which it is in contact, it must be remembered that this immunity is
                    obtained at the expense of the zinc, the tendency of which to oxidization is
                    proportionally exalted so soon as any part of the iron is exposed.</p>
                <p>The important experiments of Mr Mallet on specimens sunk in the sea showed that
                    the amount of corrosion decreased with the thickness of the casting, and that
                    from <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅛th to ⅛th inch in depth, in castings 1 inch
                    thick, and about <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> ⅛th inch of wrought iron will be
                    destroyed in a century in clear salt water. But there is reason to believe from
                    a cannon ball which was picked up on the shores of the island of Inchkeith that
                    the decay was in that case ∣th inch to the century. Cast-iron gratings
                    periodically immersed by the tide at the Bell Rock lost at the rate of 1 inch in
                    a century. Even when the castings were externally sound their strength was
                    reduced one-half in about 50 years.</p>
                <p>In judging of the qualities of different quarries for harbour purposes the
                    importance of a high specific gravity ought not to be overlooked, as appears
                    from the table given on page 464.</p>
                <p>The superiority of granite to greenstone is proved by the following experiments
                    on the times required to abrade <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅛th inch of each
                    kind of stone, made with the same weights and grinding agents, and with equal
                    cubes of each material :—30 minutes were required for Queensferry (Carlin Nose)
                    greenstone; 40 minutes for greenstone from Barnton near Edinburgh; 60 minutes
                    for Peterhead granite. Mr Murray of Sunderland also established, many years ago,
                    the superior power of resistance to attrition possessed by granite over
                    greenstone.</p>
                <p>Portland cement rubble and concrete, a most valuable material, now very commonly
                    used in Britain as well as on the Continent, may be said to have to a large
                    extent revolutionized harbour building; for it admits of being employed in many
                    different ways, and can, if due care be taken as to the quality of the cement
                    and purity of the sand and gravel, be used with perfect confidence.</p>
                <p>The following specification has been followed extensively at different places
                    :—</p>
                <p>The Portland cement is to be obtained from the best manufacturers. It is to be
                    ground extremely fine, and is to weigh not less than 115 lb per bushel; and each
                    cargo will, on its arrival at the works, be tested in the following manner. The
                    cement is to be made into small blocks 1 inch square and 8 inches long. After
                    being made, these blocks are to be immersed in water for 7 days and then tested
                    by being placed on two supports 6 inches apart, when they must stand the
                    transverse strain produced by a weight of 70 lb placed in the centre. Slabs or
                    cakes are also to be made and placed in water, and after immersion for 24 hours
                    they are not to show any signs of cracking or any softness on the surface.</p>
                <p>The cement is to be tested before any of it is used, and if it be found
                    unsatisfactory it must be removed from the works. When a cargo is landed it must
                    be tested from four different bags, and it must also be tested weekly as the
                    works proceed, and the results forwarded to the engineers. The cement must be

                </table>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Note.</hi> —This table is calculated for sea water of the
                    specific gravity of Γ028 or 64⅛ lb to the cubic foot.</p>
                <p>from the manufactory and kept at the works in a dry and well-ventilated
                    storehouse with dry wooden floor and side walls, properly roofed in and
                    completely protected from the weather.</p>
                <p>The concrete to he used is to consist of one part of Portland cement, two of
                    sand, and five of gravel, to be thoroughly mixed with a proper quantity of pure
                    water; after it is deposited, large angular stones are to be added, care being
                    taken that all the stones are completely surrounded by concrete for a thickness
                    of not less than 4 inches. All stones to be clean and quite free from sea-weed
                    or other vegetable matter likely to prevent the adhesion of the concrete. No
                    concrete to be made during frost. The sand and gravel used must be sharp and
                    clean, being perfectly free from clay or earthy matter.</p>
                <p>There are different kinds of machines by which the concrete is thoroughly mixed,
                    and a saving of cost effected. In that of Mr Messent the number of revolutions
                    to mix the concrete thoroughly is twelve.</p>
                <p>The walls of harbours may be constructed of continuous building of concrete and
                    stones, protected by temporary piling and close planking. The best mode of
                    keeping out the water, as adopted by Mr Balmer at the duke of Richmond’s harbour
                    of Port Gordon, is to make a saw-draft in each plank, and to place a thin plate
                    of iron between the planks. An example of this continuous or monolithic,
                    building is shown in Plate VIIL, fig. 6.</p>
                <p>Mr B. B. Stoney has deposited at Dublin the largest blocks that have as yet been
                    attempted to be moved.</p>
                <p>Each block is 27 feet high, 21 feet 4 inches wide at base, and 12 feet long in
                    the direction of wall, contains nearly 5000 cubic feet, and weighs 350 tons; and
                    when laid in place 12 lineal feet of the wall is finished at once up to ordinary
                    low water level. No cofferdam, staging, or pumping is required. The
                    superstructure is built in the ordinary method by tide work, and is faced with
                    granite ashlars for the ships to lie against. The blocks are built on land, and
                    after 10 weeks’ drying are lifted by floating shears, the barge or pontoon of
                    which is ISO feet long and 48 feet wide, and of this 130 feet 30 form a tank at
                    the aft end; and, when filled with water, this balances the weight of the block
                    hanging from the shears at the other end. A block can be raised with the flood
                    tide, and is generally set the following low water.</p>
                <p>The late Mr J. M. Rendel introduced the improved and very valuable method of
                    depositing the <hi rend="italic">pierres perdues</hi> or rubble, which is now
                    generally used in the construction of large breakwaters. This method he employed
                    first at Millbay pier, near Plymouth, in 1838, in a depth of 38 feet, and
                    afterwards, on a still larger scale, in the construction of the breakwaters at
                    Holyhead and Portland.</p>
                <p>The improvement consists in depositing the rough materials from stagings of
                    timber, elevated a considerable height above high water. The stones are brought
                    on the staging in waggons, through the bottoms of which they are discharged into
                    the sea. The principle on which these stagings are designed is that of offering
                    the smallest possible resistance to the sea, the under structure consisting of
                    nothing more than single upright piles for supporting each roadway. .At Wick
                    harbour works, as already stated, it was found that the piles of the staging for
                    depositing the rabble required to be of greenheart timber; but even these were
                    broken in large numbers. The piles were invariably broken by the waves at about
                    the level of high water.</p>
                <p>A depth of from 12 to 15 feet under low water was pointed out by Mr Rendel as the
                    level below which the waves did little or no damage to <hi rend="italic">pierres

                    effect at a fathom and a half. But at Wick, as already stated, the rûbble was

                    materials of three-fourths the weight of polished materials will be equally
                    safe.</p>

                <p>Piers of cast and of malleable iron are now frequently employed. Examples of

                    piles was peculiar. The piles proper or lowest lengths of the columns are cast
                    in lengths of 8 feet and 10 feet, and are sunk into the sand to the depth of 7
                    feet and 9 feet respectively. They were provided with circular disks 1 foot 6
                    inches in diameter, to form a bearing surface; and, a small hole being left in
                    the centre, a wrought-iron tube 2 inches in diameter was passed down the inside
                    of the pile, and forced about four inches into the sand, a connexion being made
                    by means of a flexible hose between the top of the tube and a temporary pipe
                    connected with the Water Company’s mains, and extended as the sinking of the
                    piles proceeded. A pressure of water of about 50 lb per inch was thus obtained,
                    and this was found to be sufficient to force the sand from under the disk. Each
                    disk was provided on the lower side with cutters, which, on an alternating
                    motion being given to the pile, loosened the sand. The piles were gradually
                    lowered, and guided by a small ordinary piling engine. When the pressure of
                    water had been removed about 5 minutes, the piles settled down to so firm a
                    bearing that when tested with a load of 12 tons each no signs of settlement
                    could be perceived. The cast-iron columns are 7 inches in external and 5f inches
                    in internal diameter. All the piles, to the number of 237, were sunk in six
                    weeks, being at the rate of between 6 and 7 in twenty-four hours.</p>

                    Barlow rails weighing 80 lb to the yard, riveted back to back, and having a
                    total section for each 100 feet span of 64 inches. They are braced together by
                    diagonal tie-rods from If to 2⅛ inches in diameter. The lower portions of the
                    piles below low water are of solid wrought iron 5 inches in diameter, shod with
                    cast-iron screws 2 feet in diameter, and were screwed down till a 4⅜-inch rope
                    passed round 6-feet capstan bars parted with the strain. They penetrated the
                    ground to depths varying from 7 to 17 feet, and though made with a thread of 5
                    inches in pitch seldom descended more than 2⅛ inches or 3 inches in a turn. The
                    solid pile-stems are connected with the Barlow rail piles by cast-iron shoes.
                    Where rock occurred holes were jumped, and a 4-inclι wrought-iron bar was
                    inserted and secured by a jagged key. A shoe to receive the Barlow rail was
                    fitted and keyed on this, and the remaining space was caulked with iron cement.
                    The length of the longest pile is 76 feet. The level of roadway is 16 feet above
                    extreme high water, and the height above the ground at the pier-head is about 68
                    feet.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Deposits and Scouring.</hi></p>
                <p>Deposits arise from two essentially opposite causes, viz., commotion and
                    stagnation of the water. They are also of different kinds of material :—(1)
                    those lighter matters, such as mud, silt, and fine sand, which are held for a
                    time in mechanical suspension, and which, as the water approaches stagnation,
                    are gradually dropped in the order of their specific gravity and mass; and (2)
                    those grosser matters, such as different kinds of sand and gravel, which are
                    rolled along the bottom or driven forward with the water by the action of waves
                    and currents. The first-named are deposited on the lee side of piers or groins
                    which obstruct the progress of the waves or currents, while the second
                    accumulate on their <hi rend="italic">weather</hi> sides. But the amount and the
                    positions assumed by the deposits of the second kind depend on the direction and
                    force of the waves or currents in relation to the foreshore and to obstructions.
                    The amount of deposits of the first kind are little dependent on the direction
                    of the stroke of the waves outside of the basin or sheltered place in which they
                    are deposited.</p>
                <p>The preservation of the depth of harbours at a level lower than that of the
                    original bottom involves both uncertainty and expense. Where the deposit is
                    confined to the space between high and low water-marks, the scouring by means of
                    salt or fresh water is comparatively easy; but where it forms a bar outside of
                    the entrance, the possibility of maintaining permanently a greater depth becomes
                    very doubtful. The efficacy of the scour, so long as it is not impeded by
                    enlargements of the channel, may be kept up for great distances, but it soon
                    comes to an end after it meets the sea. When the volume of water liberated is
                    great compared with the <hi rend="italic">alveus</hi> or channel through which
                    it has to pass, the stagnant water which originally occupied the channel does
                    not to the same extent destroy the momentum as where the scouring has to be
                    produced by a sudden finite impulse. In the one case the scouring power dependSj
                    <hi rend="italic">caeteris</hi><hi rend="italic">paribus,</hi> simply on the
                    relation subsisting between the quantity liberated in a given space of time and
                    the sectional area of the channel through which it has to pass; while in the
                    other it depends on the propelling head, and the direction in which the water
                    leaves the sluice. Mr RendeΓs scheme for Birkenhead was on the former principle,
                    which it must be recollected is only applicable where the soil is easily stirred
                    up.</p>
                <p>The first example of artificial scouring in Eugland seems to be due to Smeaton,
                    who used it effectively at Ramsgate in 1779. At Bute Docks, Cardiff, designed by
                    the late Sir W. Cubitt, the access to the outer basin is kept open most
                    successfully by means of artificial scouring on a large scale.</p>
                <p>Minard holds that when a channel has to be maintained by regular and habitual
                    scouring, the whole effect is generally produced in the course of the first
                    quarter of an hour. This was made the subject of particular investigation at
                    Dunkirk, where sections of the channel were made before and during the scour;
                    and it was found that there was no alteration in the sectional area after the
                    first quarter of an hour.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Causes of Increase of Height of Waves.</hi></p>
                <p>The following causes increase the height of waves in a harbour :—(1) the removal
                    of a spending beach either at the entrance channel or within the harbour by
                    building a quay or talus wall across it; (2) deepening the entrance channel or
                    the basin of the harbour itself,—thus the difficulty of keeping vessels to their
                    moorings at the quays of a harbour increases during flood tide, just as the tide
                    rises and the depth is thereby increased; (3) removal of an artificial
                    breakwater or a protecting point of land or spit of gravel outside of the
                    harbour; (4) filling up side creeks or lateral basins in a harbour or its
                    entrance channel; (5) shortening the distance between the sea and the entrance
                    to an inner basin or dock by projecting the basin or dock farther out from the
                    shore-line so as to bring the gates nearer the sea entrance, or projecting the
                    mouth of a harbour farther seawards; (6) removal of a jetty or filling up an
                    artificial side chamber or converting talus into plumb walls; (7) straightening
                    an entrance channel or an outer side breakwater or walls within a harbour; (8)
                    widening the entrance or the entrance channel; (9) reduction of the area of the
                    basin of the harbour; (10) making smoother the surface of a natural sloping
                    beach either within or outside of a harbour by pitching its surface; (11)
                    lowering the top of a protecting outside breakwater over which the sea breaks;
                    (12) converting an open Limber quay into a close quay; (13) lengthening a
                    breakwater so as to intercept a greater portion of the waves which come in
                    certain directions.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="smallcaps">Docks.</hi></p>
                <p>Docks are of two kinds, viz., dry or graving docks, and wet or floating docks.
                    The dry or graving dock is a small water-tight chamber, fitted with gates of
                    timber or iron, which are shut against the rising tide after a vessel has <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n493/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0493-0466"/> entered for the purpose of being repaired. The
                    water below low tide level is pumped out generally by steam power.</p>
                <p>The wet dock or tide basin is a large water-tight inclosure, usually several
                    acres in extent, which is also fitted with gates which are closed, not, however,
                    during the flowing but the ebbing tide, so that the vessels lying at the quays
                    within the basin may remain constantly afloat and nearly at the same level while
                    being loaded and unloaded.</p>
                <p>In order to extend the time during which vessels can enter or leave a wet dock
                    there are two additional works which are often connected with it. These are the
                    entrancelock and the outer or half-tide basin. The lock is a narrow chamber of
                    just sufficient length and breadth to admit a ship of the greatest length and
                    breadth of beam that is expected to frequent the port. Such a lock can, in
                    absence of the largest class of ships, accommodate simultaneously three or four
                    vessels of smaller tonnage. Locks are sometime made with double gates, so that
                    when only one vessel of small size has to enter, she is shut up within a
                    compartment of the lock, by which means some of the water is saved which would
                    have been expended had the whole of the chamber been filled. Shortly after the
                    tide has begun to ebb, and when the gates of the wet dock have been shut, in
                    order to prevent the water from falling too low in the dock, a vessel can still
                    enter or leave by means of the lock. She is first passed into the lock from the
                    sea; and, the lower or sea gates being closed, the sluices in the upper or dock
                    gates are opened, which raises the water in the lock chamber to the same level
                    as the water in the dock, when the upper gates are opened to let the vessel pass
                    in. Ships leaving the dock after the tide has begun to fall are passed into the
                    lock chamber, when the upper gates are closed and the sluices in the lower gates
                    are opened, until the water in the lock has fallen to the same level as the tide
                    outside, when the lower gates are opened and the vessel goes out to sea. This
                    system of locking is continued so long as the level of the dock is not so much
                    depressed as to affect the loading or unloading of vessels lying at the quays,
                    or until the tide has ebbed so far as to prevent vessels reaching the lock from
                    the sea. At the West Dock, Cardiff, where the level is kept up by fresh water
                    from the river Taff, the gates, in order to suit the rise and fall of the tide,
                    are opened one hour before and about two hours after high water.</p>
                <p>The tide basin may be described as a lock of very large dimensions capable of
                    receiving at the same time a considerable number of vessels, which continue to
                    run into it from the sea after the dock gates have been finally closed for that
                    tide. Such vessels can run in, so longas they have sufficient water over the
                    sill of the sea gates of the basin, or until the basin itself is filled with
                    ships. The sea gates are then closed, and the sluices in the upper gates are
                    opened till the water in the basin is on a level with the water in the dock. The
                    ships are then passed continuously into the dock, in a string, one after the
                    other. By means of this arrangement the traffic can be carried on to a far
                    greater extent than is possible with a narrow lock, which has to be filled and
                    emptied for each vessel that enters or leaves the harbour. The late Mr Jesse
                    Hartley of Liverpool was the first to propose half-tide outer basins, as
                    adjuncts to wet docks.</p>
                <p>The peculiar advantages <hi rend="subscript"> s</hi> of docks are the following.
                    Vessels can be accommodated in the smallest possible space, and are enabled to
                    lie constantly afloat; whereas in tidal harbours, where they take the ground,
                    they are apt to be strained or to have their floors broken. But there are other
                    sources of mischief than this in open harbours, for often, when the tide is
                    ebbing, vessels, unless watched, fall against each other. In two instances where
                    the bottom, which was muddy, had a considerable declivity, a ship which had
                    taken the ground on the beach near low water mark was actually run down and
                    damaged by another stranded vessel, the warps of which suddenly snapped and
                    freed her from the moorings at the quay, thus causing a collision between
                    vessels both of which were at the time high and dry. Then there is the chafing
                    of the vessel’s sides against the quays in exposed harbours where there is a run
                    of sea, and the breaking of warps during stormy weather, or during land floods,
                    where there is a river. The late Mr James Walker stated that at Sunderland
                    damage to the extent of £40,000 was occasioned in a single day by large
                    quantities of ice that came down the river Wear. When a vessel is in dock she
                    can be easily and at all times moved from place to place, and the operation of
                    discharging and loading can go regularly on during all times of tide. Her level,
                    too, is never much affected, so that the cargo does not require, when being
                    discharged, to be hoisted so high as would otherwise be necessary. Timber
                    vessels can be unloaded through their ports into the water at all times of tide,
                    while in harbours which are dry at low water the cargo receives injury by
                    falling on the hard bottom.</p>
                <p>From the general description which we have given the following conclusions may be
                    drawn as to the best localities for docks :—</p>
                <p>(1) Where the rise of tide is considerable, a dock is more required than where
                    the rise is small. In rivers such as the Clyde and the Foyle, for example, where
                    the tide rises only from 9 to 10 feet, the inducement to construct docks is not
                    so great as at the Mersey or the Bristol Channel, where the tide rises from 20
                    to 50 feet</p>
                <p>(2) Where the nature of the trade requires ships of great length, which are
                    therefore very liable to injury from taking the ground, a dock is more needed
                    than at places where the vessels are of smaller size, and therefore less liable
                    to be strained when not water borne.</p>
                <p>(3) Where the bottom is soft and muddy, there is less need for a dock than where
                    the bottom is hard and uneven, unless where strong currents are likely to burrow
                    out the soft soil so as to make the bottom irregular by forming deep ruts.</p>
                <p>(4) Where the harbour is open to the entrance of surface waves of considerable
                    height, or of a ground swell, there is more need for a dock than where there is
                    better protection.</p>
                <p>(5) Where there is sufficient fresh water, free from mud or silt, for supplying
                    the basin, a dock will be more suitable than where the supply is from the tide,
                    especially if the sea at the place be much loaded with matter in mechanical

                <p>In designing a dock the first subject to which the engineer must give his
                    attention is the seaward exposure of his proposed work. Of course no precaution
                    is needed on this head if the place be a land-locked bay, or a narrow river or
                    estuary. But if there be a considerable fetch of open sea, the waves generated
                    during gales may be of such height as to endanger the sea gates or to interfere
                    with their being worked in stormy weather. The formula already given at page 457
                    for short lengths of fetch will be the most suitable for calculating the
                    exposure of docks, where the fetch ought never to be great.</p>
                <p>Having calculated by means cf this formula the height of waves that may be
                    expected to reach the dock gates, the engineer must then determine whether such
                    waves are too high for the strength of the gates, or for their being properly
                    worked in stormy weather. Now we have unfortunately but few facts on this
                    subject to guide us, and these not very consistent with each other.</p>

                <p>It might at first sight be expected that the strain would increase as the squares
                    of the breadth of the gate, but, owing to the manner in which the forces are
                    distributed, this does not seem to be the case.</p>

                <p>δ = - <hi rend="subscript"> j</hi>- may perhaps be regarded as safe; or, where

                    is length of fetch in miles,</p>

                <p>1∙5 √D + (2∙5 -√D)'</p>
                <p>Should the calculation by the formula give higher waves than are compatible with
                    safety or convenience, the proper course will be to provide an outer harbour or
                    covering breakwater, so as to reduce the height of the waves. For this purpose
                    the formula given at page 462 is applicable. In cases where the course now
                    recommended cannot be adopted, from motives of economy or from other causes,
                    recourse may be had to protecting booms such as are described at page 463. If
                    the traffic be considerable and the interruption caused by the shipping and
                    unshipping of the booms be regarded a formidable objection, the gates may in
                    some cases be protected by fastening together the tops of the mitre posts by
                    chains. Another mode of securing gates against the sea was adopted at Ramsgate
                    by Mr Ramsay, and is stated by Sir John Coode to be perfectly satisfactory. It
                    consisted of the following arrangement :—</p>
                <p>“One end of a stout beam or stay of greenheaι-t timber was connected, by means of
                    a massive iron movable joint, to the fore part of each gate, near the middle
                    posts on the inner or basin side, and at about the level of high water of
                    equinoctial spring tides; the opposite end of this beam passed into an opening
                    in the masonry of the side walls of the entrance. The inner end of this beam was
                    supported by a small bogie truck running upon a pair of rails laid in a
                    horizontal plane. On the vertical face of the beam nearest the gate there was a
                    strong toothed rack working into a pinion at the end of a train of gearing, the
                    first motion of which was a screw-and-worm wheel. By means of this gearing the
                    power of the men was communicated to the gate through the beam or stay just
                    described.”</p>
                <p>After the engineer has succeeded in designing a dock which is sufficient in so
                    far a8 the sea is concerned, it may after all not prove safe and convenient if
                    it be exposed fully to the force of the wind, which, acting on the rigging and
                    hulls of the shipping, causes vessels to break their moorings or produces a
                    grinding action of the vessels against the quays. At Sunderland south dock and
                    at the docks in the Tyne, for example, the gales of October 1863 occasioned very
                    considerable damage, from vessels breaking adrift from their moorings and coming
                    into collision with other vessels.</p>
                <p>The number of vessels that can be accommodated in each acre of a harbour may be
                    termed its “available capacity.” This must obviously vary with the sizes of the
                    craft which frequent the port and with the ratio of sheltered to unsheltered
                    acreage; or in other words, with the exposure, depth, and reductive power. It
                    will therefore be highest for a dock with gates, less for a tide-basin into
                    which the waves have access, and least of all for an anchorage breakwater or
                    roadstead. But it also depends on the form of the basin and on its depth.</p>

                    accommodated at one time per acre for several docks :—</p>

                <p>The general form of a dock will in most cases be dependent on local
                    peculiarities. Where the nature of the ground and other circumstances admit of
                    it, the width of the basin should, in order to provide for the largest amount of
                    traffic, be greater near the entrance than at a distance from it. The diagram
                    (fig. 8) may perhaps be regarded as an approach to the form of maximum capacity
                    which should be kept in view as a general guide in making a design. But in most
                    situations the form will, as we have said, be mainly if not entirely dependent
                    on the outline of the land and depth of water, on the position of adjoining
                    streets and buildings, and on the geological formation and nature of the
                    subsoil. The serrated outline of the jetties shown in the diagram affords a
                    larger amount of accommodation for shipping than when the quays are continuously
                    straight. Sir John Hawkshaw was, we believe, the first to adopt these indented
                    jetties, which are specially suited for the coal trade; but the radiating form
                    shown in the diagram has not, so far as we know, been adopted. Not only are
                    numerous cross sections of the ground required for fixing on the best site for a
                    dock, but borings of the subsoil are essential, as, upon a careful comparison of
                    these, the position of the entrance must be determined. It is always of the
                    greatest importance to place the foundations of the lock or entrance gates at a
                    place where the bottom is rock, or, where that is not to be found, on the
                    hardest and most impervious part of the subsoil, or, failing that, on a place
                    where the bottom-though soft, is of uniform consistency.</p>

                    and off the coal tips, and for turning them on the turntables, the discharging
                    of ballast and loading of coals, and the shipment and discharging of general
                    cargoes, has now been successfully adopted at many harbours. Its use is,
                    however, only warrantable where there is a great amount of traffic, and
                    especially at places where the spring tides remain only a short time at the same
                    level.</p>
                <p>At the Victoria Docks, London, the late Mr Bidder mentions that 41 craft and 17
                    ships, or 11,711 tons, came in at one tide. In one month the number of craft
                    entering the harbour was 1229; craft leaving, 1288; ships entering, 250; ships
                    leaving, 258; or an aggregate of 2517 craft and 508 ships during the month. The
                    gates, which are 80 feet span, are opened in less than 1⅛ minutes. At Sunderland
                    the accumulators are equivalent to a head of 600 feet, and the engine is 30
                    horse-power. A wrought-iron bridge 16 feet wide, and including counterweights
                    equal to nearly 200 tons, is raised vertically 18 inches, and drawn back in
                    about 2⅜ minutes. A t Swansea the accumulators are equivalent to an effective
                    pressure of 750 lb per square inch, and there are three high-pressure engines of
                    80, 30, and 12 horse-power respectively. The time employed in either opening or
                    closing the gates is about 2⅛ minutes, which is the shortest period consistent
                    with safety. The wroughtiron swing-bridge can be opened or shut in 1⅜ minutes.
                    The ballast cranes, which are distributed round the dock, can each discharge
                    from 350 to 400 tons in the day. The quantity of coal that can be shipped is
                    about 1000 tons per day, and the effective quantity of water required for the
                    port is 21,050 cubic feet per week. The large new bridge at Leith, designed by
                    Messrs Rendel &amp; Robertson, and worked by the Armstrong apparatus, is 120
                    feet span,—length of girder 214 feet, weight moved 750 tons,—and is opened in 1⅜
                    minutes. The saving of time effected by this method is very great, for at
                    Liverpool, according to Mr A. Giles, gates of 70 feet require 20 minutes, and
                    six men on each side to open them.</p>
                <p>The proportion of water area to length of quays will obviously depend on the form
                    of the docks. The following table, deduced from information kindly supplied by
                    Mr Lyster, C.E., gives examples on this head at Liverpool :—</p>

                <p>In order to utilize the area of a dock to the best advantage, n. certain amount
                    of land space dependent on the kind of trade should be provided around it; for
                    without this space, which is needed for giving room for railway sidings,
                    warehouses, and the like, the traffic would be cramped. As an illustration of
                    the large extent of railway which is required in a coal-port, we may refer to
                    Cardiff, whereMr M <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> Connochie says, “The extent of
                    sidings provided and maintained by the Bute trustees, in connexion with the
                    docks, amounts to 16 miles in length, the whole of which is at times fully
                    occupied.”</p>
                <p>The proportion of the area of outer tide basin to that of the dock to which it
                    forms the access varies necessarily with the requirements of the trade, as is

                <p>The level of the bottom of a dock is always kept lower than that of the sill of
                    the entrance gates, in order to admit of a certain amount of deposit taking
                    place without injuriously affecting the depth of water in which the vessels lie,
                    or interfering with the working of the gates. There should never be less than 1
                    foot of greater depth over the bottom of the dock than over the entrance
                    sill.</p>
                <p>The commercial advantage of a great depth of water over the sill has been well
                    shown by Mr George Robertson in his report on the Albert Dock at Leith. By
                    increasing the depth to the extent of 2 feet he found there would be 396 tides
                    in the year giving a depth of 23 feet over the sill, as against only 102 tides
                    in the year when that depth could be had if the sill were only 2 feet high. But
                    besides the advantage of availing ourselves of a greater number of tides, Mr T.
                    Stevenson found, from an examination of the draughts and tonnage of a large
                    number of sailing vessels, that the commercial advantages in a navigable river,
                    dock, or harbour <hi rend="italic">are proportional to the cubes of the
                    depths.</hi></p>
                <p>The relation subsisting between the depth of a dock or channel and the tonnage of

                <p>In fixing the minimum width that will admit vessels of the size which are
                    expected to trade at the harbour, the engineer must take care to preserve a
                    proper relation between the area of the dock and the width of the entrance; for
                    if this relation be neglected, a current may be generated through the entrance
                    when the tide begins to ebb, which would be incompatible with the safe working
                    of the gates. A very small current is sufficient to act injuriously in this way,
                    especially if the gates be of great width. Whenever the internal area of the
                    proposed basin is considerable, it will be a safe precaution to calculate the
                    velocity of the outgoing current, at different periods of time, after the tide
                    has begun to ebb; and for this purpose observations of the fall of the tide must
                    be carefully made and compared with the proposed transverse sectional area of
                    the passage through the lock chamber. If the velocity thus obtained be thought
                    too great for the safe working of gates of the size required, the only
                    alternative is to provide an additional lock. But a double outlet will at any
                    rate be in all probability needed, or will at least prove a great convenience in
                    all cases where a large internal basin is required.</p>

                    gives the following table for the expenditure of water due to the passage of
                    vessels through the lock :—</p>
                <p>Let L denote a lockful of water, that is, the volume contained in the lock
                    chamber between the upper and lower water levels, andBtlιe volume displaced by a
                    ship, then the quantities of water discharged from the dock are shown in the
                    table. The sign — prefixed to a quantity of water denotes that it is displaced
                    from the lock into the dock.</p>

                <p>From these calculations it appears that ships ascending and descending
                    alternately cause less expenditure of water than equal numbers of ships in
                    train.</p>
                <p>The level of the surface of the water in a dock will of course sink in proportion
                    to the number of times the lock has to be filled during each tide, and may also
                    be affected to a small extent by leakage. In order to provide for this
                    depression of level, the old dock of Grimsby, and also the Bute Docks, Cardiff,
                    are supplied by land streams, while at Penarth Sir John Hawkshaw was unable to
                    get a supply of pure water, and the dock at that port is supplied from the tide
                    water of the Bristol Channel, which holds in suspension a large amount of
                    alluvial matter. In the old London docks the level is kept up by pumping.</p>
                <p>If the masonry of the walls has been properly constructed, and if the gates and
                    lock are kept in proper repair, and especially if the basin be of large area,
                    the depression of the water level due to leakage, will, as appears from the
                    following table, be comparatively trifling :—</p>

                <p>The principal works required in the construction of docks are— <hi rend="italic"
                    >first,</hi> cofferdams for excluding the tide, and puιηps for keeping the basin
                    dry while the works are going on; <hi rend="italic">second,</hi> excavation of
                    the basin and lock pit; <hi rend="italic">third,</hi> piling for the foundations
                    of quay walls and lock, where the bottom is soft; <hi rend="italic">fourth,</hi>
                    the building of the quay walls, lock, and outer tide basin; <hi rend="italic"
                    >fifth,</hi> entrance gates, gangway, and dolphins in the channel outside of the
                    dock for facilitating the entry and departure of vessels.</p>
                <p>As to the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> of these works, namely, the cofferdam and
                    pumping apparatus, reference is made to the articles on these subjects in this
                    work; and as to the <hi rend="italic">second</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >third,</hi> there is nothing requiring special notice, as no peculiarity
                    attaches to the mode of carrying on excavation or piling for docks more than for
                    any other engineering undertaking where these are needed. It is only necessary
                    to point out that when the bottom is soft a large amount of piling is required,
                    more especially at the lock pit, where rows of sheeting piles should be driven
                    across the lock, at least at the entrance, and in the lines of the clap or
                    pointing sills against which the gates shut.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">fourth</hi> class of works, namely, quays and lock, are in
                    all cases most important features in a dock. Different rules have been given by
                    engineers for the proportions of quay walls. Mr A. Giles recommends that they
                    should be made strong enough to resist the pressure of α head of water equal to
                    their own height; and Minard recommends their thickness at bottom to be <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> ⅛ths of their height.</p>
                <p>The recent use of Portland cement concrete in the construction of harbours has
                    led to its introduction at doek works. In the small dock erected in 1875 at
                    Berwick-on-Tweed, Messrs Stevenson had the dock walls and gate chamber
                    constructed entirely of Portland cement concrete, excepting a small portion at
                    and above the high water level, against which the vessels might rub; and Mr
                    Rendel at the new Victoria Docks, London, which are the longest in the world, is
                    making the whole masonry of cement concrete.</p>
                <p>Graving docks are basins sometimes 600 feet long and 60 or 70 feet wide, fitted
                    with gates, from which the tidewater which floats the vessel into the dock is
                    pumped out, so as to let the carpenters get access to the ship’s bottom. The
                    sides of graving docks consist of a series of steps of masonry, called “altars,”
                    against which small timber props, generally of Gulf of Bothnia timber, are
                    placed, for supporting the vessel’s sides as she ceases to be water-borne. Her
                    keel is supported on blocks, generally of hard wood, but of late years they have
                    in some places been made of cast iron. The sides, in order to save pumping, are
                    in some placée made of a curved form, so as to suit the shape of the vessel’s
                    sides. The advantages are, however, more than counterbalanced by the undue
                    contraction of the space allotted for the carpenters, who are unable to move
                    about easily on the sloping surface of the masonry.</p>
                <p>Of all the different kinds of masonry which enter into the construction of marine
                    works, there is none which requires greater accuracy of workmanship, or more
                    careful circumspection, than the graving dock. Leakage in &amp; wet dock,
                    provided it does not originate at a place whereit is liable to increase through
                    time, and is of no greater extent than to depress the surface of the water a few
                    inches, cannot be regarded as a serious evil. But in a graving dock, where the
                    requirements are different, there should be no leakage. A very little water,
                    accumulating on the platform, of a dry dock, interferes to a serious extent with
                    the comfort and convenience of the carpenters. Although it may occasion
                    considerable additional expense, there ought to be in all cases, especially
                    where the soil is full of springs, an ample underground storage provided by a
                    system of drains for receiving the leakage, which can then be pumped out
                    periodically, as required, without ever allowing the water to rise above the
                    platform.</p>
                <p>Mr. G. B. Rennie’s docks are stated to be the first of the kind that have been
                    made of iron. They consist of floating caissons for holding the vessel to be
                    repaired. They are sunk by allowing them to fill with water, and are raised by
                    pumping. The caissons are made with water-tight compartments, and they are
                    carried up as high as the vessel’s bulwarks, excepting that through which the
                    vessel enters and leaves. Among several advantages that have been claimed for
                    this kind of dock may be mentioned—its independence of the rise and fall of the
                    tide, the power of applying breast shores as in an ordinary graving dock, and
                    the stiffness produced by the side walls. As the upper parts of the side walls
                    or altars are always full of air, this dock may be used in deep water, and is
                    therefore independent of the nature of the bottom.</p>
                <p>Mr Edwin Clark’s hydraulic lift, at the Victoria Docks, London, consists of a
                    pontoon which is filled with water and sunk between two rows of iron columns.
                    After a vessel has been floated and steadied upon the pontoon, the whole is
                    raised by twelve hydraulic force-pumps of 2 feeb diameter, acting on the pontoon
                    by means of chains. After the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n497/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0497-0470"/> pontoon has been brought about the tide-level,
                    the water is allowed to escape, when there is sufficient floating power to admit
                    of the whole being removed to any place where the repairs can be conveniently
                    made. The pontoons, which can accommodate vessels of a length of 350 feet, are
                    about 320 feet long and 59∣ feet broad. “The power of the hydraulic lift is 6400
                    tons. The largest pontoon will carry a dead load of 3200 tons in addition to its
                    own weight.”</p>
                <p>Slips are the contrivance of the late Mr Thomas Morton of Leith, and consist of a
                    carriage or cradle working on an inclined railway, falling generally at the rate
                    of about 1 in 17, and extending above high water to a sufficient distance for
                    the class of vessels which are expected to use them to several feet below the
                    level of low water, and a truck or carriage which moves on it. When the carriage
                    is let down under the water, the vessel is floated above the place, and the
                    carriage is drawn up till the vessel catches it forwards. When the ship is
                    placed truly above the line of the carriage, a powerful crab-purchase at the top
                    of the slip, which is generally worked by steam, is set in motion, and raises
                    the truck and ship out of the water.</p>
                <p>The gridiron is a simple framework of timber placed at a level sufficient to
                    admit of vessels being floated above it during the flood-tide, and grounded upon
                    it during the ebb, and when thus left high and dry the vessel’s bottom can be
                    examined to ascertain if it be necessary to take her into the graving dock, and
                    trifling repairs can also be made. The gridirons at Liverpool vary from 25 feet
                    to 36 feet 3 inches in breadth, and from 228 feet 3 inches to 313 J feet in
                    length.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Historical and

                <p>The hydraulic and screw docks used in America are chambers into which vessels are
                    floated during the floodtide, above a cradle which is drawn up above the high
                    water level, either by means of Bramah’s press worked by a steam-engine, or by a
                    powerful apparatus of screws.</p>
                <p>The patent slip possesses the following advantages over the graving dock. (1) The
                    cost of its construction is less. (2) When the fall of tide is languid, a vessel
                    can generally be more quickly laid dry. (3) When so laid dry she can be more
                    easily examined, and, from the duration of the daylight being greater than in a
                    deep graving dock, the time in which work can be done is considerably extended
                    during winter. (4) There is more perfect ventilation, by which the vessel’s
                    sides are sooner dried, which is of some moment with an iron ship. (5) A vessel
                    can be hauled up long before high water, and the repairs can be begun at once;
                    whereas with a dock the pumping occasions considerable delay. (6) While the
                    upper part of the slip is occupied, an additional vessel mιy be taken up for a
                    shorter time than its predecessor, without interrupting the workmen.</p>
                <p>The advantages afforded by a graving dock, on the other hand, are these. (1)
                    Although its construction is more costly, it is nevertheless, if properly built,
                    unquestionably a more durable structure—the rails, rollers, carriages, and
                    chains connected with the slip being liable to derangement, which entails
                    occasional repair. (2) The management of the graving dock is simple, and
                    involves comparatively little superintendence; whereas that of a slip is
                    intricate, and requires more than mere nautical skill. (3) The working of a
                    graving dock is equally simple for large or small vessels, while it is
                    undeniable that the raising of a large vessel on a slip is a delicate operation,
                    and should be attempted only under the direction of persons thoroughly versed in
                    such matters, and having ample mechanical resources at command. (4) The graving
                    dock possesses the advantage, which is sometimes important, of affording the
                    means of more easily filling a vessel with water, so as to detect leaks which
                    may not be discoverable by other means. For this purpose a nozzle to receive a
                    flexible tube should be fixed into the dock-gates. (5) Where double gates are
                    provided the water contained in the dock affords a certain limited power of
                    scouring the forebay and entrance, an advantage which is of course not possessed
                    by a slip. (6) In any rapid land current, or strong tideway, it is a much easier
                    process to dock a vessel t ’ han to land her safely on the cradle of a slip—an
                    operation which, when incautiously gone about, has been in some cases attended
                    with serious consequences even in sheltered situations. (7) The graving dock
                    need not interfere with the set of the currents, whereas a slip which projects a
                    long way seaward of low water may deflect them and produce shoals in the
                    channel. (8) Mr Mallet has remarked that the strains on a ship’s timbers are
                    more direct than when she is on a slip, especially when she is leaving the
                    cradle. The late Mr J. M. Balfour suggested, in order to meet this objection,
                    that the cradle for a slip might be made of a wedge shape, so that its upper
                    surface shall be parallel with the horizon, or that the back end should even be
                    tilted slightly, so as to give a bite on the vessel and prevent her from
                    slipping.</p>
                <p>The relative advantages of the other contrivances for the repair of ships already
                    described may be judged of by comparing them with each other in a similar
                    manner.</p>
                <p>Mr P. W. Barlow has given the following formulae for the strength of dock-gates
                    :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Formula for Straight Gates.</hi></p>
                <p>If &lt;∕&gt; = horizontal angle(or “sally ”) between pointing sillandline joining
                    heel-posts of the two leaves; W=pressure on the length of the gate with any head
                    and for a given depth of the gate; and S=~hole transverse strain at angle <hi

                <p>S = ⅛W sec ≠ + τ⅛ cos <hi rend="italic">φ.</hi></p>
                <p>From this Mr Barlow has deduced that the salient angle, where the strain is the
                    minimum, is 24° 54', but as the length of the gate increases with the secant,
                    the strength will not at this angle be the greatest with a given section of
                    timber. The “sally” or angle which gives the greatest strength, with a given
                    section of timber, is stated by him as 19° 25'.</p>

                <p>There is great difference of opinion among engineers as to the strain to which
                    dock gates are subjected, and the reader is referred for further information to
                    the 18th and 31st volumes of the <hi rend="italic">Minutes of Proceedings of the
                    Institution of Civil Engineers.</hi> In these discussions Mr Brown pointed out
                    an error in Mr P. W. Barlow’s paper, which stated that the line of pressure at
                    the mitre-posts would always be a tangent to the curve of the separate gates,
                    whereas that line must always be at right angles to the centre line of the lock,
                    and could only be a tangent to the curve when the two gates formed a segment of
                    a circle, or, as Mr Bramwell says, at all events when their junction at the
                    mitre-posts formed at that point part of a continuous curve. Mr Brown gives
                    elaborate formulae suited to meet a yielding or deflexion of the structure,
                    which he alleges must always take place. Mr Bramwell states, and we think
                    justly, that, when the gates form when closed a segment of a circle, they cannot
                    be subject to transverse strain, and that the whole of the gates would be
                    subjected simply to compression. Mr R. P. Brereton very properly suggests that
                    when the gates are of malleable iron the boiler-plate should never be less than
                    ⅛ inch thick, what ever the formula may indicate.</p>

                <p>Mr Kingsbury adds half of this compressive strain to the strain representing the
                    compression due to the transverse pressure, and deducts it from the same amount
                    for the extension; and these results being divided as before by 4 and 5
                    respectively, being the allowances per square inch of metal for compression and
                    extension, give the areas for each. He, however, expresses a doubt whether the
                    whole of the compressive strain from the other gate may not perhaps come upon
                    the compressed section. The sections close to the posts he takes as requiring to
                    resist the compression due ⅜w tan <hi rend="italic">0</hi> to transmitted
                    pressure only, or=</p>
                <p>For cylindrical gates Mr Kingsbury gives the formula,—when <hi rend="italic"
                    >p</hi> —pressure per unit of surface, and <hi rend="italic">r=</hi> radius of
                    curvature,—</p>
                <p>-j-= sectional area of metal in square inches.</p>
                <p>It must be remembered in designing gates which are exposed to the waves that they
                    should be made stronger than these formulae require. And the gates for graving
                    or dry docks sustain a greater pressure with the same rise of tides than those
                    of wet docks, and should therefore be made correspondingly stronger.</p>
                <p>Caissons are sometimes employed instead of gates, and are the invention of the
                    late General Bentham. They are constructed of malleable iron plates and are
                    sometimes made in the form of a ship’s hull, and sometimes have vertical sides.
                    The caisson fits into checks made for its reception in the side walls of the
                    entrance to the dock. They require to be very carefully ballasted, and to be
                    most accurately fitted to the masonry on the sides and bottom, and even when
                    they are faced with timber which has been finely dressed and fitted, coal
                    cinders are often needed to make the joints water tight. At high water they are
                    floated into the grooves, and are then scuttled by admitting the water into the
                    interior chamber. When a vessel has to leave the dock, the water is again pumped
                    out, and the caisson is then floated out of its place and taken into the river
                    or harbour, so as to be out of the <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> way of the
                    vessel which is leaving. General Bentham says caissons are cheaper than gates,
                    occupy less room, are more easily repaired, and the same caisson may be used for
                    different places at different times, while they answer for roadways, and require
                    less labour for opening.</p>
                <p>The caisson at Keysham was designed by Mr Scamp, deputydirector of the Admiralty
                    works, and is 80 feet wide and 43 feet deep, with an air-chamber at the bottom.
                    When raised a few inches above the bottom, the caisson is drawn back into a
                    recess or chamber in the side walls. The total weight is 290 tons, and the
                    deflexion was f inch near the bottom, when the pressure of the whole surface was
                    2000 tons. The time for opening and closing the entrance at Keysham is 10
                    minutes and 8 minutes respectively. The cost was about £10,000.</p>
                <p>Mr M <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> Connochie says that the iron caisson at
                    Cardiff is 60 feet long, 26 feet greatest width, and 30⅜ feet deep, with a total
                    weight of 152 tons.</p>
                <p>The outer gangway at entrance to docks is generally a structure of open timber
                    work, erected in the line which will best suit the entrance of vessels when
                    under the influence of currents. This gangway is sometimes useful for a vessel
                    discharging her passengers or completing her cargo while the gates are shut. Mr
                    Redman remarks that “the practice in the port of London is to dock a ship upon
                    the flood just before the high water, and to undock her at ab-? it the same
                    period of tide. . . . The directions as apparently the most desirable are an
                    angle of about 45° pointing up ths streams for graving docks, an angle of about
                    60° in a similar direction for wet docks, and a right angle for building
                    slips.”</p>
                <p>It is of importance in discharging coal into ships that the fall should be as
                    small as possible.</p>
                <p>At Bramley Moor Dock, Liverpool, the Wigan coal is discharged by railway 18 feet
                    above the quay. At Sunderland Mr Meik finds that 20 feet above'the quays, as at
                    the south dock, is too small for the shoots, and prefers 36 feet. At Penaτth the
                    height is 22, and they are able to lift 180 tons per hour. At Greenock, where
                    steam cranes are used, they load about 500 tons a day. At Middlesboro’ they can
                    discharge 150 tons per hour, but 106 tons are as much as can be trimmed on
                    board. At Cardiff, where there is no hydraulic machinery, they load 100 tons an
                    hour. The distance between the staiths is 180 feet. At the Tyne Docks, Mr
                    Harrison states that on one occasion, when a vessel had very long hatchways
                    admitting of several waggons being simultaneously discharged, 420 tons of coal
                    have been snipped in 55 minutes, a feat which shows the admirable mechanism
                    employed.</p>
                <p>At Swansea, with hydraulic machinery, they can discharge from 350 to 400 tons a
                    day, and those at Penarth load at the rate of 60 tons an hour.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Law of Harbours and Ports.</hi></p>
                <p>The power of appointing suitable places to be ports or havens in England is one
                    of the ancient prerogatives of the crown, founded, as Blackstone thinks, partly
                    upon the rights of the king as conservator of the kingdom, partly upon his
                    interest in the marine revenues. “In England it hath always been holden that the
                    sovereign is lord of the whole shore, and particularly is guardian of the ports
                    and havens which are the inlets and gates of the realm, and therefore, so early
                    as the reign of King John, we find ships seized by the king’s officers for
                    putting in at a place that was not a legal port.” The right of the king to make
                    a harbour, and to grant the dues arising from the use thereof, in any suitable
                    place, although the ownership of the soil may be in another, is subject to any
                    vested rights of harbour already existing; and in the recent case of Foreman <hi
                    rend="italic">v.</hi> the Free Fishers of Whitstable, it was said that the right
                    of the public freely to navigate the high seas is a paramount right to which the
                    right of the crown in the soil is necessarily subservient, and therefore, as the
                    right of navigation must include the right of anchorage, the crown or its
                    grantee could not impose a toll on this use of its soil. To justify such a toll
                    some facts must be shown proving that the soil was originally within the
                    precincts of a port or harbour, or that some service or aid to navigation was
                    rendered, in respect of which the alleged right of toll was granted. The crown
                    having once granted a harbour could not afterwards narrow its limits, but by 16
                    and 17 Viet, c. 107 the crown is enabled to ascertain the limits of all ports,
                    and to assign quays thereon for the enclosure, loading, and landing of
                    merchandize, so that frauds on the revenue may be prevented.</p>
                <p>The Act 10 and 11 Vict. c. 27 consolidates the clauses usually inserted in
                    private acts authorizing the construction of harbours; 24 and 25 Vict. c. 45
                    facilitates the formation and improvement of piers and harbours in Great Britain
                    and Ireland; and 25 and 26 Vict. c. 69 and 28 and 29 Vict. c. 100 transfer from
                    the Admiralty to the Board of Trade certain powers and duties relative to
                    harbours. Besides these general Acts, there are many special Acts relating to
