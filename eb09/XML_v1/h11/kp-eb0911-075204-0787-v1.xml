                <p><label type="entry">HERNIA</label> (a Latin term commonly derived from <hi
                    rend="italic">llpvο&lt;s,</hi> a sprout, but this origin is doubtful) is the
                    protrusion of any viscus from its normal cavity; for example, hernia cerebri is
                    the name given to a protrusion of the brain substance, hernia pulmonum a
                    protrusion of a portion of the lung. The word may here be restricted to its most
                    usual meaning, a protrusion of part of the contents of the abdomen from their
                    normal position in the abdominal cavity,—in common language a “rupture.” A
                    rupture may occur at any weak point in the abdominal wall. The common situations
                    are the groin (inguinal hernia), the upper part of the thigh (femoral hernia),
                    and the umbilicus or navel (umbilical hernia). The contents of a rupture may be
                    any of the abdominal viscera; the more movable the viscus the more tendency
                    there is to protrusion, and therefore we generally find that the small intestine
                    and the omentum are most frequently displaced. The tumour may contain intestine
                    alone (enterocele), omentum alone (epiplocele), or a combination of intestine
                    and omentum (entero-epiplocele). The predisposing cause to rupture is any
                    weakness of the abdominal wall due (1) to natural conformity, as in inguinal
                    hernia, which descends along the inguinal canal, a canal in which the cord lies
                    in the male and the round ligament in the female; or in femoral hernia, in which
                    the hernia descends along the femoral canal along with and to the inner side of
                    the femoral vessels; (2) to any cause which weakens the wall locally, as an
                    abscess or wound; (3) to general laxity of the tissues, as in weakly people, or
                    after repeated pregnancies. This third cause only predisposes to hernia in so
                    far as it may weaken an already weak part under the first and second heads. The
                    exciting cause of hernia is generally some strain or over-exertion in any
                    powerful effort, as lifting a heavy weight, jumping off a high wall, straining,
                    as in difficult micturition or in consequence of constipation, or excessive
                    coughing, as in chronic bronchitis. The pressure of the diaphragm above and the
                    anterior abdominal wall in front acting on the abdominal viscera tends to cause
                    their protrusion at the weakest point. Rupture is either congenital or acquired.
                    A child may be born with a hernia in the inguinal or umbilical region, the
                    result of an arrest of development in these parts; or the rupture may be
                    acquired, first appearing perhaps in adult life, the result of one or other of
                    the accidents referred to above. Ruptures are most frequent at the extremes of
                    life. Men suffer more frequently than women, because they are more liable to
                    those accidents, being frequently exposed to intermittent work, such as the
                    lifting of heavy weights.</p>
                <p>At first the rupture is small, and with more or less rapidity it gradually
                    increases in size; it varies from the size of a small marble to that of a
                    child’s head or even larger. The swelling which appears is spoken of as
                    consisting of three parts,—the coverings, sac, and contents.</p>
                <p>(1) The “coverings” are composed of the different structures which form the
                    abdominal wall at the part where the rupture occurs. In femoral hernia the
                    coverings are formed of the structures at the upper part of the thigh. These
                    structures are stretched and may be thinned; in some cases they are condensed
                    and matted together, the result of pressure; in others there is an increase in
                    their thickness, the result of repeated attacks of inflammation.</p>
                <p>(2) The “sac” is composed of the peritoneum or membrane lining the abdominal
                    cavity; in some very rare cases the sac is wanting. The neck of the sac is the
                    term used to designate the narrowed portion where the peritoneum forming the sac
                    becomes continuous with the general peritoneal cavity. Very frequently the neck
                    of the sac is thickened, indurated, and adherent to surrounding parts, because
                    here the tendency to local inflammatory action is most marked, the pressure
                    being greatest at this point. (3) The “contents” have already been described.
                    There are three distinct conditions in which we may find the contents of a
                    hernial tumour: it may be either reducible, irreducible, or strangulated. A
                    “reducible” hernia is one in which the contents can be pushed back into the
                    abdomen. In some cases this is done with ease, in others it is a matter of great
                    difficulty. At any moment a reducible hernia may become “irreducible,” that is
                    to say, its contents cannot be pushed back into the abdominal cavity. This may
                    suddenly occur in consequence of an attack of constipation, or slowly, the
                    irreducibility being at first partial and gradually becoming more <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n788/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0788-0753"/> and more complete. Generally this is due to an
                    increase in the size of the omentum, accompanied by inflammatory induration. A
                    “strangulated” hernia is one in which the circulation of the blood through the
                    hernial contents is interfered with. The interference is at first slight, but
                    very rapidly tends to become more pronounced. At first there is congestion; this
                    congestion may go on to inflammation <hi rend="italic">; if</hi> unrelieved, the
                    inflammation will end in mortification. The rapidity with which the change from
                    simple congestion to mortification takes place will depend on the tightness of
                    the constricting cause; as a rule the more rapidly a hernia forms, in other
                    words, the less time the surrounding tissues have to accommodate themselves to
                    the protruding swelling, the greater the rapidity of the changes in the
                    conditions of the contents. The constricting agent may be one or other of the
                    structures which form the boundaries of the openings through which the hernia
                    has travelled in its gradual course through the abdominal wall, or it may lie in
                    the neck of the sac, which has become thickened in consequence of
                    inflammation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Reducible Hernia.—</hi> The symptoms of reducible hernia show
                    themselves in a soft compressible tumour (elastic when it contains intestine,
                    doughy when it contains omentum, a combination of elasticity and doughiness when
                    both are present), its size increasing in the erect, and diminishing in the
                    horizontal posture, whence as a rule it gives little trouble during the night,
                    and becomes more troublesome in the daytime, more especially towards evening.
                    There is a more or less distinct impulse on coughing, and when the intestinal
                    contents are pushed back into the abdomen a gurgling sensation is perceptible by
                    the fingers. Such a tumour may be met with in any part of the abdominal wall,
                    but the chief situations are—(a) the inguinal region, in which the neck of the
                    tumour lies immediately above Poupart’s ligament (a cord-like ligamentous
                    structure which can be felt stretching from the anterior superior spinous
                    process of the ilium to the spine of the pubis immediately above the genital
                    organs); (6) the femoral region in the upper part of the thigh, in which the
                    neck of the sac lies immediately below the inner end of Poupart’s ligament; (c)
                    the umbilical region, in which the tumour appears at the navel. As the inguinal
                    hernia increases in size it tends to pass into the scrotum in the male, into the
                    labium in the female; while the femoral hernia, appearing first below Poupart,
                    tends gradually as it increases in size to pass upwards superficial to Poupart’s
                    ligament.</p>
                <p>The treatment of reducible hernia consists in pushing back the contents of the
                    tumour into the abdomen, and applying a truss or elastic bandage in order to
                    prevent the contents from again escaping. The younger the patient the more
                    chance there is of the truss acting as a curative agent, as the natural tendency
                    to contraction of the channel through which the hernia protrudes is greater. The
                    truss is frequently laid aside at night, because in the horizontal posture the
                    tendency of the contents to descend is greatly lessened. The truss or bandage
                    should, however, be worn day and night. If, after the hernia is once returned,
                    it is never again allowed to come down, there is a probability of a cure taking
                    place; but if it is allowed to come down occasionally, as it may do, even during
                    the night, in consequence of a cough or from turning suddenly in bed, the parts
                    are stretched, and the contracting process which may have been going on for
                    weeks is undone.</p>
                <p>It is unnecessary to describe the multitudinous varieties of trusses. When a
                    trass is ordered the surgeon has to see that it fits accurately, the necessary
                    amount of pressure being obtained by means of a steel spring, to which a pad is
                    attached. The pad should be so arranged as to press, not into the opening
                    through which the hernia has come, but rather on its sides, so as to facilitate
                    its contraction and permanent closure. The main pressure should be in the
                    neighbourhood of the neck of the sac; if the pad presses into the opening, the
                    tendency is to keep the opening patent. The principle of the nipple-shaped pad,
                    frequently ordered for umbilical hernia, is evil; a flat pad properly applied
                    and held in position by an elastic bandage is the proper arrangement for
                    restraining an umbilical hernia. No truss is to be applied until the hernia is
                    completely reduced; it will only do harm by pressing on the contents of the
                    unreduced hernia. In some herniae, generally those of large size, it is found
                    impossible to keep them up by means of a trass; in such cases an elastic bandage
                    will sometimes effect the object, in others various operations have been
                    recommended. They are spoken of as “the radical cure of hernia,” in
                    contradistinction to the so-called “palliative treatment by means of a trass.”
                    An attempt has been made above to show that a trass may radically cure a hernia.
                    The principles involved in the operations described are (1) obliteration of the
                    neck of the sac, (2) obliteration of the channel through which the hernia has
                    descended, (3) obliteration of the sac itself, (4) plugging of the channel by
                    invaginating the loose skin. The first and second are specially important, as in
                    them the surgeon imitates nature’s way of attempting to cure the tendency to
                    hernial protrusion.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Irreducible Hernia.—</hi> Here the main symptom is a tumour in
                    one or other of the situations already referred to, of long standing and
                    generally of large size, in which the contents of the tumour, in whole or in
                    part, cannot be pushed back into the abdomen. The irreducibility is due either
                    to its large size or to changes which have taken place in the contents, either
                    indurations or adhesions. Such a tumour is a constant source of danger: its
                    contents are liable, from their exposed situation, to injury from external
                    violence; it has a constant tendency to increase in size; it may at any time
                    become strangulated, or the contents may inflame, and strangulation may occur
                    secondarily to the inflammation. It is accompanied by dragging sensations
                    referred to the abdomen, colic, dyspepsia, and constipation, which may in its
                    turn lead to obstruction, that is to say, a stoppage of the passage of the
                    contents of that portion of the intestinal canal which lies in the hernial
                    tumour. When an irreducible hernia becomes painful and tender, a local
                    peritonitis has occurred, which resembles in many of its symptoms a case of
                    strangulation.</p>
                <p>The treatment of irreducible hernia may be palliative: a bag truss may be worn to
                    prevent the swelling from getting larger; the bowels must be kept open, and all
                    irregularities of diet avoided. A person with such a hernia is in constant
                    danger, and more than palliation is called for. An attempt should be made to
                    reduce the hernia—(1) by laying the patient on his back, raising his buttocks,
                    administering purgatives, and starving him (persevering attention to these
                    points may so reduce the size of the contents that the henιia may be returned);
                    or (2) by means of an elastic bandage carefully applied so as to press
                    continuously on the tumour, and gradually press it back into the abdominal
                    cavity. By this simple means large irreducible herniae, which have withstood all
                    attempts at reduction, have been returned into the abdomen after elastic
                    pressure has been carefully and continuously applied for a few days. (3) The
                    surgeon may cut down on the hernia, under strict antiseptic precautions, open
                    the sac, divide any omental adhesions, ligature and cut away indurated omentum,
                    return the bowel, and then tie the neck of the sac. Such an operation is
                    unjustifiable unless other means have been fairly tried and failed, and unless
                    the hernia is giving rise to such symptoms that the usefulness of the patient is
                    interfered with.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Strangulated Hernia.—</hi> In this the contents are
                    constricted, and the flow of blood into the tumour and from the tumour is
                    stopped. The symptoms are—nausea, vomiting first of bilious matter, after a time
                    of faecal matter, a twisting, burning pain generally referred to the umbilicus,
                    intestinal obstruction, a quick wiry pulse, pain on pressure over the tumour and
                    in the abdomen near the tumour, the abdomen tense and tympanitic, and no impulse
                    on coughing, because the contents of the tumour are practically cut off from the
                    general abdominal contents. The patient has an anxious expression. Sooner or
                    later, from eight hours to eight days, if the strangulation is unrelieved, the
                    tumour will become livid and emphysematous; mortification has occurred, and
                    gangrene of the bowel at the neck of the sac will take place, followed by
                    extravasation of the intestinal contents into the abdominal cavity; the patient
                    becomes collapsed, and dies comatose.</p>
                <p>The treatment of a strangulated hernia admits of no delay; delay is fatal. If the
                    symptoms are not very acute, and if the case is seen early, attempts may be made
                    by large enemata and by the application of cold to the tumour to reduce the
                    congested condition and relieve the strangulation. But these attempts must not
                    be persevered with for more than two or three hours. If the strangulation
                    continues, then the patient should be told that his case is one which admits of
                    no delay. Chloroform should be administered; another attempt to return the
                    contents by pressure (termed “the taxis”) should be made. If this has already
                    been fairly tiled, and if the symptoms indicate urgency, no prolonged attempts
                    at taxis are justifiable, because the condition of the hernial contents may be
                    such that they cannot bear the pressure. The taxis to be successful should be
                    made in a direction opposite to the one in which the hernia has come down. The
                    inguinal hernia should be pressed upwards, outwards, and backwards, the femoral
                    hernia downwards, backwards, and upwards. The larger the hernia the greater is
                    the chance of success. The slightest gurgle indicates that success is near. If
                    taxis does not succeed then the surgeon must cut down on the tumour, carefully
                    dividing the different coverings until he reaches the sac. The sac is then
                    opened, the constriction divided, care being taken not to injure the bowel. The
                    condition of the bowel is then examined, and if it is glistening, however black
                    it may be, it is returned into the abdomen. If it has lost its glistening
                    aspect, if it is like “wet parchment,” then the case is very doubtful. If in
                    doubt, relieve the constriction and leave the bowel in the sac. Never open the
                    bowel, however bad it looks; it may recover; and if it does not burst for some
                    hours afterwards, the chances arc that adhesions may form at the neck of the sac
                    and lessen the risk <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n789/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0789-0754"/> of extravasation into the abdominal cavity—a
                    faecal fistula will be the result. The omentum, if healthy, may be returned; or
                    if congested and indurated, it may be ligatured and cut off. After the bowel is
                    returned the wound is sewn up, and a pad and flannel bandage applied. A dose of
                    opium should be given to prevent movement of the bowels. On the third day a dose
                    of castor oil is administered if the bowels do not open naturally. A trass is
                    applied after the wound is healed before the patient is allowed to get out of
                    bed. Many complications which may occur cannot here be referred to. Any one
                    suffering from hernia should take great care to obtain an accurately fitting
                    truss, and should remember that, whenever any symptoms resembling in any degree
                    those of st rangulation occur, any delay in the treatment is not only dangerous
                    but may prove fatal. A medical man should at once be communicated with. He in
                    his turn has to remember that when a patient asks his advice, complaining of
                    symptoms resembling strangulation, he must examine all the situations where
                    hernia may occur, because the hernial tumour may be so small that it has escaped
                    the notice of the patient. Any assertion on the patient’s part that he does not
                    suffer from hernia must receive no weight. The surgeon must satisfy himself by
                    ocular inspection and manual examination. If an operation is necessary he may
                    with confidence say that the operation is not in itself a dangerous one, while,
                    on the other hand, he can assure the patient that any delay is most certainly
                    excessively dangerous. (J. C. )</p>
