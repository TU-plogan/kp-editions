                    (1578-1657), the discoverer of the circulation of the blood, was the eldest son
                    of Thomas Harvey, a prosperous Kentish yeoman, and was born at Folkestone on
                    April 1, 1578. After passing through the grammar school of Canterbury, on the
                    31st of May 1593, having just entered his sixteenth year, he became a pensioner
                    of Caius College, Cambridge; at nineteen he took his B. A. degree, and soon
                    after, having chosen the profession of medicine, he went to study at Padua under
                    Fabricius and Casserius (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Anatomy,</hi> vol. i. pp. 809,
                    81Q). At the age of twenty-four Harvey became doctor of medicine, April 1602.
                    Returning to England in the first year of James I., he settled in London; and
                    two years later he married the daughter of Dr Lancelot Brown, who had been
                    physician to Queen Elizabeth. In the same year Harvey became a candidate of the
                    Royal College of Physicians, and was duly admitted a fellow (June 1607). In 1609
                    he obtained the reversion of the post of physician to St Bartholomew’s Hospital.
                    His application was supported by the king himself and by Dr Atkins, the
                    president of the college. On the death of Dr Wilkinson in the course of the same
                    year he succeeded to the post. He was thrice censor of the college, and in 1615
                    was appointed Lumleian lecturer. In the following year—the year of Shakespeare’s
                    death—he began his course of lectures, and first brought forward his views upon
                    the movements of the heart and blood.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    the next vacιncy physician in ordinary to his successor. In 1628, the year of

                    elected treasurer of the College of Physicians, but at the end of the following
                    year he resigned the office, in order, by command of Charles I., to accompany
                    the young duke of Lennox (James Stuart, afterwards duke of Richmond) on his
                    travels. He appears to have visited Italy, and returned in 1632. Four years
                    later he accompanied the earl of Arundel on his embassy to the emperor. He was
                    eager in collecting objects of natural history, sometimes causing the earl
                    anxiety for his safety by his excursions in a country infested by robbers after
                    the Thirty Years’ War. In a letter written on this journey, he says—“By the way
                    we could scarce see a dog, crow, kite, raven, or any bird, or anything to
                    anatomize; only some few miserable people, the relique3 of the war and the
                    plague, whom famine had made anatomies before I came.” Having returned to his
                    practice in London at the close of the year 1636, he accompanied Charles I. in
                    one of his journeys to Scotland (1639 or 1641). While at Elinburgh he visited
                    the Bass Rock; he minutely describes its abundant population of sea-fowl in his
                    treatise <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Generatione,</hi> and
                    incidentally speaks of the then credited account of the solan goose growing on
                    trees as a fable. He was in attendance on the king at the battle of Edgehill
                    (October 1642), where he withdrew under a hedge with the prince of Wales and the
                    duke of York (then boys of twelve and ten years old), “and took out of his
                    pocket a book and read. But he had not read very long before a bullet of a great
                    gun grazed on the ground near him, which made him remove his station,” as he
                    afterwards told Aubrey. After the indecisive battle, Harvey followed Charles I.
                    to Oxford, “where,” writes the same gossiping narrator, “I first saw him, but
                    was then too young to be acquainted with so great a doctor. I remember he came
                    several times to our college (Trinity) to George Bathurst, B.D., who had a hen
                    to hatch eggs in his chamber, which they opened daily to see the progress and
                    way of generation.” In Oxford he remained three years, and there was some chance
                    of his being superseded in his office at St Bartholomew’s Hospital, “because he
                    hath withdrawn himself from his charge, and is retired to the party in arms
                    against the Parliament.” It was no doubt at this time that his lodgings at
                    Whitehall were searched, and not only the furniture seized but also invaluable
                    manuscripts and anatomical preparations.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>While with the king at Oxford he was made warden of Merton College, but a year
                    later, in 1646, that city surrendered to Fairfax, and Harvey returned to London.
                    He was now sixty-eight years old, and, having resigned his appointments and
                    relinquished the cares of practice, lived in learned retirement with one or
                    other of his brothers. It was in his brother Daniel’s house at Combe that Dr
                    (afterwards Sir George) Ent, a faithful friend and disciple (1604- 1689),
                    visited him in 1650. “I found him,” he says, “with a cheerful and sprightly
                    countenance investigating, like Democritus, the nature of things. Asking if all
                    were well with him—‘ How can that be,’ he replied, ‘ when the state is so
                    agitated with storms and I myself am yet in the open sea <hi rend="italic"
                    >1</hi> And indeed, were not my mind solaced by my studies and the recollection
                    of the observations I have formerly made, there is nothing which should make me
                    desirous of a longer continuance. But thus employed, this obscure life and
                    vacation from public cares which would disgust other minds is the medicine of
                    mine.’” The work on which he had been chiefly engaged at Oxford, and indeed
                    since the publication of his treatise on the circulation in 1628, was an
                    investigation into the recondite but deeply interesting subject of generation.
                    Charles I. had been an enlightened patron of Harvey’s studies, had put the royal
                    deer parks at Windsor and Hampton Court at his disposal, and had watched his
                    demonstration of the growth of the chick with no less interest than the
                    movements of the living heart. Harvey had now collected a large number of
                    observations, though he would probably have delayed their publication. But Ent
                    succeeded in obtaining the manuscripts, with authority to print them or not as
                    he should find them. “I went from him,” he says, “like another Jason in
                    possession of the golden fleece, and when I came home and perused the pieces
                    singly, I was amazed that so vast a treasure should have been so long hidden.”
                    The result was the publication of the <hi rend="italic">Exercitationes</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">Generatione</hi> (1651).</p>
                <p>This was the last of Harvey’s labours. He had now reached his seventy-third year.
                    His theory of the circulation had been opposed and defended, and was now
                    generally accepted by the most eminent anatomists both at home and abroad. He
                    was known and honoured throughout Europe, and his own college erected a statue
                    in his honour (1652), “viro monumentis suis immortali.” In 1654 he was elected
                    to the highest post in his profession, that of president of the college; but the
                    following day he met the assembled fellows, and, declining the honour for
                    himself on account of the infirmities of age, recommended the re-election of the
                    late president Dr Prujean. He accepted, <pb break="no"

                    again held in the two following years. He had already enriched the college with
                    other gifts besides the honour of his name. He had raised for them “a noble
                    building of Roman architecture (rustic work with Corinthian pilasters),
                    comprising a great parlour or conversation room below and a library above”; he
                    had furnished the library with books, and filled the museum with “simples and
                    rarities,” as well as with specimens of instruments used in the surgical and
                    obstetric branches of medicine. At last he determined to give to his beloved
                    college his paternal estate at Burmarsh in Kent. His wife had died some years
                    before, his brothers were wealthy men, and he was childless, so that he was
                    defrauding no heir when, in July 1656, he made the transfer of this property,
                    then valued at £56 per annum, with provision for a salary to the college
                    librarian and for the endowment of an annual oration, which is still given on
                    the anniversary of the day. The orator, so Harvey orders in his deed of gift, is
                    to exhort the fellows of the college “to search out and study the secrets of
                    nature by way of experiment, and also for the honour of the profession to
                    continue mutual love and affection among themselves.”</p>
                <p>Harvey, like his contemporary and great successor Sydenham, was long afflicted
                    with gout, but he preserved his activity of mind to an advanced age. In his
                    eightieth year, on the 3d of June 1657,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    paralysis, and though deprived of speech was able, to send for his nephews and
                    distribute his watch, ring, and other personal trinkets among them. He died the
                    same evening, “the palsy giving him an easy passport,” and was buried with great
                    honour in his brother Eliab’s vault at Hempstead in Essex, “annorum et famae
                    satur.”</p>
                <p>Aubrey, to whom we owe most of the minor particulars about Harvey which have been
                    preserved, says—“In person he was not tall, but of the lowest stature; round
                    faced, olivaster complexion, little eyes, round, very black, full of spirits;
                    his hair black as a raven, but quite white twenty years before he died.” The
                    best portrait of him extant is by Cornelius Jansen in the library of the College
                    of Physicians, one of those rescued from the great fire, which destroyed their
                    original hall in 1666. It has been often engraved, and is prefixed to the fine
                    edition of his works published in 1766.</p>

                    previous state of knowledge on the subject. Aristotle taught that in man and the
                    higher animals the blood was elaborated from the food in the liver, thence
                    carried to the heart, and sent by it through the veins over the body. His
                    successors of the Alexandrian school of medicine, Erasistratus and Herophilus,
                    further elaborated his system, and taught that, while the veins carried blood
                    from the heart to the membere, the arteries carried a subtle kind of air or
                    spirit. For the practical physician only two changes had been made in this
                    theory of the circulation between the Christian era and the 16th century. Galen
                    had discovered that the arteries -were not, as their name implies, merely
                    air-pipes, but that they contained blood as well as vital air or spirit. And it
                    had been gradually ascertained that the nerves <hi rend="italic">(vevpα)</hi>
                    which arose from the brain and conveyed “animal spirits” to the body were
                    different from the tendons or sinews (v∈υpα) which attach muscles to bones. <hi
                    rend="italic">First,</hi> then, the physicians of the time of Linacre knew that
                    the blood is not stagnant in the body. So did Shakespeare and Homer, and every
                    augur who inspected the entrails of a victim, and every village barber who
                    breathed a vein. Plato even uses the expression <hi rend="smallcaps">to</hi>

                    to its source (a circulation in the true sense of the word) either in the system
                    or in the lungs. If they used the word <hi rend="italic">circulatio,</hi> as did
                    Caesalpinus,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Indeed the

                    laurels of Harvey.</p></note> it was as vaguely as the French policeman cries
                    “Circulez.” The movements of the blood were in fact thought to be slow and
                    irregular in direction as well as in speed, like the “circulation” of air in a
                    house, or the circulation of a crowd in the streets of a city. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Secondly,</hi> they supposed that one kind of blood flowed from the liver to
                    the right ventricle of the heart, and thence to the lungs and the general system
                    by the veins, and that another kind flowed from the left ventricle to the lungs
                    and general system by the arteries. <hi rend="italic">Thirdly,</hi> they
                    supposed that the septum of the heart was pervious and allowed blood to pass
                    directly from the right to the left side. <hi rend="italic">Fourthly,</hi> they
                    had no conception of the functions of the heart as the motor power of the
                    movement of the blood. They doubted whether its substance was muscular; they
                    supposed its pulsation to be due to expansion of the spirits it contained; they
                    believed the only dynamic effect which it had on the blood to be sucking it in
                    during its active diastole, and they supposed the chief use of its constant
                    movements to be the due mixture of blood and spirits.</p>
                <p>Of the great anatomists of the 16th century, Sylvius <hi rend="italic">(In
                    Hipp,</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">Gal. Phys, Partem
                    Anatom.</hi><hi rend="italic">Isagoge)</hi> described the valves of the veins;

                    rend="italic">Corporis Fabrica,</hi> 1542) ascertained that the septum between
                    the right and left ventricles is complete, though he could not bring himself to
                    deny the invisible pores which Galen’s system demanded. Servetus, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Christianismi Destitutio</hi> (1553), goes somewhat further than
                    his fellow-student Vesalius, and says—“Paries ille medius non est aptus ad
                    communicationem et elaborationem illam; licet aliquid resudare possit ;” and,
                    from this anatomical fact and the large size of the pulmonary arteries he
                    concludes that there is a communication in the lungs by which blood passes from
                    the pulmonary artery to the pulmonary vein—“Eodem artificio quo in hepato fit
                    transfusio a vena portae ad venam cavam propter sanguinem, fit etiam in pulmone
                    transfusio a vena arteriosa ad arteriam venosam propter spiritum.” The natural
                    spirit of the left side and the vital spirit of the right side of the heart were
                    therefore, he concluded, practically the same, and hence two instead of three
                    distinct <hi rend="italic">spirùus</hi> should be admitted. It seems doubtful
                    whether even Servetus rightly conceived of the entire mass of the blood passing
                    through the pulmonary artery and the lungs. The transference of the <hi
                    rend="italic">spiritus naturalis</hi> to the lungs, and its return to the left
                    ventricle as <hi rend="italic">spiritus vitalis,</hi> was the function which he
                    regarded as important. Indeed a true conception of the lesser circulation as a
                    transference of the whole blood of the right side to the left was impossible
                    until the corresponding transference in the greater or systemic circulation was
                    discovered. Servetus, however, was the true predecessor of Harvey in physiology,
                    and his claims to that honour are perfectly authentic and universally
                    admitted.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Realdus

                    nemo hactenus aut animadvertit aut scriptum reliquit.” The fact that Harvey
                    quotes Columbus and not Servetus is explained by the almost entire destruction
                    of the writings of the latter, which are now among the rarest curiosities. The
                    great anatomist Fabricius, Harvey’s teacher at Padua, described the valves of
                    the veins more perfectly than had Sylvius. Ruini, in his treatise on the <hi
                    rend="italic">Aηαtοmg and Diseases of the Horse</hi> (1590), taught that the
                    left ventricle sends blood and vital spirits to all parts of the body except the
                    lungs—the ordinary Galenical doctrine. Yet on the strength of this phrase
                    Professor Ercolani has actually put up a tablet in the veterinary school at
                    Bologna to Ruini as the discoverer of the circulation of the blood! The claims
                    of Cie3alpinu3, a more plausible claimant to Harvey’s laurels, are scarcely
                    better founded. In his <hi rend="italic">Quoestiones</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Peripateticae</hi> (1571) he followed Servetus and Columbus in describing what
                    we now know as the pulmonary “circulation” under that name, and this is the only
                    foundation for the assertion (first made in Bayle’s dictionary) that Caesalpinus
                    knew “the circulation of the blood.” He is even behind Servetus, for lie only
                    allows part of the blood of the right ventricle to go round by this “circuit”;
                    some, he conceives, passes through the hypothetical pores in the septum, and the
                    rest by the superior cava to the head and arms, by the inferior to the rest of
                    the body—“Hanc esse venarum utilitatem ut omnes partes corporis sanguinem pro
                    nutrimento deferant. Ex dextro ventι∙° cordis vena cava sanguinem crassiorem, in
                    quo calor intensus est magis, ex altero autem ventr, sanguinem temperatissimum
                    ac sincerissimum habente, egreditur aorta.” Caesalpinus seems to have had no
                    original views on the subject; all that he writes is copied from Galen or from
                    Servetιιs except some erroneous observations of his own. His greatest merit was
                    as a botanist; and no claim to the “discovery of the circulation” was made by
                    him or by his contemporaries. When it was made, Haller decided conclusively
                    against it. The fact that an inscription was lately placed on the bust of
                    Caesalpinus a Rome, which states that he preceded others in recognizing and
                    demonstrating “the general circulation of the blood,” is only a proof of the
                    blindness of misplaced national vanity.</p></note></p>
                <p>The way then to Harvey’s great work had been paved by the discovery of the valves
                    in the veins, and by that of the lesser circulation,—the former due to Sylvius
                    and Fabricius, the latter to Servetus,—but the significance of the <pb

                    pulmonary circulation was not generally admitted in its full meaning.</p>
                <p>In his treatise Harvey proves (1) that it is the contraction, not the dilatation,
                    of the heart which coincides with the pulse, and that the ventricles as true
                    muscular sacs squeeze the blood which they contain into the aorta and pulmonary
                    artery; (2) that the pulse is not produced by the arteries enlarging and so
                    filling, but by the arteries being filled with blood and so enlarging; (3) that
                    there are no pores in the septum of the heart, so that the whole blood in the
                    right ventricle is sent to the lungs and round by the pulmonary veins to the
                    left ventricle, and also that the whole blood in the left ventricle is again
                    sent into the arteries, round by the smaller veins into the venae cavae, and by
                    them to the right ventricle again—thus making a complete “circii ιtion”; (4)
                    that the blood in the arteries and that in the vein3 is the same blood <hi
                    rend="italic">; (5)</hi> that the action of the right and left sides of the
                    heart, auricles, ventricles, and valves, is the same, the mechanism in both
                    being for reception and propulsion of liquid and not of air, since the blood on
                    the right side, though mixed with air, is still blood; (6) that the blood sent
                    through the arteries to the tissues is not all used, but that most of it runs
                    through into the veins; (7) that there is no to and fro undulation in the veins,
                    but a constant stream from the distant parts towards the heart; (8) that the
                    dynamical starting-point of the blood is the heart and not the liver.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">method</hi> by which Harvey arrived at his complete and
                    almost faultless solution of the most fundamental and difficult problem in
                    physiology has been often discussed, and is well worthy of attention. He begins
                    his treatise by pointing out the many inconsistencies and defects in the
                    Galenical theory, quoting the writings of Galen himself, of Fabricius, Columbus,
                    and others, with great respect, but with unflinching criticism. For, in his own
                    noble language, wise men must learn anatomy, not from the decrees of
                    philosophers, but from the fabric of nature herself, “nee ita ia verba jurare
                    antiquitatis magistrae, ut veritatem amicam in apertis relinquant, et in
                    conspectu omnium deserant.” He had, a8 we know, not only furnished himself with
                    all the knowledge that books and the instructions of the best anatomists of
                    Italy could give, but, by a long series of dissections, had gained a far more
                    complete knowledge of the comparative anatomy of the heart and vessels than any
                    contemporary—we may almost say than any successor, until the times of Hunter and
                    Meckel. Thus equipped, he tells us that he began his investigations into the
                    movements of the heart and blood by looking at them—z.e., by seeing their action
                    in living animals. After a modest preface, he heads his first chapter “Ex
                    vivorum dissectione, qualis sit cordis motus.” He minutely describes what he saw
                    and handled in dogs, pigs, serpents, frogs, and fishes, and even in slugs,
                    oysters, lobsters, and insects, in the transparent <hi rend="italic"
                    >minima</hi><hi rend="italic">squilla,</hi> “quae Anglice dicitur <hi
                    rend="italic">a shrimp,”</hi> and lastly in the chick while still in the shell.
                    In these investigations he used a <hi rend="italic">perspicillum</hi> or simple
                    lens. He particularly describes his observations and experiments on the
                    ventricles, the auricles, the arteries, and the veins. He shows how the
                    arrangement of the vessels in the foetus supports his theory. He adduces facts
                    observed in disease as well as in health to prove the rapidity of the
                    circulation. He explains how the mechanism of the valves in the veins is
                    adapted, not, as Fabricius believed, to moderate the flow of blood from the
                    heart, but to favour its flow to the heart. He estimates the capacity of each
                    ventricle, and reckons the rate at which the whole mass of blood passes through
                    it. He elaborately and clearly demonstrates the effect of obstruction of the
                    blood-stream in arteries or in veins, by the forceps in the case of a snake, by
                    a ligature on the arm of a man, and illustrates his argument by figures. He then
                    sums up his conclusion thus :— “Circulari quodam motu, in circuitu, agitari in
                    animalibus sanguinem, et esse in perpetuo motu; et hanc esse actionem sive
                    functionem cordis quam pulsu peragit; et omnino motus et pulsus cordis causam
                    unam esse.” Lastly, in the 15th, 16th, and 17th chapters, he adds certain
                    confirmatory evidence, as the effect of position on the circulation, the
                    absorption of animal poisons and of medicines applied externally, the muscular
                    structure of the heart and the necessary working of its valves. The whole
                    treatise, which occupies only G7 pages of large print in the quarto edition of
                    1766, is a model of accurate observation, patient accumulation of facts,
                    ingenious experimentation, bold yet cautious hypothesis, and logical
                    deduction.</p>
                <p>In one point only was the demonstration of the circulation incomplete. Harvey
                    could not discover the capillary channels by which the blood passes from the
                    arteries to the veins. This gap in the circulation was supplied several years
                    later by the great anatomist Malpighi, who in 1661 saw in the lungs of a frog,
                    by the newly invented microscope, how the blood passes from the one set of
                    vessels to the other. Harvey saw all that could be seen by the unaided eye in
                    his observations on living animals; Malpighi, four years after Harvey’s death,
                    by another observation on a living animal, completed the splendid chain of
                    evidence. If this detracts from Harvey’s merit it leaves Servetus no merit at
                    all. But in fact the existence of the channels first seen by Malpighi was as
                    clearly pointed to by Harvey’s reasoning as the existence of Neptune by the
                    calculations of Le Verrier and of Adams.</p>
                <p>Harvey himself and all his contemporaries were well aware of the novelty and
                    importance of his theory. He says in the admirable letter to Dr Argent,
                    president of the College of Physicians, which follows the dedication of his
                    treatise to Charles I., that he should not have ventured to publish “a book
                    which alone asserts that the blood pursues its course and flows back again by a
                    new path, contrary to the received doctrine taught so many ages by innumerable
                    learned and illustrious men,” if he had not set forth his theory for more than
                    nine years in his college lectures, gradually brought it to perfection, and
                    convinced his colleagues by actual demonstrations of the truth of what he
                    advanced. He anticipates opposition, and even obloquy or loss, from the novelty
                    of his views. These anticipations however, the event proved to <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n536/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0536-0505"/> have been groundless. If we are to credit Aubrey
                    indeed, lie found that after the publication of the <hi rend="italic">De
                    Motu</hi> “he fell mightily in his practice; ’ twas believed by the vulgar that
                    he was crackbrained, and all the physicians were against him.” But the last
                    assertion is demonstrably untrue; and if apothecaries and patients ever forsook
                    him, they must soon have returned, for Harvey left a handsome fortune. By his
                    own profession the book was received as it deserved. So novel a doctrine was not
                    to be accepted without due inquiry, but his colleagues had heard his lectures
                    and seen his demonstrations for years; they were already convinced of the truth
                    of his theory, urged its publication, continued him in his lectureship, and paid
                    him every honour in their power. Abroad the book was wi lely read and much
                    canvassed. Few accepted the new theory; but no one dreamt of claiming the honour
                    of it for himself, nor for several years did any one pretend that it could be
                    found in the works of previous authors. The first attack on it was a feeble
                    tract by one Primerose, a pupil of Riolanus <hi rend="italic">{Excrc.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">Animadv. in Libr. Harvei de Motu
                    Cord,</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">Sang.,</hi> 1630). Five
                    years later Parisanus, an Italian physician, published his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lapis</hi><hi rend="italic">Lydius</hi><hi rend="italic">de Motu Cord,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">Sang.</hi> (Venice, 1635), a still more
                    bulky and futile performance. Primerose’s attacks were “imbellia pleraque” and
                    “sine ictu ;” that of Parisanus “in quamplurimis turpius,” according to the
                    contemporary judgment of Vessling. Their dulness has protected them from further
                    censure. Caspar Hoffmann, professor at Nuremberg, while admitting the truth of
                    the lesser circulation in the full Harveian sense, denied the rest of the new
                    doctrine. To him the English anatomist replied in a short letter, still extant,
                    with great consideration yet with modest dignity, beseeching him to convince
                    himself by actual inspection of the truth of the facts in question. He
                    concludes—“1 accept your censure in the candid and friendly spirit in which you
                    say you wrote it; do you also the same to me, now that I have answered you in
                    the same spirit.” This letter is dated May 1636, and in that year Harvey passed
                    through Nuremberg with the earl of Arundel, and visited Hoffmann. But he failed
                    to convince him; “nec tamen valuit Harveius vel coram,” writes Schlegel, who,
                    however, afterwards succeeded in persuading the obstinate old Galenist to soften
                    his opposition to the Hew doctrine, and thinks that his complete conversion
                    might have been effected if he had but lived a little longer—“nec dubito quin
                    concessisset tandem in nostra castra.” While in Italy the following year Harvey
                    visited his old university of Padua, and demonstrated his views to Professor
                    Vessling. A few months later this excellent anatomist wrote him a courteous and
                    sensible letter, with certain objections to the new theory. The answer to this
                    has not been preserved, but it convinced his candid opponent, who admitted the
                    truth of the circulation in a second letter (both were published in 1640), and
                    afterwards told a friend, “Harveium nostrum si audis, agnosces coelestem
                    sanguinis et spiritus ingressum ex arteriis per venas in dextrum cordis sinum.”
                    Meanwhile a greater convert, Descartes, in his <hi rend="italic">Discours sur la
                    Méthode</hi> (1637) had announced his adhesion to the new doctrine, and refers
                    to “the English physician to whom belongs the honour of having first shown that
                    the course of the blood in the body is nothing less than a kind of perpetual
                    movement in a circle.” Walaeus of Leyden, Regius of Utrecht, and Schlegel of
                    Hamburg successively adopted the new physiology. Of these professors, Regius was
                    mauled by the pertinacious Primerose and mauled him in return <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Spongiaqua</hi><hi rend="italic">eluuntur sordes</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    convinced than ever, demolished an unlucky Γrofessor Plempius of Louvain, who
                    had written on the other side. Dr George Ent also published an <hi rend="italic"
                    >Apologia pro</hi><hi rend="italic">Circulatione</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Sanguinis</hi> in answer to Parisanus.</p>
                <p>At last Riolan ventured to publish his <hi rend="italic">Enchiridiurn</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Anatomicum</hi> (1648), in which he attacks Harvey’s theory, and
                    proposes one of his own. Riolan had accompanied the queen dowager of France
                    (Maria de’ Medici) on a visit to her daughter at Whitehall, and had there met
                    Harvey and discussed his theory. He was, in the opinion of the judicious Haller,
                    “vir asper et in nuperos suosque coaevos immitis ac nemini parcens, nimis avidus
                    suarum laudum praeco, et se ipso fatente anatomicorum princeps.” Harvey replied
                    to the <hi rend="italic">Enchiridiurn</hi> with perfectly courteous language and
                    perfectly conclusive arguments, in two letters <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Circulatione</hi><hi rend="italic">Sanguinis,</hi> which were
                    published at Cambridge in 1649, and are still well worth reading. He speaks here
                    of the “circuitus sanguinis a me inventus.” Riolan was unconvinced, but lived to
                    see another professor of anatomy appointed in his own university who taught
                    Harvey’s doctrines. Even in Italy, Trullius, professor of anatomy at Rome,
                    expounded the new doctrine in 1651. But the most illustrious converts were
                    Pecquet of Dieppe, the discoverer of the thoracic duct, and of the true course
                    of the lacteal vessels, and Thomas Bartholinus of Copenhagen, in his <hi

                    objections; for, as he candidly stated, “having opened the bodies of a few
                    living dogs, I find that all Harvey’s statements are perfectly true.” Hobbes of
                    Malmesbury could thus say in the preface to hisA7cwtetιiα <hi rend="italic"
                    >PhilosophiaiλxsΛ,</hi> his friend Harvey, ‘‘solus quod sciam, doctrinam novam
                    superata invidia vivens stabilivit.”</p>
                <p>It has been made a reproach to Harvey that he failed to appreciate the importance
                    of the discoveries of the lacteal and lymphatic vessels by Aselli, Pecquet, and
                    Bartholinus. In three letters on the subject, one to Dr Morrison of Paris (1652)
                    and two to Dr Horst of Darmstadt (1655), a correspondent of Bartholin’s, he
                    discusses these observations, and shows himself unconvinced of their accuracy.
                    He writes, however, with great moderation and reasonableness, and excuses
                    himself from investigating the subject further on the score of the infirmities
                    of age; he was then above seventy-four. The following quotation shows the spirit
                    of these letters:—“Laudo equidem summopere Pecqueti aliorumque in indaganda
                    veritate industriam singularem, nec dubito quin multa adhuc in Democriti puteo
                    abscondita sint, a venturi saeculi indefatigabili diligentia expromenda.”
                    Bartholin, though reasonably disappointed in not having Harvey’s concurrence,
                    speaks of him with the utmost respect, and generously says that the glory of
                    discovering the movements of the heart and of the blood was enough for one
                    man.</p>

                    persuaded his friend to publish this book in 1C51. It is between five and six

                    extensive observations,its value is far inferior. The subject was far more
                    abstruse, and in fact inaccessible to proper investigation without the aid of
                    the microscope. And the field was almost untrodden since the days of Aristotle.
                    Fabricius, Harvey’s master, in his work <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Formatione Ovi</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Pulli</hi> (1621 ), had alone preceded him in modern times. Moreover, the
                    seventy-two chapters which form the book lack the coordination so conspicuous in
                    the earlier treatise, and some of them seem almost like detached chapters of a
                    system which was never completed or finally revised.</p>
                <p>Aristotle had believed that the male parent furnished the body of the future
                    embryo, while the female only nourished and formed the seed; this is in fact the
                    theory on which, in the <hi rend="italic">Eurncnidcs</hi> of Aeschylus, Apollo
                    obtains the acquittal of Orestes. Galen taught almost as erroneously that each
                    parent contributes seeds, the union of which produced the young animal. Harvey,
                    after speaking with due honour of Aristotle and Fabricius, begins rightly
                    “abovo”; for, as he remarks, “eggs cost little and are always and everywhere to
                    be had,” and moreover “almost all animals, even those which bring forth their
                    young alive, and man himself, are produced from eggs” (“omnia omnino animalia,
                    etiam vivipara, atque hominem adeo ipsum, ex ovo progigni”). This dictum,
                    usually quoted as “omne vivum ex ovo,” would alone stamp this work as worthy of
                    the discoverer of the circulation of the blood, but it was a prevision of
                    genius, and was not proved to be a fact until Von Baer discovered the mammalian
                    ovum in 1827. Harvey proceeds with a careful anatomical description of the ovary
                    and oviduct of the hen, describes the new-laid egg, and then gives an account of
                    the appearance seen on the successive days of incubation, from the 1st to the
                    6th, the 10th, and the 14th, and lastly describes the process of hatching. He
                    then comments upon and corrects the opinions of Aristotle and Fabricius,
                    declares against spontaneous generation (though in one passage he seems to admit
                    the current doctrine of production of worms by putrefaction as an exception),
                    proves that there is no <hi rend="italic">semenfοemineurn,</hi> that the
                    clialazae of the lien’s egg are not the <hi rend="italic">semen gαlli,</hi> and
                    that both parents contribute to the formation of the <hi rend="italic">egg.</hi>
                    He describes accurately the first appearance of the ovarian ova as mere specks,
                    their assumption of yelk, and afterwards of albumen. In chapter xlv. he
                    describes two methods of production of the embryo from the ovum: one is <hi
                    rend="italic">metamorphosis,</hi> or the direct transformation of pre-existing
                    material, as a worm from an egg, or a butterfly from an <hi rend="italic"
                    >aurelia</hi> (chrysalis); the other is <hi rend="italic">epigenesis,</hi> or
                    development with addition of parts, the true generation observed in all higher
                    animals. Chapters xlvi∙-l. are devoted to the abstruse question of the efficient
                    cause of generation, which, after much discussion of the opinions of Aristotle
                    and of Sennertius, Harvey, refers to the action of both parents as the efficient
                    instruments of the first great cause.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    chick. He states that the <hi rend="italic">punctum saliens</hi> or foetal heart
                    is the first organ to be seen, and explains that the nutrition of the chick is
                    not only effected by yelk conveyed directly into the midgut, as Aristotle
                    taught, but also by absorption from yelk and white by the umbilical
                    (omphalomeseraic) veins; on the fourth day of incubation appear two masses
                    (which he oddly names <hi rend="italic">vermiculus),</hi> one of which develops
                    into three vesicles, to form the cerebrum, cerebellum, and eyes, the other into
                    tbe breastbone and thorax; on the sixth or seventh day come the viscera, and
                    lastly, the feathers and other external parts. Harvey points out how nearly this
                    order of development in the chick agrees with what he had observed in mammalian
                    and particularly in human embryos. He notes the bifid apex of the foetal heart
                    in man and the equal thickness of the ventricles, the soft cartilages which
                    represent the future bones, the large amount of liquor amnii and absence of
                    placenta which characterize the foetus in the third month; in the fourth the
                    position of the testes in the abdomen, and the uterus with its Fallopian tubes
                    resembling the uterus bicornis of the sheep; the large thymus; the caecum, small
                    as in the adult, not forming a second stomach as in the pig, the horse, and the
                    hare; the lobulated kidneys, like those of the seal <hi rend="italic"
                    >(“vikulof</hi> sc. <hi rend="italic">marino)</hi> and porpoise, and the large
                    suprarenal veins, not much smaller than those of the kidneys (li.-lvi.). He
                    failed, however, to trace the connexion of the urachus with the bladder. In the
                    following chapters (lxiii.— lxxii. ) he describes the process of generation in
                    the fallow deer or the roe. After again insisting that all animals arise from
                    ova, that a “conception” is an internal <hi rend="italic">egg</hi> and an egg an
                    extruded conception, he goes on to describe the uterus of the doe, the process
                    of impregnation, and the subsequent development of the foetus and its membranes,
                    the <hi rend="italic">punctum</hi><hi rend="italic">saliens,</hi> the cotyledons
                    of the placenta, and the “uterine milk,” to which Professor Turner has lately
                    recalled attention. The treatise concludes with detached notes on the placenta,
                    parturition, and allied subjects.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Harvey</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">s other Writings and Medical
                    Practice.—</hi> The remaining writings of Harvey which are extant are
                    unimportant. A complete list of them will be found below, together with the
                    titles of those which we know to be lost. Of these the most important were
                    probably that on respiration, and the records of post-mortem examinations. From
                    the following passage <hi rend="italic">{De</hi><hi rend="italic">Partu,</hi> p.
                    550) it seems that he had a notion of respiration being connected rather with
                    the production of animal heat than, as then generally supposed, with the cooling
                    of the blood. “Haec qui diligenter perpenderit, naturamque aeris diligenter
                    introspexerit, facile opinor fatebitur eundem nec refrigerationis gratia nec in
                    pabulum animalibus concedi. Haec autem obiter duntaxat de respiratione diximus,
                    proprio loco de eadem forsitan copiosius disceptaturi.”</p>
                <p>Of Harvey as a practising physician we know very little. Aubrey tell us that “he
                    paid his visits on horseback with a footcloth, his man following on foot, as the
                    fashion then was.” He adds—“Though all of his profession would allow him to be
                    an excellent anatomist, I never heard any that admired his therapeutic way. I
                    knew several practitioners that would not have given threepence for one of his
                    bills” (the apothecaries used to collect physicians’ prescriptions and sell or
                    publish them to their own profit), “and that a man could hardly tell by his bill
                    what he did aim at.” However this may have been,—and rational therapeutics was
                    impossible when the foundation-stone of physiology had only just been laid,— we
                    know that Harvey was an active practitioner, performing such important surgical
                    operations as the removal of a breast, and he turned his obstetric experience to
                    account in his book on generation. Some good practical precepts as to the
                    conduct of labour are quoted by Willoughby, a contemporary. He also took notes
                    of the anatomy of disease; these unfortunately perished with his other
                    manuscripts. Otherwise we might regard him as a forerunner of Morgagni; for
                    Harvey saw that pathology is but a branch of physiology, and like it must depend
                    first on accurate anatomy. He speaks strongly to this purpose in his first
                    epistle to Riolanus: “Sicut enim sanorum et boni habitus corporum dissectio
                    plurimum ad philosophiam et rectam physiologiam facit, ita corporum morbosorum
                    et cachecticorum inspectio potissimum ad patho-logiam philosophicam.” The only
                    specimen we have of his observations in morbid anatomy is his account of the
                    post-mortem examination made by order of the king on the body of the famous
                    Thomas Parr, who died in 1635&gt; at the reputed age of 152. Harvey insists on
                    the value of physiological truths for their own sake, independently of their
                    immediate utility; but he himself gives us an interesting example of the
                    practical application of his theory of the circulation in the cure of a large
                    tumour by tying the arteries which supplied it with blood <hi rend="italic">{De

                    Schlegel are on the circulation; those to Morrison, Horst, and Vlackveld refer
