                    (1805-1865), one of the really great mathematicians of the present century, was
                    born in Dublin, August 4, 1805. His father, who was a solicitor, and his uncle
                    (curate of Trim), migrated from Scotland in youth. A branch of the Scottish
                    family to which they belonged had settled in the north of Ireland in the time of
                    James I., and this fact seems to have given rise to the common impression that
                    Hamilton was an Irishman.</p>
                <p>His genius displayed itself, even in his infancy, at first in the form of a
                    wonderful power of acquiring languages. At the age of seven he had already made
                    very considerable progress in Hebrew, and before he was thirteen he had
                    acquired, under the care of his uncle, who was an extraordinary linguist, almost
                    as many languages as he had years of age. Among these, besides the classical and
                    the modern European languages, were included Persian, Arabic, Hindustani,
                    Sanskrit, and even Malay. But though to the very end of his life he retained
                    much of the singular learning of his childhood and youth, often reading Persian
                    and Arabic in the intervals of sterner pursuits, he had long abandoned them as a
                    study, and employed them merely as a relaxation.</p>
                <p>His mathematical studies seem to have been undertaken and carried to their full
                    development without any assistance whatever, and the result is that his writings
                    belong to no particular “school,” unless indeed we consider them to form, as
                    they are well entitled, to do, a school by themselves. As an arithmetical
                    calculator he was not only wonderfully expert, but he seems to have occasionally
                    found a positive delight in working out to an enormous number of places of
                    decimals the result of some irksome calculation. At the age of twelve he engaged
                    Colburn, the American “calculating boy,” who was then being exhibited as a
                    curiosity in Dublin, and he had not always the worst of the encounter. But, two
                    years before, he had accidentally fallen in with a Latin copy of <hi
                    rend="italic">Euclid,</hi> which he eagerly devoured; and at twelve he attacked
                    Newton’s <hi rend="italic">Arithmetica</hi><hi rend="italic">Universalis.</hi>
                    This was his introduction to modern analysis. He soon commenced to read the <hi
                    rend="italic">Principia,</hi> and at sixteen he had mastered a great part of
                    that work, besides some more modern works on analytical geometry and the
                    differential calculus.</p>
                <p>About this period he was also engaged in preparation for entrance at Trinity
                    College, Dublin, and had therefore to devote a portion of his time to classics.
                    In the summer of 1822, in his seventeenth year, he began a systematic study of
                    Laplace’s <hi rend="italic">Mecanνjue Celeste.</hi> Nothing could be better
                    fitted to call forth such mathematical powers as those of Hamilton; for
                    Laplace’s great work, rich to profusion in analytical processes alike novel and
                    powerful, demands from the most gifted student careful and often laborious
                    study. It was in the successful effort to open this treasure-house that
                    Hamilton’s mind received its final temper. “Dès-lors il commença à marcher
                    seul,” to use the words of the biographer of another great mathematician. From
                    that time he appears to have devoted himself almost wholly to original
                    investigation (so far at least as regards mathematics), though he ever kept
                    himself well acquainted with the progress of science both in Britain and
                    abroad.</p>
                <p>Having detected an important defect in one of Laplace’s demonstrations, he was
                    induced by a friend to write out his remarks, that they might be shown to Dr
                    Brinkley, afterwards bishop of Cloy ne, but who was then royal astronomer for
                    Ireland, and an accomplished mathematician. Brinkley seems at once to have
                    perceived the vast talents of young Hamilton, and to have encouraged him in the
                    kindest manner. He is said to have remarked in 1823 of this lad of
                    eighteen,—“This young man, I do not say <hi rend="italic">will be,</hi> but <hi
                    rend="italic">is,</hi> the first mathematician of his age.”</p>
                <p>Hamilton’s career at college was perhaps unexampled. Amongst a number of
                    competitors of more than ordinary merit, he was first in every subject, and at
                    every examination. His is said to be the only recent case in which a student
                    obtained the honour of an <hi rend="italic">optime</hi> in more than one
                    subject. This distinction had then become very rare, not being given unless the
                    candidate displayed a thorough mastery over his subject. Hamilton received it
                    for Greek <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n441/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0441-0422"/> and for physics. How many more such honours he
                    might have attained it is impossible to say; but he was expected to win both the
                    gold medals at the degree examination, had his career as a student not been cut
                    short by an unprecedented event. This was his appointment to the Andrews
                    professorship of astronomy in the university of Dublin, vacated by Dr Brinkley
                    in 1827. The chair was not exactly offered to him, as has been sometimes
                    asserted, but the electors, having met and talked over the subject, authorized
                    one of their number, who was Hamilton’s personal friend, to urge him to become a
                    candidate, a step which his modesty had prevented him from taking. Thus, when
                    barely twenty-two, he was established at the Dublin Observatory. He was not
                    specially fitted for the post, for although he had a profound acquaintance with
                    theoretical astronomy, he had paid but little attention to the regular work of
                    the practical astronomer. And it must be said that his time was better employed
                    in grand original investigations than it would have been had he spent it in
                    meridian observations made even with the best of instruments,— infinitely better
                    than if he had spent it on those of the observatory, which, however good
                    originally, were then totally unfit for the delicate requirements of modern
                    astronomy. Indeed there can be little doubt that Hamilton was intended by the
                    university authorities who elected him to the professorship of astronomy to
                    spend his time as he best could for the advancement of science, without being
                    tied down to any particular branch. Had he devoted himself to practical
                    astronomy they would assuredly have furnished him with modern instruments and an
                    adequate staff of assistants.</p>
                <p>In 1835, being secretary to the meeting of the British Association which was held
                    that year in Dublin, he waβ knighted by the lord-lieutenant. But far higher
                    honours rapidly succeeded, among which we may merely mention his election in
                    1837 to the president’s chair in the Royal Irish Academy, and the rare and
                    coveted distinction of being made corresponding member of the academy of St
                    Petersburg. These are the few salient points (other, of course, than the epochs
                    of his more important discoveries and inventions presently to be considered) in
                    the uneventful life of this great man. He retained his wonderful faculties
                    unimpaired to the very last, and steadily continued till within a day or two of
                    his death (September 2, 1865) the task (hie <hi rend="italic">Elements of
                    Quaternions)</hi> which had occupied the last six years of his life.</p>
                <p>The germ of his first great discovery was contained in one of those early papers
                    which in 1823 he communicated to Dr Brinkley, by whom, under the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">Caustics,</hi> it was presented in 1824 to the Royal Irish
                    Academy. It was referred as usual to a committee. Their report, while
                    acknowledging the novelty and value of its contents, and the great mathematical
                    skill of its author, recommended that, before being published, it should be
                    still further developed and simplified. During the next three years the paper
                    grew to an immense bulk, principally by the additional details which had been
                    insetted at the desire of the committee. But it also assumed a much more
                    intelligible form, and the grand features of the new method were now easily to
                    be seen. Hamilton himself seems not till this period to have fully ιmderstood
                    either the nature or the importance of his discovery, for it is only now that we
                    find him announcing his intention of applying his method to dynamics. The paper
                    was finally entitled “Theory of Systems of Rays,” and the first part was printed
                    in 1828 in the <hi rend="italic">Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy.</hi>
                    The second and third parts have not yet been printed; but it is understood that
                    their more important contents have appeared in the three voluminous supplements
                    (to the first part) which have been published in the same <hi rend="italic"
                    >Transactions,</hi> and in the two papers “On a General Method in Dynamics,”
                    which appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Philosop)hical Transactions</hi> in
                    1834-5. The principle of “Varying Action” is the great feature of these papers;
                    and it is strange, indeed, that the one particular result of this theory which,
                    perhaps more than anything else that Hamilton has done, has rendered hie name
                    known beyond the little world of true philosophers, should have been easily
                    within the reach of Fresnel and others for many years before, and in no way
                    required Hamilton’s new conceptions or methods, although it was by them that he
                    was led to its discovery. This singular result is still known by the name
                    “Conical Refraction,” which he proposed for it when he first predicted its
                    existence in the third supplement to his <hi rend="italic">Systems of Rays,</hi>
                    read in 1832.</p>
                <p>The step from optics to dynamics in the application of the method of “Varying
                    Action” was made in 1827, and communicated to the Royal Society, in whose <hi
                    rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi> for 1834 and 1835 there are two
                    papers on the subject. These display, like the ‘ ‘ Systems of Rays,” a mastery
                    over symbols and a flow of mathematical language almost unequalled. But they
                    contain what is far more valuable still, the greatest addition which dynamical
                    science had received since the grand strides made by Newton and Lagrange. Jacobi
                    and other mathematicians have developed to a great extent, and as a question of
                    pure mathematics only, Hamilton’s processes, and have thus made extensive
                    additions to our knowledge of differential equations. But there can be little
                    doubt that we have as yet obtained only a mere glimpse of the vast physical
                    results of which they contain the germ. And though this is of course by far the
                    more valuable aspect in which any such contribution to science can be looked at,
                    the other must not be despised. It is characteristic of most of Hamilton’s, as
                    of nearly all great discoveries, that even their indirect consequences are of
                    high value.</p>
                <p>The other great contribution made by Hamilton to mathematical science, the
                    invention of <hi rend="smallcaps">Quaternions,</hi> is fully treated under that
                    heading. It is not necessary to say here more than this, that quaternions form
                    as great an advance relatively to the Cartesian methods as the latter, when
                    first propounded, formed relatively to Euclidian geometry. The following
                    characteristic extract from a letter shows Hamilton’s own opinion of his
                    mathematical work, and also gives a hint of the devices which he employed to
                    render written language as expressive as actual speech. His first great work,
                    <hi rend="italic">Lectures on Quaternions</hi> (Dublin, 1852), is almost painful
                    to read in consequence of the frequent use of italics and capitals.</p>
                <p>“I hope that it may not be considered as unpardonable vanity or presumption on my
                    part, if, as my own taste has always led me to feel a greater interest in <hi
                    rend="italic">methods</hi> than in <hi rend="italic">results,</hi> so it is by
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">methods,</hi> rather than by <hi rend="italic">any</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">theorems,</hi> which <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be separately
                    <hi rend="italic">quoted,</hi> that I desire and hope to be remembered.
                    Nevertheless it is only human nature, to derive <hi rend="italic">some</hi>
                    pleasure from being cited, now and then, even about a ‘ Theorem especially where
                    the</p>
                <p>∙quoter can enrich the subject, by combining it with researches of <hi
                    rend="italic">his own.”</hi></p>
                <p>The discoveries, papers, and treatises we have mentioned might well have formed
                    the whole work of a long and laborious life. But, not to speak of his enormous
                    collection of MS. books, full to overflowing with new and original matter, which
                    have been handed over to Trinity College, Dublin, and of whose contents it is to
                    be hoped a large portion may yet be published, the works we have already called
                    attention to barely form the greater portion of what he has published. His
                    extraordinary investigations connected with the solution of algebraic equations
                    of the fifth degree, and his examination of the results arrived at by Abel,
                    Jerrard, and Badano, in their researches on this subject, form another grand
                    contribution to science. There is next his great paper on <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fluctuating Functions,</hi> a subject which, since the time of Fourier, has
                    been of immense and ever increasing value in physical applications of
                    mathematics. There is also the extremely ingenious invention of the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Hodograph</hi><hi rend="italic">(q. V.</hi>). Of his extensive
                    investigations into the solution (especially by numerical approximation) of
                    certain classes of differential equations which constantly occur in the
                    treatment of physical questions, only a few items have been published, at
                    intervals, in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Magazine.</hi> Besides all
                    this, Hamilton was a voluminous correspondent. Often a single letter of his
                    occupied from fifty to a hundred or more closely written pages, all devoted to
                    the minute consideration of every feature of some particular problem: for it was
                    one of the peculiar characteristics of his mind never to be satisfied with a
                    general understanding of a question; he pursued it until he knew it in all its
                    details. He was ever courteous and kind in answering applications for assistance
                    in the study of his works, even when his compliance must have cost him much
                    valuable time. He was excessively precise and hard to please with reference to
                    the final polish of his own works for publication; and it was probably for this
                    reason that he published so little compared with the extent of his
                    investigations.</p>
                <p>Like most men of great originality, Hamilton generally matured his ideas before
                    putting pen to paper. “He used to carry on,” says his elder son, “long trains of
                    algebraical and arithmetical calculations in his mind, during which he was
                    unconscious of the earthly necessity of eating; we used to bring in a ‘ snack ’
                    and leave it in his study, but a brief nod of recognition of the intrusion of
                    the chop or cutlet was often the only result, and his thoughts went on soaring
                    upwards.”</p>
