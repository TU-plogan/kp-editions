                <p><label type="entry">HARTLEY, <hi rend="smallcaps">David</hi></label> (1705-1757),
                    who may justly be called the founder of the English Association school of
                    psychologists, was born on the 30th August 1705. His father, who was vicar of
                    Armley in Yorkshire, wished him to enter the church; and with this view he was
                    sent at the age of fifteen to Jesus College, Cambridge, where he studied under
                    Saunderson the mathematician, and distinguished himself so much that he was
                    elected a fellow of his college. But his university career so far modified his
                    opinions that, feeling himself no longer able conscientiously to sign the
                    Thirty-nine Articles, he abandoned his first intention and devoted himself to
                    the study of medicine. He, however, remained in the communion of the English
                    Church, living on intimate terms with the most distinguished churchmen of his
                    day, among whom may be named Joseph Butler, Warburton, Law, Hoadley, and the
                    poet Young. Indeed he asserted it to be a duty to obey ecclesiastical a3 well as
                    civil authorities. The doctrine to which he most strongly objected was that of
                    eternal punishment. His keen interest in theology is proved by the fact that he
                    devoted a large part of his <hi rend="italic">Observations</hi> to that subject,
                    the objective side of which he treated upon orthodox lines. The life of Hartley
                    was the useful life of a benevolent and studious physician. He practised at
                    Newark, Bury St Edmunds, London, and lastly at Bath, where he died on the 28th
                    August 1757, within two days of his fifty-second birthday. It was at the age of
                    twenty-five that he commenced the series of essays that was to make up his <hi
                    rend="italic">Observations on Man: his Frame, his Duty, and his
                    Expectations.</hi> The praise of originality cannot be denied him. It is
                    noteworthy, however, that very nearly at the same time with the publication of

                    by Charles Bonnet of Geneva, whose coincidence with Hartley in the most
                    distinctive features of his philosophy is extremely remarkable. But Hartley’s
                    own account of the matter is so straightforward as to command immediate assent.
                    His physical theory, he tells us, was drawn from certain speculations as to
                    nervous action which Newton had published in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Principia.</hi> His psychological theory was suggested by an <hi rend="italic"
                    >Essay on the Fundamental Principle of Virtue or Morality</hi> (written by a
                    clergyman named Gay, and prefixed by Law to his translation of Archbishop King’s
                    Latin work on the <hi rend="italic">Origin of Evil),</hi> the chief object of
                    which was to show that sympathy and conscience are developments by means of
                    association from the selfish feelings. It is greatly to Hartley’s credit that he
                    so frankly owned his obligations to a work so far inferior to his own in
                    completeness and tone of thought..</p>
                <p>The outlines of Hartley’s theory are as follows. With Locke he asserted that,
                    prior to sensation, the human mind is a blank. By a growth from simple
                    sensations those states of consciousness which appear most remote from sensation
                    come into being. And the one law of growth of which Hartley took account was the
                    law of contiguity, synchronous and successive. By this law he sought to explain,
                    not only the phenomena of memory, which others had similarly explained before
                    him, but also the phenomena of emotion, of reasoning, and of voluntary and
                    involuntary action.</p>
                <p>By his physical theory Hartley gave the first strong impulse to the modern study
                    of the intimate connexion of physiological and psychical facts which has proved
                    so fruitful, though his physical theory in itself is inadequate, and has not
                    been largely adopted. He held that sensation is the result of a vibration of the
                    minute particles of the medullary substance of the nerves, to account for which
                    he postulated, with Newton, a subtle elastic ether, rare in the interstices of
                    solid bodies and in their close neighbourhood, and denser as it recedes from
                    them. Pleasure is the result of moderate vibrations, pain of vibrations so
                    violent as to break the continuity of the nerves. These vibrations leave behind
                    them in the brain a tendency to fainter vibrations or “vibratiuncles” of a
                    similar kind, which correspond to “ideas of sensation.” Thus memory is accounted
                    for. The course of reminiscence and of the thoughts generally, when not
                    immediately dependent upon external sensation, is accounted for on the ground
                    that there are always vibrations in the brain on account of its heat and the
                    pulsation of its arteries. What these vibrations shall be is determined by the
                    nature of each man’s past experience, and by the influence of the circumstances
                    of the moment, which causes now one now another tendency to prevail over the
                    rest. Sensations which are often associated together become each associated with
                    the ideas corresponding to the others; and the ideas corresponding to the
                    associated sensations become associated together, sometimes so intimately that
                    they form what appears to be a new simple idea, not without careful analysis
                    resolvable into its component parts.</p>
                <p>Starting, like the modern Associationists, from a detailed account of the
                    phenomena of the senses, Hartley tries to show how, by the above laws, all the
                    emotions, whicK he analyses w ith considerable skill, may be explained. Locke’s
                    incomplete phrase “association of ideas" is employed throughout, “idea” being
                    taken as including every mental state but sensation. He emphatically asserts the
                    existence of pure disinterested sentiment, while declaring it to be a growth
                    from the self-regarding feelings. Voluntary action is explained as the result of
                    a firm connexion between a motion and a sensation or “idea,” and, on the
                    physical side, between an “ideal” and a motory vibration. Therefore in the
                    Freewill controversy<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n530/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0530-0499"/> Hartley took his place as a Determinist. It is
                    singular that, as he tells us, it was only with reluctance, and. when his
                    speculations were nearly complete, that he came to a conclusion on this subject
                    in accordance with his theory.</p>
                <p>Hartley’s theory of reasoning is forced into agreement with the rest of his
                    system. He declares that “assent and dissent, whatever their precise and
                    particular nature may be, must come under the notion of ideas, being only those
                    very complex internal feelings which adhere by association to such clusters of
                    words as are called propositions .... And thus a mathematical proposition is
                    nothing more than a group of ideas united by association,” this group of ideas
                    including “not only the sum of the ideas belonging to the terms of the
                    proposition, but also those which belong to equality, coincidence, and
                    truth.”</p>
                <p>The remaining half of the <hi rend="italic">Observations</hi> is devoted to
                    discussion of theological questions and to practical ethics, and does not call
                    for detailed notice. While emphatically asserting his faith in supernatural
                    religion, in the psychological part of his work he treats, not only conscience,
                    but also the religious emotions entirely as developments from sensation, in the
                    same sense as the pleasures of imagination.</p>
                <p>Clearness, freedom from redundancy, and a severe simplicity and brevity are the
                    best characteristics of his style. “No book,” writes Sir James Mackintosh,
                    “perhaps exists which, with so few of the common allurements, comes at last so
                    much to please by the picture it presents of the writer’s character .... Whoever
                    bestows a careful perusal on the work must be unfortunate if he does not see,
                    feel, and own that the writer was a great philosopher and a good man.” (T. Μ.
