                <p><label type="entry">HABAKKUK</label> (P∙1P3Π), one of the minor prophets of the
                    Old Testament, the eighth in order in the Massoretic text. The name of the
                    prophet is peculiar to him, and occurs only in his own writing (i. 1; iii. 1).
                    As to its meaning there is some uncertainty, but it is probably a formation from
                    a verb signifying <hi rend="italic">to entwine, to embrace</hi><pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n376/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0376-0357"/> (P3∏),and means “embraced” or simply “embrace”
                    (Jerome, <hi rend="italic">Pr.</hi><hi rend="italic">ad Hab.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> Gesenius and Fürst on the word). In the Septuagint and with
                    the Greek fathers it appears in the form of <hi rend="italic">'kpβακovp,</hi>
                    which would seem to indicate that the Hebrew was read and pronounced Habbâkuk
                    (p∙lp3∏), the double <hi rend="italic">b</hi> being changed for the sake of
                    euphony into <hi rend="italic">mb.</hi> The change of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >k</hi> into <hi rend="italic">m</hi> at the end of the word Bleek says is
                    without analogy; but in the change of Beelzebub into Beelzebul we have an
                    analogous instance of the substitution of a liquid for a mute,—probably because
                    to the Greek ear it was not agreeable that a final syllable should begin and end
                    with the same rough consonant. Of the prophet’s personal history nothing is
                    certainly known. In the inscription of his book he is simply called “the
                    prophet”; nor can we with certainty determine at what time he lived, and
                    prophesied. From the use of the word “my” in the subscription to the psιlrn in
                    chap, iii., “To the chief singer on my stringed instrument” (ver. 19), it has
                    been inferred that he was of the tribe of Levi, inasmuch as it is supposed from
                    this that he held a place among those by whom officially the musical service of
                    the temple was conducted, a place which only a Levite, it is alleged, could
                    occupy. But this seems rather too much to build on the mere use of the word
                    “my,” nor is it quite certain that only Levites took part with stringed
                    instruments in the service of song in the temple. King Hezekiah, after his
                    recovery from his sickness, composed a psalm of thanksgiving, and in reference
                    to it he says, “We will sing my songs to the stringed instruments all the days
                    of our life in the house of the Lord ”; for he “had said, What is the sign that
                    I shall go up to the house of the Lord?” (Isa. xxxviii. 20, 22); from which it
                    may be inferred that others besides Levites might take part in the liturgical
                    music of the temple. Were there any truth in the assertion in the additions to
                    Daniel in the Apocrypha that Habakkuk was 3ent by the Lord from Judaea to
                    Babylon with food for Daniel in the lions’ den, this would give us the date of
                    the prophet’s activity; but on such a manifest fiction nothing can be built.
                    According to one tradition the prophet was buried at Keilah in the tribe of
                    Judah; according to another at Hukkok (now Yakuk) in the tribe of Naphtali.</p>
                <p>The book of Habakkuk falls into two parts,—the former of which (chaps, i. and
                    ii.) has the inscription, “The burden which Habakkuk the prophet saw,” and the
                    latter (chap, iii.) the inscription, “Prayer” (or hymn) “of Habakkuk on
                    Shigyonoth.” Both parts have reference to the same subject, the invasion of
                    Judah by the Chaldeans, who are expressly named (i. 6). In both this is regarded
                    as a chastisement from the Lord upon the people for their sins; but whilst in
                    the earlier part the prophet appears as a reprover and denouncer of evil, in the
                    latter he gives utterance to emotions of reverence, confidence, and joy in God
                    as the Saviour of His people. In the former part the prophecy is in the form of
                    a dialogue between Jehovah and the prophet. The prophet, deeply troubled because
                    of the corruption of his people, cries to God and asks how long such a state of
                    things is to continue (i. 2-4); to which God replies in effect that He is about
                    to bring on the sinful nation a heavy calamity by raising against them the
                    Chaldeans—“that bitter and impetuous nation ”—whose fierce and terrible hosts
                    should devastate the land,—at the same time intimating that this scourge should
                    pass away, and that the invaders, though the instruments of God’s vengeance,
                    should not be held guiltless (5-11). The prophet then appeals to God, the
                    Everlasting and Holy One, and asks how the employment ofsuch instruments to
                    inflict punishment on the people of His choice is reconcilable with the divine
                    rectitude and unchangeableness (12-17), but declares that he will stand on his
                    watch-tower that he may learn what God will say to him, hoping that some word of
                    comfort may be vouchsafed to him which he may carry to his people. The word
                    comes; the Lord will not suffer the ungodly, the transgressor, and the idolater
                    to escape; a five-fold woe is denounced against the enemies of God’s people; the
                    just are encouraged to abide in faith, cheered with the assurance that as a
                    result of God’s judgments on the wicked the knowledge of the glory of the Lord
                    shall fill the earth as the waters cover the sea; for God is in His holy temple,
                    His purposes shall stand fast, therefore let all the earth be still and await
                    His coming (ii. 1-20). The latter part of the book is a hymn of praise in which
                    the prophet in his own name and that of the people celebrates the majesty and
                    mighty deeds of the Lord, and gives exulting expression to the confidence and
                    joy with which His true subjects rest in Him (iii. 1-19). This hymn is in form
                    and style like one of the Psalms, and was doubtless intended for use in the
                    temple service. To some it has appeared that· this third chapter is wholly
                    unconnected with the two preceding. But though different in character and style,
                    it stands closely connected in substance with what goes before, and forms with
                    this one whole. In the former part we have the burden which the prophet had to
                    bear to the people; in the latter we have the utterance of the feelings produced
                    by the contemplation of the facts and revelations therein set forth, viewed in
                    the light of God’s manifestations of Himself on behalf of His people in former
                    times.</p>
                <p>This book, which it is generally agreed was written by the prophet himself, forms
                    one of the finest remains of ancient Hebrew literature. In conception and style
                    it is not inferior to any production of the most flourishing age of prophecy.
                    The language is pure, the thought is lofty, and in the construction artistic
                    skill is displayed. With the mantle of the prophet the author bears also the
                    chaplet of the poet.</p>
                <p>At what time Habakkuk prophesied remains uncertain. From i. 5, 6, where the
                    invasion of Israel by the Chaldeans is represented as a thing so strange as to
                    be incredible when announced, it has been inferred that the prophecy was uttered
                    whilst as yet the people of Israel were unacquainted with the Chaldeans as a
                    warlike power,—long, therefore, before the battle of Carchemish (606 B.c.), in
                    which Neeho, king of Egypt, was defeated by Nebuchadnezzar. The date of the
                    prophecy has accordingly by some been relegated to the reign of Manasseh; and
                    this has been supposed to receive confirmation from the fact that during that
                    reign there were prophets who foretold the coming on the nation of a calamity
                    such as that the ears of all who heard of it should tingle (2 Kings xxi. 10#.);
                    and of these prophets Habakkuk may have been one. The words of the prophet,
                    however, do not necessarily imply that at the time he uttered his prophecy the
                    people were so ignorant of the Chaldeans that they could not believe what he was
                    commissioned to announce to them regarding an invasion of the country by that
                    “bitter and hasty” nation; it is rather the immediateness and terribleness of
                    the catastrophe which he represents as what would pass belief, even when
                    announced by a prophet of the Lord. It is further to be observed that his words
                    imply that the calamity be was sent to announce would happen in the days of
                    those to whom he spoke, which could hardly be said of a generation that had
                    reached adult age during the latter half of Manasseh’s reign, that is, fully
                    sixty years before the invasion of Judah by Nebuchadnezzar. It may be added that
                    it is very improbable that during the reign of Manasseh, when idolatry had to
                    such an extent superseded the worship of Jehovah, such a psalm as that of chap.
                    iii. would have been composed for the temple service by anyone living in Judah.
                    A later date, it would thus appear, must be assigned to the prophecy. Vitringa
                    has suggested that it was uttered in the time of Josiah, and this is accepted by
                    Delitzsch and others. To this it has been objected that the state of things
                    described in the beginning of the book does not accord with what we know to have
                    been the state of things in Josiah’s reign, and moreover that the declaration
                    that the calamity threatened should happen in the days of the existing
                    generation does not tally with the assurance given by the prophetess Huldah to
                    King Josiah, that the evil the Lord was about to bring upon Jerusalem should not
                    happen in his day (2 Kings xxii. 15-20). Neither of these objections, however,
                    has much weight. To the former it may be replied that, though in the later part
                    of Josiah’s reign a better state of things than that described by the prophet
                    prevailed, in the early part of it things were probably exactly such as he
                    represents; and to the latter it may be <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n377/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0377-0358"/> replied that the two declarations are not
                    irreconcilable, for though the invasion of the Chaldeans might happen in the
                    time of the existing generation to whom the prophet spoke, it might be not till
                    after the death of Josiah that Jerusalem should be taken; which in point of fact
                    was the case. A more serious objection is that the psalm in chap. iii. could not
                    have been composed in the early part of Josiah’s reign before the reforms which
                    he introduced had been begun, and that the first and second chapters could not
                    have been uttered after these had been inaugurated, because then the state of
                    things there described did not exist. To meet this it has been suggested that
                    the two parts of the book may have been composed at different times, the earlier
                    part in the beginning and the later after the middle of Josiah’s reign. This is
                    possible; but the standpoint of the prophet is in both parts so much the same
                    that it is not probable that any marked interval of time elapsed between the
                    composition of the two. We are, however, so imperfectly acquainted with the
                    minuter details of the history of the times that for aught we can tell there may
                    have been seasons during the reign of Josiah when the good and the evil in the
                    nation were so mixed that a prophet, whilst denouncing the wickedness he saw
                    around him, and threatening a woe on the nation because of it, might yet be
                    inspired by the remembrance of God’s dealings with his people in the past and
                    the hope of better things for the future to give utterance to such a strain of
                    adoration and exultant gladness as the hymn at the close of the book presents;
                    nor is there any reason to doubt that the pious king and such men as Hilkiah the
                    high priest, and those associated with him as “rulers of the house of God” (2
                    Chrom XXXV. 8), would be so in sympathy with the prophet in this that they would
                    readily approve of his psalm being consigned to “the chief singer” to be used in
                    the temple service. An argument in favour of assigning the date of this prophecy
                    to the reign of Josiah has been drawn from the numerous coincidences in
                    sentiment and phraseology between this book and those of Jeremiah and Zephaniah
                    <hi rend="italic">(cf.</hi> Hab. i. 8 with Jer. v. 6, iv. 13, and Zeph. iii. 3;
                    Hab. i. 13 with Jer. xii. 1; Hab. ii. 9 with Jer. xlix. 16; Hab. ii. 13 with
                    Jer. li. 58; Hab. ii. 16 with Jer. xxv. 27; Hab. ii. 20 with Zeph. i. 7, &amp;c.
                    ); and if in these instances Jeremiah and Zephaniah have imitated Habakkuk or
                    quoted from him, the argument must be held conclusive, for both these prophets
                    began to prophesy in the later part of the reign of Josiah. De Wette, Hitzig,
                    Ewald, Bleek, and others assign the prophecy to the reign of Jehoiakim; but for
                    this there seems no good reason. (W. L. A.)</p>
