                <p><label type="entry">HENRY IV</label>. (1425-1475), king of Castile, surnamed eZ
                    <hi rend="italic">Impotente</hi> (the impotent) and sometimes <hi rend="italic"
                    >el Liberal</hi> (the spendthrift), the eldest son of John II. by his first wife
                    Maria of Aragon, was born at Valladolid on January 6, 1425. As prince of
                    Asturias he took a prominent and generally an unfilial part in most of the
                    disturbances of his father’s reign; in 1445 a pitched battle between the king
                    and the prince was prevented only at the last moment by the intervention of the
                    clergy and some of the nobles; and peace was not finally secured until 1450 when
                    Pope Nicholas V. issued his bull of excommunication against all those in the
                    peninsula who, by perplexing the affairs of the sovereign, were disastrously
                    helping the cause of the infidels. In 1440 Henry had in accordance with a treaty
                    signed in 1436 been united to Blanche of Aragon; but this marriage, which had
                    not been happy and which had given cause to many scandalous reports, he
                    dissolved in 1453 shortly before his accession to the throne on his father’s
                    death in July of that year. He began his reign with a great show of energy
                    against the Moors; but the boldness of his intentions contrasted strangely with
                    the feebleness of his execution; and the unsatisfactory character of the results
                    attained tended greatly to bring to a head the discontent which his indolent
                    inattention to home affairs, his reckless extravagance, and the disorders of his
                    private life had not failed to create. In 1465 occurred at Avila the
                    extraordinary scene, so often described, of the king’s deposition in favour of
                    his brother Alphonso; this was followed in 1468, shortly after Alphonso’s death,
                    by the election of his sister Isabella, who, however, declined to accept the
                    proffered crown. In the same year Henry was forced to repudiate his wife Joanna
                    of Portugal and to disinherit her daughter Juana (la Beltraneja) whom he had
                    unsuccessfully attempted to put forward as also his; and thus the succession
                    became fixed in favour of Isabella, who was married to Ferdinand of Aragon in
                    the following year. Henry died at Madrid on December 12, 1474.</p>
