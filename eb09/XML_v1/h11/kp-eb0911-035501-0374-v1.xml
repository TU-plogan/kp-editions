                <p>H has varied in form from the Phoenician and old</p>
                <p>Hebrew symbol 0, called Che th, only by the removal of the upper and lower
                    horizontal lines. (For the oldest forms of the letter see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Alphabet.)</hi> The closed form is sometimes found in old Greek inscriptions,
                    and, though less frequently, in South Italy.</p>
                <p>Its value in Phoenicia was probably a continuous guttural sound—the sound which
                    it had in Hebrew—resembling the German <hi rend="italic">ch,</hi> and with no
                    English counterpart. In Greece it represented nothing more than the spirant <hi
                    rend="italic">h,</hi> so long as a separate symbol to denote that sound was felt
                    to be necessary. Afterwards it was generally employed to denote a second
                    e-sound, under the name of <hi rend="italic">Eta</hi>; probably it had before
                    been called <hi rend="italic">Heta.</hi> The time of this change varied in
                    different parts of Greece. In the alphabet of the island of Thera we find H
                    representing <hi rend="italic">e</hi> as early as the 40th Olympiad, though it
                    still sometimes retained its old value. At Athens the date was 403 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and here the practice did not vary. But in most of
                    the alphabets of Greece proper, of Peloponnesus, and of the Italian colonies, H
                    still remained as the rough breathing; and as such it consequently passed into
                    the Latin alphabet. It is possible that <hi rend="italic">h</hi> in a very few
                    Latin words, when it occurs as a medial sound <hi rend="italic">{e.g.,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">traho, veho),</hi> was a continuous guttural. But generally it
                    occurs at the beginning of a word, and can hardly have been more than a
                    breathing. Even as this it early became evanescent. During the classical period
                    of Latin literature it was retained in the speech of educated men, doubtless in
                    part by Greek influence. But in the popular speech it was rapidly disappearing
                    as an initial sound; although it continued to be written, and indeed was often
                    written wrongly, at the beginning of words where it had no place; <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g., umor</hi> was written <hi rend="italic">humor,</hi> and the
                    <hi rend="italic">h</hi> has held its own in English spelling down to our day.
                    The sound is almost completely lost in modern Italian.</p>
                <p>It is not settled beyond dispute by what mechanism the Λ-sound is produced. The
                    old view (held by Lepsius and others) is that <hi rend="italic">h</hi> has a
                    distinct position of its own, further back in the throat than the gutturals, in
                    fact, immediately above the larynx,—that it is a surd, to which the
                    corresponding sonant is the slight gurgle heard between words of which the first
                    ends and the second begins with the same sound <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> “go
                    over ”), if we take care to close the glottis between the two words but not to
                    alter the position of the other vocal organs. A quite different view is held by
                    Whitney, M. Bell, and others, that <hi rend="italic">h</hi> has no distinct
                    position of its own, but is sounded in or through the position of the following
                    sound; for example, that in saying <hi rend="italic">ha</hi> we do not put the
                    vocal organs into two positions, one for <hi rend="italic">h</hi> and one for
                    <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> but we put them into the position for <hi
                    rend="italic">a,</hi> and then produce the breath and the vowel without any
                    change of position, the <hi rend="italic">h</hi> being a mere expiration of
                    breath through the open glottis; similarly <hi rend="italic">hi, hu,</hi>
                    &amp;c., are produced with the vocal organs in the position for <hi
                    rend="italic">i, u,</hi> &amp;c., respectively; in each case the vocal chords
                    vibrate for the vowel after the expiration of breath, but there is no change
                    made within the orifice of the mouth between the Ä-sound and the vowel. This
                    view is at least a plausible one.</p>
