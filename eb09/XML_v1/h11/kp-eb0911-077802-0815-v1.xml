                <p><label type="entry">HESS</label>. Amongst numerous German artists of this name,
                    the following particularly deserve attention.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Heinrich Maria Hess</hi> —Von Hess, after he received a
                    patent of personal nobility—was born at Düsseldorf in 1798, and brought up to
                    the profession of art by his father, the engraver Karl Ernst Christoph Hess.
                    Karl Hess had already acquired a name when in 1806 the elector of Bavaria,
                    having been raised to a kingship by Napoleon, transferred the Düsseldorf academy
                    and gallery to Munich. Karl Hess accompanied the academy to its new home, and
                    there continued the education of his children. In time Heinrich Hess became
                    sufficiently master of his art to attract the attention of King Maximilian. He
                    was sent with a stipend to Rome, where a copy which he made of Raphael’s
                    Parnassus, and the study of great examples of monumental design, probably caused
                    him to become a painter of ecclesiastical subjects on a large scale. In 1828 he
                    was made professor of painting and director of all the art collections at
                    Munich. He decorated the Aukirche, the Glyptothek, and the Allerheiligencapelle
                    at Munich with frescos; and his cartoons were selected for glass windows in the
                    cathedrals of Cologne and Ratisbon. Then came the great cycle of frescos in the
                    basilica of St Boniface at Munich, <pb break="no"

                    Child enthroned between the four doctors, and receiving the homage of the four
                    patrons of the Munich churches (now in the Pinakothek). His last work, the
                    Lord’s Supper, was found unfinished in his atelier after his death in 1863.
                    Before testing his strength as a composer Heinrich Hess tried genre, an example
                    of which is the Pilgrims entering Rome, now in the Munich Gallery. He also
                    executed portraits, and twice had sittings from Thorwaldsen (Pinakothek and
                    Schack collections). But his fame will rest on the frescos representing scenes
                    from the Old and New Testaments in the Allerheiligencapelle, and the episodes
                    from the life of St Boniface and other German apostles in the basilica of
                    Munich. Here he holds rank second to none but Overbeck in monumental painting,
                    being always true to nature though mindful of the traditions of Christian art,
                    earnest and simple in feeling, yet lifelike and powerful in expression. Through
                    him and his pupils the sentiment of religious art has been preserved and
                    extended in the Munich school, and will not easily die out.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Peter Hess</hi> —afterwards Von Hess—was born at Diisseldorf
                    in 1792, and accompanied his younger brother Heinrich Maria to Munich in 1806.
                    Being of an age to receive vivid impressions, he felt the stirring impulses of
                    the time, and became a painter of skirmishes and battles. In 1813-15 he was
                    allowed to join the staff of General Wrede, who commanded the Bavarians in the
                    military operations which led to the abdication of Napoleon; and there he gained
                    novel experiences of war and a taste for extensive travel. In the course of
                    years he successively visited Austria, Switzerland, and Italy. On Prince Otho’s
                    election to the Greek throne King Louis sent Peter Hess to Athens to gather
                    materials for pictures of the war of liberation. The sketches which he then made
                    were placed, forty in number, in the Pinakothek, after being copied in wax on a
                    large scale (and little to the edification of German feeling) by Nilsen, in the
                    northern arcades of the Hofgarten at Munich. King Otho’s entrance into Nauplia
                    was the subject of a large and crowded canvas now in the Pinako thek, which Hess
                    executed in person. From these, and from battlepieces on a scale of great size
                    in the Royal Palace, as well as from military episodes executed for the czar
                    Nicholas, and the battle of Waterloo now in the Munich Gallery, we gather that
                    Hess was a clever painter of horses. His conception of subject was lifelike, and
                    his drawing invariably correct, but his style is not so congenial to modern
                    taste as that of the painters of touch. He finished almost too carefully with
                    thin medium and pointed tools; and on that account he lacked to a certain extent
                    the boldness of Horace Vernet, to whom he was not unaptly compared. He died
                    suddenly, full of honours, at Munich, in April 1871. Several of his genre
                    pictures, horse hunts, and brigand scenes may be found in the gallery of
                    Munich.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Karl Hess,</hi> the third son of Karl Christoph Hess, born
                    at Düsseldorf in 1801, was also taught by his father, who hoped that he would
                    obtain distinction as an engraver. Karl, however, after engraving one plate
                    after Adrian Ostade, turned to painting under the guidance of Wagenbauer of
                    Munich, and then studied under his elder brother Peter. But historical
                    composition proved to be as contrary to his taste as engraving, and he gave
                    himself exclusively at last to illustrations of peasant life in the hill country
                    of Bavaria. He became clever alike in representing the people, the animals, and
                    the landscape of the Alps, and with constant means of reference to nature in the
                    neighbourhood of Reichenhall, where he at last resided, he never produced
                    anything that was not impressed with the true stamp of a kindly realism. Some of
                    his pictures in the museum of Munich will serve as examples of his manner. He
                    died at Reichenhall on the 16th of November 1874.</p>
