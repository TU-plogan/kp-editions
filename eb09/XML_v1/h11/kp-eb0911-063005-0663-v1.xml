                    from Cuxhaven at the mouth of the Elbe, and about 100 from Hamburg. Though the
                    red cliffs of the Rock Island are most familiar to the voyager entering the
                    Elbe, there are in reality two islets, the second being the Dune or Sand Island,
                    now lying a quarter of a mile east of the main one, though at one time connected
                    with it by <hi rend="italic">de waal,</hi> a neck of land which the sea broke
                    through and destroyed in 1720. The Rock Island is nearly triangular in shape,
                    surrounded on every side by steep cliffs, the only beach being the sandy spit
                    where the landing-place is situated, near the south-east point. On this islet
                    there are some 500 houses, divided into a lower town or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Unterland,</hi> on the spit, and an upper town or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oberland,</hi> situated on the cliff above and connected with the lower town by
                    a wooden stair of 190 steps, the only possible mode of communication between the
                    two sections. The portion of the flat-topped rock not occupied by the houses,
                    the church with graveyard, the Government residencies, and place for a battery,
                    comprises a little pastureland, a few cabbage gardens, potato patches, and a
                    powder magazine at the north end of the rock. About 200 sheep, tethered to
                    particular spots, feed on the scanty herbage, eked out by potato-peelings and
                    halms, cabbage blades, or any other vegetable refuse, which is carried out to
                    them every morning. From one end of the island to the other runs a footpath,
                    called by the Heligolanders the “Land-wae” or High Road, but better known to
                    visitors by the name of “Kartoffel-Allee” (Potato Walk). There is also a
                    lighthouse; but, though a few guns are placed behind a rude earthwork, there are
                    no fortifications except the inaccessible cliffs of the island, and no garrison
                    of any kind unless a few coast-guardsmen be considered as such. The greatest
                    length of the island, which slopes somewhat from west to east, is 5880 feet, and
                    the greatest breadth 1845 feet, its circumference 13,500 feet, its average
                    height 198 feet, and the highest point 216 feet. The Dune or Sand Island is
                    little more than a sand-bank covered with scanty herbage, and imperfectly bound
                    together by bent, grass, and carices. It is only about 200 feet above the sea at
                    its highest point, but the drifting sands and the constant inroads of the sea
                    make the height rather variable. The sea-bathing establishment is situated here;
                    but, with the exception of the restaurant keeper and waiters, and the attendants
                    who drag the bathing-coaches into the sea, there are no residents. A shelving
                    beach of white sand presents excellent facilities for bathing; everything is
                    under strict Government surveillance, the boats in which the bathers cross in
                    the morning, the hours of bathing, and the tariff being all regulated by law.
                    Approached from the sea the Rock Island, with its red-tiled houses perched in a
                    little cluster on the red cliff,—“Am Falm,” as it . is called,—looks very
                    picturesque, and even the narrow brick-paved or sandy lanes of the town are not
                    deficient in a certain degree of quaintness. There are—with the exception of a
                    wheelbarrow and an occasional perambulator—no wheeled carriages in the island,
                    and no horses or other beasts of burden. Even the two cows kept in the Unterland
                    for the use of invalid visitors, and whose milk is sold at the apothecary’s
                    shop, are removed at the end of the bathing season to Cuxhaven, the island not
                    supplying food for both man and beast. Mud is unknown on the streets, the rain
                    only serving to wash their sloping surfaces clean as the scoured floor of the
                    housewives’ kitchens. Most of the houses are built— the lower half at least—of
                    brick, but some are of wood. There are a theatre, a “conversation house,” and a
                    number of hotele and restaurants, though during the season nearly every house is
                    more or less let out to “baadegaster ”— visitors for sea-bathing forming the
                    great source of the islanders’ prosperity. In both the lower and the upper town
                    there are numbers of shops; but the articles for sale seem to be chiefly
                    intended for the summer “bathing guests,” the natives getting most of their
                    supplies from Hamburg or Bremen. The dwellings of the fisher-folk are reasonably
                    clean, and the interiors bear evidence of the seafaring character of the
                    population. Some of the houses have little gardens with flowers, cucumbers,
                    &amp;c., in front of them; and in places protected from the sea breezes there
                    are a few fruit trees. At the foot of “the stair” are one or two lime trees
                    sheltered by the contiguous houses; they are looked upon by the Heligolanders as
                    objects of national pride.</p>
                <p>During the summer from 2000 to 3000 people visit the island for sea-bathing. Most
                    of these are from Hamburg, English or other “guests” being rare. There are no
                    English residents, the officials, the governor excepted, being either natives or
                    Germans; and German, when Frisian is not employed, is the official language,
                    though for form’s sake on the postage stamps English and German words appear in
                    duplicate. The natives speak a dialect of Frisian, barely .intelligible to the
                    other islands of the group. They are perfectly content with the almost perfect
                    autonomy they enjoy under the English Government. There is little emigration,
                    and accordingly the population is slowly increasing. In 1879 the number was a
                    little over 2000. There is regular communication with Bremen and Hamburg in the
                    summer and autumn months, but during the winter the island is often isolated for
                    weeks at a time, owing to tempestuous weather, drift ice, and other causes. It
                    is said that insanity and suicide are in consequence not rare. Epidemic diseases
                    occur, though they do not commonly spread; but scrofula, owing to the poor
                    character of the islanders’ food, attacks three-fourths of the population. In
                    ten years there were 309 deaths—about 15 to the 1000; while during the same
                    period—from 1863 to 1872 inclusive—there were no less than 17 suicides. At one
                    time the population did not exceed 300, and it was only when it increased to
                    over 1000 that the inhabitants had to dispense with the few horses they kept to
                    till their patches of land. This is now done with the spade, and loads are
                    conveyed either in wheelbarrows or in shallow willow baskets.</p>
                <p>The temperature of the Oberland is, owing to its exposure, about l <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 5° lower than that of the Unterland. The following
                    are the means of the months, from a series of observations taken for seven
                    consecutive years at the lighthouse built on the highest point of the
                    island:—January, 31’9° Fahr.; February, 33'9°; March, 35'2°; April, 43’1°; May,

                    48'2°; November, 40'0°; December, 34’3° —the mean temperature of the whole year
                    being 47'2° Fahr.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    The winters are however very stormy, and the air is so laden with salt spray
                    that the rain leaves a delicate deposit of salt after it has evaporated. May and
                    the early part of June are very wet and foggy, so that the first visitors do not
                    arrive until the middle of the latter month.</p>
                <p>The rocks composing the island are of Triassic age, bunter-sandstone, keuper,
                    lias, oolite, muschelkalk, and chalk (now denuded), topped by Pliocene—“the
                    brown tock,” in which are found the scales and teeth mostly of freshwater
                    fishes, freshwater <hi rend="italic">Mollusca,</hi> and fruit and leaves of a

                    >{Stomatophyllum hclgolandicum),</hi> &amp;c. The cliffs are worn into caves,
                    and around the Rock Island are many fantastic arches and^ columns of rock. There
                    is no just ground, however, for believing that the Rock Island was ever much
                    bigger than it is,—the tales of the great size of Heligoland—its numerous
                    churches and villages in early times—being doubtless exaggerated by tradition,
                    while the maps affecting to show its former extension doubtless relate to the
                    Sand Island, which was incontestably much larger in very recent periods, and is
                    now yearly becoming smaller. The natural history presents nothing remarkable.
                    There are no wild animals on it, and the numerous birds which breed in its
                    cliffs, or light on it during their migrations, all belong to the mainland or to
                    the North Sea.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Gätke,

                    are peculiar to it, though there are one or two local varieties. The
                    sandy-bottomed shallow sea supplies abundance of flat fish, and in the deeper
                    water crabs, lobsters, haddock, &amp;c., abound. There are, however, not many
                    fishing-boats, and these of small size. Most of the men act as pilots.</p>
                <p>The trade of the island is insignificant. The only time when it enjoyed any
                    commercial prosperity was during the Napoleonic wars, when, by the “Continental
                    system,” the European ports were supposed to be shut to England. During that
                    period smuggling prospered, and the island was crowded with soldiers and
                    adventurers. In 1878 the revenue was £7236, the expenditure £7548, and the
                    public debt £2115. The imports are mostly from Bremen and Hamburg, those from
                    Britain being valued at only £72; the exports, consisting chiefly of goods
                    bought by visitors, are ladies’ feathers, hats, muffs, fish, &amp;c. The
                    government is vested in a governor appointed by the English crown, aided by a
                    council,—the former mode of government having been more democratic, but less
                    conducive to the islanders’ peace than the present. The taxes are few, and
                    consist chiefly of a duty on wine, beer, and spirits, a small house tax, and the
                    “kur-tax,” levied on all visitors who reside beyond three days. <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The history of
                    Heligoland, “the holy island,” is interesting. “Sunt et aliae insulae contra
                    Friesiam et Daniam, sed nulla earum tam memorabilis,” writes Adam of Bremen.
                    “Multa regna, multas regiones et insulas perlustravi, nec unquam similem huic
                    sacrae vidi,” are the words of Pontanus. Here Hertha <hi rend="superscript">
                    2</hi> had her great temple, and hither came from the mainland the Angles to
                    worship at her shrine. Here lived King Radbod, a pagan, and on this isle St
                    Willebrod, 1200 years ago, first preached Christianity; and for its ownership,
                    before and after that date, many sea-rovers have fought. Finally it settled down
                    to be a fief of the dukes of Schleswig or Holstein, though often in pawn for
                    loans advanced to these impecunious princes by the free city of Hamburg. The
                    island thus happened, in 1807 to be a Danish possession, when the English seized
                    and held it until it was formally ceded to them in 1814. In these days of swift
                    steamers the value of Heligoland as a military position commanding the Elbe
                    mouth has been doubted. There is not, with the exception of wells, the rain
                    collecting in ths ‘ ‘ Sapskulen” or hollows, and that caught in casks, any water
                    on the island, while the shelter afforded by the north and south harbours formed
                    by the sand point on which the Unterland is built is but indifferent. It is only
                    vessels of small size that can approach the shore, and passengers by the
                    steamers have to land in open boats at the end of a long jetty (the
                    Laster-Allee, or “Misery Walk”). Under British rule the islanders enjoy the
                    utmost freedom, and in return for this privilege are subjected to a trifling
                    taxation for local purposes, and escape the compulsory military service to which
                    they would be liable were they to become German or Danish subjects.</p>
