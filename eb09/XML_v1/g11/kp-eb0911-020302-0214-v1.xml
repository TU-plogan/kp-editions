                <p><label type="entry">GRINGOIRE</label>, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Gringon, Pierre
                    (c.</hi> 1480-1544), was the last of the mediaeval poets. He lived to see the
                    old methods which he was taught to believe unchangeable entirely superseded. He
                    was born about the time when King René, the last of the princely <hi
                    rend="italic">trouvères,</hi> died; he finished his career when Marot had
                    already introduced a new and natural <hi rend="italic">genre</hi> which he could
                    not understand, and when Ronsard and Baif were beginning those studies which
                    would interpose a barrier between the old language and the new. It was not to be
                    expected that he should ever fall in with the new movements, or that he should
                    understand the enormous value of the changes which were destined to consign his
                    own works to oblivion.</p>
                <p>The place of his birth is uncertain. Perhaps it was Lorraine, perhaps Normandy.
                    His real name was Gringon, which he changed to Gringoire, for the poetical
                    reason that it sounded better. His early history is almost entirely unknown; at
                    the age of nineteen or twenty he produced his first poem, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Chateau de Labour,</hi> in which he is supposed to
                    have narrated his own experiences. Most probably he did. René, Charles of
                    Orleans, Froissart, Deschamps, all the poets whose works he would study, began
                    with a poetical exposition of their own experiences. There are, in Gringoire’s
                    poem, the personages common to all mediaeval allegories, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Raison, Donne</hi><hi rend="italic">Volonte,</hi><hi rend="italic">Talent de
                    beau faire,</hi> for friends, and <hi rend="italic">Souci, Tromperie,</hi> and
                    the rest, for enemies. Finding that the trade in allegorical poems was ruined
                    for want of demand, and discovering an opening in the direction of mysteries,
                    Gringoire began to produce those dramas, and joined the “Enfants de Sans Souci.”
                    The fraternity advanced him to the dignity of “Mère Sotte,” and afterwards to
                    the highest honour of the guild, that of “Prine o des Sots.” For twenty years
                    Gringoire seems to have been <pb break="no"

                    >confrérie,</hi> writing for them farces, <hi rend="italic">soties,</hi> and
                    satires. In this capacity of dramatist he exercised an extraordinary influence.
                    At no time was the stage, rude and coarse as it was, more popular as a true
                    exponent of the popular mind. Gringoire’s success lay in the fact that he
                    followed, but did not attempt to lead; on his stage the people saw exhibited
                    their passions, their judgments of the moment, their jealousies, their hatreds,
                    and their ambitions. Brotherhoods of the kind existed all over France. In Paris
                    there were the “Enfans Sans Souci,” the “Basochiens,” the “Confrérie de la
                    Passion,” and the “Souverain Empire de Galilée”; at Dijon there were the “Mère
                    Folle” and her family; in Flanders the “Société des Arbalétriers” played
                    comedies; at Rouen the “Cornards” or “Conards” yielded to none in vigour and
                    fearlessness of satire. There is every reason, therefore, to believe that
                    Gringoire enjoyed considerable distinction as the leading spirit among the
                    satirists of the capital. He adopted for his device, <hi rend="italic">Tout
                    par</hi><hi rend="italic">Raison,</hi><hi rend="italic">Raison par Tout, Par
                    tout Raison.</hi> He has been called the “Aristophanes des Halles.” In one
                    respect at least he resembles Aristophanes. He is serious in his merriment;
                    there is purpose behind his extravagancies. Among his principal works are <hi
                    rend="italic">Les Falles</hi><hi rend="italic">Enterprises</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Les Abus du Monde,—</hi> poems in which everything under the sun
                    is criticized,— certain political pieces, such as <hi rend="italic">La Chasse du
                    Cerf des Cerfs {Serf des Serfs, i.e.,</hi><hi rend="italic">servus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">servorum),</hi> under which title that of the pope is thinly
                    veiled, and <hi rend="italic">La Mère Sotte,</hi> with all her literary
                    offspring. During the last twenty years of a long life he became orthodox, and
                    contributed the <hi rend="italic">Blason</hi><hi rend="italic">des
                    Hereticques</hi> to orthodox literature. It was during this period also that he
                    wrote the work by which he is best known, the <hi rend="italic">Mystère</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de la Vie de Saint Louis,</hi> of which an analysis may be found
                    in M. Leroy's <hi rend="italic">Etudes</hi><hi rend="italic">sur les
                    Mystères.</hi> After more than 300 years of oblivion this poet has been
                    republished, not so much on account of his own merits as because of the position
                    which he occupies in the history of dramatic literature.</p>
