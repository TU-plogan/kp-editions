                <p><label type="entry">GUBBIO</label>, a city of Italy, in the province of Umbria,
                    about 20 miles N. of Perugio. Built along the western ledges of Monte Calvo, it
                    shares alike in the grandeur of the mountains and the beauty of the plain, and
                    its churches and palaces are brought into relief by the varying elevation of the
                    site. Its ancient walls are still retained, and a certain mediaeval impress
                    lingers about the place. Besides the cathedral of SS. Mariano and Giacomo, which
                    consists of a small single nave and has a fine wheel window, San Francisco may
                    be mentioned for the sake of the Conception by Fr. Signorelli, S. Agostino for a
                    Madonna del Soccorso by Ottaviano Nelli, and S. Maria Nova with the same
                    artist’s finest work—a votive fresco. Portions still remain of the old palace of
                    the dukes of Urbino, built for Federigo by Luciano Lauranna. The palazzo
                    municipale or del commune is a fine building erected between 1332 and 1346 after
                    the designs of Matteo Giovanello, surnamed Gattapone.</p>

                <p>Like Urbino and Faenza, Gubbio was formerly noted for its majolica, and it was
                    Maestro Giorgio of Gubbio who rediscovered the ruby glazing for which this ware
                    is remarkable. The manufacture has been resumed in modern times. In the
                    neighbourhood of the town there is a great reservoir, La Bottacione, capable of
                    containing 4,720,000 cubic feet of water. The population in 1871 was 5343 in the
                    town and 22,757 in the commune. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Eugubine
                    Tables.</hi></p>
                <p>The ancient Umbrian city of <hi rend="italic">Ikuvio,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Iguvium,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Eugubium</hi> occupied a site a little
                    further out in the plain, to the left of the Via Flaminia. There is no mention
                    of it in Roman history till the time of its subjugation. It was the place
                    selected by the senate for the detention of the Illyrian king Gentius and his
                    sons, and it was an important post in the wars betweeen Caesar and Pompey. The
                    site is still marked by ruins, among which are those of the theatre discovered
                    in 1789 by Ranghiasci <hi rend="italic">(Discoprimento,</hi> Perugia, 1790), and
                    further explored in 1863 <hi rend="italic">{Boll, dell’</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Institut.</hi><hi rend="italic">dicorr. arch.,</hi> tom. xii.). It is also
                    known that the town possessed temples to Diana, to Vesta, to Janus, to Pallas,
                    and to the Sun and Apollo; and about 8 miles to the north was the celebrated
                    temple of the Apennine Jove. The modern city was raised from the decay into
                    which it had fallen by Otto the Great, whose charter may be seen in Reposati’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Della Zecca di Gubbio,</hi> Bologna, 1773. In 1155 it was
                    besieged by Frederick Barbarossa, but was saved by the intercession of St
                    Ubaldo. The temporal government of the town, which had previously been in the
                    hands of the papal legate, the bishop, or the prior of the cathedral, was then
                    placed by the emperor in the hands of the people. The first podesta appears in
                    1163. During the 14th century the prosperity of Gubbio was greatly advanced; it
                    obtained jurisdiction over 130 castles, had great influence over the
                    neighbouring cities, and possessed about 30,000 inhabitants. In 1384 it
                    surrendered to Montefeltro, and thus became incorporated with the duchy of
                    Urbino. An account of the school of painting which flourished in Gubbio in the
                    15th century is given by Ranghiasci Sebastiani in vol. iv. of the Siena edition
                    of Vasari, and by Amico Ricci in his <hi rend="italic">Memorie di belle arti in
                    Gubbio,</hi> Bologna, 1831. Reference may also be made to <hi rend="italic"
