                    (1616-1664), German poet, was born at Grossglogau, Silesia, on the 11th of
                    October, 1616. His youth fell in the period of the Thirty Years’ War, which
                    began in 1618, when he was two years old. After spending five years at school in
                    various towns, he returned to his native place in 1636, and became tutor in the
                    family of Palsgrave George von Schönborn, who crowned him laureate and granted
                    him a patent of nobility. In 1638 he went to the university of Leyden, where he
                    spent six years, at first as a student, afterwards as a tutor. Having travelled
                    through France and Italy in association with a young Pomeranian, and lived a
                    year in Strasburg, he went back to Silesia, and in 1650, at the age of
                    thirty-four, was made syndic of the principality of Glogau. This office, the
                    duties of which he faithfully discharged, he held till his death in 1664. He was
                    a man of deeply melancholy <pb break="no"

                    fostered both by private misfortune and by the terrible public calamities of his
                    age. Like most German writers in the first half of the 17th century, he was
                    profoundly influenced by the critical doctrines of Opitz, on which account he is
                    usually classed with the first Silesian school, although by some of his
                    characteristics he is more closely allied to the second Silesian school. His
                    best works are his comedies, one of which, <hi rend="italic">Peter Squenz,</hi>
                    is based on the comic episode of <hi rend="italic">A Midsummer Night's Dream.

                    of natural simplicity and grace, and still ranks high among the comparatively
                    small number of genuine comedies of which German literature can boast. <hi
                    rend="italic">Horribiliscribrifax</hi> is a rather laboured attack on pedantry.
                    Besides these three comedies, Gryphius wrote five tragedies. In all of them his
                    tendency is to become wild and bombastic, but he had the merit of at least
                    attempting to work out artistically conceived plans, and there are occasional
                    flashes both of passion and of imagination. His models seem to have been Seneca,
                    and the great Dutch poet Vondel. He had the courage, in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Carolus Stuardus,</hi> to deal with events of his own day; his other tragedies
                    are <hi rend="italic">Leo</hi><hi rend="italic">Arminius,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Katharina</hi><hi rend="italic">von Georgien,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Cardenio</hi><hi rend="italic">und</hi><hi rend="italic">Celinda,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Pampiηianus.</hi> The lyrics of Gryphius give utterance to his
                    despairing views of life, and are not without power; but it is as a dramatist
                    that he is mainly important. No German dramatic writer before him had risen to
                    so high a level, nor had he worthy successors until about the middle of the 18th
                    century. A selection from his lyrics will be found in W. Muller’s <hi
