                <p><label type="entry">GRADUATION</label> is the name given to the art of dividing
                    straight scales, circular arcs, or whole circumferences into any required number
                    of equal parts. It is the most important aud difficult part of the work of the
                    mathematical instrument maker, and is required in the construction of most
                    physical, astronomical, nautical, and surveying instruments, such as thermometer
                    scales, linear measuring instruments, quadrants, sextants, mural circles,
                    theodolites, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The art was, undoubtedly, first practised by clockmakers for cutting the teeth of
                    their wheels at regular intervals; but so long as it was confined to them, no
                    particular delicacy or accurate nicety in its performance was required. This
                    only arose when astronomy began to be seriously studied, and the exact position
                    of the heavenly bodies to be determined, which created the necessity for
                    strictly accurate means of measuring linear and angular magnitude. Then
                    graduation began to be looked upon as an art which required special talents and
                    training, and hence we find that all the best artists have spent their best
                    efforts on the perfecting of astronomical instruments. Of these may be named
                    Abraham Sharp, Bird, Smeaton, Ramsden, the Due de Chaulnes, John and Edward
                    Troughton, Simms, and Ross.</p>
                <p>It is obvious that the first graduated instrument must have been done by the hand
                    and eye alone, whether it was in the form of a straight-edge with equal
                    divisions, or a screw, or a divided plate; but, once in the possession of one
                    such divided instrument, it was a comparatively easy matter to employ it as a
                    standard, and copy its divisions on any other article that might be desired.
                    Hence graduation naturally divides itself into two distinct branches, <hi
                    rend="italic">original graduation</hi> and <hi rend="italic">copying,</hi> which
                    latter may be done either by the hand or by a machine called a dividing engine.
                    We may thus speak of graduation under the three heads of <hi rend="italic"
                    >original graduation, copying,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">machine
                    graduation.</hi><hi rend="italic">Original Graduation.—</hi> This is by far the
                    most difficult part of the art—so difficult, indeed, and requiring such accuracy
                    of hand and eye, that but few in any generation have been completely competent,
                    for the task. The earlier astronomers graduated their own instruments, and, from
                    the examples that have come down to us, it must have been very roughly done as
                    compared with modern work.</p>
                <p>In regard to the graduation of straight scales, we have, by elementary geometry,
                    the means, theoretically, of dividing a straight line into any number of equal
                    parts; but the practical carrying out of the geometrical construction is so
                    beset with difficulties as to render the method untrustworthy. This method,
                    which employs the common diagonal scale, was used in dividing a quadrant of 3
                    feet radius, which belonged to Napier of Merchiston, and which only read to
                    minutes—a result, say Thomson and Tait <hi rend="italic">{Nat. Γhilf</hi><hi

                    attainable by the pocket sextants of Troughton and Simms, the radius of whose
                    arc is little more than an inch.”</p>
                <p>The original graduation of a straight line is, in practice, done either by the
                    method of continual bisection or by stepping. In continual bisection the entire
                    length of the line is first laid down. Then, as nearly as possible, half that
                    distance is taken in the beam-compass and marked off by faint arcs from each end
                    of the line. Should these marks coincide the exact middle point of the liue is
                    obtained. If not, as will almost always be the case, the distance between the
                    marks is carefully bisected by hand with the aid of a magnifying glass. The same
                    process is again applied to the halves thus obtained, and so on in succession,
                    dividing the line into parts represented by 2, 4, 8, 16, &lt;fcc., till the
                    desired divisions are reached. In the method of stepping the smallest division
                    required is first taken, as accurately as possible, by spring dividers, and that
                    distance is then laid off, by successive steps, from one end of the line. It is
                    evident that, in this method, any error at starting will be <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n37/mode/1up"

                    division. Errors so made are usually adjusted by the dots being put either back
                    or forward a little by means of the dividing punch guided by a magnifying glass.
                    This is an extremely tedious process, as the dots, when so altered several
                    times, are apt to get insufferably large and shapeless.</p>
                <p>The division of circular arcs is essentially the same in principle as the
                    graduation of straight lines, and of this we shall now give some examples.</p>
                <p>The first example of note is the 8-feet mural circle which was graduated by
                    Graham for the National Observatory in 1725. In this two concentric arcs of
                    radii 96’85 and 95’8 inches respectively were first described by the
                    beam-compass. On the inner of these the arc of 90° was to be divided into
                    degrees and 12th parts of a degree, while the same on the outer was to be
                    divided into 96 equal parts, and these again into 16th parts. The reason for
                    adopting the latter was that, 96 and 16 being both powers of 2, the divisions
                    could be got at by continual bisection alone, which, in Graham’s opinion, who
                    first employed it, is the only accurate method, and would thus serve as a check
                    upon the accuracy of the divisions of the outer arc. With the same distance on
                    the beam-compass as w⅛s used to describe the inner arc, laid off from 0°, the
                    point 60° was at once determined. With the points 0° and 60° as centres
                    successively, and a distance on the beam-compass very nearly bisecting the arc
                    of 60°, two slight marks were made on the arc; the distance between these marks
                    was carefully divided by the hand aided by a lens, and this gave the point 30°.
                    The chord of 60° laid off from the point 30° gave the point 90°, and the
                    quadrant was now divided into three equal parts. Each of these parts was
                    similarly bisected, and the resulting divisions again trisected, giving 18 parts
                    of 5° each. Each of these quinquesected gave degrees, the 12th parts of which
                    were arrived at by bisecting and trisecting as before. The outer arc was divided
                    by continual bisection alone, and a table was constructed by which the readings
                    of the one arc could be converted into those of the other. After the dots
                    indicating the required divisions were obtained, either straight strokes all
                    directed towards the centre were drawn through them by the dividing knife, or
                    sometimes small arcs were drawn through them by the beam-compass having its
                    fixed point somewhere on the line which was a tangent to the quadrantal arc at
                    the point where a division was to be marked.</p>
                <p>The next important example of graduation was done by Bird in 1767. His quadrant,
                    which was also 8 feet radius, was divided Into degrees and 12th parts of a
                    degree. He employed the method of continual bisection aided by chords taken from
                    an exact scale of equal parts, which could read to ’ 001 of an inch, and which
                    he had previously graduated by continual bisections. With the beamcompass an arc
                    of radius 95 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 938 inches was first drawn. From
                    this radius the chords of 30°, 15°, 10° 20', 4° 40', and 42° 40'were computed,
                    and each of them by means of the scale of equal parts laid off on a separate
                    beam-compass to be ready. The radius laid off from 0° gave the point 60°; by the
                    chord of 30° the arc of 60° was bisected; from the point 30° the radius laid off
                    gave the point 90°; the chord of 15° laid off backwards from 90° gave the point
                    75°; from 75° was laid off forwards the chord of 10° 20'; and from 90° was laid
                    off backwards the chord of 4° 40'; and these were found to coincide in the point
                    85° 20'. Now 85° 20' being=5' × 1024 = 5' × 2 <hi rend="superscript"> 10</hi>,
                    the final divisions of 85° 20' were found by continual bisections. For the
                    remainder of the quadrant beyond 85° 20', containing 56 divisions of 5' each,
                    the chord of 64 such divisions was laid off from the point 85’ 40', and the
                    corresponding arc divided by continual bisections as before. There was thus a
                    severe check upon the accuracy of the points already found, viz., 15°, 30°, 60°,
                    75°, 90°, which, however, were found to coincide with the corresponding points
                    obtained by continual bisections. The short lines through the dots were drawn in
                    the way already mentioned.</p>
                <p>The next eminent artists in original graduation are the brothers John and Edward
                    Troughton. The former was the first to devise a rneansmf graduating the quadrant
                    by continual bisection without the aid of such a scale of equal parts as was
                    used by Bird. His method was as follows :—The radius of the quadrant laid off
                    from 0’ gave the point 60°. This arc bisected and the half laid off from 60°
                    gave the point 90°. The arc between 60° and 90° bisected gave 75°; the arc
                    between 75° and 90° bisected gave the point 82° 30', and the arc between 82° 30'
                    and 90° bisected gave the point 86° 15'. Further, the arc between 82° 30' and
                    86° 15' trisected, and two-thirds of it taken beyond 82° 30', gave the point
                    85°, while the arc between 85° and 86° 15' also trisected, and one-third part
                    laid off beyond 85°, gave the point 85° 25' lΛstly, the arc between 85° and 85°
                    25' being quinquesected, and four-fifths taken beyond 85°, gave 85° 20', which
                    as before is = 5' × 2 <hi rend="superscript"> 10</hi>, and so can be finally
                    divided by continual bisection.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Edward Troughton’s Method.—</hi> The method of original
                    graduation discovered by Edward Troughton is fully described in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi> for 1809, as employed by himself
                    to divide a meridian circlé of 4 feet radius. The circle was first accurately
                    turned both on its face and its inner and outer edges. A roller was next
                    provided, of such diameter that it revolved 16 times on its own axis while made
                    to roll once round the outer edge of the circle. This roller, made movable on
                    pivots, was attached to a frame-work, which could be slid freely, yet tightly,
                    along the circle, the roller meanwhile revolving, by means of frictional
                    contact, on the outer edge. The roller was also, after having been properly
                    adjusted as to size, divided as accurately as possible into 16 equal parts
                    bylines parallel to its axis. While the frame carrying the roller was moved once
                    round along the circle, the points of contact of the roller-divisions with the
                    circle were accurately observed by two microscopes attached to the frame, one of
                    which (which we shall call H) commanded the ring on the circle near its edge,
                    which was to receive the divisions, and the other viewed the rollerdivisions.
                    The exact points of contact thus ascertained were marked with faint dots, and
                    the meridian circle thereby divided into 256 very nearly equal parts.</p>
                <p>The next part of the operation was to find out and tabulate the errors of these
                    dots, which are called <hi rend="italic">apparent</hi> errors, in consequence of
                    the error of each dot being ascertained on the supposition of its neighbours
                    being all correct. For this purpose two microscopes (which we shall call A and
                    B) were taken, with cross wires and micrometer adjustments, consisting of a
                    screw and head divided into 100 divisions, 50 of which read in the one and 50 in
                    the opposite direction. These microscopes, A and B, were fixed so that their
                    cross-wires respectively bisected the dots 0 and 128, which were supposed to be
                    diametrically opposite. The circle was now turned half-way round on its axis, so
                    that dot 128 coincided with the wire of A, and, should dot 0 be found to
                    coincide with B, then the two dots were sure to be 180° apart. If not, the cross
                    wire of B was moved till it coincided with dot 0, and the number of divisions of
                    the micrometer head noted. Half this number gave clearly the error of dot 128,
                    and it was tabulated + or - according as the arcual distance between 0 and 128
                    was found to exceed or fall short of the remaining part of the circumference.
                    The microscope B was now shifted, A remaining opposite dot 0 as before, till its
                    wire bisected dot 64, and, by giving the circle one quarter of a turn on its
                    axis, the difference of the arcs between dots 0 and 64 and between 64 and 128
                    was obtained. The half of this difference gave the apparent error of dot 64,
                    which was tabulated with its proper sign. With the microscope A still in the
                    same position the error of dot 192 was obtained, and in the same way by shifting
                    B to dot 32 the errors of dots 32, 96, 160, and 224 were successively
                    ascertained. By proceeding in this way the apparent errors of all the 256 dots
                    were tabulated.</p>
                <p>From this table of apparent errors a table of real errors was drawn up by
                    employing the following formula :—</p>
                <p>⅜(α <hi rend="subscript"> α</hi> + z <hi rend="subscript"> e</hi>) + z=the real
                    error of dot <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> where <hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> a</hi> is the real error of dot <hi rend="italic">a,
                    x</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> c</hi> the real error of dot c, and <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> the apparent error of dot <hi rend="italic">b</hi> midway
                    between <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> Thus having got
                    the real errors of any two dots, the table of apparent errors gives the means of
                    finding the real errors of all the other dots.</p>
                <p>The above formula is easily derived as follows :—</p>
                <p>Let <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">c</hi> be the number of
                    micrometer divisions from 0 to dots <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">c</hi> respectively; and let <hi rend="italic">b</hi> be the
                    number of similar divisions from 0 to the point <hi rend="italic">b,</hi>
                    supposed to be midway between <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and c. Also let <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> a</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >x</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> c</hi> be the real errors of dots <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> and c, and <hi rend="italic">z</hi> the apparent error of
                    <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> Then we have <hi rend="italic">z - b - a -</hi> J (c -
                    α) = <hi rend="italic">b</hi>- ⅜(a + c).</p>
                <p>Now the real positions of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">c</hi>
                    are <hi rend="italic">a-x</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> a</hi> and <hi

                <p>Therefore the real position of <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> the point midway between
                    <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and and <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> is <hi rend="italic"

                <p>= 4(α + c)-⅛(z <hi rend="subscript"> α</hi> + a⅛).</p>
                <p>Therefore the real error of <hi rend="italic">b</hi><hi rend="italic">= b-</hi>
                    real position of <hi rend="italic">b</hi></p>
                <p>= δ - 4 (α + c) + ⅜(ic <hi rend="subscript"> α</hi> + αr <hi rend="subscript">
                    c</hi>)=a + ⅛ (a;« + ¾)∙</p>
                <p>Having obtained the 256 dots and their real errors, the third and last part of
                    Troughton’s process was to employ them to cut the final divisions of the circle,
                    which were to be spaces of 5' each. Now the mean interval between any two dots
                    is = 5' × 16j, 256</p>
                <p>and hence, in the final division, this interval must be divided into 16∣ equal
                    parts. In order to accomplish this a small instrument, called a subdividing
                    sector, was provided. It was formed of thin brass and had a radius about four
                    times that of the roller, but made adjustable as to length. The sector was
                    placed concentrically on the axis, and rested on the upper end of the roller. It
                    turned by frictional adhesion along with the roller, but at the same time was
                    sufficiently loose to allow of its being moved back by hand to any position
                    without affecting the roller. Now it is evident that, while the roller passes
                    over an augular space equal to the mean interval <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n38/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0038-0029"/> between two dots, any point of the sector must
                    pass over 16 times that interval, that is to say, over an angle represented
                    by</p>
                <p>× 16 = 22° 30'. Tlιis interval was therefore divided by I65, and 256</p>
                <p>a space equal to 16 of the parts taken. This was laid off on the arc of the
                    sector and carefully divided into 16 equal parts, each equal to l <hi
                    rend="superscript"> o</hi> 20'; and, in order to provide for the necessary ⅞ths
                    of a division, there was laid off at each end of the sector, and beyond the 16
                    equal parts, two of these parts each subdivided into 8 equal parts. A microscope
                    with cross wires, which we shall call I was placed on the main frame, so as to
                    command a view of the sector divisions, just as the microscope H viewed the
                    final divisions of the circle. Before the first or zero mark was cut, the zero
                    of the sector was brought under I and then the division cut at the point on the
                    circle indicated by H, which also coincided with the dot 0. The frame was then
                    slipped along the circle by the slow screw motion provided for the purpose, till
                    the first sector-division, by the action of the roller, was brought under I. The
                    second mark was then cut on the circle at the point indicated by H. That the
                    marks thus obtained are 5' apart, as they should be, is evident when we reflect
                    that the distance between them must be ⅛th of a division on the section which by
                    construction is 1° 20'. By proceeding in this way the first 16 divisions were
                    cut; but before cutting the 17th it was necessary to adjust the micrometer wires
                    of H to the real error of dot 1, as indicated by the table, and bring back the
                    sector, not to zero, but to ∣th short of zero. Starting from this position the
                    divisions between dots 1 and 2 were next filled in, and then H was adjusted to
                    the real error of dot 2, and the sector brought back to its proper division
                    before commencing the third course. By proceeding in this manner through the
                    whole circle, the microscope H was finally found with its wire at zero, and the
                    sector with its 16th division under its microscope indicating that the circle
                    had been accurately divided.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Copying.—</hi> In graduation by copying the first requisite is
                    a pattern, which must be either an accurately divided straight scale, or an
                    accurately divided circle, commonly called a <hi rend="italic">dividing
                    plate.</hi></p>
                <p>In copying a straight scale the pattern and scale to be divided, usually called
                    the work, are first fixed side by side, with their upper faces in the same
                    plane. The dividing square, which closely resembles an ordinary joiner’s square,
                    is then laid across both, and the point of the dividing knife dropped into the
                    zero division of the pattern. The square is now moved up close to the point of
                    the knife; and, while it is held firmly in this position by the left hand, the
                    first division on the work is made by drawing the knife along the edge of the
                    square with the right hand. Great care must be taken that the knife is held
                    exactly in the same position in cutting the division and in setting the
                    square.</p>
                <p>It frequently happens that the divisions required on a scale are either greater
                    or less than those on the pattern. To meet this case, and still use the same
                    pattern, the work must be fixed at a certain angle of inclination with the
                    pattern. This angle is easily found in the following way. Take the exact ratio
                    of a division on the pattern to the required division on the scale. Call this
                    ratio α. Then, if the required divisions are longer than those of the pattern,
                    the angle is co3 <hi rend="superscript"> -1</hi> α, but, if shorter, the angle
                    is sec <hi rend="superscript"> -1</hi> α. In the former case two operations are
                    required before the divisions are cut: first, the square is laid on the pattern,
                    and the corresponding divisions merely notched very faintly on the edge of the
                    work; and, secondly, the square is applied to the work and the final divisions
                    drawn opposite each faint notch. In the second case, that is, when the angle is
                    sec^ <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> α, the dividing square is applied to the
                    work, and the divisions cut when the edge of the square coincides with the end
                    of each division on the pattern.</p>
                <p>In copying circles use is made of the dividing plate. This is a circular plate of
                    brass, of 36 inches or more in diameter, carefully graduated near its outer
                    edge. It is turned quite flat, and has a steel pin fixed exactly in its centre,
                    and at right angles to its plane. For guiding the dividing knife an instrument
                    called an index is employed, This consists of a straight bar of thin steel of
                    length equal to the radius of the plate. A piece of metal, having a V notch with
                    its angle a right angle, is riveted to one end of the bar in such a position
                    that the vertex of the notch is exactly in a line with the edge of the steel
                    bar. In this way, when the index is laid on the plate, with the notch grasping
                    the central pin, the straight edge of the steel bar lies exactly along a radius.
                    The work to be graduated is laid flat on the dividing plate, and fixed by two
                    clamps in a position exactly concentric with it. The index is now laid on, with
                    its edge coinciding with any required division on the dividing plate, and the
                    corresponding division on the work is cut by drawing the dividing knife along
                    the straight edge of the index.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Machine Graduation.—</hi> The first dividing engine was
                    probably that of Henry Hindley of York, constructed in 1740, and used for the
                    most part by him for cutting the teeth of clock wheels. This was followed
                    shortly after by an engine devised by the Due de Chaulnes; but the first engine
                    which obtained distinct notoriety was that made by Ramsden, of which an account
                    was published by the Board of Longitude in 1777. He was rewarded by that board
                    with a sum of £300, and a further sum of £315 was given to him on condition that
                    he would divide, at a certain fixed rate, the instruments of other makers. The
                    essential principles of Ramsden’s machine have been repeated in almost all
                    succeeding engines for dividing circles, and it will be well, therefore, to give
                    a brief description of it.</p>
                <p>It consisted of a large brass plate 45 inches in diameter, carefully turned, and
                    movable on a vertical axis. The edge of the plate was ratched with 2160 teeth,
                    into which a tangent screw worked, by means of which the plate could be made to
                    turn through any required angle. Thus six turns of the screw moved the plate
                    through 1°, and ∙ <hi rend="subscript"> δ</hi> ⅛th of a turn through - <hi
                    rend="subscript"> s</hi> ⅜ <hi rend="subscript"> σ</hi> th of a degree. On the
                    axis of the tangent screw was placed a cylinder having a spiral groove cut on
                    its surface. A ratchet-wheel containing 60 teeth was attached to this cylinder,
                    and was so arranged that, when the cylinder moved in one direction, it carried
                    the tangent screw with it, and so turned the plate, but when it moved in the
                    opposite direction, it left the tangent screw, and with it the plate,
                    stationary. Round the spiral groove of the cylinder a catgut band was wound, one
                    end of which was attached to a treadle and the other to a counterpoise weight.
                    When the treadle was depressed the tangent screw turned round, and when the
                    pressure was removed it returned, in obedience to the weight, to its former
                    position without affecting the screw. Provision was also made whereby certain
                    stops could be placed in the way of the screw, which only allowed it the
                    requisite amount of turning according to the graduation required. The work to be
                    divided was firmly fixed on the plate, and made concentric with it. The
                    divisions were cut, while the screw was stationary, by means of a dividing knife
                    attached to a swing frame, which allowed it to have only a radial motion. In
                    this way the artist could divide very rapidly by alternately depressing the
                    treadle and working the dividing knife.</p>
                <p>Ramsden also constructed a linear dividing engine on essentially the same
                    principle. If we imagine the rim of the circular plate with its notches
                    stretched out into a straight line and made movable in a straight slot, the
                    screw, treadle, &amp;c., remaining as before, we shall get a very good idea of
                    the linear engine.</p>
                <p>In 1793 Edward Troughton finished a circular dividing engine, of which the plate
                    was smaller than in Ramsden’s, and which differed considerably otherwise in
                    simplifying matters of detail. The plate was originally divided by Trough ton’s
                    own ingenious method, already described, and the divisions so obtained were
                    employed to ratch the edge of the plate for receiving the tangent screw with
                    great accuracy.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Transactions of the Society of Arts</hi> for 1830-31
                    there is a full description, with illustrative figures, of a dividing engine,
                    constructed by Andrew Ross, which differs considerably from those of Ramsden and
                    Troughton.</p>
                <p>The essential point of difference is that, in Ross’s engine, the tangent screw
                    does not turn the engine plate; that is done by an independent apparatus, and
                    the function of the tangent screw is only to stop the plate after it has passed
                    through the required angular interval between two divisions on the work to be
                    graduated. Round the circumference of the plate are fixed 48 projections which
                    just look as if the circumference had been divided into as many deep and
                    somewhat peculiarly shaped notches or teeth. Through each of these teeth a hole
                    is bored parallel to the plane of the plate <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n39/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0039-0030"/> and also to a tangent to its circumference. Into
                    these holes are screwed steel screws with capstan heads and flat ends. The
                    tangent screw consists only of a single turn of a large square thread which
                    works in the teeth or notches of the plate. This thread is pierced by 90 equally
                    distant holes, all parallel to the axis of the screw, and at the same distance
                    from it. Into each of these holes is inserted a steel screw exactly similar to
                    those in the teeth, but with its end rounded. It is the rounded and flat ends of
                    these sets of screws coming together that stop the engine plate at the desired
                    position, and the exact point can be nicely adjusted by suitably turning the
                    screws.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the Astronomical Society</hi>, of date June
                    1813, a description is given of a dividing engine made by William Simms. From
                    experience he became convinced that to copy upon smaller circles the divisions
                    which had been put upon a large plate with very great accuracy was not only more
                    expeditious but better than original graduation, and hence he determined to
                    construct a machine which would do this work as perfectly as possible. That
                    machine involved essentially the same principle as Troughtun’s, and, with some
                    slight modifications, is at present to be seen at work in the workshop of the
                    eminent firm of Troughton &amp; Simms at Charlton near London. The accompanying
                    figure is taken by permission from a photograph of that instrument.</p>
                <p>The plate À is 46 inches in diameter, and is composed of gun-metal cast in one
                    solid piece. It has two sets of 5' divisions—one very faint on an inlaid ring of
                    silver, and the other stronger on the gunmetal. These were put on by original
                    graduation, mainly on the plan of Edward Troughton. One very great improvement
                    in this engine is that the axis B is tubular, as seen at C. The object of this
                    hollow is to receive the axis of the circle to be divided, so that it can be
                    fixed flat to the plate by the clamps E, without having first to be detached
                    from the axis and other parts to which it has already been carefully fitted.
                    This obviates the necessity for resetting, which can hardly be done without some
                    error. D is the tangent screw, and F the frame carrying it, which turns on
                    carefully polished steel pivots. The screw is pressed against the edge of the
                    plate by a spiral spring acting under the end of the lever G, and by screwing
                    the lever down the screw can be altogether removed from contact with the plate.
                    The edge of the plate is ratched by 4320 teeth which were cut opposite the
                    original division by a circular cutter attached to the screw frame. II is the
                    spiral barrel round which the catgut band is wound, one end of which is
                    attracted to the crank L on the end of the axis J and the other to a
                    counterpoise weight not seen. On the other end of J is another crank inclined to
                    L and carrying a band and counterpoise weight seen at K. The object of this
                    weight is to balance the former and give steadiness to the motion. On the axis J
                    is seen a pair of bevelled wheels which move the rod I, which, by another pair
                    of bevelled wheels attached to the box N, gives motion to the axis M, on the end
                    of which is an eccentric for moving the bent lever O, which actuates the bar
                    carrying the cutter. Between the eccentric and the point of the screw P is an
                    undulating plate by which long divisions, at re&lt;μιired intervals, can be cut.
                    It will be seen that the cutting apparatus is supported upon the two parallel
                    rails which can be elevated or depressed at pleasure by the nuts Q. Also the
                    cutting apparatus can be moved forward or backward upon these rails to suit
                    circles of different diameters. The box N is movable upon the bar R, and the rod
                    I is also adjustable as to length by having a kind of telescope joint. The
                    engine is quite self-acting, and can be driven either by hand or by a
                    steam-engine or other motive power. When driven by the latter it can be thrown
                    in or out of gear at once by a handle seen at S. Mr Simms has also provided an
                    ingenious arrangement whereby that is done automatically directly any piece of
                    work was finished.</p>
                <p>Space permits of but the mere mention of Donkin’s linear dividing engine, in
                    which the principle employed is a compensating arrangement whereby great
                    accuracy is obtained notwithstanding the inequalities of the screw used to
                    advance the cutting tool. Dividing engines have also been made by Reichenbach
                    and others in Germany, and Gambey in Paris.</p>
