                <p><label type="entry">GREYTOWN, or more correctly San Juan del Norte</label>, a
                    small town of Nicaragua, worthy of note as the only port of the republic on the
                    coast of the Atlantic and as the eastern terminus proposed for the Nicaraguan
                    inter-oceanic canal. According to the survey of Commanders Hatfield and Lull,
                    U.S.N., in 1872-3, the church is situated in 10° <hi rend="italic">55'</hi> 14*
                    N. lat. and 83° 42' 18" W. long. The town lies along the seaward side of a
                    narrow peninsula formed by the windings of the San Juan river, and most of its
                    buildings are insignificant erections raised 2 or 3 feet on piles. Though it is
                    still a port of call for mail steamers, and monopolizes the export and import
                    trade of Nicaragua, Greytown is in a decadent condition. Its fine harbour has
                    become almost useless. Between 1832 and 1848 the Arenas Point, which formed one
                    of its boundaries, advanced westward nearly a nautical mile, and now the whole
                    seaward frontage of the bay is a moving sand-bank. In 1853 the channel of
                    entrance was still about one-third of a mile in width and had 23 to 25 feet of
                    water in the bar, so that even vessels of war were able to take shelter within
                    the harbour; but by 1801 the channel was only 100 yards wide and 12 feet deep,
                    and iu 1875 the passage was sometimes practically closed, with at the most only
                    5 feet of water. The inhabitants of the town, however, have increased from 955
                    in 1863 to about 1200 in 1875. As the vicinity of their town is unfitted for
                    agriculture, they are almost entirely dependent for provisions on supplies from
                    the interior or abroad, and sometimes the commonest articles of consumption are
                    exceedingly scarce. In terms of the treaty of 1860 trial by jury is maintained
                    in all civil and criminal cases, and there is perfect freedom of religious
                    worship, both private and public. The seventh article, however, by which
                    Greytown was to remain a free port has become a dead letter. A duty of 5 per
                    cent, was allowed by the merchants on all imports consumed in the place in order
                    to provide means for constructing a lighthouse; and in 1863 the central
                    Government of the republic imposed another 5 per cent., so that all goods really
                    pay 10 per cent, <hi rend="italic">ad valorem.</hi> The imports in 1875 and 1876
                    respectively were £25,350 and £105,000, and the exports £60,500 and
                    £145,000.</p>
                <p>The harbour of San Juan, first discovered by Columbus, was brought into further
                    notice by Captain Diego Machuca, who in 1529 sailed down the river from the Lake
                    of Nicaragua. The date of the first Spanish settlement on the spot is not known,
                    but in the 17th century there were fortifications at the mouth of the river. In
                    1796 San Juan was made a port of entry by royal charter, and new defences were
                    erected in 1821. The patriots of Nicaragua seized the place at the revolution,
                    but they were expelled in January 1848 by the British, who, claiming the
                    district in name of the “king of the Mosquito Indians,” continued in possession
                    till the treaty of 1860. In 1854 the town was bombarded by the United States
                    forces for an alleged insult.</p>
