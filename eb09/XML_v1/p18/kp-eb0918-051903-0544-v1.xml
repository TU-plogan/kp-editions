                <p><label type="entry">PEPYS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Samuel</hi></label> (1633-1703),
                    was the fifth child of John Pepys and Margaret (Perkins? <hi rend="italic"
                    >Diary,</hi> 17th September 1663), and was born on 23d February 1632/3. His
                    family was of the middle class, and at this time was in humble circumstances,
                    his father being a tailor in London, while an uncle and an aunt, named Perkins,
                    lived in poverty in the Fens near Wisbeach. His father’s elder brother Robert
                    had a small property at Brampton in Huntingdonshire, and Samuel was at school at
                    Huntingdon about 1644. Thence he went to St Paul’s, London, and on 21st June
                    1650 was entered as a sizar at Trinity College, Cambridge, but was transferred
                    on 1st October in the same year to Magdalene, where he became pensioner on 4th
                    March following. On 3d April 1651 he was elected scholar on the Spendluffe
                    foundation, and on 4th October 1653 on that of Dr John Smith. Exactly a
                    fortnight afterwards he was admonished by the registrar before all the fellows
                    in residence for being “scandalously overserved with drink the night before.”
                    His love of drink, so constantly illustrated in the early pages of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Diary,</hi> would have been a serious drawback to his advancement,
                    had not his love of work and order been a still stronger impulse. The crisis was
                    reached on Sunday, 29th September 1661, when he was too drunk to trust himself
                    to read prayers to the household. After that he makes resolute vows against
                    wine, which he often breaks, and with regard to which he displays curious powers
                    of self-deception.</p>
                <p>Nothing more is known of Pepys’s college career, though he tells us that he was
                    addicted to writing romances. He became a moderate classical scholar; it is,
                    however, a curious commentary upon the university training of those days that,
                    after his appointment to the navy board, he is found busy with the
                    multiplication table, which he speaks of as entirely new to him, and of his
                    daily progress in which he is not a little proud. After this he becomes
                    enamoured of arithmetic and teaches his wife the science also.</p>

                    gives 10th October as the date; the registers of St Margaret’s church

                    Michel, a girl of fifteen, of great beauty, whose father, a Huguenot refugee in
                    England, was at this time in very poor circumstances. She was a good cook and a
                    good housekeeper, and was both clever and warm-tempered; Pepys, vain,
                    quarrelsome, fussy, and pedantic, was unfitted, save by a general goodness of
                    heart, to manage a high-spirited girl; and the pages of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Diary</hi> are full of bickerings and downright quarrels arising out of
                    trifles, the entries of which, though often amusing, are as often extremely
                    pathetic. Pepys and his wife, who were destitute of funds, were received by Sir
                    Edward Montagu, afterwards earl of Sandwich, wdιose mother had married Pepys’s
                    grandfather. Pepys probably acted as Montagu’s secretary. He was successfully
                    cut for the stone on 26th March 1657/8, an anniversary which he always notes
                    with gratitude. In March 1658/9 he accompanied Montagu and Algernon Sidney to
                    the Sound on board the “Naseby” (afterwards the “Charles ”). To this he more
                    than once refers as the beginning of his fortunes. On his return he was employed
                    as a clerk in the army pay-office of the exchequer under Downing, afterwards Sir
                    George Downing.</p>
                <p>In January 1659/60 Pepys began to keep his <hi rend="italic">Diary.</hi> He was
                    at this time living in Axe Yard, Westminster, in a small house with one servant,
                    on straitened means. On 29th January he can count but &lt;£40; his great object
                    is to get on and to “put money in his purse;” and by 24th May 1661 he is worth
                    £500. Political principles he had none, though his personal attachment to James
                    (II.) makes him call himself a Tory; but it is noticeable that even before the
                    Restoration he regularly attended the Church of England service carried on by
                    Peter Gunning, afterwards successively bishop of Chester and of Ely. Of active
                    religious convictions Pepys leaves no trace, but he was ever a steady
                    church-goer; and the epithets he applies to the sermons are very happy in their
                    causticity. In February he went to Cambridge to settle his brother in his old
                    college. One side of what was distinctly a coarse-grained nature is exhibited in
                    an entry during this week, where he describes himself (as on many other
                    occasions) as “playing the fool with the lass of the house.” His views of women,
                    indeed, are almost always vulgar; he was given to clumsy gallantry, and he was
                    certainly unfaithful to his wife. In March Montagu gave Pepys the post of
                    secretary to the generals at sea. While the fleet lay off the Dutch coast he
                    made a short journey into Holland. At this time he secured the favour of the
                    duke of York; and he retained it through life. On 28th June he became clerk of
                    the acts of the navy, an office which Montagu had procured for him against
                    powerful competition. A salary of a little over &lt;£100 a year, afterwards
                    increased to &lt;£350, was attached to the post, but Pepys had to pay an annuity
                    of &lt;£100 to his predecessor in office. On 23d July he became clerk of the
                    privy seal, the fees from which, at any rate for a time, brought him in an
                    additional £3 a day <hi rend="italic">(Diary,</hi> 10th August 1660). In this
                    month he took his Μ. A. degree. On 24th September he was sworn in as J.P. for
                    Middlesex, Essex, Kent, and Southampton. He now lived in Seething Lane, in front
                    of the navy office, Crutched Friars. In July 1661, on the death of his uncle,
                    the Brampton estate, worth £80 a year, came to his father, and on the latter’s
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n545/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0545-0520"/> death in 1680 to Pepys himself. In July 1662 he
                    was made a younger brother of the Trinity House.</p>
                <p>Pepys’s untiring industry in office, his prudence, his unfailing usefulness, his
                    knowledge of business, which he was ever diligent to increase, and his general
                    integrity secured him the greatest confidence at headquarters. As early as
                    August 1662, when placed on the Tangier commission, he had found himself “a very
                    rising man.” In March 1664/5 he was made treasurer to the commission, and
                    received also the contract for victualling the garrison, both lucrative
                    appointments; and in October, through the influence of Sir W. Coventry, he was
                    further made surveyor-general of the victualling office, a post which he
                    resigned at the conclusion of the peace. His conduct during the Great Plague,
                    when, alone of all the navy board, he stayed in the city of the dead and carried
                    on the whole administration of the navy, was admirable. During the Fire also his
                    readiness and presence of mind were of the greatest service in staying the
                    conflagration.</p>
                <p>In the spring of 1667/8, in the blind rage at the national disgrace generally
                    termed the miscarriage of Chatham, the whole navy board were summoned before the
                    House of Commons to give an account of their conduct. Pepys was deputed by his
                    colleagues to conduct the defence, and he did so with complete success on 5th
                    March in a speech of three hours’ duration, which gained him great
                    reputation.</p>
                <p>In 1669 the increasing weakness of his eyesight compelled him to discontinue the
                    <hi rend="italic">Diary</hi>, his last entry being on 31st May. What was to us
                    an irremediable misfortune was to Pepys “almost as much as to see myself go into
                    the grave.” He now took leave of absence and spent some months in travelling
                    through France and in revisiting Holland. On the day of his return his wife fell
                    ill, and died in the early spring, before 3d March 1669/70. In July 1669 Pepys
                    stood as the duke of York’s nominee, backed by the Howard influence, for the
                    borough of Aidborough in Suffolk, but was defeated. In November 1670 we find him
                    engaged in a quarrel with the Swedish resident, which was likely to have been
                    followed by a duel, as Pepys, doubtless to his exceeding comfort (for he was a
                    great coward), received an order from the king neither to send nor accept a
                    challenge. In 1672 he was promoted to the secretaryship of the admiralty;
                    and,when James resigned his office of lord high admiral, Pepys did all the work
                    until the commission was appointed. He was placed also upon the new commission
                    for Tangier.</p>
                <p>In June 1673 he was chosen at a by-election, again as James’s nominee, foι∙
                    Castle Rising, a Howard borough, but a vote of the committee of privileges
                    declared the election void. Pepys, on the authority of Sir J. Banks and the earl
                    of Shaftesbury, was denounced before the House of Commons as being a Papist;
                    but, when these persons were called upon, they denied any definite knowledge of
                    the altar and crucifix which he was charged with having in his house. The
                    parliament being prorogued, he retained his seat, and is recorded as speaking on
                    17 th May and 26th October 1675, on the latter occasion against the proposal
                    made, in distrust of the crown, to lodge the money for the ships iñ the chamber
                    of London instead of in the exchequer; and again on 11th May 1678, in the debate
                    on the king’s message to quicken supply for the navy, when he was sharply
                    reproved by Sir R. Howard for speaking “rather like an admiral than a secretary,
                    ‘ I ’ and ‘ we,’” an amusing instance of how completely Pepys had obtained
                    control of the business of the navy and had identified himself with the work. He
                    was afterwards, in 1678/9, returned for Harwich (see a note on p. 122 of vol.
                    vi. of Bright’s edition of the <hi rend="italic">Diary).</hi> In the list,

                    History</hi> (vol. iv. p. 1082), the members for Harwich are recorded as being
                    Sir Anthony Deane and <hi rend="italic">Sir Thomas</hi> Pepys. An investigation
                    of the records of Harwich leaves no doubt that the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Parliamentary History</hi> is wrong upon this point, and that Pepys did sit for
                    the borough during this parliament.</p>
                <p>On 7th August 1677 Pepys was elected master of the Clothworkers’ Company, who
                    still possess the silver cup he gave them on the occasion. He continued to hold
                    the secretaryship until 1679, when fresh complaints of miscarriages in the navy
                    were made before the House. The country was then in the throes of the popish
                    terror. Pepys was accused, on the evidence of one Colonel Scott, an infamous
                    character, “a very great vindicator of the Salamanca doctor” <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Intelligencer,</hi> 20th May 1681), of sending secret information regarding
                    the English navy to France <hi rend="italic">(Intelligencer,</hi> 23d May 1681),
                    and was again charged with being a Papist. On 22d May he was sent, nominally on
                    the first charge, though really on the second, to the Tower, with his colleague
                    Sir Anthony Deane. As he himself wrote to James on 6th May, “a papist I must be,
                    whether I will or no, because favoured by your royal highness.” On 2d June he
                    appeared before the King’s Bench, and was remanded three times, bail being
                    refused by Jones, the attorney-general. At length Pepys was allowed out on bail
                    for &lt;£30,000. The trial was four times postponed, in the hope that evidence
                    would be obtained, and at last on 12th February 1680 he was released only
                    because Scott refused to swear to his depositions, and no prosecutor appeared,
                    and because his old servant, who had given evidence against him, being now on
                    his deathbed, confessed that it was utterly false. This illustrates admirably
                    the wild injustice that prevailed during that feverish time.</p>
                <p>In April 1680 Pepys attended the king by command to Newmarket, and there took
                    down in shorthand from his own mouth the narrative of his escape from Worcester.
                    His post had meantime been abolished, or at any rate the constitution of the
                    navy board changed. We find him writing to James on 6th May 1679, asking leave
                    to lay down “this odious secretaryship,” and to be placed on the commission of
                    the navy. James urged his claims upon Charles, but the imprisonment in the Tower
                    probably put an end to the affair. In May 1682 Pepys accompanied James when he
                    took the government of Scotland, and while there made with Colonel Legge a tour
                    of the chief toλvns. In the autumn of 1683 he sailed with the same Colonel
                    Legge, then Lord Dartmouth, on the expedition to destroy the fortifications of
                    Tangier, though not aware when he started of the object of the expedition. The
                    ships reached Tangier on Friday, 14th September. Here he stayed, with the
                    exception of a short visit to Spain, until 5th March, and arrived in London on
                    6th April.</p>
                <p>On his return Pepys was again made secretary to the admiralty. In this same year
                    (1684) he was elected president of the Royal Society. At the coronation of James
                    II. he figured as one of the barons of the Cinque Ports; and he sat in James’s
                    parliament for his old seat of Harwich along with his former colleague Sir
                    Anthony Deane, —a fact which illustrates how completely the crown had regained
                    possession of political power in the boroughs. He lost both his seat and his
                    secretaryship at the Revolution, though he was consulted on navy matters to the
                    time of his death. Having been rejected at Harwich in the new elections, he
                    tried in vain to find another seat. His well-known intimacy with and regard for
                    James made him a special object of suspicion to the Government, and in 1690, in
                    common with others suspected for similar reasons, though without cause, he was
                    suddenly arrested and sent to the Gate House, but was almost immediately
                    released, <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n546/mode/1up"

                    vol. vi. p. 169). He was, however, afraid of fresh attacks as late as Easter
                    1692 (Letter to Evelyn, Bright, vi. p. 173). It was about this time that he
                    published his long-intended <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the Navy.</hi> He gave,
                    as in former years, great attention to the government of Christ’s Hospital, and
                    especially to the mathematical foundation; and he was concerned with the
                    establishment of Sir William Boreman’s mathematical school at Greenwich. He was,
                    too, a benefactor of his old school of St Paul’s, and of Magdalene College.</p>
                <p>In the spring of 1700, being very ill with the breaking out of the wound caused
                    by the operation of 1658, he removed to the house of his old clerk William
                    Hewer, at Clapham, and, against the urgent advice of his doctors (Bright,
                    Preface), gave himself up to indefatigable study, feeling that his health was
                    restored by the change. He himself, however, on 7th August 1700, wrote in a
                    charming letter<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>He
                    carried on an active correspondence with literary friends, among them being
                    Dryden, Sloane, and Evelyn.</p></note> that he was doing “nothing that will bear
                    naming, and yet I am not, I think, idle; for who can, that has so much of past
                    and to come to think on as I have? And thinking, I take it, is working.” And he
                    speaks of himself in September as making several country excursions. He was,
                    immediately after this, confined entirely to the house with his old disease of
                    stone, and gradually failed. He bore his long and acute sufferings with extreme
                    fortitude, and died, in reduced circumstances (though he claimed a balance of
                    &lt;£28,007 2s l∣d against the crown), on 26th May 1703. He was buried by the
                    side of his wife in St Clave’s, Crutched Friars, London, on 5th June. His
                    library of 3000 volumes, which he had collected with much labour and sacrifice,
                    and which he would not allow to be divided, was bequeathed to Magdalene
                    College.</p>
                <p>The last fact to be recorded of Pepys is that on 18th March 1884, two centuries
                    after his official employment, a monument was unveiled in the church where he
                    was buried to the “Clerk of the Acts and Secretary to the Admiralty” <hi
                    rend="italic">{Times,</hi> 19th March 1884).</p>
                <p>The importance of Pepys’s <hi rend="italic">Diary,</hi> historically speaking,
                    may be summed up by saying that without it the history of the court of Charles
                    II. could not have been written. We do not, it is true, gain from it any
                    information as to what was going on in the country. Utterly destitute of
                    imagination or political knowledge, Pepys could only record the sights and the
                    gossip that were evident to all. It is because he did record these, without
                    hesitation or concealment, that from his <hi rend="italic">Diary</hi> we can
                    understand the brilliancy and wickedness of the court, as well as the social
                    state and daily life of the bourgeois class. Viewed in another light, it is
                    unique as the record of a mind formed of inconsistencies. To him especially
                    would his own motto apply, “Mens cujusque, is est quisque.” Probity in word and
                    integrity in office, along with self-confessed mendacity and fraud; modesty,
                    with inordinate self-conceit; independence of mind, with the vulgarest striving
                    after and exultation at the marks of respect which he receives as he rises in
                    the world, and at little advantages gained over others; high - mindedness, with
                    sordid spite; dignity, with buffoonery; strong common sense, with great
                    superstition; kindness, with brutality; the eager pursuit of money, with
                    liberality in spending it,— such are a few of the more obvious contrasts. He
                    gained his reputation by fair means, and yet was willing enough to lie in order
                    to increase it; he practised extreme respectability of deportment before the
                    world, while he worshipped the most abandoned of Charles’s mistresses, and now
                    and again gave loose rein to his own very indifferent morals; and he combined
                    with courage amid difficulties and devotion to duty in the face of almost
                    certain death a personal poltroonery to which few men would care to confess. The
                    best tribute to him as a man is that in his later years Evelyn became his firm
                    and intimate friend, and that he died amid universal respect.</p>
