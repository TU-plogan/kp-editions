                <p><label type="entry">PASTORAL EPISTLES</label>, the name given to three epistles
                    of the New Testament which bear the name of St Paul, and of which two are
                    addressed to Timothy and one to Titus. The reason of their being grouped
                    together is that they are marked off from the other Pauline epistles by certain
                    common characteristics of language and subjectmatter; and the reason of their
                    special name is that they consist almost exclusively of admonitions for the
                    pastoral administration of Christian communities. None of the Pauline epistles
                    have given greater ground for discussion, partly on account of the nature of
                    their contents, partly on account of their philological peculiarities, and
                    partly on account of their historical difficulties.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Contents.—</hi> The Pastoral Epistles are chiefly
                    distinguished from the other Pauline epistles by the prominence which they give
                    to doctrine. From an objective point of view Christian teaching is “the word” (2
                    Tim. iv. 2), or “the word of God” (2 Tim. ii. 9), or “the doctrine of God our
                    Saviour” (Tit. ii. 10), or “the truth” (1 Tim. iii. 15, 2 Tim. ii. 18; iv. 4;
                    Tit. i. 14), or “the faith” (1 Tim. iv. 1). From the point of view of the

                    Christians are those who “believe and know the truth” (1 Tim. iv. 3). It had
                    existed long enough to have become perverted, and hence a stress is laid upon

                    plural, “sound words,” 1 Tim. vi. 3; 2 Tim. i. 13). It had also tended to become
                    dissociated from right conduct; hence a stress is laid upon a “pure conscience”
                    (1 Tim. i. 19; iii. 8), and the end which it endeavours to attain is “love out
                    of a pure heart, and out of a good conscience, and out of unfeigned faith” (1
                    Tim. i. 5). Consequently the “things that befit the sound doctrine” are moral
                    attributes and duties (Tit. ii. 1 <hi rend="italic">sqf,</hi> and the things
                    that are “contrary to the sound doctrine” (1 Tim. i. 10) are moral vices. This
                    combination of sound doctrine and right conduct is “piety” (eυ&lt;re∕3eια, 1
                    Tim. ii. 2; iii. 16; iv. 7, 8; vi. 5, 6, 11; 2 Tim. iii. 4) or “godliness” <hi
                    rend="italic">(θeοσcβfια,</hi> 1 Tim. ii. 10); and sound doctrine is, in other
                    words, “the doctrine,” or “the truth, that is in harmony with piety” (1 Tim. vi.
                    3; Tit. i. 1). This doctrine or truth is regarded as a sacred deposit in the
                    hands of the church or community (1 Tim. vi. 20; 2 Tim. i. 14}, and is therefore
                    a “common faith” (Tit. i. 4), of which the church is the “pillar and stay” (1
                    Tim. iii. 15). Its substance appears to be given in 1 Tim. iii. 16, which has
                    been regarded, not without reason, as a rudimentary form of creed, and possibly
                    part of a liturgical hymn. But the church is no longer identical with “them that
                    are being saved” or “the elect”; it is compared to “a great house” which
                    contains vessels “some unto honour, and some unto dishonour” (2 Tim. ii. 20). It
                    is in other words no longer an ideal community, the “Israel of God” (Gal. vi.
                    16), but a visible society. And, being such, its organization had come to be of
                    more importance than before. But the nature of the organization to which these
                    epistles point is an unsolved problem. The solution of that problem is attended
                    by the preliminary question, which in the absence of collateral evidence cannot
                    be definitely answered, of the relation in which Timothy and Titus are conceived
                    to stand to the other or ordinary officers. According to a tradition mentioned
                    by Eusebius, but for which he gives no definite authority, Timothy was “bishop”
                    of Ephesus and Titus of Crete; according to others their position was rather
                    that of the later “metropolitans”; and some modern writers, accepting one or
                    other of these views, take it as part of the proof that the epistles belong to a
                    period of the 2d century in which the monarchical idea of the episcopate was
                    struggling to assert itself. On the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0370-0349"/> other hand, it appears from the epistles
                    themselves that the positions of Timothy and Titus were temporary rather than
                    permanent, and that they were special delegates rather than ordinary officers (1
                    Tim. iii. 14, 15; iv. 13; Tit. iii. 12). For the ordinary officers the
                    qualifications are almost all moral, and they are so similar to each other, and
                    to the moral qualifications of all Christians, as to imply that the sharp
                    distinctions of later times between one grade of office and another, and between
                    the officers and the other members of the communities, were not yet developed (1
                    Tim. iii. 2-12; Tit. i. 6-9, possibly also ii. 2-6). The most probable solution
                    of the difficulties which present themselves in relation to the apparent
                    interchange of the names “bishop” and “elder,” and to the apparent double use of
                    the word “elder,” sometimes as a title and sometimes as a designation of age, is
                    that in these epistles there is an imperfect amalgamation of two forms of
                    organization, Jewish and Gentile: in the former the distinction between the
                    governing and the governed classes was mainly that of age, and the functions of
                    the governing class were mainly those of discipline; in the latter the
                    distinction was mainly that of functions, and the functions were mainly those of
                    administration. (1) The distinction between elder and younger appears in regard
                    to both men and women (1 Tim. v. 1, 2; Tit. ii. 2-6). Out of the elder men some
                    appear to have been chosen or appointed to preside <hi rend="italic">(oι
                    πpoeστωτeς,</hi> 1 Tim. v. 17; a cognate form of the designation is found in
                    Rom. xii. 8, 1 Thess. v. 12, and constitutes almost the only link of connexion
                    between the organization of these and that of the other Pauline epistles), and
                    to have constituted a collective body or “presbytery” (1 Tim. iv. 14, the word
                    was in use to designate the Jewish councils of elders, for which the more common
                    word was <hi rend="italic">γepoυala).</hi> Their functions, like those of the
                    corresponding officers in the Jewish communities, were probably for the most
                    part disciplinary; to these some of them added the function of teaching (1 Tim.
                    v. 17). The elder women also were charged with disciplinary functions; they had
                    to “train the young women to love their husbands, to love their children, to be
                    sober-minded” (Tit. ii. 3, 4). Out of such of them as were widows some were
                    specially entered on the roll of church-officers <hi rend="italic"
                    >(κατάλογος),</hi> and formed a class which, though it did not long survive the
                    growth of monasticism, is mentioned in almost all early documents which refer to
                    ecclesiastical order (see Smith and Cheetham, <hi rend="italic">Diet, of Chris.
                    Antiq., s.v.</hi> “Widows”). Whether the younger men and women, or a selected
                    number of them had, as such, corresponding duties is not clear, but an inference
                    in favour of the supposition may be drawn from a comparison of 1 Tim. v. 1, 2,
                    13, Acts v. 6, 10. (2) Side by side with this, and sometimes, but not always,
                    blended with it, was the organization which was probably adopted from the
                    contemporary civil societies, especially those in which, as in the Christian
                    communities, there were funds to be administered; the presiding elders, or some
                    of them, were also “bishops” or administrators, and some of the younger men were
                    “deacons” or servants. A bishop was “God’s steward” (Tit. i. 7); a deacon was
                    the active helper of the bishops in both administration and discipline.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Language.—</hi> These epistles are distinguished from the
                    other Pauline epistles by many peculiarities of language, of which only a few
                    can be mentioned here. (1) In 1 Timothy there are seventy-four words which are
                    not elsewhere in the New Testament; in 2 Timothy there are forty-six such words,
                    and in Titus forty-eight. In the three epistles taken together there are one
                    hundred and thirty-three words which are not found in the other Paμline
                    epistles, though they are found elsewhere in the New Testament; and many of the
                    most marked and frequent expressions of St Paul are absent. (2) There is a
                    tendency which is not found elsewhere in the Pauline epistles to form unusual
                    compounds, <hi rend="italic">e.g., λoγoμαχfiν, iτepoδιδασκαλfιν,
                    iψηλoφpoνeιν,</hi><hi rend="italic">αυτοκατάκριτος.</hi> (3) Words are used for
                    which the other Pauline epistles invariably substitute a different, though
                    nearly synonymous, word; <hi rend="italic">e.g., 8eσπoτης</hi> is used for <hi
                    rend="italic">κύριος,</hi><hi rend="italic">κτlσμa</hi> for <hi rend="italic"
                    >κτlσις.</hi> (4) The particles, which are even better tests of identity of
                    style than nouns and verbs, are different: the Pauline <hi rend="italic"
                    >γάρ</hi> is rare; <hi rend="italic">ápa, ápa oυν, tτι, μηπως,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">πάλιν,</hi><hi rend="italic">ωσπep,</hi> are absent. (5) “In the
                    other Pauline epistles the fulness of the apostle’s thought struggles with the
                    expression, and causes peculiar difficulties in exposition. The thoughts slide
                    into one another, and are so intertwined in many forms that not seldom the new
                    thought begins before a correct expression has been given to the thought that
                    preceded. Of this confusion there is no example in the Pastoral Epistles”
                    (Huther, <hi rend="italic">Introduction,</hi> Eng. tr., p. 10). A complete
                    account of the linguistic peculiarities of these epistles will be found in
                    Holtzmann, pp. 84-117.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Historical Difficulties.—</hi> The historical difficulties
                    to which these epistles give rise are of two kinds:—(1) that of finding a place
                    for them in any period of the recorded life of St Paul, and (2) that of
                    determining the state of theological opinion to which they are relative.</p>
                <p>(1) In regard to the first kind of difficulties, each of the three epistles has
                    its own problems.</p>
                <p>The data of the historical position of 1 Timothy appear to be (a) that St Paul
                    had gone into Macedonia, (ò) that he had left Timothy at Ephesus (i. 3). The
                    chief hypotheses which have been framed to satisfy the conditions which these
                    data imply are the following. (1) The majority of older writers suppose that St
                    Paul left Timothy at Ephesus when he went into Macedonia after the émeute in the
                    theatre (Acts xx. 1). The difficulties in the way of this hypothesis are that
                    Timothy had been sent into Macedonia (Acts xix. 22), and probably at the same
                    time to Corinth (1 Cor. iv. 17), that he had not returned when St Paul himself
                    reached Macedonia, inasmuch as St Paul waited for him there (1 Cor. xvi. 11),
                    that the two were together in Macedonia when 2 Corinthians was written (2 Cor.
                    i. 1), and that they returned together to Asia Minor (Acts xx. 4). Some of these
                    difficulties have been met by the conjecture that Timothy never reached Corinth,
                    but returned to St Paul at Ephesus and rejoined him in Macedonia; but the
                    conjecture implies that Timothy disobeyed the apostle’s exhortation to tarry at
                    Ephesus almost as soon as he had received it, and that the apostle, so far from
                    “hoping to come unto him shortly” (1 Tim. iii. 14), was in reality intending to
                    go to Jerusalem and to Rome (Acts xix. 21), not even calling at Ephesus on his
                    way (Acts xx. 17). (2) It has been supposed that there was an unrecorded journey
                    of St Paul into Macedonia during his long stay in Ephesus (Acts xix. 1-20; so
                    Mosheim, Schrader, Wieseler, and Reuss, the last of whom makes the journey
                    extend to Crete and Illyricum). There is little difficulty in the supposition of
                    such a journey into Macedonia, but there is great difficulty in supposing that
                    the epistle was written in the course of it,—first, because its language is not
                    compatible with the idea that Timothy was merely left in temporary charge during
                    a short absence of the apostle, and, secondly, because the epistle implies the
                    existence of an organized community which had existed long enough to have had
                    errors growing up in it (whereas in Acts xx. 29-30 the coming of heretical
                    teachers is regarded as still future), and in which it was possible that a
                    bishop should be “not a novice” (1 Tim. iii. 6). (3) It has been supposed that
                    St Paul wrote the epistle during his imprisonment at Caesarea or at Jerusalem;
                    but this does not <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0371-0350"/> avoid the difficulty which is fatal to the two
                    preceding hypotheses, that Timothy had been left at Ephesus when the apostle was
                    “going into Macedonia.” (4) In order to avoid this fatal difficulty some writers
                    (especially Otto, <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic">geschichtlichen
                    Verhältnisse der Pastoralbriefe,</hi> Leipsic, 1860, and Kölling, <hi

                    translation of 1 Tim. i. 3, so as to make it appear that it was Timothy and not
                    Paul that was going into Macedonia (for criticisms of this attempt see Huther’s
                    edition of Meyer’s commentary <hi rend="italic">ad loc.,</hi> and Weiss in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Studien</hi><hi rend="italic">u.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Kritiken</hi> for 1861, p. 577).</p>
                <p>The data of the historical position of 2 Timothy appear to be (a) that St Paul
                    either was or had been in Rome (i. 17), <hi rend="italic">(b)</hi> that he was
                    in prison (i. 16; ii. 9), (c) that he had already had a trial (iv. 16), <hi
                    rend="italic">(d)</hi> that he believed himself, to be near the end of his life
                    (iv. 6), (e) that he was expecting shortly to see Timothy (i. 4; iv. 9, 21), (∕)
                    that he had been, apparently not long before, at Troas, Corinth, and Miletus
                    (iv. 13, 20). Upon these data two hypotheses have been framed. (1) It has been
                    supposed that the required historical position is to be found at the beginning
                    of the “two whole years” of Acts xxviii. 30, and that consequently the epistle
                    was written before those to the Philippians and Colossians (so, among others,
                    Schrader, Otto, and Reuss). The difficulties in the way of this hypothesis are
                    chiefly two,—first, that of accounting for the complete change of tone between
                    the close anticipation of death of 2 Tim. iv. 6 and the hopefulness of
                    Philippians ii. 23, 24, Philemon 22, and, secondly, that of accounting for the
                    “first defence” of 2 Tim. iii. 16; this Otto does by supposing it to be the
                    process before Festus at Caesarea, a supposition which implies the very
                    improbable further supposition that the process before Felix was not what was
                    technically known as an “actio,” and that the term “make my defence” (Acts xxiv.
                    10) was wrongly applied by St Paul himself to his own speech. (2) It has been
                    supposed that the required position is to be found in the period immediately
                    succeeding the “two whole years” of Acts xxviii. 30, and that the epistle was
                    written after those to the Philippians and Colossians (so, among others,
                    Wieseler). One of the main difficulties in the way of this hypothesis is that it
                    implies an interval of at least four years since the journey referred to in
                    chap, iv., and that it is incredible that St Paul should have written to a
                    disciple in Asia Minor to mention the casual incidents of a voyage —such as the
                    leaving a cloak at Troas and a companion sick at Miletus—which had occurred
                    several years before; the difficulty would not be much lessened even if the
                    ingenious conjectures were adopted by which Wieseler endeavours to identify this
                    voyage with that of Acts xxvii.</p>
                <p>The data of the historical position of the epistle to Titus are (a) that Paul and
                    Titus had been in Crete together, and that Titus had been left there, <hi
                    rend="italic">(b)</hi> that Paul was intending to winter at Nicopolis (wherever
                    that may be, places of that name being found in several Roman provinces). Upon
                    these data many conjectures have been built. It has been supposed that St Paul
                    visited Crete either (1) at the cömmencement of this second missionary journey
                    (Acts xv. 41), or (2) during his residence at Corinth (Acts xviii. 1, 8; so
                    Michaelis and Thiersch). Each of these conjectures is met, in addition to other
                    difficulties, by the fact, which seems fatal to it, that Apollos, who is
                    mentioned in Titus iii. 13, was not known to Paul and his company until after
                    the second missionary journey (Acts xviii. 24). (3) The same fact is also fatal
                    to the supposition of Hug and others that the visit to Crete took place during
                    the journey from Corinth to Ephesus (Acts xviii. 18,19), a supposition which is
                    also inconsistent with the apostle’s apparent desire to reach Syria without much
                    delay, and which requires for its support the further supposition that, although
                    on his way to Antioch and Caesarea, he had selected the almost unknown town of
                    Nicopolis in Cilicia to winter in. (4) It has been supposed (Credner) that the
                    visit to Crete was made as a detour in the course of the journey from Antioch to
                    Ephesus (Acts xviii. 22, 23; xix. 1); this is not only improbable in itself but
                    also inconsistent with the summary of that journey: “Paul, having passed through
                    the upper,” <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the inland, “country, came to Ephesus.”
                    (5) It has been supposed that St Paul called at Crete in the course of a journey
                    which he probably made to Corinth during his long sojourn at Ephesus (so
                    Wieseler, who thinks that he went first to Macedonia, 1 Tim. i. 3, and thence to
                    Corinth, Crete, and back to Ephesus; and Reuss, who thinks that the route was
                    Ephesus, Crete, Corinth, Illyricum, Macedonia, Ephesus); but this supposition
                    seems to be excluded by the inconsistency between the expressed intention to
                    winter in Nicopolis (Tit. iii. 12) and the similar intention to pass the same
                    winter at Corinth (1 Cor. xvi. 6), unless the ingenious hypothesis of Wieseler
                    be adopted that he intended to spend part of the winter in one place and the
                    rest in the other. (6) It has been supposed that he made his journey from
                    Macedonia to Greece (Acts xx. 1-3) by way of Crete (so Matthies); but this
                    supposition seems to be excluded by the fact that in 2 Cor. viii. 6, 17 (which
                    was written from Macedonia), Titus who had been with Paul in Macedonia had gone
                    forward on his own account not to Crete but to Corinth. And all these endeavours
                    to find a place for the epistle in St Paul’s life before his voyage to Rome are
                    met by the improbability that, if Crete had been already so far Christianized as
                    to have communities in several cities (which is implied in Tit. i. 5), there
                    should be no hint of the fact in Acts xxvii. 7-13.</p>
                <p>The difficulties of all endeavours to find a place for these epistles in the
                    recorded history of St Paul have been so strongly felt by most of those modern
                    writers who support their authenticity that such writers have generally
                    transferred them to an unrecorded period of his life, subsequent to the close of
                    the Acts of the Apostles. The external authorities for the belief that there was
                    such a period, and that in the course of it St Paul underwent a second
                    imprisonment, are chiefly the statement of Clement of Rome that he went to “the
                    goal of the West,” and that of the Muratorian fragment that he went to Spain
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Paul,</hi><hi rend="italic">infra,</hi> p. 422). Both
                    these statements admit of much dispute, the one as to its meaning, the other as
                    to its authority; and their value as evidence is weakened by the fact that
                    Irenaeus, Tertullian, and Origen, though they mention the death of the apostle
                    at Rome, say nothing of any journeys subsequent to his arrival there. In the 4th
                    century Eusebius, for the first time, mentions a second imprisonment, but
                    prefixes to his statement the ambiguous words <hi rend="italic">λόγος</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">tχeι,</hi> “there is a story” or “tradition holds.” Several
                    fathers subsequent to his time repeat and amplify his statement; but that
                    statement, if accepted, involves the further difficulties on the one hand of
                    finding room for St Paul’s journeys before the great Neronian persecution of 64
                    A.D., and on the other hand of accounting for the fact that, supposing the
                    apostle to have survived that persecution, he makes no mention of it. For all
                    these difficulties more or less plausible answers have been framed, and many
                    narratives of St Paul’s unrecorded travels have been written; but, although it
                    may be admitted that such narratives are conceivably true, yet it must be
                    conceded on the other hand that they rest rather upon conjecture than upon
                    evidence. It may be added that the hypothesis of a second imprisonment is
                    rejected not only by writers like Baur and Hilgenfeld, who deny the authenticity
                    of <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n372/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0372-0351"/> both the Pastoral Epistles and the other
                    “Epistles of the Captivity,” but also by conservative writers, such as Meyer,
                    Ebrard, Otto, Wieseler, Thiersch, and De Pressensé.</p>
                <p>(2) The second kind of historical difficulties, that of determining the state of
                    theological opinion to which these epistles are relative, arises partly from the
                    incidental nature of the references to false teachers in the epistles themselves
                    and partly from the fragmentary character of our knowledge of contemporary
                    teaching. The characteristics of the false teachers are mainly the following,
                    (i.) They once held “sound doctrine” but have now fallen away from it (1 Tim. i.
                    6, 19; vi. 5, 21; 2 Tim. ii. 18); and, puffed up with self-conceit (1 Tim. vi.
                    4) and claiming to have a special “knowledge” <hi rend="italic">(γνωσις,</hi>
                    vi. 20; implied also in Tit. i. 16), they oppose the truth (Tit. i. 9; 2 Tim.
                    ii. 25; iii. 8) and teach a different doctrine (1 Tim. i. 3); yet they remain
                    within the church and cause factions within it (Tit. iii. 10). (ii.) They
                    profess asceticism,</p>
                <p>“forbidding to marry and commanding to abstain from meats,” apparently on the
                    ground that some “creatures of God” are evil (1 Tim. iv. 3), and at the same
                    time their moral practice is perverted, they are “unto every good work
                    reprobate” (1 Tim. vi. 5; 2 Tim. iii. 13; Tit. i. 16), and they make their
                    teaching of religion a means of gain (1 Tim. vi. 5; Tit. i. 11). (iii.) Their
                    teaching is concerned with “fables and endless genealogies” (1 Tim. i. 4; Tit.
                    i. 14), with questionings and disputes of words (1 Tim. vi. 4), with empty
                    sounds and contradictions (1 Tim. vi. 20), with “profane and old wives’ fables”
                    (1 Tim. iv. 7), with “foolish questionings and genealogies, and strifes and
                    fightings about the law” (Tit. iii. 9), and they held that the “resurrection is
                    past already” (2 Tim. ii. 18). It has been sometimes held that these statements
                    refer rather to errors of practice than errors of doctrine, and rather to
                    tendencies than to matured systems (Reuss); and it has also been sometimes held
                    that different forms of opinion are referred to in either different epistles or
                    different parts of the same epistle (Credner, Thiersch, Hilgenfeld); but the
                    majority of writers think that the reference is to a single definite form of
                    error. The main question upon which opinions are divided is whether the basis of
                    this false teaching was Judaistic or Gnostic, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi>
                    whether that teaching was a rationalizing form of Judaism or a Judaizing form of
                    Gnosticism. (1) The former of these views branches out into many forms, and is
                    held on various grounds. It is sometimes held that the reference is to the
                    allegorizing and rationalizing school of which Philo is the chief
                    representative, and which was endeavouring to take root in Christian soil, the
                    “fables” being the allegorical interpretations of historical facts, the
                    “genealogies” those of the Pentateuch, or possibly the Pentateuch itself, which
                    served as the basis of philosophical speculations (Wiesinger, Hofmann). It is
                    sometimes held that the reference is to what in later times was known as the
                    Kabbalah, the assumption being made that the Kabbalah must be dated many
                    centuries earlier than other testimony warrants us in believing (so Vitringa,
                    Grotius, Schöttgen, and more recently Olshausen and Baumgarten). It is sometimes
                    held that the false teachers were not so much theosophic as thaumaturgie, allied
                    to the J udaeo-Samaritan school of which Simon Magus is the typical
                    representative, and that this is the point of the reference to Jannes and
                    Jambres and to “jugglers .... deceiving and being deceived” (2 Tim. iii. 8, 13).
                    It is sometimes supposed that they combined Essenism with a form of Ebionism,
                    and this view (the ablest supporter of which is Mangold, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Die</hi><hi rend="italic">Irrlehrer der Pastoralbriefe,</hi> 1856) is that
                    which now prevails among those who contend for the early date of the epistles,
                    if not for their authenticity. (2) It is contended on the other hand that none
                    of these theories quite cover the facts. It is maintained that genealogies did
                    not take the place in the Jewish speculative schools which they evidently had in
                    the false teaching to which these epistles refer; that even if they had done so
                    it is difficult to account for the epithet “endless” which is applied to them;
                    that there is no sufficient proof that the Essenes held a dualistic theory of
                    the relation of spirit to matter, or that they denied the resurrection (the
                    testimony of Hippolytus on this point being more probable than that of
                    Josephus), or that they taught for gain, or that they prosecuted a propaganda
                    among women (2 Tim. iii. 6). It is further contended that all these points are
                    generally characteristic of Gnosticism. The use of the epithet “falsely so
                    called,” it is urged, shows that “knowledge” <hi rend="italic">{γνωσις)</hi> is
                    used in a technical sense; in the “endless genealogies” writers so early as
                    Irenaeus and Tertullian recognized Gnostic systems of aeons, to which the phrase
                    seems exactly to apply; the abstinence from meats and from marriage belongs not
                    to any form of Judaism but to Gnostic theories of the nature of matter; the
                    description of the teachers as making a gain of their teaching and as “taking
                    captive silly women laden with sins” suits no one so well as the half-converted
                    rhetoricians who brought into Christian communities the practices as well as the
                    beliefs of the degenerate philosophical schools of the empire. It is probable
                    that this view is substantially correct; at the same time it may be granted that
                    the evidence is too scanty to allow of the identification of the Gnostics to
                    which reference is made with any particular Gnostic sect, and that the several
                    attempts which have been made so to identify them have failed.</p>
                <p>The result of this combination of difficulties—the differences between the
                    pastoral epistles and the other Pauline epistles in respect of the character of
                    their contents, their philological peculiarities, the difficulty of reconciling
                    the historical references with what is known from other sources of the life of
                    St Paul, the difficulty of finding any known form of belief which precisely
                    answers to the opinions which they attack, and the further difficulty of
                    believing that so elaborate a debasement of Christianity had grown up in the
                    brief interval between St Paul’s first contact with Hellenism and his death—has
                    been to make the majority of modern critics question or deny their authenticity.
                    The first important attacks were that of Schleiermacher, who, however, only
                    rejected 1 Timothy, and a few years afterwards that of Eichhorn, who rejected
                    all three; but the modern criticism of them practically begins with Baur’s
                    treatise <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic">sogenannten Pastoralbriefe
                    des Apostels Paulus</hi> in 1835. Since then the controversy has been keenly
                    waged on both sides; the history of it will be found in Holtzmann, <hi
                    rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic">Pastoralbriefe</hi> (Leipsic, 1880),
                    which is by far the ablest work on the negative side of the controversy, and
                    which, whether its conclusions be accepted or not, is more full of accurate
                    information than any other. The most available works on the conservative side,
                    for English readers, are the translation of Huther’s edition of Meyer’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Commentary</hi> (Edinburgh, 1881); Dr Wace’s introduction to the
                    Pastoral Epistles in the <hi rend="italic">Speakers Commentary</hi> (London,
                    1881); and Archdeacon Farrar’s excursus on “The Genuineness of the Pastoral
