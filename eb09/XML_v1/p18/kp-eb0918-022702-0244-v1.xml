                <p><label type="entry">PAPHLAGONIA</label>, in ancient geography, was the name given
                    to a province of Asia Minor, situated on the Euxine Sea, and adjoining Bithynia
                    on the west and Pontus on the east, while towards the south it was separated
                    from Galatia by a range of mountains which may be considered as a prolongation
                    to the east of the Bithynian Olympus. According to Strabo, whose authority is
                    generally followed upon this point, the river Parthenius formed the western
                    limit of the region so-called, and it was bounded on the east by the much more
                    important river Halys. Although the Paphlagonians play scarcely any part in
                    history, they were one of the most ancient nations of Asia Minor, as their name
                    appears in the Homeric catalogue of the allies of Priam during the Trojan War
                    (ZZ., ii. 851). They are afterwards mentioned by Herodotus among the races
                    reduced to subjection by Croesus, and they sent an important contingent to the
                    army of Xerxes in 480 B.c. They seem, however, to have enjoyed a state of at
                    least semi-independence, as Xenophon speaks of them as being governed by a
                    prince of their own, without any reference to the satraps of the neighbouring
                    parts of Asia. The rugged and difficult nature of their country, which is
                    described by Xenophon as containing fertile and beautiful plains, but traversed
                    by lofty ranges of mountains, which could only be crossed by narrow and
                    difficult passes, doubtless contributed to this result. At a later period
                    Paphlagonia passed under the yoke of the Macedonian kings, and we find it after
                    the death of Alexander the Great assigned, together with Cappadocia, to Eumenes.
                    It continued, however, to be governed by native princes until it was absorbed by
                    the encroaching power of the neighbouring kingdom of Pontus. The rulers of that
                    dynasty became masters of the greater part of Paphlagonia as early as the reign
                    of Mithradates III. (302-266 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> but it was not
                    till that of Pharnaces I. that the important city of Sinope fell into their
                    hands (183 B.c.). From this time the whole province was incorporated with the
                    kingdom of Pontus until the fall of the great Mithradates (65 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.).</hi> In the settlement of Asia which followed that
                    event, Pompey united the coast districts of Paphlagonia with the province of
                    Bithynia, but left the interior of the country under one of the native princes,
                    two or three of whom followed in succession until the dynasty became extinct and
                    the whole country was incorporated in the Roman empire. All these petty native
                    rulers appear to have borne the name or surname of Pylaemenes, as a token that
                    they claimed descent from the chieftain of that name who figures in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Iliad</hi> as the leader of the Paphlagonians. Under the Roman
                    empire Paphlagonia, with the greater part of Pontus, was united into one
                    province with Bithynia, as we find to have been the case in the time of the
                    younger Pliny; but the name was still retained by geographers, though its
                    boundaries are not distinctly defined by Ptolemy. It reappears as a separate
                    province in the 5th century (Hierocles, <hi rend="italic">Synecd.,</hi> c.
                    33).</p>
                <p>The ethnic relations of the Paphlagonians are very uncertain. It seems perhaps
                    most probable that they belonged to the same race with the Cappadocians, who
                    held the adjoining province of Pontus, and who were undoubtedly a Semitic race.
                    Their language, however, would appear from the testimony of Strabo to have been
                    distinct from that of their neighbours. Equally obscure is the relation between
                    the Paphlagonians and the Eneti, or Heneti, who are mentioned in connexion with
                    them in the Homeric catalogue, and who were supposed in the mythical fictions of
                    antiquity to be the ancestors of the Veneti, who dwelt at the head of the
                    Adriatic. But no trace is found in historical times of any tribe of that name in
                    Asia Minor.</p>
                <p>The greater part of Paphlagonia is a rugged and mountainous country, but it
                    contains fertile valleys, and produces great abundance of fruit. The mountains
                    also are clothed with dense forests, which are conspicuous for the quantity of
                    boxwood which they furnish. Hence its coasts were from an early period occupied
                    by Greek colonies, among which the flourishing city of Sinope, a colony from
                    Miletus, founded about 630 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> stood preeminent.
                    Amastris, a few miles east of the Parthenius, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n245/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0245-0228"/> became an important town under the Macedonian
                    monarchs; while Amisus, a colony of Sinope, which was situated a short distance
                    east of the Halys, and therefore did not fall strictly within the limits of
                    Paphlagonia as defined by Strabo, though often considered as belonging to that
                    province, rose to be almost a rival of its parent city. The other towns along
                    the coast of the Euxine were of little consequence, and none of those in the
                    interior ever rose to any importance. The most considerable were Gangra, in
                    ancient times the capital of the Paphlagonian kings, afterwards called
                    Germanicopolis, and situated near the frontier of Galatia, and Pompeiopolis, in
                    the valley of the Amnias (a tributary of the Halys), near which were extensive
                    mines of the mineral called by Strabo sandarake (red arsenic), which was largely
                    exported from Sinope. <hi rend="smallcaps">(e. h. b.)</hi></p>
