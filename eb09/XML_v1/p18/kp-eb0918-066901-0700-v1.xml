                    Christoph</hi></label> (1772-1843), German publisher, was born at Rudolstadt on
                    21st April 1772. At the age of fifteen he became an apprentice in the service of
                    Böhme, a bookseller in Leipsic, with whom he remained about six years. In
                    Hamburg, where he settled in 1793 as an assistant to the bookseller Hoffmann, he
                    started in 1796 a bookselling business of his own, in developing which he soon
                    gave evidence of remarkable tact, energy, and intelligence. In 1798 he entered
                    into partnership with his brother-in-law, J. H. Besser, with whose aid he
                    rapidly succeeded in forming an establishment which commanded universal
                    confidence and respect. By his marriage with a daughter of the poet Matthias
                    Claudius (in 1797) he was brought into intimate relation with a group of
                    Protestant writers, who, although of a liberal tendency, retained a strong
                    belief in the essential doctrines of Christianity; and they exercised a powerful
                    influence on the growth of his religious opinions. This, however, did not
                    prevent him from being on friendly terms with a number of eminent Roman Catholic
                    authors. Perthes was an ardent patriot; and during the period of Napoleon’s
                    supremacy he distinguished himself by his steady resistance to French
                    pretensions. His zeal for the national cause led him to issue (in 1810-11) <hi
                    rend="italic">Das Deutsche Museum,</hi> to which many of the foremost publicists
                    in Germany contributed. For some time the French made it impossible for him to
                    live in Hamburg; and when, in 1814, he returned, he found that his business had
                    greatly fallen off and that it would have to be thoroughly reorganized. In 1821,
                    his first wife having died, he left Hamburg, transferring his business there to
                    his partner, and went to Gotha, where he established what ultimately became one
                    of the first publishing houses in Germany. Among other important works issued by
                    him may be named the <hi rend="italic">Theologische Studien und Kritiken</hi>
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Geschichte der europäischen Staaten,</hi> the latter
