                    smarting skin) is the name given, from one of its early symptoms, to a peculiar
                    disease, of comparatively modern origin, occurring among the peasantry, in
                    Lombardy and other provinces of northern Italy, and in the Asturias <hi
                    rend="italic">(mal</hi><hi rend="italic">de la</hi><hi rend="italic">rosa),</hi>
                    Gascony, Roumania, and Corfu. It is a progressive disease of nutrition tending
                    towards profound paralytic and mental disorders, and is associated to a very
                    significant extent, if not even invariably, with a staple diet of damaged maize
                    along with other peculiarly wretched and hopeless conditions of living. Although
                    Lombardy is the garden of Italy, its peasantry are over-worked, under-paid, and
                    underfed; instead of a diet suited to their severe labour, their sustenance
                    consists largely of the more worthless kinds of Indian corn of their own
                    growing, the produce of poorly-cultivated ground, sown late, harvested before
                    maturity, and stored carelessly in its wet state; even if they grow a certain
                    proportion of good maize-corn the millers, to whom they are often in debt, are
                    more likely to grind the worst samples for the peasants’ own use. The flour is
                    either made into a kind of porridge—the “polenta” of Italy, the “cruchade” of
                    Gascony, or the “mamaliga” of Roumania— or it is made into loaves, without
                    yeast, baked hastily on the surface only or on one side, and raw and wet within,
                    large enough to last a week, and apt to turn sour and mouldy before the week is
                    out.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Of the peasantry of

                    little flesh, they drink little wine; their usual diet is Indian corn, with
                    beans, peas, chestnuts, apples, pears, melons, and cucumbers; and even their
                    bread, made of Indian corn, has neither barm nor leaven, but is unfermented, and
                    in the state of dough; their drink is water” (ii. 14).</p><p>The following is
                    the most recent account (by Dr Petit) of the condition of the peasantry in the
                    pellagrous district of the Gironde:</p><p>“The cultivation of this district
                    consists of millet, rye, a small quantity of maize, and a few rare vineyards.
                    The soil does not suffice for the nourishment of the miserable population who
                    cultivate it. They are slovenly, and sleep in their clothes; their labour is in
                    general of the severest kind, and they are very ill fed. Their food is mostly a
                    porridge of millet; maize is rarely part of their diet [elsewhere he says, “in
                    all these provinces the flour of maize enters largely into the food of the
                    people ’’], which includes a little rye-bread, sour most of the time, a few
                    sardines, and rancid lard. Meat is almost excluded from their food; sometimes on
                    fête-days one may see a quarter of mutton or veal at the repast. Their usual
                    drink is water, and mostly bad water; wine is not drunk except in well-to-do
                    families. Their dwellings are deplorable; they are low-roofed and damp, built of
                    wattle, and constantly enveloped in reek. It often happens that man and beast
                    live together. Pellagra rages as an endemic among these
                    populations.”</p></note></p>
                <p>That pellagra is not a <hi rend="italic">morbus miseriae</hi> pure and simple,
                    wanting some more specific cause, will be at once apparent when we consider that
                    the misery of living is as old as the human race, whereas pellagra is a disease
                    of the last hundred years or so, and that in Ireland, Russia, Upper Silesia,
                    Galicia, or other headquarters of the <hi rend="italic">morbi</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">miseriae,</hi> pellagra is unknown. The special factor is
                    undoubtedly maize as an article of diet or as the staple diet; but it is, on the
                    other hand, perfectly clear that there is nothing in a maize diet itself to
                    induce pellagra. Compared with the enormous extent of the maize-zone both in the
                    western and eastern hemispheres, the pellagra-area is a mere spot on the map;
                    excluding Corfu, it lies between the parallels of 46° and 42° N.; and the
                    exception of Corfu is a significant one. It is only since 1856 that pellagra
                    ha;.: become endemic in that island. Maize has always thriven well there; but
                    wine-growing has displaced it to a great extent, and the maize, which is still
                    largely in request with the peasantry, is now mostly imported; it is in fact
                    chiefly Roumanian maize of an inferior kind, and all the more deteriorated owing
                    to its long water-transit by way of the Danube and Black Sea. Again, in the
                    Danubian provinces themselves the peasantry of Transylvania, who are by no means
                    well off, are free from pellagra, notwithstanding their addiction to polenta,
                    having long ago learned the art of husbandry from the Saxon part of the
                    population; they allow the maize to ripen to the utmost, and then let it dry on
                    the ground and afterwards in barns, whereas the Wallack peasantry of Roumania,
                    who are subject to pellagra, gather the corn before it is ripe, and shoot it
                    into pits where it becomes musty. In other countries where the conditions of
                    climate and soil are somewhat trying for maize, as in Burgundy, Franche Comté,
                    and the Bresse in France, and in Mexico, the greatest care is taken to dry the
                    Indian corn before it is stored; and it may be said that wherever these
                    precautions are taken pellagra does not follow. It has happened on several
                    occasions, after a particularly bad maize-harvest, that pellagra has risen
                    almost to an epidemic. Again, its prevalence within its actual endemic area
                    varies much from province to province or from commune to commune, being always
                    last where the maize-diet is supplemented by wheaten flour, rice, beans,
                    chestnuts, potatoes, or fish.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Characters of the Disease.—</hi> The indications of pellagra
                    usually begin in the spring of the year, declining towards autumn, and recurring
                    with increasing intensity and permanence in the spring seasons following. A
                    peasant who is acquiring the malady feels unfit for work, suffers from
                    headaches, giddiness, singing in the ears, a burning of the skin, especially in
                    the hands and feet, and diarrhoea. At the same time a red rash appears on the
                    skin, of the nature of erysipelas, the red or livid spots being tense and
                    painful, especially where they are directly exposed to the sun. About July or
                    August of the first season these symptoms disappear, the spots on the skin
                    remaining rough and dry. The spring attack of the year following will probably
                    be more severe and more likely to leave traces behind it; with each successive
                    year the patient becomes more like a mummy, his skin shrivelled and sallow, or
                    even black at certain spots, as in Addison’s disease, his angles protruding, his
                    muscles wasted, his movements slow and languid, and his sensibility diminished.
                    Meanwhile there are more special symptoms relating to the nervous system,
                    including drooping of the eyelid, dilatation of the pupil, and other disorders
                    of vision, together with symptoms relating to the digestive system, such as a
                    red and dry tongue, a burning feeling in the mouth, pain on swallowing, and
                    diarrhoea. Peasants with this progressive malady upon them come to the towns
                    spring after spring seeking relief at the various hospitals, and under a good
                    regimen and a permanently improved diet the malady is often checked. But after a
                    certain stage the disease is confirmed in a profound disorganization of the
                    nervous system; spasms of the limbs begin to occur, and contractures of the
                    joints from partial paralysis of the extensor muscles and preponderant action of
                    the flexors; melancholy, imbecility, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n498/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0498-0477"/> and a strong suicidal tendency are common
                    accompaniments. A large number of pellagrous peasants end their days in lunatic
                    asylums in a state of drivelling wretchedness or raving madness; many more drag
                    out a miserable existence in the communes where their working years had been
                    spent, sometimes receiving the communal relief to which the law entitles them;
                    while the cases that are reckoned curable are in Italy received into the various
                    endowed hospitals, of which there are a large number. Cases that are rapidly
                    fatal end in delirium or a state of typhoid stupor; the more protracted cases
                    are cut off at last by rapid wasting, colliquative and ill-smelling sweats,
                    profuse diarrhoea, and dropsy. After death a variety of textural changes are
                    found, which may be referred in general to trophic disorders, or disorders of
                    tissue-nutrition; in a considerable number the kidneys are in the contracted
                    state corresponding to the clinical condition of Bright’s disease without
                    albuminuria; another condition often remarked is thinning of the muscular coats
                    of the intestine; deposits of pigment in the internal organs are also
                    characteristic, just as the discoloration of the skin is during life.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Treatment.—</hi> There is hardly any doubt as to the remedy for
                    pellagra, just as there is hardly any doubt as to its cause. The question is
                    mainly one of the social condition of the peasantry, of their food and wages; it
                    is partly, also, a question of growing Indian corn on a soil or in a climate
                    where it will not mature unless with high farming. There is nothing in the
                    resources of medicine proper to cure this disease; as the cause is, so must the
                    remedy be.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Affinities of Pellagra.—</hi> The disease has the general
                    characters of a tropho-neurosis. The early involvement of certain areas of the
                    skin, especially in exposed places such as the hands and feet, suggests leprosy;
                    as in that disease, there is first hyperaesthesia and then loss of sensibility,
                    sometimes a thickening of the surface and discolorations; and, although in
                    pellagra the onset each successive spring and the subsidence towards autumn are
                    distinctive, yet in leprosy also the cutaneous disorder is apt to come and go at
                    first, reappearing at the same spots and gradually becoming fixed. The grand
                    difference in leprosy, at least in the nodular variety of it, is that a new
                    growth of a granulomatous kind arises at these spots in the skin and around the
                    nerves. The occasional deep discoloration of the pellagrous skin in certain
                    spots has suggested a resemblance to Addison’s disease of the suprarenals, and
                    has even made the diagnosis difficult. But after the cutaneous disorders the
                    course of pellagra is something <hi rend="italic">sui generis</hi>; the
                    melancholy, imbecility, or mania, as well as the mummified state of the body,
                    are peculiar to it. With ergotism the points of resemblance are more perhaps in
                    the causation than in the nosological characters; both diseases are specifically
                    due to damaged grain, ergotism being caused by the presence of an actual bulky
                    parasitic mould on rye, whereas pellagra is more probably caused by fermentation
                    and decomposition within the proper substance of the maize-corn. As regards
                    heredity, it is much less marked in pellagra than in leprosy, but there are good
                    grounds for believing that the disease is in fact inherited sometimes by the
                    offspring; infants at the breast may show the symptoms of it, but that fact is
                    not in itself conclusive for heredity, for the reason that infants at the breast
                    are partly fed on the household polenta. As regards contagiousness, there is no
                    more proof of it in pellagra than there is in leprosy.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic subscript"> -</hi><hi rend="italic">Geographical Distribution
                    and History.—</hi> Pellagra is peculiarly a disease of the peasantry, being
                    hardly ever seen in residents of the towns. In Italy the number of peasants
                    affected by it was estimated in 1879 at 100,000, the distribution being as
                    follows :—Lombardy, 40,838; Venetia, 29,386; Piedmont, 1692; Liguria, 148;
                    Aemilia, 18,728; Tuscany, 4382; the Marches and Umbria, 2155; Rome, 76. In
                    Lombardy the worst centres are in the provinces of Brescia, Pavia, Piacenza, and
                    Ferrara. In Italy the disease has increased very considerably within the last
                    thirty years; thus, in the province of Vicenza the number of persons known to be
                    pellagrous in 1853-55 was 1380, in 1860 it was 2974, and in 1879 it had risen to
                    3400. There, are no accurate returns from the Asturias and other affected
                    provinces of Spain, but the malady there is said to have declined very
                    materially of late. In Gascony, where it did not begin until about fifty years
                    ago, it is somewhat common, more in the Landes than in the Gironde; in one
                    district of the latter Petit estimates that there are 200 cases in a population
                    of 6000. In Roumania the total number is given at 4500, Moldavia having a larger
                    share than Wallachia. In Corfu it exists in 27 out of the 117 communes, the
                    proportion of cases for the whole island being 3'2 per 1000 inhabitants.</p>
                <p>Maize was grown in Europe for many years before pellagra showed itself (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Maize)</hi>; but the outbreak of the disease corresponds on the
                    whole closely in time (particularly in Gascony and Roumania) with the
                    introduction of an inferior kind of maize as the staple food of the peasantry.
                    The first accounts of pellagra come from Spain. Casal in 1762 described the
                    disease in the Asturias under the name of <hi rend="italic">mal</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de la</hi><hi rend="italic">rosa</hi>; it is said to have been
                    noticed first in 1735 around Oviedo, being then confined within very narrow
                    limits. The Asturias are still its headquarters in Spain, but it is prevalent
                    also in Burgos, Navarra, Zaragoza, Lower Aragon, Guadalajara, and Cuenca, and.
                    it is met with in other provinces as well. In Italy it was first reported from
                    the vicinity of Lago Maggiore, and a few years later (in 1750) it broke out
                    simultaneously in the districts of Milan, Brescia, Bergamo, and Lodi, extending
                    afterwards to Como, Cremona, Mantua, and Pavia, and to the whole of Lombardy
                    before the end of the century. It became endemic also in Venetia on the one side
                    and in Piedmont on the other, almost contemporaneously with this. Within the
                    present century it has extended its area southwards into Aemilia and into
                    Tuscany, while it has become more prevalent in its earlier seats at the same
                    time. There is very little of it in central Italy, while southern Italy with
                    Sicily, is absolutely exempt, notwithstanding the common use of Indian corn in
                    the form of bread and macaroni. The first authentic information of its existence
                    in Gascony came from near Arcachon in 1818, after which it spread along the
                    coast of the Gironde and the Landes. It has extended subsequently along the left
                    bank of the Garonne and towards the Pyrenees; but around Dax it is said to have
                    decreased considerably of late. In Roumania, where the medical profession is
                    unanimous in tracing it to the use of damaged maize, it dates from about
                    1833-46. It is only since 1856 that it has become endemic in Corfu, under the
                    circumstances already mentioned.</p>
