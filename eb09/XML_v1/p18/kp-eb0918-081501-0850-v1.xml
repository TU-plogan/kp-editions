                    “Phosphorus” <hi rend="italic">(φωςφόρος,</hi> light-bringer) had currency in
                    chemistry as a generic term for all substances which shine in the dark without
                    burning, until the name came to be monopolized by a peculiar kind of
                    “phosphorus” which was discovered, some time previous to 1678, by the German
                    alchemist Brand of Hamburg. Brand, hoping to obtain thereby an essence for the
                    “ennobling” of silver into gold, subjected urine-solids to dry distillation. In
                    lieu of the hoped-for essence he obtained as part of the distillate a wax-like,
                    easily fusible solid which, besides being phosphorescent, readily caught fire,
                    to burn with a dazzling light into a white solid acid. The new phosphorus
                    naturally excited universal interest; but it was, and remained, only a rather
                    costly chemical curiosity until Scheele, in 1771, starting from the discovery of
                    Gahn that bone-ash is the lime-salt of a peculiar non-volatile acid, proved that
                    this acid is identical with the one formed in the combustion of phosphorus, and
                    that the latter, being only “phlogisticated” bone-ash acid, can be obtained from
                    it by distillation with charcoal at a high temperature. This method of Scheele’s
                    is used to the present day for the manufacture of phosphorus, and even the
                    theoretical notion on which it rests is recognized as correct as far as it goes,
                    anhydrous bone-ash acid being a compound of phosphorus with oxygen the formation

                    (“phlogiston”) of each in the kinetic form of heat. That phosphorus is an
                    elementary substance was originally a surmise, which, however, has been
                    confirmed by all subsequent experiences. In comparatively recent times it was
                    found that Brand’s phosphorus is susceptible of passing (by mere loss of energy)
                    into two allotropic modifications, known as “red” and “metallic” phosphorus
                    respectively, so that the name “phosphorus” has again come to assume a generic
                    meaning, being used for these three substances and the element as such
                    conjointly.</p>

                    any kind of phosphate of lime might be used, and in fact mineral phosphates are

                    as a raw material. Such bones (apart from a large percentage of water and a

                <p>The percentages, however, in bones generally are subject to great variation. When
                    bones are heated to redness in the absence of air the organic part is destroyed,
                    and there remains ultimately a cellular tissue of bone-phosphate impregnated, so
                    to speak, with finely-divided charcoal. This black residue, known as
                    “bone-black,” is used largely for the decoloration of sugar-syrup, and, after
                    having been exhausted in this direction, forms a cheap material for the
                    manufacture of bone-ash and consequently of phosphorus; but, as a rule, the
                    phosphorus-manufacturer makes his bone-ash direct from bones, by burning them in
                    a furnace (constructed and wrought pretty much like a limekiln) between
                    alternate layers of coal.</p>
                <p>The burned bones (which retain their original shape) are ground up into granules
                    of about the size of lentils, and these are then placed in a wooden tank coated
                    inside with lead, to be decomposed by means of about their own weight of
                    chamber-acid, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> sulphuric acid containing about 60
                    per cent, of real H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> SO <hi rend="subscript">
                    4</hi>. To accelerate the action the bone-meal is mixed with boiling water
                    previous to the addition of acid, and steam may be passed into the magma when
                    its temperature threatens to fall too low. The acid readily decomposes the
                    carbonate of the boneash, and then acts, more slowly, on the phosphate, the
                    process being completed in about twenty-four hours; and the result, in regard to
                    the latter, is that about two-thirds of the phosphate are decomposed into
                    sulphate of lime (gypsum), which separates out as a precipitate, and phosphoric
                    acid, which unites with the residual one-third of the phosphate and the water
                    into a solution of superphosphate of lime—</p>

                <p>To eliminate the gypsum the mass is diluted with water, allowed to settle, and
                    the solution drawn off with lead syphons, then the residue is washed by
                    decantation, and ultimately filtered off through a bed of straw contained in a
                    cask with a perforated bottom. The spent heat of the distillation-furnace is
                    utilized to concentrate the united liquors to about 1 ’ 45 specific gravity,
                    when a remnant of gypsum separates out, which must be removed. The clarified
                    liquor is then mixed with about one-tenth of its weight of granulated charcoal,
                    and the whole evaporated in an iron basin until the mass is sufficiently dry to
                    be passed through a copper sieve and granulated. The granules are heated
                    cautiously over a fire, to be dehydrated as far as possible without loss of
                    phosphorus (as phosphuretted hydrogen); and the dry mass is then transferred to
                    fireclay retorts—either pear-shaped with bent-down necks, or cylinders, about 18
                    inches long and 4 inches in diameter, with straight necks—arranged within a
                    powerful furnace. The condensers are made of earthenware, and must be so
                    arranged that loss of phosphorus by combustion is avoided as far as possible;
                    its condensation takes care of itself. One construction is to give the condenser
                    the form of a bell-jar resting in a saucer containing water; lateral orifices in
                    the bell serve to couple every two bells into one, to unite each with its
                    retort-neck, and to send the vapour (of phosphuretted hydrogen, carbonic oxide,
                    and other poisonous gases) into a chimney, where they take fire spontaneously,
                    and the products are carried away by the draught. While the condensers are being
                    adjusted the fire is kindled and raised very slowly, but ultimately forced up to
                    the highest temperature which the retorts can stand, and maintained at this
                    pitch until the appearance of the flames of the escaping vapours proves the
                    absence from them of phosphorus, free or combined. This takes from thirty-six to
                    forty-eight hours. The reduction-process, though in reality very complex, is in
                    its principal features easily understood. The acid-phosphate behaves as if it
                    were a mere mixture of -∣ × P <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 5</hi> + ⅜ × P <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 5</hi> 3CaO (bone-phosphate). The quasi-free acid (⅜P <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi>) is reduced by the
                    charcoal with formation of carbonic oxide and phosphorus-vapour, one-third of
                    the phosphorus remaining in its original form of bone-phosphate.</p>
                <p>The distillation of phosphorus is rather a dangerous operation, because the
                    connecting pipes at the condensers are apt to get blocked up with frozen
                    phosphorus, and consequently must be cleared from lime by copper or iron wires
                    being pushed through them (at a certain risk to the operator). Another
                    difficulty is that, although a retort may be quite whole in the ordinary sense,
                    it may, and as a rule does, admit of the perspiration of phosphorus-vapour. To
                    render retorts as nearly as possible impermeable to the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n851/mode/1up"

                    coats of some kind of cement, such as a mixture of slaked lime and borax, or a
                    magma of clay, horse-dung, and water. In the collecting and further manipulation
                    of the phosphorus the dangerous inflammability of the substance demands that all
                    operations be conducted under water.</p>
                <p>As soon as the retorts have cooled down sufficiently the condensers are detached
                    and their tubuli bunged up to prevent access of air to the inside. The necks of
                    the retorts are knocked off and thrown into water to save the phosphorus which
                    has condensed within them and to unite it with that of the condensers. From the
                    analysis of the ox-bone quoted we calculate that its ash contains 17‘6 per cent,
                    of phosphorus, of which two-thirds (=11'7 per cent.) should be recoverable as
                    free phosphorus; according to Fleck, the yield of phosphorus is 8 per cent.,
                    while Payen puts it down at 8 to 10 per cent. But this crude phosphorus is
                    largely contaminated with blown-over bone-ash and charcoal and with “red”
                    phosphorus. Its purification used to be effected everywhere by melting it under
                    water of about G0° C., and pressing it through chamois leather by means of a
                    force-pump. In certain French works porous fireclay serves as a filtering
                    medium, while superheated steam supplies at the same time the necessary heat and
                    pressure. By the addition of coarsely-powdered charcoal to the phosphorus the
                    clogging-up of the pores of the fireclay septum is precluded. A more effectual
                    method of purification is to re-distil the crude (or perhaps the previously
                    filtered) phosphorus from out of cast-iron retorts, the necks of which dip half
                    an inch deep into water contained in a bucket. A chemical method of purification
                    is that of Böttcher, who fuses the crude phosphorus (100 parts) under water,
                    with addition of 3’5 parts of oil of vitriol and 3 ‘5 parts of bichromate of
                    potash. The phosphorus passes, -with a feeble gas-evolution, into an almost
                    colourless liquid, with a loss of only 4 per cent, of its weight, as against the
                    10 to 15 per cent, unavoidably involved in the distillation process. To bring
                    the purified phosphorus into the traditional form of sticks it is fused under
                    water and sucked up into slightly conical glass tubes about two-fifths of an
                    inch wide and a foot long; the tubes are closed below with the finger and
                    immersed in cold water to cause the contents to freeze. The solid stick is then
                    pushed out by means of a rod, and cut into pieces with a pair of scissors. For
                    emission into commerce the sticks are put into cylindrical wide-necked glass
                    bottles, or into tin canisters, full of water, which latter had better be mixed
                    with a sufficiency of alcohol or glycerin to prevent freezing (and bursting) in
                    winter time.</p>
                <p>Seubert, about 1&amp;44, invented an ingenious apparatus for the continuous
                    casting of phosphorus-sticks, consisting of a funnel-shaped vessel of copper,
                    terminating below in a long horizontal copper tube, the outer end of which lies
                    within a tank full of cold water. The phosphorus is placed in the funnel,
                    covered with water, and the whole up to the cold-water tank raised (by means of
                    a water-bath and steam-pipes) to a suitable temperature, matters being arranged
                    so that the phosphorus freezes just on arriving at the exit end of the tube. The
                    workman then catches the protruding button of phosphorus and pulls out an
                    endless stick, which is cut up into pieces of the desired length. This ingenious
                    apparatus, however, has not been found to work satisfactorily, and has been
                    given up again in favour of some form of the old method. The loss of one-third
                    of the phosphorus contained in the bone-ash, which is unavoidably involved in
                    the ordinary method of phosphorus-making, can be avoided, according to Wohler,
                    by adding finely-powdered quartz to the mixture which goes into the retorts. The
                    superphosphate is then completely decomposed with formation of a residue of
                    silicate, instead of phosphate, of lime. An improvement by Fleck aims at the
                    utilization of the organic part of the bones. He proposes to recover the fat
                    from the bones by boiling them with water and then the gelatin by digesting them
                    in hydrochloric acid of 1Ό5 specific gravity. The gelatin remains in a coherent
                    form; the phosphate passes into solution as mono-calcic salt, which is recovered
                    by evaporation in crystals and then reduced by distillation with charcoal. None
                    of these (and other) proposals have been much heeded; the manufacture of
                    phosphorus at present, in fact, is almost a monopoly, the bulk of what occurs in
                    commerce being produced by two firms, viz., Albright and Wilson of Oldbury, near
                    Birmingham, and Coignet and Son in Lyons. According to E. Kopp, the production
                    in 1874 amounted to 1200 tons.</p>
                <p>Recently purified phosphorus is a slightly yellowish or colourless solid of about
                    the consistence of beeswax. At low temperatures it is brittle; specific gravity
                    == 1 · 83 at 10’ C. It fuses at 44° ’ 3 C. into a strongly light-refracting
                    liquid of l·743 (Kopp) specific gravity. Neither in the solid nor in the liquid
                    state does it conduct electricity. When heated further (in an inert atmosphere
                    such as hydrogen or carbonic-acid gas) it boils at 290° C., and assumes the form
                    of a colourless vapour which at 1040* C. is 4 ’ 5 times as heavy as air or 65T
                    times as heavy as hydrogen, whence it follows that its molecular weight is 2 ×
                    65Ί = 130 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 2 = very nearly <hi rend="italic"
                    >four</hi> times the atomic weight of phosphorus (31Ό). Phosphorus is insoluble
                    in water, more or less sparingly soluble in alcohol, ether, fatty oils, and oil
                    of turpentine, and very abundantly soluble in bisulphide of carbon. When exposed
                    to the air, and especially to moist air, it suffers gradual oxidation into
                    phosphorous and phosphoric acids with evolution of a feeble light. Phosphorus
                    does not phosphoresce in the <hi rend="italic">absence</hi> of oxygen.
                    Singularly, it does not phosphoresce in pure oxygen either, unless the tension
                    of the gas be reduced to some point considerably below one atmosphere (Graham).
                    Phosphorus is a most dangerous poison; doses of as little as 0 ’ 1 gramme ( = 1
                    <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 5 grains) are known to have been fatal to adults.
                    The heads of a few lucifer matches may suffice to kill a child. Phosphorus is
                    used chiefly for the manufacture of lucifer matches (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Matches,</hi> vol. xv. pp. 625, 626) and also in the manufacture of iodide of
                    methyl and other organic preparations used as auxiliary agents in the tar-colour
                    industry. Phosphorus-paste, made by working up a small proportion of phosphorus
                    melted under water in a hot mortar with flour, is used as poison for vermin.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Reel Phosphorus. —</hi> A red infusible solid which is always
                    produced when ordinary phosphorus is made to burn in an insufficient supply of
                    air, and also by the long-continued action of sunlight on phosphorus-sticks kept
                    under water, used to be taken for a lower oxide of the element, until A. v.
                    Schrötter of Vienna showed, in 1845, that it is nothing but an allotropic
                    modification of the elementary substance. A given mass of ordinary phosphorus
                    can be converted almost completely into the red modification by keeping it at
                    240° to 250° C. in the absence of air for a sufficient time. The addition of a
                    trace of iodine to phosphorus at 200° C. brings about the conversion suddenly
                    with large evolution of heat (Brodie). Red phosphorus is now an article of
                    chemical manufacture. The phosphorus is simply heated, and kept at the requisite
                    temperature, within a large iron pot which communicates with the atmosphere by
                    only a narrow pipe. At a very slight expense of the material the air within the
                    apparatus is quickly deoxygenated and converted into (inert) nitrogen. The
                    requisite steady temperature is maintained by means of a bath of molten solder.
                    By the mere effect of the heat the phosphorus becomes more and more viscid and
                    darker and darker in colour, and is at last completely converted into a dark-red
                    opaque infusible solid. This, however, always includes a small proportion of the
                    ordinary modification, which is most readily extracted by powdering the crude
                    product and exhausting it with bisulphide of carbon, which does not affect the
                    red kind. A less expensive method is to boil the powdered raw product with
                    successive quantities of caustic-soda ley, when the ordinary phosphorus only is
                    dissolved as hypophosphite with evolution of phosphuretted hydrogen. The residue
                    is washed and <pb break="no"

                    air, nor by aerated water, hence it is neither phosphorescent nor poisonous.
                    When heated in air to about 260° C. it begins to pass into the ordinary
                    modification and consequently burns, readily enough, into the same phosphoric

                    ordinary phosphorus. The balance of 883 units is the equivalent of the surplus
                    of energy contained in the yellow as compared with the red modification. This
                    accounts for the relative chemical inertness of the latter. The specific gravity
                    of red phosphorus is 2 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 089 to 2’106 at 17°C.; its

                    remains, partly in the shape of dark resplendent plates, partly in the form of

                <p><hi rend="italic">Detection of Phosphorus.—</hi> The detection of (ord.)
                    phosphorus in medico-legal cases offers no difficulty as long as the phosphorus
                    has not disappeared by oxidation. In the case of a mass of food or the contents
                    of a stomach the first step is to spread out the mass on a plate and view it in
                    the dark. A very small admixture of phosphorus becomes visible by its
                    phosphorescence. Failing this, the mass is distilled with water· from out of a
                    glass flask connected with a <hi rend="italic">glass</hi> Liebig’s condenser in
                    a dark room. The minutest trace of phosphorus suffices to impart phosphorescence
                    to the vapours at some stage of the distillation. Should this second test fail
                    we must search for phosphorous acid, which may be there as a product of the
                    oxidation of phosphorus originally present as such. To test for phosphoric acid
                    would be of no use, as salts of this acid are present in all animal ⅛nd
                    vegetable juices and tissues. Phosphorous acid, if present, can be detected by
                    treating the mass, in a properly constructed gas-evolution apparatus, with pure
                    hydrochloric acid and zinc. The hydrogen gas evolved must be purified by passing
                    it over pieces of solid caustic potash, and made to stream out of a narrow
                    platinum nozzle. If the reagents are pure and phosphorous acid is absent the gas
                    burns with a colourless flame, which remains so even when depressed by means of
                    a porcelain plate; in the presence of phosphorous acid the gas contains
                    phosphuretted hydrogen, which causes the flame of the gas to exhibit a green
                    core, at least when depressed by means of a porcelain plate. The test is very
                    delicate, but in interpreting a positive result it must be remembered that it
                    applies likewise to hypophosphorous acid, and that certain salts of this acid
                    are recognized medicinal agents.</p>
                <p>Of all phosphorus compounds ortho - phosphates are the commonest, and they can be
                    detected by the tests given below under “Phosphates.” All other phosphorus
                    compounds, when fused with carbonate of alkali and nitre, or heated in sealed-up
                    tubes with strong nitric acid to a sufficient temperature, are changed so that
                    the phosphorus assumes the form of ortho - phosphoric acid, which is easily
                    detected. Either of the two operations named (by the mere action of the alkali
                    or of the acid <hi rend="italic">qua</hi> acid) converts what may be present of
                    meta - phosphoric or pyro - phosphoric into ortho-phosphoric acid.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Phosphor-Bronze.—</hi> This name has been given to a class of
                    useful metallic substances produced by the chemical union of either pure copper
                    or of copper alloys with phosphorus. Most commercial copper is contaminated with
                    a small proportion of its own suboxide, which, in the case of an otherwise pure
                    metal, detracts from its tenacity and plasticity; and all ordinary bronze is
                    subject to a similar contamination, because, whatever kind of copper may have
                    been used in making it, the tin is sure to suffer partial oxidation, and some of
                    this oxide, as Montefiori-Levi and Künzel found, remains diffused throughout the
                    casting, and diminishes its homogeneity and solidity. Experience shows that both
                    in the case of copper and bronze the oxygen present as metallic oxide can be
                    removed by introduction into the fused metal of a judiciously limited proportion
                    of phosphorus, which takes out the oxygen (and itself) into the slag it⅛
                    phosphate, and thus produces a purely metallic and consequently superior metal.
                    A small excess of phosphorus in either case effects further improvement. A
                    phosphor-copper containing 0Ί to 0’5 per cent, of the non-metallic element has
                    all the plasticity of the pure metal coupled with higher degrees of hardness and
                    solidity. An alloy of from 0’5 to 2’0 per cent, gives good castings, because,
                    unlike the pure metal, it does not form blisters on solidifying. In the case of
                    phosphorized bronze the presence of somewhat more than 0 ’5 per cent, of
                    phosphorus (in the finished alloy) produces a warmer tone of colour (more
                    gold-like than that of the plain alloy), a finer grain (similar to that of
                    steel), a higher degree of elasticity, and a higher breaking-strain. The latter
                    may be more than double that of the corresponding plain bronze. By increasing or
                    diminishing the proportion of phosphorus the mechanical properties of a
                    phosphor-bronze can be modified at will, within wide limits. By its fine colour
                    and its perfect fluidity when molten it lends itself particularly well for the
                    casting of artistic or ornamental articles. The introduction of phosphorus into
                    the metal is best effected by fusing it with the proper proportion of a <hi
                    rend="italic">rich</hi> phosphor-copper. A phosphor-copper containing about 9
                    per cent, of phosphorus can be produced as follows. A kind of potential
                    phosphorus (“phosphorus mass”) is made by mixing superphosphate of lime with 20
                    per cent, of charcoal, and dehydrating the mixture at a <hi rend="italic"
                    >dull</hi> red heat. Six hundred parts of this mass are mixed with 975 of
                    copper-turnings and 75 of charcoal, and kept at copper-fusion heat for sixteen
                    hours within a graphite crucible. The phosphor-copper is obtained in the form of
                    detached granules, which are picked out, re-fused, and cast out into cast-iron
                    moulds. Phosphor-bronze has only come to be popularly known during the last
                    decade or two; but as early as 1848 A. &amp; H. Parkes of Birmingham took out a
                    patent for phosphoriferous metallic alloys.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Phosphuretted Hydrogens.—</hi> Of these three are known,

                <p>also by the action of water on the phosphides of highly basilous metals. The gas
                    evolved by any of these processes is impure; that obtained by the second or
                    third invariably includes vapour of P <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, and consequently is self-inflammable. Pure phosphine
                    can be obtained only by decomposing solid iodide of phosphonium with
                    concentrated caustic potash-ley in a suitable gas-evolution bottle previously
                    filled with hydrogen to avoid explosions. It is a colourless gas, smelling
                    intensely like putrid fish, and very poisonous. It is slightly soluble in water,
                    and takes fire in air only beyond 100° C. It may be mixed with pure oxygen
                    without change; but when the mixture is suddenly expanded it explodes violently.
                    Notwithstanding its analogy to ammonia (NH <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>),
                    phosphine is only very feebly basic. It unites with gaseous hydriodic or
                    hydrobromic acid into solid phosphonium salts PH <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> (I
                    or Br); but these are both decomposed by water into the respective acids and
                    phosphine. Pure phosphine is little known; chemists are more familiar with the
                    (impure) gas which is evolved when “phosphide of calcium” is thrown into λvater,
                    and which, containing vapour of P <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, at once catches fire when it bubbles out of the water
                    into the air, with formation of steam and a smoke of meta-phosphoric acid, which
                    latter, in a still atmosphere, assumes the form of an exquisite vortex-ring.
                    During the last decade or so this reaction has come to be pretty extensively
                    utilized in navigation for producing a light on the surface of the sea at night,
                    in case of accidents, and for other purposes. A British patent for this useful
                    application of phosphide of calcium was granted (as No. 1828) to the agent of
                    Silas and Pegot Ogier of Paris on the 8th of August 1859, but allowed to lapse
                    in 1863, to be subsequently wrought by others. The manufacture of the phosphide
                    is now (1884) being chiefly carried on by one firm (in Warrington, England), and
                    through the courtesy of their chemist, Mr W. G. Johnston, the writer is enabled
                    to give the following details. The preparation of the phosphide is effected
                    within a crucible standing on a support within a furnace, and divided by a
                    perforated false bottom into two compartments. The loλver is charged with pieces
                    of phosphorus, the upper, up to the closely-fitting lid, with fragments of
                    quicklime. The firing is conducted so that the lime is red hot before the
                    phosphorus, through the radiation and conduction of the heat applied above,
                    begins to volatilize. A charge yielding 20 ìb of product is finished in from
                    five to eight hours. The reaction is very complex, but it is easy to see through
                    its general course; part of the phosphorus deoxidizes lime with formation of P
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> s</hi>, which unites with
                    other lime into phosphate, and of calcium, which combines with other phosphorus
                    into phosphides. Of the latter, PCa seems to predominate, and consequently the
                    product, when thrown into water, should yield chiefly the hydride P <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>; but this latter very
                    readily breaks up into phosphine and solid hydride P <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi> H. The crude phosphide forms a brown stonelike mass, which must at once
                    be secured in air-tight receptacles. But most of it is immediately worked up
                    into “lights” of various kinds, of which the “life-buoy light” may be selected
                    as an example. It consists of a cylindrical tinned-iron box, the upper half of
                    which is taken up by an inverted hollow box, which serves as a float when the
                    light is in the water. The lower half contains <pb break="no"

                    Two small circular portions of the top and bottom respectively consist of soft
                    metal (lead). These are pierced with an appended pricker before the apparatus
                    goes overboard along with the buoy, to which it is attached by means of a cord.
                    The water penetrates through the lower hole'and the gas comes out through the
                    upper and burns with a brilliant flame, which is from 9 to 18 inches high and
                    lasts for about half an hour. A larger similar contrivance, intended to be
                    accommodated within a bucket full of water on deck, serves as an
                    inextinguishable night-signal to ships in distress. By the British Merchant
                    Shipping Act, 1876, Vict. 21, every sea-going passenger-steamer and every
                    emigrant-ship must be provided with arrangements for inextinguishable
                    distress-lights and life-buoy lights. In the British navy a peculiar form of the
                    phosphide of calcium light is used in connexion with torpedo-practice.</p>

                    impure forms of amorphous or massive apatite, modified more or less by
                    disintegration. It occurs (a) in massive, irregular, corroded-looking nodules
                    embedded in limestone or other kinds of soft rock near Amberg (Bavaria), in
                    Baden, Wurtemberg, the Weser hills, and in the Teutoburger Wald, and contains
                    from 40 to 80 per cent, of phosphate and up to 3 per cent, of fluoride of
                    calcium; the phosphorite nodules in the sandstone of Kursk and Voronezh, the
                    “South Carolina phosphate,” and the “Lot phosphate” belong to the same category.
                    It is met with (δ) in more or less extensive beds, as “kidneys,” as stalactites,
                    or as a connective cement in breccias; such phosphorite, of which large
                    quantities are found in the Lahn valley, generally contains only from 25 to 60
                    per cent, of phosphate of lime, and includes large percentages of clay or marl,
                    and more or less of the phosphates of iron and alumina. Another variety is (c)
                    black phosphorite slate. A deposit containing 20 per cent, of P.,O <hi

                    in Wales; an earthy deposit is found in the “braunkohle” of Pilgramsreuth in the
                    Fichtelgebirge. Phosphorite is also found (d) in veins, as a stone of very
                    varying structure, generally intermixed with quartz,—for instance at Logrosan in
                    Estremadura (65 to 80 per cent, of phosphate and up to 14 per cent, of fluoride
                    of calcium), also in the Silurian slate of the Dniester.</p>

                    at the constant occurrence of traces of phosphates in the bones of vertebrate
                    animals; the wonder is that the fluorine in these amounts to only Ό05 per

                    preparation of phosphates the oxide P <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 5</hi> affords a natural starting-point. This substance is
                    produced when phosphorus burns in an abundant supply of oxygen or air. Apparatus
                    for the convenient execution of the process on a preparative scale are described
                    in the handbooks of chemistry. Phosphoric anhydride forms a snow-white, loose,
                    inodorous powder, which, when heated in a hard glass tube to redness, sublimes
                    slowly. It is extremely hygroscopic. When thrown into water it hisses like a
                    red-hot iron and passes into the <hi rend="italic">nιeta-acid,</hi> most of
                    which, in spite of its abundant solubility, separates out as a sticky
                    precipitate, which is rather slow in dissolving. It is the most energetic of all
                    dehydrating agents; even sulphuric acid, when distilled with an excess of it,
                    suffers dehydration, and passes into SO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>. The
                    preparation is liable to be contaminated with red phosphorus and phosphorous
                    anhydride (P <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>), also
                    with “white arsenic,” because most commercial phosphorus, being made by means of
                    <hi rend="italic">pyrites-</hi> vitriol, is arseniferous. A freshly-prepared
                    solution of the anhydride in water, being one of the meta-acid, coagulates
                    albumen (as HN0 <hi rend="subscript"> s</hi> does) and gives a white precipitate
                    with nitrate of silver. But, when the solution is allowed to stand, the
                    dissolved meta-acid gradually passes into pyro-acid (P <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> 2H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O), and
                    this latter again gradually passes into ortho-acid (P.,O <hi rend="subscript">
                    5</hi> 3H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O), the highest hydrate. At a boiling
                    heat, especially if a little nitric acid be added, the whole of the dissolved P
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> is converted into
                    ortho-acid in the course of one or two hours. The solution then does not
                    coagulate albumen; it gives no precipitate with nitrate of silver unless the
                    mixture be neutralized with an alkali, when a yellow precipitate of the salt P

                    at temperatures not exceeding 160° C., and ultimately dried at this temperature,
                    leaves its substance P <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript">

                    paragraph is not so easy in practice as it appears on paper; hence it is
                    generally preferred to prepare this substance by the oxidation of ordinary
                    phosphorus with nitric acid. An acid of 1'2 specific gravity works best; weaker
                    acid acts too slowly; if stronger it may act with dangerous violence. One part
                    of phosphorus is placed in a large tubulated retort, connected with an ordinary
                    globular receiver, and treated therein, at a carefully regulated heat, with ten
                    or twelve parts of the acid. When about half the acid has distilled over, it is
                    poured back and the operation resumed and kept on until all the phosphorus is
                    dissolved. The excess of nitric acid is then distilled over as far as
                    conveniently possible and thus recovered. Towards the end of the distillation a
                    fresh gas-evolution sets in through the conversion of previously produced
                    phosphorous acid (H <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> PO <hi rend="subscript">
                    3</hi>) into phosphoric. The residual liquid in the retort is now poured out
                    into a Berlin porcelain (or, what is better, a platinum) basin, and, if it still
                    contains phosphorous acid, fully oxidized by evaporation with occasional
                    addition of strong nitric acid. Phosphorous acid, if present, is easily detected
                    by the following tests: (1) its solution, when mixed with nitrate of silver and
                    excess of ammonia, gives a <hi rend="italic">black</hi> precipitate of metallic
                    silver; (2) when heated with a solution of corrosive sublimate, HgCL, it
                    produces a white precipitate of calomel, HgCl; (3) when heated to boiling with
                    excess of aqueous sulphurous acid it gives a precipitate of sulphur, or, if
                    arsenious acid is present, of sulphide of arsenic. When the final oxidation is
                    accomplished the acid needs only be freed of the remnant of nitric acid by
                    repeated evaporation with water to be ready for use if arsenic be absent. As a
                    rule, however, this impurity is present and must be removed by diluting the
                    acid, passing in sulphuretted hydrogen first at 70° C., and then in the cold,
                    and allowing to stand for twenty-four hours, when all the arsenic is converted
                    into sulphide, which, <hi rend="italic">after</hi> elimination of the excess of
                    sulphuretted hydrogen by continued exposure to air at a gentle heat, is filtered
                    off. In practice, as a rule, the filtrate is being concentrated to some
                    predetermined specific gravity and preserved as aqueous phosphoric acid, which
                    preparation is official, and used besides for the cleansing of metallic
                    surfaces, in lithography, and for other purposes. The British pharmacopoeia
                    prescribes for the official acid a strength corresponding to 10 per cent, of P

                    discovery that meta-phosphoric and pyro-phosphoric, although so closely allied

                    to be effected in platinum. Informer times, when phosphorus was expensive, the

                    vitriol, and, after elimination of the gypsum, to supersaturate the liquid with
                    carbonate of soda and filter off the phosphate of lime produced (see p. 815 <hi
                    rend="italic">supra,</hi> where the process is explained indirectly). The salt,
                    from sufficiently strong hot solutions, separates out in large transparent
                    crystals of the composition PO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> HNa <hi

                    and becomes pyro-phosphate, which latter retains its specific character on being
                    dissolved in water. A solution of the (original) salt in water has a mild taste
                    (hence its preferential application as a pleasant purgative); it colours red
                    litmus-paper intensely blue, and does not act upon alkaline carbonate. But, when
                    evaporated with the calculated proportion of carbonate of soda (Na <hi

                    ultimately, a red heat, it yields a residue of tri-sodic salt (PO <hi

                    infusible at the highest temperature producible within a platinum crucible over
                    a glass blowpipe. The solution of this salt in water has all the properties of a

                    the predominating component of bone-ash. A hydrate of the salt is produced by
                    precipitating chloride of calcium solution with excess of ordinary phosphate of
                    soda, mixed with enough of ammonia to produce (virtually) trialkaline salt, as a

                    a carefully adjusted quantity of hydrochloric acid, gradually passes into a mass

                    of this salt, known as “superphosphate,” enters into the composition of many
                    artificial manures. Such superphosphate is made industrially by treating
                    broken-up bones, or powdered bone-ash, or powdered phosphorite, or coprolite, or
                    occasionally apatite with chamber-acid, meaning vitriol of about 60 per cent.,
                    as it comes out of the chamber. The phosphate is mixed with the acid in a
                    lead-ιined trough by means of machinery, when a rather lively reaction sets in,
                    involving the evolution of vapour of water mixed with hydrofluoric acid, and
                    fluoride of silicon if mineral phosphate is used, possibly also with traces of
                    fluoride or chloride of arsenic, and, in any case, with stinking volatile
                    organic substances. The vapour, therefore, must be removed by means of suitable
                    draught arrangements. The mass passes from the trough into a (ventilated)
                    chamber, where the reaction gradually accomplishes itself with ultimate
                    formation of a porous friable mass, dry to the touch. This is superphosphate as
                    it goes out into commerce or is used as an ingredient in making more complex
                    manures. Its value is determined chiefly by its percentage of “soluble
                    phosphoric acid,” meaning the percentage of P <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 5</hi>, extractable as 1 ’ O <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> H

                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> by a certain large proportion of cold water. This
                    percentage is liable to decrease on long-continued storing, especially in the
                    case of mineral superphosphate, through a gradual formation of (or regeneration
                    of originally present) phosphate of iron and alumina, partly, perhaps, also
                    through the spontaneous decomposition of some of the mono-calcic salt into
                    insoluble di-calcic salt and free acid. The portion of the P <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> which has thus become

                    that of the phosphoric acid present is easily calculated. Phosphates soluble in
                    acids, and reprecipitated from their solutions as such by ammonia—as phosphate
                    of lime or alumina, or ferric oxide—used to give great difficulties to the
                    analysts until Sonnenschein founded an excellent quantitative method for their
                    analysis upon a reaction discovered by Swanberg and Struve, which is explained
                    under <hi rend="smallcaps">Molybdenum</hi> (vol. xvi. p. 697). The phosphate is
                    dissolved in nitric acid (hydrochloric is less to be recommended) and the
                    solution mixed, and kept for some hours at 40° C., with a large excess of a
                    solution of molybdate of ammonia in excess of nitric acid. The phosphoric acid
                    (along with any arsenic acid that may be present) comes down as yellow
                    crystalline phospho-molybdate of ammonia, soluble in phosphoric acid and
                    slightly in water, but insoluble in <hi rend="italic">dilute</hi> nitric acid in
                    the presence of a sufficiency of nitrate of ammonia. The precipitate is soluble

                    explained. Neither of the two methods applies directly to meta-phosphates or
