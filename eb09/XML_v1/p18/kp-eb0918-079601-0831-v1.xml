                <p><label type="entry">PHILOSTRATUS</label>, the eminent Greek sophist, was probably
                    born in Lemnos between 170 and 180 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> From his
                    incidental statements respecting himself we learn that he studied at Athens, and
                    was afterwards attached to the court of the empress Julia Domna, consort of
                    Severus. Since he does not speak of her as living, while mentioning her as his
                    patroness in his <hi rend="italic">Life of Apollonius of Tyana,</hi> this work
                    was probably written after her death. From some passages in it and his <hi
                    rend="italic">Lives of the Sophists,</hi> he would seem to have been in Gaul
                    with Caracalla, and he may probably have accompanied that emperor on his
                    progress through his dominions. The only other fixed date we possess for his
                    life is afforded by his dedication of the <hi rend="italic">Lives of the
                    Sophists</hi> to Antonius Gordianus as proconsul. Gordianus was consul in 230,
                    and his proconsulship must have been between that year and 234. It seems to be
                    implied that Philostratus resided in Rome, and, according to Suidas, he lived
                    until the reign of Philip (244-249). His works now extant are a biography of
                    Apollonius of Tyana, <hi rend="italic">Lives of the Sophists, Heroicon’,
                    Imagines,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Epistles.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Life of Apollonius of Tyana</hi> has been partly discussed
                    under <hi rend="smallcaps">Apollonius.</hi> It may be compared to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cyropaedia</hi> of Xenophon as a romance founded on fact, treating
                    of a distinguished historical person, not in an historical spirit, but as an

                    own invention, Philostratus was indebted for his to the narrative attributed to
                    Damis, Apollonius’s travelling companion; and many of the sayings ascribed to
                    Apollonius, such as his bon-mots against Domitian and his protest against
                    gladiatorial combats, are probably authentic. The rest of the work testifies to
                    the increasing fondness of the age for the marvellous, which Lucian had vainly
                    endeavoured to stem in the preceding generation, and to the tendency to set up
                    semi-mythical sages like Pythagoras as prophets, at the expense of sober
                    reasoners like Zeno and Epicurus. Philostratus, however, is careful to disclaim
                    all connexion of his hero with mere vulgar thaumaturgy. The sorcerer, he
                    expressly says, is a miserable person. Apollonius is the sage who foreknows the
                    future not by incantations but by wisdom and conformity to the will of the
                    gods,—a new Pythagoras, the prototype, we can now see, of Apuleius, Plotinus,
                    and the other later Platonists, who, without wholly discarding philosophical
                    method, coquetted with ecstasy and revelation. Philosophy, in truth, had become
                    bankrupt, physical science did not yet exist, and the best minds of the time
                    were necessarily thrown back on the supernatural. Philostratus gives this
                    tendency of the age a concrete expression, and there is no reason to conceive
                    that his work was composed in any spirit of antagonism to Christianity, whose
                    Founder, equally with Apollonius himself, was venerated by his patron Alexander
                    Severus. Though a mass of fiction, it is still very valuable as delineating the
                    ideal of the philosophic character as recognized in the 3d century. It is full
                    of errors in geography and chronology, but possesses great literary merit, being
                    varied, entertaining, animated, and lively and accurate in its pictures of
                    character. <hi rend="italic">Sophisticae certe artis egregium dedit in hoc libro
                    specimen,</hi> says Kayser. The distinction between a philosopher and a sophist
                    is clearly laid down by Philostratus himself in his next important work, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Lives of the Sophists.</hi> The philosopher investigates truth
                    independently; the sophist embellishes the truth, which he takes for granted.
                    The distinction is much the same as that between the theologian and the
                    preacher, or the jurist and the advocate. Philostratus, though by no means
                    attempting detailed biography after the fashion of Diogenes Laertius, has given
                    us interesting sketches of a number of distinguished ornaments of the
                    sophistical profession, mostly his immediate predecessors or contemporaries. He
                    thus affords a lively picture of the intellectual standard of an age full of
                    curiosity and intelligence, but unable to make progress in knowledge for want of
                    a scientific method or a scientific spirit, living on old literary models which
                    it was unable to emulate or vary, and hence compelled to prefer show to
                    substance, and manner to matter. The <hi rend="italic">Heroicon</hi> is a good
                    specimen of the popular literature of the day. It may have arisen out of
                    Caracalla’s visit to Ilion, and the games celebrated by him in honour of
                    Achilles. The subject is the injustice of Homer to Palamedes, which is expounded
                    to a Phoenician merchant by a Thracian vinedresser on the authority of the
                    latter’s tutelary daemon, the hero Protesilaus. It was probably a common theme
                    of declamation in the schools, to which Philostratus has contributed an elegant
                    and graceful setting. The <hi rend="italic">Imagines,</hi> after the life of
                    Apollonius the most entertaining of Philostratus’s writings, is perhaps the most
                    valuable of any from the light it throws on ancient art. The writer is
                    introduced as living in a villa near Naples, which contains a collection of
                    choice paintings. To please the son of his host and his young companions he
                    undertakes to describe and explain the pictures, which are sixty-four in all,
                    including mythological, historical, allegorical, and landscape subjects. The
                    descriptions are exceedingly good, and reveal the skilful word-painter no less
                    than the accomplished connoisseur of art. As pointed out by Μ. Bougot, they
                    either actually are or are intended to be taken for improvisations, which
                    explains some irregularities in the style. It has been much disputed whether
                    they are genuine descriptions of actually existing works of art. The affirmative
                    has been maintained by Goethe and Weicker, the negative by Heyne. In our days
                    the controversy has been revived by two eminent German archaeologists,
                    Friederichs and Brunn, the former impugning, the latter maintaining the actual
                    existence of the pictures. Their arguments are reviewed in a recent and valuable
                    work by E. Bertrand, who sides with Brunn, as also does Helbig. Perhaps the
                    point is not of such extreme moment, for, if Philostratus had not actual
                    pictures in his mind, he must nevertheless have described such as his hearers or
                    readers were in the habit of seeing. The traces of improvisation, however,
                    pointed out by M. Bougot afford a strong argument that he was lecturing upon a
                    visible collection, and in any case his work is a most valuable guide to the
                    manner in which heroic figures were delineated in ancient paintings, to the
                    general grouping and arrangement of such λvorks, and to the qualities which they
                    were expected to possess. Philostratus’s <hi rend="italic">Epistles</hi> are
                    entirely artificial, and mostly amatory. The style is good, and the originals of
                    some pretty conceits appropriated by modern poets may be found in them.<note

                <p>The first complete edition of the works of Philostratus was published by F.
                    Morel, Paris, 1608. It is not much esteemed. That by Olearius (Leipsic, 1709) is
                    much better; but the chief restorer of the text is C. F. Kayser, who, after
                    having edited most of the writings of Philostratus, separately published a
                    collective edition at Zurich in 1844, reissued in 1853, and again at Leipsic in
                    1870-71. There is a very good edition, with a Latin translation, by Westermann
                    (Paris, 1849); this also contains Eunapius ’ s <hi rend="italic">Lives of the
                    Sophists</hi> and the declamations of Himerius. The first two books of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Life of Apollonius</hi> were translated into English by the
                    celebrated and unfortunate Charles Blount in 1680; but the unorthodox nature of
                    the commentary, attributed in part to Lord Herbert of Cherbury, occasioned the
                    work to be prohibited, and it was not continued. A complete translation by E.
                    Berwick, an Irish clergyman, was published in 1809. A French translation by
