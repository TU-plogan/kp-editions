                <p><label type="entry">PERM</label>, a government of Russia, on both slopes of the
                    Ural Mountains, with an area of 128,250 square miles. Though Perm
                    administratively belongs entirely to Russia in Europe, its eastern part (about
                    57,000 square miles) is situated in Siberia, in the basin of the Obi. It is
                    traversed from north to south by the Ural range, a low ridge, from 30 to 45
                    miles in width, thickly covered with forests, and deeply excavated by rivers.
                    The highest summits do not rise above 3600 feet in the northern section of the
                    range (the Vogulian Ural); in the central portion, between 59° and 60° 30' N.
                    lat., they once or twice exceed 5000 feet (Denezhkin, 5027 feet, and
                    Konzhakovskii Kamen, 5135- feet); but the chain soon sinks towards the south,
                    where it barely attains an elevation of 3000 feet. Where the great Siberian road
                    crosses the ridge the highest point is· 1400 feet. Westward the plain of the
                    river Kama is still 500 feet above sea-level at a distance of 120 miles from the
                    main watershed, but to the east the secondary ridges· and spurs of the central
                    chain fall away somewhat more rapidly,—Kamyshloff, 100 miles distant, being
                    situated amidst the lowlands of the Obi at an altitude of less than 200
                    feet.</p>
                <p>The geology of Perm has been the subject of very many investigations since the
                    journeys of Humboldt and Murchison; but several parts of the government still
                    remain unexplored. Granites, diorites, porphyries, serpentines, and Laurentian
                    gneisses and limestones, containing iron, copper, and zinc ores, constitute the
                    main axis of the Ural chain; their western slope is covered by a narrow strip of
                    Huronian crystalline slates, which disappear in the east under the Post-Tertiary
                    deposits of the Siberian lowlands, while on the west narrow strips of Silurian
                    limestones, quartzites, and slates, and separate islands of Devonian deposits
                    appear on the surface. These in their turn are covered with Carboniferous clays
                    and sandstones, containing Coal-measures in several isolated basins. The Permian
                    deposits extend as a regular strip, parallel to the main ridge, over these last,
                    and are covered with the so-called “variegated marls,” which are now considered
                    as Triassic, and which appear only in the western corner of the territory. Perm
                    is the chief mining region of Russia, owing to its wealth in iron, silver,
                    platinum, copper, nickel, lead, chrome ore, and auriferous alluvial deposits.
                    Many rare metals, besides, such as iridium, osmium, rhodium, and ruthenium, are
                    found along with the above, as also a great variety of precious stones, such as
                    sapphires, jacinths, beryls, phenacites, chrysoberyls, emeralds, aquamarines,
                    topazes, amethysts, jades, malachite. Salt-springs appear in the west; and the
                    mineral waters, though still little known, are also worthy of mention.</p>
                <p>The government is very well watered by rivers belonging to the Petchora, Tobol
                    (affluent of the Obi), and Kama systems. The Petchora itself rises in the
                    northern corner of the government, and its tributary the Volosnitsa is separated
                    by a distance of only 4900 yards from the navigable Vogulka, a tributary of the
                    Kama,—a circumstance of some commercial importance. The tributaries of the Tobol
                    (Sosva, Tura, Isset, and Ui) are far more important. Their sources, which
                    approach those of the tributaries of the Kama very closely, early became a link
                    between Russia and Siberia, and the first section of the Siberian railway
                    (completed for 312 miles from Perm to Ekaterinburg) has been planned to connect
                    the Kama at Perm with the Tura at Tumen, whence there is a navigable route by
                    the Siberian rivers to the very heart of western Siberia at Tomsk. The chief
                    river of Perm is, however, the Kama, whose great navigable tributaries the
                    Tchusovaya, Sylva, and Kolva are important channels for the export of the heavy
                    iron goods to Russia,—5,000,000 cwts., valued at upwards of £2,000,000, being
                    annually shipped on these rivers to the Volga. Timber also is floated down many
                    of the smaller streams. Altogether, the rivers supply to some extent the want of
                    roads or the defects of those which exist, the great Siberian highway even <hi

                    usually in a bad state.</p>

                    45,750,000 acres are forest; of this large area only 2,175,600 acres are under
                    proper forest administration. The forests are distributed very unequally,
                    covering 95 per cent, of the area in the north, and only 25 per cent, in the
                    south-east. Fir <hi rend="italic">(Abies sibirica,</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    which have their north-eastern or south-western limits within the government.
                    The climate is severe, the average temperature at different places being as

                <p>The population in 1881 amounted to 2,520,100, of which number 106,500 lived in
                    towns. It consisted chiefly of Great Russians, Bashkirs (about 100,000,
                    including Mescheryaks and Teptyars), about 65,000 Perm yaks or Permians, 25,000
                    Tatars, 8000 Tcheremisses, and some 2500 Voguls. More than a million of the
                    Great Russians are Nonconformists, their number having rapidly increased within
                    the last twenty years. Except in the northern districts, which are covered with
                    marshes and tundras, and in a zone 70 miles wide, which includes the higher and
                    stony parts of the Ural Mountains to the north of the 58th parallel, agriculture
                    is the general occupation of the inhabitants, who are favoured with a very
                    fertile soil in the southern districts. Nevertheless, only 8,000,000 acres are
                    under crops, the proportion of arable land ranging from 2 to 34 per cent, of the
                    area in different districts. Rye, oats, barley, and hemp are raised in all
                    parts, and wheat, millet, buckwheat, and flax in the south. The average crops in
                    recent years have been 4,198,000 quarters of grain and 1,866,400 bushels of
                    potatoes.</p>
                <p>Cattle-breeding is specially developed in the south-east among the Bashkirs, who
                    have large numbers of horses, but is at present decreasing. In 1881 there were
                    837,000 horses, 820,000 horned cattle, 1,055,000 sheep, and 267,000 pigs. These
                    figures vary, however, from year to year, in consequence of the murrains that
                    periodically destroy great numbers of horses and cattle. Agriculture is widely
                    spread among the Bashkirs, Teptyars, and Tcheremisses, and the chase is still a
                    source of wealth, especially among the Voguls. Shipbuilding is developed on the
                    Kama, Vishera (a tributary of the Kama), Sylva, and Tchusovaya; and large
                    amounts of timber, pitch, and tar, as also wooden implements, are exported to
                    the Volga. Some 100,000 hands find occupation in connexion with the mining
                    industry, and a number are engaged in the transport trade to and from Siberia,
                    or in shipping. Mining increases every year, especially since private enterprise
                    has been allowed to develop freely. In 1879 the total production of metals on
                    the miningworks of the crown and of private individuals was (in cwts. ) :—gold,
                    lO2'7; copper, 12,913; pig-iron, 4,457,000; iron, 2,704,000; steel, 599,600;
                    salt, 3,750,000. The working of coal, although recent, promises to be most
                    valuable. In 1865 the aggregate of all manufactures connected with mining hardly
                    exceeded 15,000,000 roubles (£1,500,000) in value. In 1879 it was :—copper,
                    879,800 roubles; pig-iron, 14,076,000; iron, 9,077,900; and steel, 2,218,000.
                    The aggregate of other manufactures, employing 7400 hands, in the same year
                    reached 20,962,000 roubles, against 5,802,000 in I860. The first place is taken
                    by flour-mills (£973,500), folloλved by distilleries (£566,500) and tanneries
                    (£212,300); next in order come the manufactures of spirits, saddlery, woollen
                    cloth, ropes, oils, cakes, paper, chemicals, candles, tallow, soap, matches,
                    wax-candles, glass, pottery, &amp;c. The cutting of precious stones is
                    extensively carried on throughout the villages on the eastern slope of the Ural
                    Mountains, the chief market for them being at Ekaterinburg. Besides, a variety
                    of petty trades are carried on, the manufacture of carpets in the south-east
                    (Tumen carpets), as also that of boots at Kungur, being especially worthy of
                    mention.</p>
                <p>An active trade, greatly favoured by the easy communication of the chief centres
                    of the mining industry with the great market of Nijni Novgorod on the one side
                    and with the great network of Siberian rivers on the other, is carried on in
                    metals and metal wares, minerals, timber and wooden wares, tallow, skins,
                    cattle, furs, corn, and linseed. Large caravans descend the affluents of the
                    Kama ev ?ry spring, and reach the great fairs of Laisheff and Nijni Novgorod, or
                    descend the Volga to Samara and Astrakhan; while Ekaterinburg is an important
                    centre for the trade with Siberia. The fair at Irbit, second in importance only
                    to that of Nijni Novgorod, is a great centre for supplying Siberia with grocery
                    and manufactured wares, as also for the purchase of tea, of furs for Russia, and
                    of coi n and cattle for the mining districts. About 180 other fairs are held
                    every year within the government. The chief commercial centres are Ekaterinburg,
                    Irbit, Perm, Kamyshloff, Shadrinsk, Tcherdyn, and several iron-works <hi

                <p>Perm is more largely provided with educational institutions and primary schools
                    than most of the governments of central Russia. Besides the usual lyceum and
                    ecclesiastical seminary at Perm, there are a mining school at Ekaterinburg and
                    lower mining schools at Bogoslovsk and Kushva, and two lyceums for women at Perm
                    and Ekaterinburg. The number of primary schools in 1881 was 621 (39,773
                    scholars, including about 8000 girls). The Nonconformists are very diligent in
                    teaching reading (in Old Slavonian) to their girls. The Ural Society of
                    Naturalists, at Ekaterinburg, issues valuable scientific serials, and there are
                    within the government two first-rate meteorological and magnetic observatories,
                    at Ekaterinburg and Bogoslovsk.</p>
                <p>Perm is divided into twelve districts having for their chief towns (with
                    populations in 1879)—Perm (32,350), Kungur (14,000), Krasnoufimsk (3700),
                    Okhansk (1650), Osa (2850), Solikamsk (16,900), and Tcherdyn (3260) in Europe;
                    Ekaterinburg (25,150), Irbit (4250), Kamyshloff (2160), Shadrinsk (11,550), and
                    Verkhoturie (8900) in Asia. Alapaevsk (5450), Dalmatoff (4350), and Dedyukhin
                    (3900, with important salt-works) have also municipal institutions. The
                    iron-works form the following important towns: —Nijne-Taghilsk (30,000 in 1881),
                    Neviansk (14,000), Kyshtym (12,350), Revdinsk (9950), Upper and Lower Turinsk
                    (9750), Nyazepetrovsk (9000), Verkh-Issetskii (7000), Nijne-Issetskii,
                    Sysertskii (5900), Bogoslovsk (4500), Verkhne-Taghilsk (3850), and Suksunsk
                    (3150). The salt-works of Usclie (7700) and Lenva (3250) may also be
                    mentioned.</p>

                    immense quantities on both Ural slopes throughout the territory of Perm. Still
                    larger quantities of implements belonging to an early Finnish, or rather Ugrian,
                    civilization are found everywhere in the basin of the Kama, even in its northern
                    parts, the present district of Tcherdyn. Even Herodotus speaks of the richness
                    of this country inhabited by the Ugrians, who kept up a brisk traffic with the
                    Greek colony of Olbia, and with the Bosphorus by way of the Sea of Azoff and the
                    Volga. The precise period at which the Ugrians left the district for the
                    southern steppes of Russia (the “Lebedia” of Constantine Porphyrogenitus) is not
                    known. In the 9th century the Scandinavians were acquainted with the country as
                    Biarmia, and Byzantine annalists knew it as Permia. Nestor describes it as a
                    territory of the Perm, a Finnish people, some 50,000 of whom still remain, and
                    whose name seems to have been derived from <hi rend="italic">parma,</hi> a
                    Finnish word denoting hilly tracts thickly covered with forests.</p>
                <p>The Russians penetrated into this region at an early date. In the 11th century
                    Novgorod levied tribute from the Finnish inhabitants, and undertook the
                    colonization of the country, which in the treaties of the 13th century is dealt
                    with as a separate territory of Novgorod. In 1471, after the fall of Novgorod,
                    Perm was annexed to Moscow, which in the following year erected a fort to
                    protect Russian settlers and tradesmen from the Voguls, Ostyaks, and Samoyedes.
                    Tcherdyn, the oldest town of Perm, was already in existence in the 15th century.
                    The mineral wealth of the country soon attracted the attention of the Moscow
                    princes, and Ivan III. sent two Germans to search for ores; these they succeeded
                    in finding south of the upper Petchora. A great impulse to colonization and
                    mining was given by the Strogonoffs, when in the 16th century they received
                    immense tracts of land ort the Kama and Tchusovaya. They founded the first salt
                    and iron works, built forts, and colonized the Ural region. Solikamsk, Osa,
                    Okhansk, and Verkhoturie were founded during this century. By the latter part of
                    the century the Russian colonies had spread beyond the Ural Mountains; and in
                    this direction the Strogonoffs continued to extend their mining operations. The
                    rapidly-growing trade with Siberia gave a new impulse to the development of the
                    country. This trade had its centres at Perm and Solikamsk, where merchandise
                    brought up the Kama was unshipped and transported by land to Verkhoturie, at
                    that time the first Siberian town and custom-house on the great highway. Kungur,
                    too, attained some commercial importance. The fair of Irbit in the 17th century
                    became the chief seat of the trade in merchandise, brought both from Russia to
                    Siberia and from Siberia and Bokhara to Russia. Communication with Siberia
                    having taken a northern route, the southern parts of the territory were not
                    colonized until the next century, when Ekaterinburg, Krasnoufimsk, and Alapaevsk
                    were founded. In 1780 the provinces of Perm and Ekaterinburg were instituted,
                    but were soon united into one. (P. A. K.) <pb break="no"
