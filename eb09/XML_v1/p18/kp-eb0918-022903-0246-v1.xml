                <p><label type="entry">PAPPUS, <hi rend="smallcaps">of Alexandria</hi></label>, a
                    geometer of a very high order, belongs to a time when already the Greek
                    mathematicians of great original genius had been succeeded and replaced by a
                    race of learned compilers and commentators, who confined their investigations
                    within the limits previously attained, without adding anything to the
                    development of mathematics. To the general mediocrity Pappus must be considered
                    to be a remarkable exception; for, although much even of his work is of the
                    nature of compilation (which is, however, itself of great historical value),
                    there is yet much the discovery of which cannot well be attributed to any one
                    else. According to Proclus, he was at the head of a school; but how far he was
                    above his contemporaries, how little appreciated or understood by them, is shown
                    by the absence of references to him in other Greek writers, and by the fact that
                    his work had no effect in arresting the decay of mathematical science. In this
                    respect the fate of Pappus strikingly resembles that of Diophantus, another
                    living power amid general stagnation. In reading the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Colledicm</hi> of Pappus, we meet with no indication of the date of the authors
                    whose treatises he makes use of, or of the time at which he himself wrote. If we
                    had no other information than can be derived from a perusal of his work, we
                    should <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n247/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0247-0230"/> only know that he was later than Claudius
                    Ptolemy, whom he quotes often and with respect. Suidas states that he was of the
                    same age as Theon of Alexandria, who wrote commentaries on Ptolemy’s great work,
                    the <hi rend="italic">Almagest,</hi> and flourished in the reign of Theodosius
                    I. (379-395 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.).</hi> Suidas asserts also that Pappus
                    wrote a commentary upon the same work of Ptolemy. But it would seem incredible
                    that two contemporaries should have at the same time and in the same style
                    composed commentaries upon one and the same work, and yet neither should have
                    been mentioned by the other, whether as friend or opponent. We have apparently
                    no reason to question the statement of Suidas that Pappus wrote such a
                    commentary. But the similarity of two such commentaries as those of Pappus and
                    Theon may easily have led Suidas to confuse the two, and so suppose the two
                    authors to have been contemporary. There is, then, reason to believe that Suidas
                    may have been mistaken; we have, however, another authority, whose statement, on
                    the supposition that it is false, is completely incomprehensible. This is the
                    author of certain historical glosses, which are found in the margin of a MS.
                    belonging to the beginning of the 10th century. Here it is stated, in connexion
                    with the reign of Diocletian (284-305 A.D.), that Pappus wrote during that
                    period. Except the two distinctly contradictory statements of Suidas and the
                    scholiast, we have no evidence of the date of Pappus; and it seems accordingly
                    best to accept the date indicated by the scholiast.</p>
                <p>The work of Pappus which has come down to us bore the title σwαγωγ77 or <hi
                    rend="italic">Collection,</hi> as we gather from references in the work itself,
                    and from the scholia appended to the Vatican MS. 218 of the 12 th century. This
                    collection, which consisted of eight books, we possess only in an incomplete
                    form, there being no part remaining of the first book, and the rest also having
                    suffered considerably. It is curious that no ancient writer, with the exception
                    of the author of the appendix to book iii., quotes the work under its proper
                    title, though Eutocius’s reference (Archimedes, p. 139 <hi rend="italic"

                    Pappus.</p>
                <p>The characteristics of Pappus’s <hi rend="italic">Collection</hi> are that it
                    contains an account, systematically arranged, of the most important results
                    obtained by his predecessors, and, secondly, notes explanatory of, or extending,
                    previous discoveries. These discoveries form, in fact, a text upon which Pappus
                    enlarges discursively, many of his additions having no very decided points of
                    connexion with the direct subject under discussion. Very valuable are the
                    systematic introductions to the various books which set forth clearly in outline
                    the contents and the general scope of the subjects to be treated. From these
                    introductions we are able to judge of the style of Pappus’s writing, which is
                    excellent and even elegant the moment he is free from the shackles of
                    mathematical formulae and expressions. At the same time, his characteristic
                    exactness makes his collection a most admirable substitute for the texts of the
                    many valuable treatises of earlier mathematicians of which time has deprived
                    us.</p>
                <p>We proceed to summarize briefly the contents of that portion of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Collection</hi> which has survived, mentioning separately certain
                    propositions which seem, in the light of modern developments of mathematics, to
                    be among the most important.</p>
                <p>Of book i. the whole has been lost. We can only conjecture that it, as well as
                    book ii., was concerned with arithmetic, book iii. being clearly introduced as
                    beginning a new subject.</p>
                <p>The whole of book ii. (the former part of which is lost, the existing fragment
                    beginning in the middle of the 14th proposition) related to a system of
                    multiplication due to Apollonius of Perga. On this subject see Nesselmann, <hi
                    rend="italic">Algebra,</hi><hi rend="italic">der Griechen,</hi> Berlin, 1842,
                    pp. 125-134; and Friedlein, <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Zahlzeichen und das elementare .Rechnen der Griechen und Römer,</hi> Erlangen,
                    1869.</p>
                <p>Book iii. contains geometrical problems, plane and solid. It may be divided into
                    five sections. (1) On the famous problem of finding two mean proportionals
                    between two given lines, which arose from that of doubling the cube, reduced by
                    Hippocrates to the former. Pappus gives the solutions of this problem by
                    Eratosthenes, Nicomedes, and Heron, and finally his own solution of the more
                    general problem of finding geometrically the side of a cube whose content is in
                    any given ratio to that of a given one. (2) On the three different means between
                    two straight lines, the arithmetic, the geometric, and the harmonic, and the
                    problem of representing all three in one and the same geometrical figure. This
                    serves as an introduction to a general theory of means, of which Pappus
                    distinguishes ten kinds, and gives a table representing examples of each in
                    whole numbers. (3) On a curious problem of the same type as Euch L 21. (4) On
                    the inscribing of each of the five regular polyhedra in a sphere. (5) An
                    addition by a later writer on another solution of the first problem of the
                    book.</p>
                <p>Of book iv. the title and preface have been lost, so that the programme has to be
                    gathered from the book itself. At the beginning are various theorems on the
                    circle, leading up to the problem of the construction of a circle which shall
                    circumscribe three given circles touching each other two and two. This and
                    several other problems of contact form the first division of the book. Pappus
                    turns then to a consideration of certain properties of Archimedes’s spiral, the
                    conchoid of Nicomedes (already mentioned in book i. as supplying a method of
                    doubling the cube), and the curve discovered most probably by Hippias of Elis
                    about 420 B.c., and known by the name <hi rend="italic">η τετpaγωviζoυσa,</hi>
                    or quadratrix, from the property that, if it could be practically constructed,
                    it would enable us to square the circle. Having described the ordinary—the
                    mechanical, as Pappus calls it—definition of this curve, he proceeds to show how
                    it might be constructed by projecting orthogonally suitable plane sections of
                    certain surfaces which he calls <hi rend="italic">plectoids</hi> described by
                    means of (a) the helix described on a cylinder, (5) the plane helix, or
                    Archimedes’s spiral. From these propositions it would seem that <hi
                    rend="italic">plectoid</hi> was the Greek general term for surfaces described by
                    the motion of a straight line always passing through a fixed straight line and a
                    curve, and remaining parallel to a fixed plane. Proposition 30 describes the
                    construction of a curve of double curvature called by Pappus the helix on a
                    sphere; it is described by a point moving uniformly along the arc of a great
                    circle, which itself turns about its diameter uniformly, the point describing a
                    quadrant and the great circle a complete revolution in the same time. The area
                    of the surface included between this curve and its base is found—the first
                    instance of quadrature of a curved surface. The rest of the book treats of the
                    trisection of an angle, and the solution of certain problems by means of the
                    quadratrix and spiral.</p>
                <p>In book v., after an interesting preface concerning regular polygons, and
                    containing some remarks upon the hexagonal form of the cells of honeycombs,
                    Pappus addresses himself to the comparison of the areas of different plane
                    figures which have all the same perimeter (following Zenodorus’s treatise on
                    this subject), and of the volumes of different solid figures λvlιich have all
                    the same superficial area, and, lastly, a comparison of the five regular solids
                    of Plato.</p>
                <p>According to the preface, book vi. is intended to resolve difficulties occurring
                    in the so called <hi rend="italic">μικρbs aστρovoμoυμεvos.</hi> It accordingly
                    comments on the <hi rend="italic">Sphaerica</hi> of Theodosius, a treatise of
                    Autolycus, Theodosius’s book on <hi rend="italic">Day and Night,</hi> the
                    treatise of Aristarchus <hi rend="italic">On the Size and Distances of the Sun
                    and Moon,</hi> and Euclid’s <hi rend="italic">Optics</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phaenomena.</hi></p>
                <p>The preface of book vii. explains the terms analysis and synthesis, and the
                    distinction between theorem and problem. Pappus then enumerates works of Euclid,
                    Apollonius, Aristaeus, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n248/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0248-0231"/> and Eratosthenes, thirty-three books in all, the
                    substance of which he intends to give, with the lemmas necessary for their
                    elucidation. With the mention of the <hi rend="italic">Porisms</hi> of Euclid we
                    have an account of the relation of porism to theorem and problem. In the same
                    preface we have enunciated (a) the famous problem known by Pappus’s name— <hi
                    rend="italic">Having given a number of straight lines, to find the geometric
                    locus of a point such that the lengths of the perpendiculars upon, or (more
                    generally} the lines drawn from it obliquely at given inclinations to, the given
                    lines satisfy the condition that the product of certain of them may bear a
                    constant ratio to the product of the remaining ones</hi>; (6) the theorems which
                    since the 17th century have been called by the name of Guldin, but appear to
                    have been discovered by Pappus himself. Book vii. contains also (1) under the
                    head of the <hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">determinata sectione</hi>
                    of Apollonius, lemmas which, closely examined, are seen to be cases of the
                    involution of six points; (2) important lemmas on the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Porisms</hi> of Euclid (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Porism);</hi> (3) a lemma upon
                    the <hi rend="italic">Conics</hi> of Apollonius, which is the first statement of
                    the constant relation between the distances of any point on a conic from the
                    focus and directrix.</p>
                <p>Lastly, book viii. treats principally of mechanics, the properties of the centre
                    of gravity, and some mechanical powers. Interspersed are some questions of pure
                    geometry. Proposition 14 gives a simple construction for the axes of an ellipse,
                    when a pair of conjugate diameters are given.</p>
                <p>Of the whole work of Pappus the best edition is that of Hultsch, bearing the
                    title <hi rend="italic">Pappi Alexandrini Collectionis</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    (reprinted at Venice, 1689, and Pesaro, 1602). A second edition of this work was
                    published by Carolus Manolessius, entitled <hi rend="italic">Pappi

                    Bologna, 1660. The merits of these two works are discussed by Hultsch, who
                    remarks that the editor of the second edition, so far from making good the title
                    and his boastful preface, has actually much marred the original book.</p>
