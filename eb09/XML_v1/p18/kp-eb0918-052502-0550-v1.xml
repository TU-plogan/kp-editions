                <p><label type="entry">PERFUMERY</label> is the art of manipulating odoriferous
                    substances for the gratification of the sense of smell. Perfumes may be divided
                    into two classes, the first of which includes all primitive or simple
                    odoriferous bodies derived from the animal or vegetable kingdom, as well as the
                    definite chemical compounds specially manufactured, while the second comprises
                    the various “bouquets” or “mélanges” made by blending two or more of the
                    foregoing in varying proportions,—toilet powders, dentifrices, sachets, and the
                    like. To the former class belong (1) the animal products, ambergris, castor,
                    civet, musk; (2) essential oils (more properly called attars), mostly procured
                    by distillation; (3) the philicome butters or oils, which are either solid or
                    liquid fats charged with odours by the processes of inflowering or maceration;
                    (4) the odoriferous gum-resins or balsams which exude naturally or from wounds
                    in the trunks of various trees and shrubs, such as benzoin, opoponax, peru,
                    tolu, storax, myrrh; (5) a few chemical bodies, similar in odour to or identical
                    in odoriferous active principle with certain plants, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> nitrobenzol, called attar of mirbane or false almond, vanillin or
                    methyl-protocatechuic aldehyde, coumarin or coumaric anhydride, and a few
                    others. Ammonia and acetic acid are used respectively as smelling salts and in
                    the preparation of aromatic vinegar, but can scarcely be considered as perfumes.
                    The second class contains the endless combination of tinctures for scenting the
                    handkerchief sold under fancy names which may or may not afford a clue to their
                    composition, such as “comédie française,” “eau de senteur,” “eau de Cologne,”

                    parts of the plants which yield them,—the wood (lign aloe, santal, cedar), the
                    bark (cinnamon, cascarilla), the leaves (patchouli, bay, thyme), the flowers
                    (rose, lavender, orange-blossom), the fruit (nutmeg, citron), or the seeds
                    (caraway, almond). Some plants yield more than one, such as lemon and bergamot.
                    They are mostly obtained by distilling with water that part of the plant in
                    which they are contained; but some few, as those from the rind of bergamot (from
                    <hi rend="italic">Citrus bergamia),</hi> lemon (citron zeste, from <hi
                    rend="italic">C. Limonum),</hi> lime (C ’. <hi rend="italic">Limetta),</hi> by
                    “expression.” The outer layer of the cortex is rasped oft* from the unripe
                    fruits, the raspings placed in a canvas bag, and squeezed in a screw or
                    hydraulic press. The attars so obtained are separated from the admixed water by
                    a tap-funnel, and are then filtered (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Oils,
                    Essential,</hi> vol. xvii. p. 748). Certain flowers, such as jasmine, tuberose,
                    violet, cassia, either do not yield their attars by distillation at all, or do
                    it so sparingly as not to admit of its collection for commercial purposes; and
                    sometimes the attar, as in the case of orange (neroli), has an odour quite
                    different from that of the fresh blossoms. In these cases the odours are secured
                    by the processes of inflowering (enfleurage), or by maceration. Both depend upon
                    the remarkable property which fats and oils possess of absorbing odours. The
                    former process has already been described in the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Jasmine</hi> (vol. xiii. p. 595). Maceration consists in soaking the flowers in
                    heated fat; in due time they are strained off and replaced by fresh ones, as in
                    the enfleurage process. The λvhole of the necessary meltings and heatings of the
                    perfumed greases are effected by means of water-baths, whereby the temperature
                    is kept from rising too high. For the manufacture of perfumes for the
                    handkerchief the greases now known as pomades, butters, or philocomes are
                    treated with rectified spirit of wine 60° overproof, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> containing as much as 95 per cent, of absolute alcohol by volume,
                    which practically completely abstracts the odour.</p>
                <p>The gum-resins have been employed as perfumes from the earliest ages; many are
                    referred to in the Old Testament; see <hi rend="smallcaps">Incense</hi> (vol.
                    xii. p. 718) and <hi rend="smallcaps">Frankincense</hi> (vol. ix. p. 709). They
                    are largely used in the manufacture of perfumes, both for burning as pastilles,
                    ribbon of Bruges, incenses, &lt;fcc., and in tinctures, to which they impart
                    their characteristic odours, affording, at the same time, a certain fixity to
                    other perfumes of a more fleeting nature when mixed with them. The chemical
                    perfumes are relatively new. Vanillin, the odoriferous principle of vanilla (<hi
                    rend="italic">V. planifolia),</hi> was first artificially prepared by Tielman
                    and Hermann in Germany, who obtained it from the sap of certain kinds of fir,
                    and established its composition. Their research was afterwards remarkably
                    verified by Dr C. R. Alder Wright, who prepared it from crude opium. It is a
                    pale straw-yellow crystalline substance, smelling exactly like vanilla, arid
                    said to be forty times stronger. Its value commercially is about 23s. per oz.
                    Coumarin, the odoriferous principle of Tonquin beans <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Dipterùc</hi><hi rend="italic">odorata),</hi> is also artificially prepared.
                    In appearance it resembles vanillin, and is valued at 9s. per oz. Some similar
                    bodies with fancy names, such as “hemerocalle,” “bromelia,” “aubépine,” are in
                    the market, but have scarcely yet found their way into the perfume manufactory.
                    Nitro-benzol, before mentioned, is employed only for imparting an almond-like
                    odour to inferior soaps. The various compound ethers called artificial fruit
                    essences, from their resemblance to the odours of certain fruits (jargonelle
                    pear, pine-apple, plum, &amp;c.), find no place in perfumery, though largely
                    used in confectionery for flavouring.</p>
                <p>As before stated, the bouquets constituting the second class of perfumes are but

                <p><hi rend="italic">The Odοphοηe.—</hi> The late Dr Septimus Piesse endeavoured to
                    show that a certain scale or gamut existed amongst odours as amongst sounds,
                    taking the sharp smells to correspond with high notes and the heavy smells with
                    low. He illustrated the idea by classifying some fifty odours in this manner,
                    making each to correspond with a certain note, one-half in each clef, and
                    extending above and below the lines. For example, treble clef note E (4th space)
                    corresponds with Portugal (orange), note D (1st space below clef) with violet,
                    note F (4th space above clef) with ambergris. It is readily noticed in practice
                    that ambergris is much sharper in smell (higher) than violet, while Portugal is
                    intermediate. He asserted that properly to constitute a bouquet the odours to be
                    taken should correspond in the gamut like the notes of a musical chord,—one
                    false note among the odours as among the music destroying the harmony. Thus on
                    his odophone, santal, geranium, acacia, orange-flower, camphor, corresponding
                    with C (bass 2d line below), C (bass 2d space), E (treble 1st line), G (treble
                    2d line), C (treble 3d space), constitute the bouquet of chord C.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Other Branches of Perfumery.—</hi> For the preparation of <hi
                    rend="italic">scented soaps</hi> two methods are in use; both start with a basis
                    either of fine yellow soap (which owes its odour and colour to the presence of
                    resin), or of curd soap (which is hard, white, and odourless, and is prepared
                    without resin). In one process the soap is melted by superheated steam, and
                    while still hot and semi-fluid mixed by means of a T-shaped stirrer of wood with
                    iron cross-bar, technically called a “crutch,” with the attars and colouring
                    matter. It is then removed from the melting pan to a rectangular iron mould or
                    box, the sides of which can be removed by unscrewing the tie-rods which hold
                    them in position; when cold the mass is cut into slabs and bars with a thin
                    brass wire. In the other or cold process the soap is first cut into chips or
                    shavings by a plane or “chipping machine,” then the colouring matters are added
                    and thoroughly incorporated by passing the soap between granite rollers driven
                    by steam-power; the tinted soap emerges in a continuous sheet but little thicker
                    than paper. The attars are then added, and after standing for about twelve hours
                    the soap is again sent through the rolling machine. It is next transferred to a
                    bar-forming machine, which consists of an Archimedean screw with tapering thread
                    revolving in a box; the soap in sheets is roughly squeezed through a hopper over
                    the widest threads of the screw and is forced, as this revolves, towards the
                    distant end of the box, to an opening of the required size, through which it
                    emerges in a continuous bar almost as hard as wood. Soap thus worked contains
                    less than 10 per cent, of water; that prepared by melting contains 20 and even
                    30 per cent. The amount of attars added depends upon the nature of the perfume,
                    and amounts usually to about 7 or 8 per cent. The finest soaps are always
                    manufactured by the cold process. <hi rend="italic">Toilet powders</hi> are of
                    various sorts. They consist of rice-starch or wheat-starch, with powdered
                    orris-root in varying proportions, and with or without the addition of oxide of
                    zinc, oxide of bismuth, or French chalk. The constituent powders, after the
                    addition of the attars, are thoroughly incorporated and mixed by sifting through
                    a fine sieve. Violet powder for the nursery should consist entireìy of powdered
                    violet root <hi rend="italic">{Iris</hi><hi rend="italic">florentine),</hi> from
                    the odour of which the powder is named. It is of a yellowish tint, soft, and
                    pleasant to the touch. The white common so-called “violet powders” consist of
                    starch only scented with attar of bergamot, and are in every sense inferior. <hi
                    rend="italic">Tooth powders</hi> consist for the most part of mixtures of
                    powdered orris-root with precipitated chalk, and some other constituent destined
                    to particularize it as to properties or flavour, such as charcoal,
                    finely-pulverized pumice, quassia, sugar, camphor, &amp;c. The perfume of the
                    contained orris-root is modified, if required, by the addition of a little of
                    some attar. <hi rend="italic">Tooth pastes</hi> are not much in vogue; they are
                    formed of the same constituents as the powders, and are worked into a paste by
                    the addition of a little honey or glucosβ-syrup<pb break="no"

                    to have an injurious effect on the teeth. <hi rend="italic">Perfume sachets</hi>
                    consist either of a powder composed of a mixture of vanilla, musk, Tonquin
                    beans, &amp;c., one or other predominating as required, contained in an
                    ornamental silk sac; or of some of the foregoing substances spread upon card or
                    chamois leather or flannel after being made into a paste with mucilage and a
                    little glycerin. λVhen dry the card so prepared is daintily covered with various
                    party-coloured silks for sale. Where the ingredients employed in their
                    manufacture are of good quality these cards, known as “peau d’Espagne” sachets,
                    retain their odour unimpaired for years.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Adulterations.—</hi> There is, as might be expected,
                    considerable scope for the adulteration of the “matières premières” employed in
                    perfumery, and it is to be stated with regret that many unscrupulous dealers
                    avail themselves of the facilities offered for this dishonourable practice.
                    Thus, in the case of musk, the “pods” are frequently found to be partially
                    emptied of the grain, which has been replaced by hide or skin, while the weight
                    has been increased by the introduction of lead, &amp;c. In other instances the
                    fraud consists in the admixture of refuse grain, from which the odour has been
                    exhausted with spirit, with dried blood, and similar substances, whilst pungency
                    is secured by the addition of carbonate of ammonia. Attar of rose is diluted
                    down with attaι ’ of <hi rend="italic">Palma</hi><hi rend="italic">rosa,</hi> a
                    variety of geranium of only a quarter or a fifth of the value. The main
                    adulterant of all the attars, however, is castor oil. This is a bland neutral
                    body, practically odourless, and completely soluble in alcohol; it therefore
                    presents all the requisites for the purpose. Its detection is difficult even by
                    chemical analysis, which is obviously inapplicable in most instances; the
                    safeguard of the purchaser is the knowledge resulting from experience.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Statistics.—</hi> In Europe, flower-farming for perfumery
                    purposes is almost exclusively confined to that triangular portion of the valley
                    of the Var (France) which has Grasse for its apex and the Mediterranean shore
                    between Nice and Cannes for its base, with an area of about 115,000 English

                    efforts in this direction bid fair to meet with complete commercial success.</p>

                    ounces of musk are annually imported from all sources, while the quantity of
                    alcohol employed in the manufacture of perfumes is calculated to exceed 60,000
                    gallons.</p>
