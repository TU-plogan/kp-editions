                    (1790-1855), arctic navigator, was the fourth son of Dr Caleb Hillier Parry, a
                    physician of Some celebrity in Bath, and was born there 19th December 1790. He
                    was educated at the Bath Grammar School, and was intended for the medical
                    profession, but through the intervention of a lady friend of the family he was
                    permitted, through the kindness of Admiral Cornwallis, to join the “Ville de
                    Paris,” the flagship of the Channel fleet, as a first-class volunteer. In 1806
                    he became a midshipman in the “Tribune” frigate, from which he was, in the
                    spring of 1808, transferred to the “Vanguard” in the Baltic fleet. After
                    obtaining his lieutenant’s commission he joined the “Alexander” frigate,
                    employed in the protection of the Spitzbergen whale fishery. Taking advantage of
                    the opportunity for the study of astronomy, and the observation of the fixed
                    stars in the northern hemisphere, he afterwards published the result of his
                    studies in a small volume on <hi rend="italic">Nautical Astronomy.</hi> He also
                    employed himself in preparing accurate charts of the northern navigation. Having
                    joined the “La Hogue” at the North-American station, he remained there till
                    1817, distinguishing himself in an expedition up the Connecticut river, for
                    which he received a medal. Shortly after his return to England he obtained an
                    appointment to the “Alexander” brig in the expedition of Sir John Ross to
                    discover the probabilities of a North-West Passage to the Pacific. Ross,
                    mistaking clouds for the Croker mountains barring his way westwards, returned to
                    England in the belief that further perseverance was hopeless; but Parry,
                    confident, as he expressed it, “that attempts at polar discovery had been
                    hitherto relinquished just at a time when there was the greatest chance of
                    succeeding,” obtained the command of a new expedition, consisting of two ships,
                    the “Griper” and “Hecla,” with which he sailed from the Thames in May 1819.
                    Passing up Baffin’s Bay, he explored and named Barrow’s Straits, Prince Regent’s
                    Inlet, and Wellington Channel, and reached Melville Island at the beginning of
                    September, having crossed longitude 110° W., thus becoming entitled to the
                    reward of &lt;£5000 offered by parliament. After wintering in Melville Island he
                    made an effort to force a passage to Behrings Straits, but, the state of the ice
                    rendering this impossible, he returned to England, re-entering the Thames in
                    November 1820. A narrative of the expedition appeared in 1821. Shortly after his
                    return he was promoted to the rank of commander, presented with the freedom of
                    Bath and Norwich, and elected a member of the Royal Society. With the “Fury” and
                    the “Hecla” he set sail on a second expedition in May 1821, and after great
                    hardships returned to England in November 1823 without achieving his purpose.
                    During his absence he had in November 1821 been promoted to post rank, and on
                    1st December 1823 he was chosen acting hydrographer to the navy. His <hi
                    rend="italic">Journal of a Second Voyage for the Discovery of the North-West
                    Passage</hi> appeared in 1824. With the same ships he, in May 1824, set sail on
                    a third expedition, which, however, was also unsuccessful, and after the wreck
                    of the “Fury” he returned home in October 1825 with a double ship’s company. Of
                    this voyage he published an account in 1826. Having obtained the sanction of the
                    Admiralty to journey to the North Pole from the northern shores of Spitzbergen
                    in boats that could be fitted to sledges, he set sail with the “Hecla,” March
                    27, 1827, and in June set out for the Pole. He, however, failed to find the
                    solid plain of ice he expected; and as, moreover, owing to the ice drift, he
                    found his efforts at progress northwards in great degree frustrated, he was
                    compelled, after reaching 82° 45' N. lat., to retrace his steps, and arrived in
                    England in October. Of his journey he published an account under the title of
                    <hi rend="italic">Narrative of the Attempt to reach the North Pole in
                    Boats,</hi> 1827. On April 29, 1829, he received the honour of knighthood, Sir
                    John Franklin being also knighted on the same occasion. After continuing his
                    duties as hydrographer till May 1829, he went to New South Wales as commissioner
                    to the Australian Agricultural Company. On his return to England in 1835 he was
                    appointed assistant poor-law commissioner in Norfolk. This he in little more
                    than a year resigned, and in 1837 he was employed in organizing the packet
                    service between Liverpool, Holyhead, and Dublin. For nine years from 1837 he was
                    comptroller of the steam department of the navy. On retiring from active service
                    he was appointed captain-superintendent of Haslar Hospital. He vacated this
                    office in 1852 on obtaining<pb break="no"

                    appointed governor of Greenwich Hospital, which post he retained till his death,
                    8th July 1855. Besides the journals of his different voyages, Parry was the
