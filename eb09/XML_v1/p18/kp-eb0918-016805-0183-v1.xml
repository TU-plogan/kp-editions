                <p><label type="entry">PALERMO</label> (Greek, <hi rend="italic">ΤΙάνορμος;</hi>
                    Latin, <hi rend="italic">Panhormus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Panormus),</hi> the
                    capital of the Sicilian kingdom as long as it kept its separate being, now
                    capital of a province of the same name in the kingdom of Italy, and the see of
                    an archbishop. The population numbered 205,712 in 1881. The city stands in the
                    north-west part of the island, on a small bay looking eastwards, the coast
                    forming the chord of a semicircle of mountains which hem in the <hi
                    rend="italic">campagna</hi> of Palermo, called the Golden Shell (Conca d’Oro).
                    The most striking point is the mountain of Heirkte, now called Pellegrino (from
                    the grotto of Santa Rosalia, a favourite place of pilgrimage), which rises
                    immediately above both the sea and the city. Palermo has been commonly thought
                    to be an original Phoenician settlement of unknown date, but lately Prof. Holm,
                    the historian of ancient Sicily, has suggested that the settlement was
                    originally Greek.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    coins bearing the name of ΠJΠD are no longer assigned to Palermo; but it is
                    probable that certain coins with the name f (Ziz) are of Panhormus.</p></note>
                    There is no record of any Greek colonies in that part of Sicily, and Panhormus
                    certainly was Phoenician as far back as history can carry us. According to

                    power of Carthage, and became the head of the Carthaginian dominion in Sicily.
                    As such it became the centre of that strife between Europe and Africa, between
                    Aryan and Semitic man, in its later stages between Christendom and Islam, which
                    forms the great interest of Sicilian history. As the Semitic head of Sicily, it
                    stands opposed to Syracuse the Greek head. Under the Carthaginian it was the
                    head of the Semitic part of Sicily; when, under the Saracen, all Sicily came
                    under Semitic rule, it was the chief seat of that rule. It has been thrice won
                    for Europe by Greek, Roman, and Norman conquerors—in 276 B.c. by the Epirot king
                    Pyrrhus, in 254 B.c. by the Roman consuls Aulus Atilius and Gnaeus Cornelius
                    Scipio, and in 1071 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> by Robert Guiscard and his
                    brother Roger, the first count of Sicily. After the conquest by Pyrrhus, the
                    city was soon recovered by Carthage, but this first Greek occupation was the
                    beginning of a connexion with western Greece and its islands which was revived
                    under various forms in later times. After the Roman conquest an attempt to
                    recover the city for Carthage was made in 250 B.c., which led only to the great
                    victory of Metellus just under the southern wall of the city. Later in the First
                    Punic War, Hamilcar Barca was encamped for three years on Heirkte or Pellegrino,
                    but the Roman possession of the city was not disturbed. Panhormus remained a
                    Roman possession, and one of the privileged cities of Sicily, till it was taken
                    by the Vandal Genseric in 440 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> It afterwards
                    became a part of the East-Gothic dominion, and was recovered for the empire by
                    Belisarius in 535. It again remained a Roman possession for exactly three
                    hundred years, till it was taken by the Saracens in 835. As Syracuse remained to
                    the empire for a much longer time, Panhormus now became the Mussulman capital.
                    In 1063 the Pisan fleet broke through the chain of the harbour and carried off
                    much spoil, which was spent on the building of the great church of Pisa. After
                    the Norman conquest the city remained for a short time in the hands of the dukes
                    of Apulia. But in 1093 half the city was ceded to Count Roger, and in 1122 the
                    rest was ceded to the second Roger. When he took the kingly title in 1130, it
                    became and remained the capital and crowning-place of the kingdom, “Prima sedes,
                    corona regis, et regni caput.” During the Norman reigns Palermo was the main
                    centre of Sicilian history, especially during the disturbances in the reign of
                    William the Bad (1154-66). The emperor Henry VI. entered Palermo in 1194, and it
                    was the chief scene of his cruelties. In 1198 his son Frederick, afterwards
                    emperor, was crowned there. His reign was the most brilliant time in the history
                    of the city. After his death Palermo was for a moment a commonwealth. It passed
                    under the dominion of Charles of Anjou in 1266, but he was never crowned there.
                    In the next year, when the greater part of Sicily revolted on behalf of
                    Conradin, Palermo was one of the few towns which was held for Charles; but the
                    famous Vespers of 1282 put an end to the Angevin dominion. From that time
                    Palermo shared in the many changes of the Sicilian kingdom. In 1535 Charles V.
                    landed there on his return from Tunis. The last kings crowned at Palermo were
                    Victor Amadeus of Savoy in 1713, and Charles III. of Bourbon in 1735. The loss
                    of Naples by the Bourbons in 1798, and again in 1806, made Palermo once more the
                    seat of a separate Sicilian kingdom. The city rose against Bourbon rule in 1820
                    and in 1848. In 1860 came the final deliverance at the hands of Garibaldi, but
                    with it came also the yet fuller loss of the position of Palermo as the capital
                    of a kingdom of Sicily.</p>
                <p>The original city was built on a tongue of land between two inlets of the sea.
                    There is some question as to their extent inland, and as to the extent of salt
                    and fresh water. But there is no doubt that the present main street, the
                    Cassaro, Via Marmorea, or Via Toledo (in official language Via Vittorio
                    Emmanuele), represents the line of the ancient town with water on each side of
                    it. Another peninsula with one side to the open sea, meeting as it were the main
                    city at right angles, formed in Polybius’s time the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Neapolis</hi> or new town, in Saracen times Khalesa, a name which still
                    survives in that of Calsa. It was on this side that both the Romansand the
                    Norman conquerors entered the city. But the old relations of land and water have
                    long been changed. The two ancient harbours have been dried up; the two
                    peninsulas have met; the long street has been extended to the present
                    coast-line; a small inlet called the Cala alone represents the old haven. The
                    city kept its ancient shape till after the time of the Norman kings. It is still
                    easy to mark the site of the two inlets, which now form valleys on each side of
                    the long street. The old state of things fully explains the name <hi
                    rend="italic">ΤΙάνορμος.</hi></p>
                <p>There are not many early remains in Palermo. The Phoenician and Greek antiquities
                    in the museum do not belong to the city itself. The earliest existing buildings
                    date from the time of the Norman kings, whose palaces and churches were built in
                    the Saracenic and Byzantine styles prevalent in the island (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Normans).</hi> Of Saracen works actually belonging to the time
                    of Saracen occupation there are no whole buildings remaining, but many
                    inscriptions and a good many columns, often inscribed with passages from the
                    Koran, which have been used up again in later buildings, specially in the porch
                    of the metropolitan church. This last was built by Archbishop Walter, a native
                    of England, and consecrated in 1185, on the site of an ancient basilica, which
                    on the Saracen conquest became a mosque, and on the Norman conquest became a
                    church again, first of the Greek and then of the Latin rite. What remains of
                    Walter’s building is a rich example of the Christian-Saracen style. This church
                    contains the tombs of the emperor Frederick the Second and his parents, as also
                    the royal throne, higher than that of the archbishop; for the king of Sicily, as
                    hereditary legate of the see of Rome, was the higher ecclesiastical officer of
                    the two. But the metropolitan church has been so greatly altered in modern times
                    that by far the best example of the style in Palermo, or indeed anywhere, is the
                    chapel of the king’s palace at the west end of the city. This is earlier than
                    Walter’s church, being the work of Ring Roger in 1143. Besides the wonderful
                    display of mosaics, it is, simply as an architectural whole, beyond all praise.
                    Of the palace itself the greater part has been rebuilt and added in Spanish
                    times, but there are some other parts of Roger’s work left, specially the hall
                    called Sala Normanna.</p>
                <p>Alongside of the churches of this Christian-Saracen type, there is another class
                    which follow the Byzantine type. Of these the most perfect is the very small
                    church of San Cataldo, embodied in public buildings. But the best, though much
                    altered, is the church commonly called Martorana, the work of George of Antioch,
                    King Roger’s admiral. This is rich with mosaics, among them the portraits of the
                    king and the founder. Both these and the royal chapel have cupolas, and there is
                    a still greater display in that way in the church of San Giovanni degli Eremiti,
                    which it is hard to believe never was a mosque. It is the only church in Palermo
                    with a bell-tower, itself crowned with a cupola.</p>
                <p>Most of these buildings are witnesses in different ways to the peculiar position
                    of Palermo in the 12th century as the “city of the threefold tongue,” Greek,
                    Arabic, and Latin. Elements from all three sources may be seen, and inscriptions
                    abound in all three languages. King Roger’s sundial<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n185/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0185-0170"/> in the palace is commemorated in all three, and
                    it is to be noticed that the three inscriptions do not translate one another. In
                    private inscriptions a fourth tongue, the Hebrew, is also often found. For in
                    Palermo, under the Norman kings, Christians of both rites, Mussulmans, and Jews
                    were all allowed to flourish after their several fashions. This distinguishes
                    Palermo from some other Sicilian cities which belonged wholly or mainly to one
                    people—Greek, Latin, or Saracen. In many of the early churches of Palermo it is
                    easy to see that they were first designed for the Greek rite, which was
                    gradually supplanted by the Latin. The abiding connexion of Palermo with the
                    races of south-eastern Europe comes out in several other shapes. In Saracen
                    times there was a Slavonic quarter on the southern side of the city, and there
                    is still a colony of United Greeks, or more strictly Albanians, who sought
                    shelter from the Turks, and who keep their national religious usages.</p>
                <p>The series of Christian-Saracen buildings is continued in the country houses of
                    the kings which surround the city, La Favara and Mimnerno, the works of Roger,
                    and the better known Ziza and Cuba, the works severally of William the Bad and
                    William the Good. The Saracenic architecture and Arabic inscriptions of these
                    buildings have often caused them to be taken for works of the ancient emi√s; but
                    the inscriptions of themselves prove their date. Different as is their style,
                    their mere shape is not very unlike that of a contemporary keep in England or
                    Normandy.</p>
                <p>All these buildings are the genuine work of Sicilian art, the art which had grown
                    up in the island through the presence of the two most civilized races of the
                    age, the Greek and the Saracen. Later in the 12 th century the Cistercians
                    brought in a type of church which, without any great change, of mere style, has
                    a very different effect, a high choir taking in some sort the place of the
                    cupola. The greatest example of this is the neighbouring metropolitan church of
                    Monreale; more closely connected with Palermo is the church of San Spirito,
                    outside the city on the south side, the scene of the Vespers. Palermo is full of
                    churches and monasteries of later date, as in Saracen times it was crowded with
                    mosques. But only a few are of any architectural importance, and they often
                    simply range with the houses.</p>
                <p>Domestic and civil buildings, from the 12th century to the 15th, abound in
                    Palermo, and they present several types of genuine national art, quite unlike
                    anything in Italy. The later houses employ a very flat arch, the use of which
                    goes on in some of the houses and smaller churches of the Renaissance, some of
                    which are very pleasing. But the general aspect of the streets is later still,
                    dating from mere Spanish times. Still many of the houses are stately in their
                    way, with remarkable heavy balconies. The most striking point in the city is the
                    central space at the crossing of the main streets, called the Quattro Cantoni.
                    Here the eye catches the mountains at three ends and the sea at the fourth. But
                    none of the chief buildings come into this view, and the intersecting streets
                    suggest a likeness, which is wholly deceptive, to the four limbs of a Roman <hi
                    rend="italic">ehester.</hi> Two indeed of the four are formed by the ancient Via
                    Marmorea, but the Via Macqueda, which supplies the other two, was cut through a
                    mass of small streets in Spanish times.</p>
                <p>The city walls remain during the greater part of their extent, but they are of no
                    great interest. The gates also are modern. The best is Porta Nuova, near the
                    king’s palace, built in 1584 to commemorate the return of Charles V. fifty years
                    earlier. The design is far better than could have been looked for at that time.
                    Outside the walls, in the immediate neighbourhood of the city, there are,
                    besides the royal country houses and the church of San Spirito, several
                    buildings of the Norman reigns. Among these are the oldest church in or near
                    Palermo, the Lepers’ church, founded by the first conqueror or deliverer, Count
                    Roger, and the bridge over the forsaken stream of the Oreto, built in King
                    Roger’s day by the admiral George. There are also some later mediaeval houses
                    and towers of some importance. These all lie on to the south of the city,
                    towards the hill called Monte Griffone (Griffon = Greek), and the Giant’s Cave,
                    which has furnished rich stores for the palaeontologist. On the other side,
                    towards Pellegrino, the change in the ancient haven has caused a new one to grow
                    up, but there is little of artistic or historic interest on this side.</p>
