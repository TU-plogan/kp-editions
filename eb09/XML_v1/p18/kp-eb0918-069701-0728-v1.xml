                    rend="italic">Peter.—</hi> The first of the two canonical epistles which bear
                    the name of St Peter is addressed “to the elect who are sojourners of the
                    dispersion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia.” Most
                    commentators in both ancient and modern times <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> of
                    the former, Athanasius, Jerome, Epiphanius <hi rend="italic">; of</hi> the
                    latter, Lange, Weiss, and Bey schlag) have interpreted this phrase to refer
                    primarily to Jewish Christians. But this interpretation creates a difficulty.
                    The countries named were countries in which St Paul and his companions had been
                    especially active, and in which they had formed many communities, chiefly from
                    the Gentile population. If therefore “the sojourners of the dispersion” be
                    understood to refer to Jews, it becomes necessary to suppose the existence side
                    by side in the same countries of two sets of communities, Pauline and Petrine,
                    and further to suppose either (with Weiss) that the latter were already in
                    existence when Paul preached, or (with the majority of writers) that Peter
                    followed Paul upon his own ground. Both these suppositions are improbable, and
                    it is preferable to understand the phrase of the “children of God that are
                    scattered abroad” whether Jews or Gentiles. That some of the latter were
                    included in it seems clear from i. 21, ii. 10, which imply that before they were
                    Christians they knew not God, and from iii. 6, which implies that their wives
                    had only now become daughters of Abraham.</p>
                <p>The epistle was evidently written at a time when the Christians of Asia Minor
                    were both calumniated (ii. 12, iii. 16, iv. 4, 14) and persecuted (i. 6, 7, iii.
                    14-17, iv. 12-19). It exhorts those to whom it was addressed not only to bear
                    their trials patiently, and even to rejoice inasmuch as they were “partakers of
                    the sufferings of Christ” (iv. 13), but also to give no occasion to the hostile
                    world which surrounded them to reproach them as evildoers (ii. 12, 15, iv. 14,
                    15), and it specializes this exhortation to well-doing by addressing separately
                    servants (ii. 18-25), wives (iii. 1-6), and husbands (iii. 7). This fact that
                    Christianity had come to be persecuted, and also the fact, which is manifested
                    in its whole tone, that Christians were in danger of retrograding, show that the
                    epistle cannot be placed in the earlier part of the apostolic age. The time of
                    the Neronian persecution is the earliest that will satisfy the required
                    conditions; and some <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> Schwegler, Baur, Hilgenfeld)
                    have thought that even this is too early for those conditions, and that it must
                    be referred to the time of Trajan. It may, however, be said in reference to this
                    latteι ’ view that the words of Tacitus in regard to the Christians under Nero,
                    if they be not merely a reflexion from his own time, exactly suit the
                    circumstances to which this epistle refers; “quos <hi rend="italic">per
                    flagitia</hi><hi rend="italic">invisos</hi> vulgus Christianos appellabat” <hi
                    rend="italic">(Ann., xν.</hi> 44).</p>
                <p>Like most documents of the apostolic age, it deals less with doctrine than with
                    practice. But, though the doctrine is incidental, it is clear; taken in
                    connexion with the Petrine speeches in the Acts of the Apostles, with which it
                    is on the whole in harmony, it probably gives a faithful transcript of the
                    original apostolic teaching. The Messiah of whom the prophets had spoken had
                    been revealed (i. 10-12); He had come to suffer (i. 11) for sins(ii. 24, iii.
                    18), and by His sufferings He had rescued the elect from their former evil life
                    ,(i. 18-20) and brought them to God (iii. 18), and in His conduct under
                    suffering left an example for them to follow (ii. 21-23). Belief in God who
                    raised Him from the dead on the one hand is a purification of the soul and an
                    obedience to the truth, and on the other it results in love of the brethren (i.
                    22); it constitutes a bond of brotherhood, like that which had existed between
                    the children of Abraham, and made the elect, what the Jews had failed to be, “a
                    royal priesthood, a holy nation” (ii. 9, from Exod. xix. 6). But the fulfilment
                    of the promise is not for this world; Christians are “strangers and travellers”
                    (ii. 11); the end of all things is at hand (iv. 7), and that is the revelation
                    of the glory of the Messiah in which those who believe in Him will be partakers
                    (iv. 13, V. 1).</p>
                <p>The picture of the Christian communities which the epistle presents is of the
                    simplest, and is in entire harmony with the general facts of the apostolic and
                    sub-apostolic age. The organization was that of the Jewish synedria; the
                    “elders” were as shepherds of the flock, exercising over the younger members the
                    control of a simple discipline. The ministering to the wants of those who needed
                    help was the common and personal duty of all who had wherewith to minister (iv.
                    10), and a special class of officers for the purpose was not yet needed. It is
                    evident that “liberty of prophesying” prevailed; the only injunction on the
                    point is, “if any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God” (iv. 11).</p>
                <p>The coincidences of thought and expression between some passages of this epistle
                    and some passages in the epistle of James and in both the disputed and
                    undisputed epistles of St Paul have given rise to much discussion. The chief
                    coincidences are the following :—(1) between 1 Peter and James, i. 6, 7, and i.
                    2, 3, i. 12 and i. 25, i. 22 and iv. 8, ii. 1 and i. 21, iv. 8 and v. 20, v. 5,
                    9, and iv. 6, 7, v. 6 and iv. 10; (2) between 1 Peter and Romans, i. 14 and xii.
                    2, ii. 5 andxii. 1, ii. 6-10 and ix. 32, ii. 13 and xiii. 1, iii. 9 and xii. 17,
                    iii. 22 and viii. 34, iv. 3, 7, and xiii. 11, 12, iv. 9 and xiii. 13, iv. 10 and
                    xii. 6; (3) between 1 Peter and Ephesians, i. 1 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi> and
                    i. 3 <hi rend="italic">sq.,</hi> i. 14 and ii. 3, ii. 18 and vi. 5, iii. 1 and
                    v. 22, iii. 22 and i. 20, v. 5 and v. 21. Of these coincidences several
                    explanations have been given. Weiss <hi rend="italic">(Die petri,ηische</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Lehrbegriffe,</hi> 1855, and <hi rend="italic">Biblical Theology
                    of the New Testament,</hi> E. T., vol. i. p. 167) holds that this epistle
                    preceded the other epistles and gave rise to the expressions which they contain.
                    The Tübingen school hold that the contrary is the case, and that it represents
                    either a late and weakened form of Paulinism (Baur, Zeller, Pfleiderer), or an
                    attempt to mediate between the Pauline and Petrine parties by clothing the
                    doctrines of the latter in the phraseology of the former (Schwegler). Others
                    (notably Mayerhoff, <hi rend="italic">Einleitung</hi><hi rend="italic">in
                    diepetr.</hi><hi rend="italic">Schriften,</hi> 1835) consider that there is no
                    copying on either the one side or the other, but that all the coincidences of
                    expression come from a common stock of apostolic teaching.</p>
                <p>The epistle was used by Papias and is possibly referred to by Polycarp, and it is
                    expressly quoted by Irenaeus and Tertullian; it is not mentioned in the
                    Muratorian Fragment, but it is translated in the Peshito version, and is
                    included by Eusebius among the admitted books <hi rend="italic"
                    >(homologoumena).</hi> Its genuineness was generally admitted until the present
                    century; and some of its peculiarities have been accounted for by the hypothesis
                    of its having been originally written in Aramaic, and translated, or possibly
                    amplified, by Mark or Silvanus. On the other hand there are some who hold that
                    the attacks upon it by Schwegler, Baur, Pfleiderer, Holtzmann, and others have
                    been stronger than the defence of it.</p>
                <p>2 <hi rend="italic">Peter.—</hi> The second epistle is addressed to a wider
                    circle than the first, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> to Christians in general.
                    Its aim is mainly polemical; it is directed partly against a tendency towards
                    libertinism, which was growing up and which took for one of its supports the
                    Pauline doctrine of Christian freedom (ii. 1, iii. 16), and partly against the
                    reaction which had set in against the earlier eschatology (iii. 3, 4). It
                    protests in powerful language against the separation of Christianity from holy
                    living, maintaining that Christianity without holy living is worse than no
                    Christianity at <pb break="no"

                    Second Coming, resting it upon the reality of the supernatural evidence of the
                    First Coming (i. 16-18).</p>
                <p>The correspondence betλveen this epistle, especially c. ii., and that of Jude is
                    too strong to be a mere coincidence. It was at one time supposed to be the
                    original which Jude imitated (so Sender and Michaelis, and more recently
                    Luthardt and Hofmann), but the preponderance of opinion in modern times is in
                    favour of the opposite view (not only by those who question the authenticity of
                    this epistle but by some also of those who maintain it, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> Weiss). A leading argument in favour of the latter hypothesis is
                    that 2 Peter ii. 13-17 is an amplification (and some maintain also a
                    misapplication) of Jude 11, 12, and that 2 Peter ii. 11 requires Jude 9 for its
                    explanation. An equally well marked correspondence has recently been pointed out
                    between this epistle and Josephus, and the balance of probability is in favour
                    of the priority of the latter.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The differences of style which distinguish the second from the first epistle have
                    been noted since the time of Jerome <hi rend="italic">{De</hi> Ftr. <hi
                    rend="italic">Illustr.,</hi> c. 1, and <hi rend="italic">Epist. ad Hedib.,</hi>
                    c. 11). They are sometimes explained on the ground of the epistles having had
                    different purposes, or having been written at different times; they are more
                    commonly used as indications of a difference of authorship; and, although the
                    argument from differences of style in comparatively short documents cannot be
                    held to be decisive where the external evidence in their favour is strong, such
                    is not the case with this epistle. The external evidence for it is singularly
                    weak; there are no certain traces of it earlier than the 3d century, when Origen
                    (ap. Euseb., <hi rend="italic">If. E.,</hi> vi. 25), who is the first to mention
                    it, also mentions that it was questioned. It is not included in either the
                    Muratorian Fragment or the Peshito-Syriac (though it is in the later
                    Philoxenian). Eusebius (∕Z. <hi rend="italic">E.,</hi> iii. 3) ranks it among
                    the disputed books <hi rend="italic">{antilegomenα),</hi> and Jerome, although
                    he included it in his translation (which fact probably accounts for its general
                    acceptance in the Western churches), mentions that many rejected it. These
                    doubts of early writers, which were revived by Erasmus and Calvin, have been
                    shared by a large proportion of those who have written on the book in modern
                    times; at the same time it cannot be said that there is a consensus of opinion
                    against it.</p>
                <p>The best editions of both the epistles are those in the commentaries of De Wette
                    and Meyer, as revised the former by Brückner and the latter by Huther (this has
                    been translated, with the rest of Meyer’s <hi rend="italic">Commentary,</hi>
                    into English); there is a convenient short English commentary by Dean Plurnptre
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Cambridge Bible for Schools.</hi> For the doctrinal and
                    other questions which arise ont of the two epistles reference may be made, in
