                <p><label type="entry">PASSAU</label>, an ancient town and episcopal see of Bavaria,
                    lies in the district of Lower Bavaria, and occupies a highly picturesque
                    situation at the confluence of the Danube, the Inn, and the Hz, 90 miles to the
                    north-east of Munich, and close to the Austrian frontier. It consists of the
                    town proper, on the rocky tongue of land between the Danube and the Inn, and of
                    the three suburbs of Innstadt, on the right bank of the Inn, Ilzstadt, on the
                    left bank of the Hz, and Anger, in the angle between the Ilz and the Danube.
                    Passau is one of the most beautiful places on the Danube, a fine effect being
                    produced by the way in which the houses are piled one above another on the
                    heights rising from the river. The best general view is obtained from the
                    Oberhaus, an old fortress now used as a prison, which crowns a hill 300 feet
                    high on the left bank of the Danube. A detailed inspection of the buildings of
                    the town, most of which date from the 17th and 18th centuries, scarcely fulfils
                    the expectation aroused by their imposing appearance as a whole. The most
                    noteworthy are the cathedral, a florid rococo structure on the site of an
                    earlier church, which claims to have been founded in the 5th century; the
                    post-office, in which the treaty of Passau was signed; the episcopal palace; the
                    old Jesuit college, with a library of 30,000 volumes; the arsenal; the
                    Romanesque church of the Holy Cross; and the double church of St Salvator. The
                    old forts and bastions have been demolished, but the Niederhaus, at the base of
                    the Oberhaus, is still extant, though no longer maintained as a fortress. The
                    chief products of the insignificant industry of the town are tobacco, leather,
                    and paper. It also possesses iron and copper foundries and a few barge-building
                    yards. The well-known Passau crucibles are made at the neighbouring village of
                    Obernzell. Trade is carried on in iron and timber, large quantities of the
                    latter being floated down the Hz. The inhabitants (15,365 in 1880) are nearly
                    all Roman Catholics.</p>
                <p>Passau is a town of very ancient origin. The first settlement here is believed to
                    have been the Celtic Boiuduruιn, on the site of the present Innstadt; and the
                    Romans afterwards established a colony of Batavian veterans (Castra Batava) on
                    the site of the town proper. The bishopric was founded in the 8th century, and
                    most of the subsequent history of Passau is made up of broils between the
                    bishops and the townsmen. The fortress of Oberhaus was erected by the former in
                    consequence of a revolt in the 13th century, and at a later <pb break="no"

                    1552 Charles V. and Elector Maurice of Saxony here signed the treaty of Passau,
                    by which the former was constrained to acknowledge the principle of religious
                    toleration. The town was a frequent object of dispute in the war of the Spanish
                    succession, and it was taken by the Austrians in 1806. The bishopric was
                    secularized in 1803, and its territory annexed to Bavaria two years later. The
                    present bishopric was established in 1817.</p>
