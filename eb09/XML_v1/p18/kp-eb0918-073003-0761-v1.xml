                <p><label type="entry">PHARMACOPOeIA</label> (lit. the art of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >φαρμακοποιός,</hi> or drug-compounder) in its modern technical sense denotes a
                    book containing directions for the identification of simples and the preparation
                    of compound medicines, and published by the authority of a Government or of a
                    medical or pharmaceutical society. The name has also been applied to similar
                    compendiums issued by private individuals. The first work of the kind published
                    under Government authority appears to have been that of Nuremberg in 1542; a
                    passing student named Valerius Cordus showed a collection of medical receipts,
                    which he had selected from the writings of the most eminent medical authorities,
                    to the physicians of the town, who urged him to print it for the benefit of the
                    apothecaries, and obtained for his work the sanction of the senatus. An earlier
                    work, known as the <hi rend="italic">Antidotarium</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Florentinum,,</hi> had been published, but only under the authority of the
                    college of medicine of Florence. The term “pharmacopoeia” first appears as a
                    distinct title in a work published at Basel in 1561 by Dr A. Foes, but does not
                    appear to have come into general use until the beginning of the 16th century.
                    Before 1542 the works principally used by apothecaries were the treatises on
                    simples by Avicenna and Serapion; the <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Synonymis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Quid pro Quo</hi> of Simon Januensis; the
                    <hi rend="italic">Liber Servitoris</hi> of Bulchasim Ben Aberazerim, which
                    described the preparations made from plants, animals, and minerals, and was the
                    type of the chemical portion of modern pharmacopoeias; and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Antidotarium</hi> of Nicolaus de Salerno, containing Galenical compounds
                    arranged alphabetically. Of this last work there were two editions in
                    use,—Nicolaus magnus and Nicolaus parvus; in the latter, several of the
                    compounds described in the larger edition were omitted and the formulae given on
                    a smaller scale.</p>
                <p>Until 1617 such drugs and medicines as were in common use were sold in England by
                    the apothecaries and grocers. In that year the apothecaries obtained a separate
                    charter, and it was enacted at the same time that no grocer should keep an
                    apothecary’s shop. The preparation of physicians’ prescriptions was thus
                    confined to the apothecaries, upon whom pressure was brought to bear, in order
                    to make them dispense accurately, by the issue of a pharmacopoeia in May 1618 by
                    the College of Physicians, and by the power which the wardens of the
                    apothecaries received in common with the censors of the College of Physicians of
                    examining the shops of apothecaries within 7 miles of London and destroying all
                    the compounds which they found unfaithfully prepared. This, which was the first
                    authorized <hi rend="italic">London Pharmacopoeia,</hi> was selected chiefly
                    from the works of Mezue and Nicolaus de Salerno, with a few additions from those
                    of other authors then in repute, but it was found to be so full of errors that
                    the whole edition was cancelled, and a fresh one was published in the following
                    December. At this period the compounds employed in medicine were often
                    heterogeneous mixtures, some of which contained from 20 to 70, or more
                    ingredients, while a large number of simples were used in consequence of the
                    same substance being supposed to possess different qualities according to the
                    source from which it was derived. Thus crabs’ eyes, pearls, oyster-shells, and
                    coral were supposed to have different properties. Among other disgusting
                    ingredients entering into some of these formulae were the excrements of human
                    beings, dogs, mice, geese, and other animals, calculi, human skull and moss
                    growing on it, blind puppies, earthworms, &amp;c. Although other editions of the
                    <hi rend="italic">London Pharmacopoeia</hi> were issued in 1621,1632,1639, and
                    1677, it was not until the edition of 1721, published under the auspices of Sir
                    Hans Sloane, that any important alterations were made. In this issue many of the
                    ridiculous remedies previously in use were omitted, although a good number were
                    still retained, such as dog’s excrement, earthworms, and moss from the human
                    skull; the botanical names of herbal remedies were for the first time added to
                    the official ones; the simple distilled waters were ordered <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n762/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0762-0731"/> of a uniform strength; sweetened spirits,
                    cordials, and ratifias were omitted as well as several compounds no longer used
                    in London, although still in vogue elsewhere. A great improvement was effected
                    in the edition published in 1746, in which only those preparations were retained
                    which had received the approval of the majority of the pharmacopoeia committee;
                    to these was added a list of those drugs only which were supposed to be the most
                    efficacious. An attempt was made to simplify further the older formulae by the
                    rejection of the superfluous ingredients which had been introduced during a
                    succession of ages, and by retention of the known active ingredients. In the
                    edition published in 1788 the tendency to simplify was carried out to a much
                    greater extent, and the extremely compound medicines which had formed the
                    principal remedies of physicians for 2000 years were discarded, while a few
                    powerful drugs which had been considered too dangerous to be included in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Pharmacopoeia</hi> of 1765 were restored to their previous
                    position. In 1809 the French chemical nomenclature was adopted, and in 1815 a
                    corrected impression of the same was issued. Subsequent editions were published
                    in 1824, 1836, and 1851.</p>
                <p>The first <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Pharmacopoeia</hi> was published in 1699
                    and the last in 1841; the first <hi rend="italic">Dublin Pharmacopoeia</hi> in
                    1807 and the last in 1850.</p>
                <p>The preparations contained in these three pharmacopoeias were not all uniform in
                    strength, a source of much inconvenience and danger to the public, when powerful
                    preparations such as dilute hydrocyanic acid were ordered in the one country and
                    dispensed according to the national pharmacopoeia in another. This inconvenience
                    led to the insertion of a provision in the Medical Act of 1858, by which it was
                    ordained that the General Medical Council should cause to be published under
                    their direction a book containing a list of medicines and compounds, and such
                    other matters and things relating thereto, as the General Council should think
                    fit, to be called the <hi rend="italic">British Pharmacopoeia,</hi> which should
                    for all purposes be deemed to be a substitute throughout Great Britain and
                    Ireland for the several above-mentioned pharmacopoeias. Hitherto these had been
                    published in Latin. The first <hi rend="italic">British Pharmacopoeia</hi> was
                    published in the English language in 1864, but gave such general dissatisfaction
                    both to the medical profession and to chemists and druggists that the General
                    Medical Council brought out a new and amended edition in 1867. This
                    dissatisfaction was probably owing partly to the difficulty met with in
                    selecting a due proportion of formulae from each pharmacopoeia so as to avoid
                    giving offence to national susceptibilities, and partly to the fact that the
                    majority of the compilers of the work were men not engaged in the actual
                    practice of pharmacy, and therefore competent rather to decide upon the kind of
                    preparations required than upon the method of their manufacture. The necessity
                    for this element in the construction of a pharmacopoeia is now fully recognized
                    in other countries, in most of which pharmaceutical chemists are duly
                    represented on the committee for the preparation of the legally recognized
                    manuals.</p>
                <p>National pharmacopoeias now exist in the following countries: —Austria, Belgium,
                    Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Holland, Hungary, India,
                    Mexico, Norway, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Sweden, and the United States of
                    America. The Argentine Republic, Chili, and Japan have each a pharmacopoeia in
                    preparation. All the above-mentioned were issued under the authority of
                    Government, and their instructions have the force of law in their respective
                    countries, except those of the United States and Mexico, which were prepared by
                    commissioners appointed by medical or pharmaceutical societies, and have no
                    other authority, although generally accepted as the national text-books. Italy
                    has no national pharmacopoeia, the authorities used in the different states
                    prior to the unification being still retained. Sardinia, for example, has a
                    pharmacopoeia dating from 1853; Modena, Parma, and Piacenza have one in common,
                    published in 1839; in the States of the Church as well as in Tuscany and Lucca
                    an unofficial compilation is in use entitled <hi rend="italic">Orosi
                    Farmacologia techniea</hi><hi rend="italic">practica</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ovveroFarmacologia Italiana</hi>; Naples has its <hi rend="italic">Ricettario
                    Farmaceutico Napolitano</hi> (1859); and Lombardy and Venice use the Austrian
                    pharmacopoeia. Although Switzerland has a national pharmacopoeia, this does not
                    possess Government authority, the French <hi rend="italic">Codex</hi> being
                    recognized in Geneva, and the canton of Ticino having a pharmacopoeia of its
                    own.</p>
                <p>The French <hi rend="italic">Codex</hi> has probably a more extended use than any
                    other pharmacopoeia outside the limits of its own country, being, in connexion
                    with Dorvault’s <hi rend="italic">L’Officine,</hi> the standard for druggists in
                    a large portion of Central and South America; it is also official in Turkey. The
                    sum-total of the drugs and preparations it contains is about 2000, or more than
                    double the average of other modern pharmacopoeias. The progress of medical
                    knowledge during the last two hundred years has led to a gradual but very
                    perceptible alteration in the contents of the various pharmacopoeias. The
                    original very complex formulae have been gradually simplified until only the
                    most active ingredients have been retained, and in many cases the active
                    principles have to a large extent replaced the crude drugs from which they were
                    derived. From time to time such secret remedies of druggists or physicians as
                    have met with popular or professional approval have been represented by simpler
                    official preparations.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">International Pharmacopoeia.—</hi> The increased facilities for
                    travel during the last fifty years have brought into greater prominence the
                    importance of an approach to uniformity in the formulae of the more powerful
                    remedies, such as the tinctures of aconite, opium, and nux vomica, in order to
                    avoid danger to patients when a prescription is dispensed in a different country
                    from that in which it was written. Attempts have been made during the last few
                    years by international pharmaceutical and medical conferences to settle a basis
                    on which an international pharmacopoeia could be prepared, but, owing to
                    national jealousies and the attempt to include too many preparations in such a
                    work, it has not as yet been produced. At the fifth International Pharmaceutical
                    Congress held in London in 1881, however, a resolution was passed to the effect
                    that it was necessary that such a pharmacopoeia should be prepared, and a
                    commission consisting of two delegates from each of the countries represented
                    was recommended to be appointed in order to prepare within the shortest possible
                    time a compilation in which the strength of all potent drugs and their
                    preparations should be equalized,—the work, when complete, to be handed over to
                    their respective Governments or to their pharmacopoeia committees. It appears
                    probable that such a work will be presented for consideration by the commission
                    at the forthcoming meeting of the congress at Brussels in 1885.</p>
                <p>Several unofficial universal pharmacopoeias have been published from time to time
                    in England and in France, which serve to show the comparative strength of
                    parallel preparations in different countries; but the results of discussions
                    which have taken place at the international conferences above alluded to
                    indicate that the production and acceptance of an international pharmacopoeia
                    will be a work of time, and that in such a work the numerous drugs and
                    preparations intended to meet an unprofessional demand rather than the wants of
                    physicians will have to be omitted. The advances that have been made in this
                    direction are as follows. The metric or decimal mode of calculation and the
                    centigrade scale of temperature are adopted in all pharmacopoeias except those
                    of Great Britain, of India, and in some instances of Greece. The majority omit
                    chemical formulae. An alphabetical arrangement is followed in all except the
                    French, Spanish, and Greek. The great increase of medical literature and
                    international exchange of medical journals has led to the adoption in almost
                    every country of all the really valuable remedial agents, and the more extended
                    use of active principles has given rise to an approximation in strength of their
                    solutions. The difficulty of nomenclature could probably be overcome by a list
                    of synonyms being given with each article, and that of language by the use of
                    Latin. The greatest stumbling-blocks in the way of uniformity are the tinctures
                    and extracts,—a class of preparations containing many very powerful drugs, but
                    in which the same name does not always indicate the same thing; thus, extract of
                    aconite signifies an extract of the root in the pharmacopoeias of the United
                    States, Austria, Hungary, and Russia, extract of the leaves in the Danish and
                    Portuguese, inspissated juice of the fresh leaves in the British, Indian,
                    Spanish, and Greek, and dry extract of the leaves with sugar of milk in the
                    Norwegian pharmacopoeias. It appears probable, however, that the growth of
                    pharmaceutical chemistry will indicate clearly, in course of time, which of
                    those in use form the most active and reliable preparations, while the general
                    adoption of the metric system will lead to clearer approximation of strength
                    than hitherto. The method adopted by the Portuguese pharmacopoeia comes nearest
                    to that uniformity which is so desirable in such preparations, as the tinctures
                    of the fresh plants are all prepared with equal parts of the drug and alcoholic
                    menstruum; simple tinctures in general, with unfortunately a few exceptions,
                    with one part of the drug in five parts of alcohol of given <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n763/mode/1up"

                    proportion of one part in ten; and the tinctures of the alkaloids and their
                    salts contain one part of the alkaloid in ninety-nine of menstruum.</p>
                <p>Homoeopathic and eclectic practitioners as well as dentists have also their
                    special pharmacopoeias.</p>
