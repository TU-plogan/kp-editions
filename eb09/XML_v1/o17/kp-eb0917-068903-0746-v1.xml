                    including some of the most important timber trees of the north temperate zone.
                    All the species are arborescent or shrubby, varying in size from the most
                    stately of forest trees to the dwarfish bush. Monoecious, and bearing their male
                    flowers in catkins, they are readily distinguished from the rest of the
                    Cupuliferous family by their peculiar fruit, an acorn or nut, enclosed at the
                    base in a woody cup, formed by the consolidation of numerous involucral bracts
                    developed beneath the fertile flower, simultaneously with a cup-like expansion
                    of the thalamus, to which the bracteal scales are more or less adherent. The
                    ovary, three-celled at first, but becoming one-celled and one-seeded by
                    abortion, is closely invested by the perianth, toothed on the margin, and
                    adherent below; the male flowers are in small clusters on the usually slender
                    and pendent stalk, forming an interrupted catkin; the stamens vary from six to
                    twelve. The alternate leaves are more or less deeply sinuated or cut in most of
                    the species, but in some of the deciduous and many of the evergreen kinds are
                    nearly or quite entire on the margin. The oaks are widely distributed over the
                    temperate parts of Europe, Asia, North Africa, and North America. In the western
                    hemisphere they range along the Mexican highlands and the Andes far into t.hp.

                    islands of the archipelago, several species occurring in the Moluccas and
                    Borneo. On the mountains of Europe and North America they grow only at moderate
                    elevations, and none approach the arctic circle. The multitude of species and
                    the many intermediate forms render their exact limitation difficult, but those

                <p>The well-known <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi><hi rend="italic">Robur</hi>, one of the
                    most valued of the genus, and the most celebrated in history and myth, may be
                    taken as a type of the oaks with sinuated leaves. Though known in England, where
                    it is the only indigenous species, as the British oak, it is a native of most of
                    the milder parts of Europe, extending from the shores of the Atlantic to the
                    Ural; its most northern limit is attained in Norway, where it is found wild up
                    to lat. 63°, and near the Lindesnaes forms woods of some extent, the trees
                    occasionally acquiring a considerable size. In western Russia it flourishes in
                    lat. 60°, but on the slope of the Ural the 56th parallel is about its utmost
                    range. Its northern limit nearly coincides with that of successful wheat
                    cultivation. Southwards it extends to Sardinia, Sicily, and the Morea. In Asia
                    it is found on the Caucasus, but does not pass the Ural ridge into Siberia. In
                    Britain and in most of its Continental habitats two varieties exist, regarded by
                    many as distinct species: one, <hi rend="italic">Q. pedunculata,</hi> has the
                    acorns, generally two or more together, on long stalks, and the leaves nearly
                    sessile; while in the other, <hi rend="italic">Q. sessiliflora,</hi> the fruit
                    is without or with a very short peduncle, and the leaves are furnished with
                    well-developed petioles. But, though the extreme forms of these varieties are
                    very dissimilar, innumerable modifications are found between them; hence it is
                    more convenient to regard them as at most sub-species of <hi rend="italic">Q.
                    Robur.</hi> The British oak is one of the largest trees of the genus, though old
                    specimens are often more remarkable for the great size of the trunk and main
                    boughs than for very lofty growth. The spreading branches have a tendency to
                    assume a tortuous form, owing to the central shoots becoming abortive, and the
                    growth thus being continued laterally, causing a zigzag development, more
                    exaggerated in old trees and those standing in exposed situations; to this
                    peculiarity the picturesque aspect of ancient oaks is largely due. When standing
                    in dense woods the trees are rather straight and formal in early growth,
                    especially the sessile-fruited kinds, and the gnarled character traditionally
                    assigned to the oak applies chiefly to its advanced age. The broad
                    deeply-sinuated leaves with blunt rounded lobes are of a peculiar yellowish
                    colour when the buds unfold in May, but assume a more decided green towards
                    midsummer, and eventually become rather dark in tint; they do not change to
                    their brown autumnal hue until late in October, and on brushwood and saplings
                    the withered foliage is often retained until the spring. The catkins appear soon
                    after the young leaves, usually in England towards the end of May; the acorns,
                    oblong in form, are in shallow cups with short, scarcely projecting scales; the
                    fruit is shed the first autumn, often before the foliage changes.</p>
                <p>Vast oak forests still covered the greater part of England and central Europe in
                    the earlier historic period; and, though they have been gradually cleared in the
                    progress of cultivation, oak is yet the prevailing tree in most of the woods of
                    France, Germany, and southern Russia, while in England the coppices and the few
                    fragments of natural forest yet left are mainly composed of this species. The
                    pedunculated variety is most abundant in the southern and midland counties, the
                    sessile-fruited kinds in the northern parts and in Wales, especially in upland
                    districts; the straighter growth and abundant acorns of this subspecies have led
                    to its extensive introduction into plantations. The name of “durmast” oak,
                    originally given to a dark-fruited variety of <hi rend="italic">Q.
                    sessiliflora</hi> in the New Forest, has been adopted by foresters as a general
                    term for this kind of oak; it seems to be the most prevalent form in Germany and
                    in the south of Europe. A variety of the sessile oak with sweet acorns appears
                    to be the <hi rend="italic">Q. Esculus</hi> of some writers. Many of the ancient
                    oaks that remain in England may date from Saxon times, and some perhaps from an
                    earlier period; the growth of trees after the trunk has become hollow is
                    extremely slow, and the age of such venerable giants only matter of vague
                    surmise. The celebrated Newland oak in Gloucestershire, known for centuries as
                    “the great oak,” was by the latest measurement 47∣ feet in girth at 5 feet from
                    the ground. The Cowthorpe oak, standing (a ruin) near Wetherby in Yorkshire, at
                    the same height measures 38J feet, and seems to have been of no smaller
                    dimensions when described by Evelyn two centuries ago; like most of the giant
                    oaks of Britain, it is of the pedunculate variety. The preservation of these old
                    trees has been in past times largely due to the survival of the reverence in
                    which the oak was held by Celt and Saxon,—a feeling which seems to have been
                    shared by several Aryan races. The great regard paid to the oak probably
                    originated in the value attached to its timber and fruit; the largest and most
                    durable of European trees, its wood was looked upon as the most precious produce
                    of the forest. With both Greek and Roman it was the favourite timber for house,
                    bridge, and ship building; and the furrowed columns with spreading base that
                    upheld their stone-built temples of historic age seem to indicate the oak-trunk
                    as their archaic prototype. The tree was not in less esteem among the Teutonic
                    nations; the long ships Of the Northmen were hewn from the same “heart of oak”
                    of which the war-ships of England were until lately constructed. The
                    Anglo-Saxons employed oak timber not only for their dwellings and their fleets
                    but occasionally for more sacred architecture,—the church till recently standing
                    at Greenstead in Essex, and supposed to have been erected in the 10th century,
                    was wholly formed of oak trunks roughly squared. The few ancient timber mansions
                    still existing in England are generally built entirely of oak, which in many
                    cases remains sound after the lapse of several hundred years, sometimes
                    outlasting the brick and stone with which the structures have been repaired. The
                    great oak woods that in early days covered the larger part of Britain had in
                    Tudor times become so reduced that an Act was passed in the reign of Henry VIII.
                    to enforce their preservation, and by the end of the 16th century oak
                    planting<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n748/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0748-0691"/> became common. At present large quantities of
                    timber are still obtained from hedgerows and copsewoods; but, although some
                    attempts have been made to renew the royal forests, much of the oak timber
                    employed in Britain is imported from abroad. Many of the Continental woods are
                    failing to produce their former supply the large quantity still obtained from
                    the port of Memel, and formerly drawn from Prussia and nearer Poland, is now
                    brought thither from the distant forests of the Dnieper and the Don.</p>
                <p>The wood of the British oak, when grown in perfection, is the most valuable
                    produced in temperate climates. The heart-wood varies in colour from dark brown
                    to pale yellowish - brown; hard, close-grained, and little liable to split
                    accidentally, it is, for a hard wood, easy to work. Under water it excels most
                    woods in durability, and none stand better alternate exposure to drought and
                    moisture, while under cover it is nearly indestructible as long as dry-rot is
                    prevented by free admission of air. Its weight varies from 48 to about 55 lb the
                    cubic foot, but in very hard slowly-grown trunks sometimes approaches 60 ft&gt;.
                    The sap-wood is lighter and much more perishable, but is of value for many
                    purposes of rural economy. The relative qualities of the two varieties have been
                    the frequent subject of debate, the balance of practical testimony seeming to
                    establish the superiority of <hi rend="italic">Q. pedunculata</hi> as far as
                    durability in water is concerned; but when grown under favourable circumstances
                    the sessile oak is certainly equally lasting if kept dry. The wood of the
                    durmast oak is commonly heavier and of a darker colour, hence the other is
                    sometimes called by woodmen the white oak, and in France is known as the “chêtie
                    blanc.” The oak of Britain is still in great demand for the construction of
                    merchant shipping, though teak has become in some measure its substitute, and
                    foreign oak of various quality and origin largely takes its place. Its great
                    abundance of curved trunks and boughs rendered the oak peculiarly valuable to
                    the shipwright when the process of bending timber artificially was less
                    understood; the curved pieces are still useful for knees. The younger oaks are
                    employed by the carpenter, wheelwright, waggon-builder, and for innumerable
                    purposes by the country artisan. The most durable of fences are those formed of
                    small oaks, split lengthwise by the wedge into thin boards. The finely-grained
                    heart-wood is sought by the cabinetmaker for the manufacture of furniture, and
                    high prices are often given for the gnarled and knotted portions of slowly-grown
                    trees, to be sawn into veneers. Oak was formerly largely used by wood-carvers,
                    and is still in some demand for those artists, being harder and more durable
                    than lime and other woods that yield more readily to the sculptor’s tool. Oak
                    was thus applied at a very early date; the shrine of Edward the Confessor, still
                    existing in the abbey at Westminster, sound after the lapse of 800 years, is of
                    darkcoloured oak-wood. The wood, of unknown age, found submerged in peat-bogs,
                    and of a black hue, is largely used in decorative art under the name of
                    “bog-oak.”</p>
                <p>The oak grows most luxuriantly on deep strong clays, calcareous marl, or stiff
                    loam, but will flourish in nearly any deep well-drained soil, excepting peat or
                    loose sand; in marshy or moist places the tree may grow well for a time, but the
                    timber is rarely sound; on hard rocky ground and exposed hillsides the growth is
                    extremely slow and the trees small, but the wood is generally very hard and
                    durable. The oak will not bear exposure to the full force of the sea gale,
                    though in ravines and on sheltered slopes oak woods sometimes extend nearly to
                    the shore. The cultivation of this tree in Europe forms one of the most
                    important branches of the forester’s art. It is frequently raised at once by
                    sowing the acorns on the ground where the trees are required, the fruit being
                    gathered in the autumn as soon as shed, and perfectly ripe seeds selected; but
                    the risk of destruction by mice and other vermin is so great that transplanting
                    from a nursery-bed is in most cases to be preferred. The acorns should be sown
                    in November on well-prepared ground, and covered to a depth of 1J or 2 inches;
                    the seeds germinate in the spring, and the seedlings are usually transplanted
                    when one or two years old to nursery-beds, where they are allowed to grow from
                    two to four years, till required for the plantation. Some authorities recommend
                    the tap-roots to be cut in the second year, with the view of increasing the ball
                    of fibre; but, if the trees are removed from the seedbed sufficiently early, the
                    root is best left to its natural development. The oak requires shelter in the
                    early stages of growth; in England the Scotch pine is thought best for this
                    purpose, though Norway spruce answers as well on suitable ground, and larch and
                    other trees are sometimes substituted. The conifers are allowed to grow to a
                    height of from 3 to 5 feet before the young oaks are planted, and are gradually
                    thinned out as the latter increase in size. The distance between the oaks
                    depends upon the growth intended before thinning the young wood; usually they
                    are placed from 8 to 12 feet apart, and the superabundant trees cut out as they
                    begin to interfere with each other. The lower branches often require removal, to
                    ensure the formation of a tall straight trunk, and this operation should be
                    performed before the superfluous shoots get too large, or the timber will be
                    injured; but, as with all trees, unnecessary pruning should be avoided, as every
                    branch removed lessens the vigour of growth. Where artificial copsewood is the
                    object, hazel, hornbeam, and other bushes may be planted between the oaks; but,
                    when large timber is required, the trees are best without undergrowth.</p>
                <p>The oak, after the trunk is felled, throws up shoots from the cut stump more
                    surely and abundantly than most trees; hence it is well adapted for the
                    formation of brushwood, of which great quantities are employed in Britain for
                    the manufacture of crates and hoops, and for many other uses. Where the
                    underwood consists mainly of oak it is generally cut once in twenty years, but
                    in some places fifteen years are thought sufficient, while on poor land thirty
                    years are sometimes allowed to intervene between the cuttings. Oak coppices are
                    generally cut in the spring, because the bark is then more readily separated,
                    and large timber trees are very often felled at the same period; but winter
                    felling is probably best when sound heart-wood is the chief thing in view. The
                    growth of the oak is slow, though it varies greatly in different trees; Loudon
                    states that an oak, raised from the acorn in a garden at Sheffield Place,
                    Sussex, became in seventy years 12 feet in circumference<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n749/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0749-0692"/>; but the increase of the trunk is usually very
                    much slower, and when grown for large timber oak can rarely be profitably felled
                    till the first century of its growth is completed. The tree will continue to
                    form wood for 150 or 200 years before showing any symptoms of decay. As firewood
                    oak holds a high position, though in Germany it is considered inferior to beech
                    for that purpose. It makes excellent charcoal, especially for metallurgic
                    processes; the Sussex iron, formerly regarded as the best produced in Britain,
                    was smelted with oak charcoal from the great woods of the adjacent Weald, until
                    they became so thinned that the precious fuel was no longer obtainable.</p>
                <p>An important product of oak woods is the bark that from a remote period has been
                    the chief tanning material of Europe. The most valuable kind is that obtained
                    from young trees of twenty to thirty years’ growth, but the trunks and boughs of
                    timber trees also furnish a large supply; it is separated from the tree most
                    easily when the sap is rising in the spring. It is then carefully dried by the
                    free action of the air, and when dry built into long narrow stacks until needed
                    for use. The value of oak bark depends upon the amount of tannin contained in
                    it, which varies much, depending not only on the growth of the tree but on the
                    care bestowed on the preparation of the bark itself, as it soon ferments and
                    spoils by exposure to wet, while too much sun-heat is injurious. That obtained
                    from the sessile-fruited oak is richer in tannic acid than that yielded by <hi
                    rend="italic">Q. pedunculata,</hi> and the bark of trees growing in the open is
                    more valuable than the produce of the dense forest or coppice. The bark of young
                    oak branches has been employed in medicine from the days of Dioscorides, and is
                    occasionally used in modern practice, chiefly as an astringent: in decoction it
                    is given as a gargle for throat affections depending on relaxation, and is
                    administered in dysenteric haemorrhages and some forms of diarrhoea; it was
                    regarded by the practitioners of a former age as useful in consumption, a
                    disease from which tanners are said to be nearly exempt. Poultices made of the
                    crushed or powdered bark have been used with advantage where astringent external
                    applications are indicated; as a tonic it has in modern medicine given place to
                    other remedial agents. The astringent principle is a peculiar kind of tannic
                    acid, called by chemists <hi rend="italic">querci-tannic,</hi> which, yielding
                    more stable compounds with gelatine than other forms, gives oak bark its high
                    value to the tanner. According to Neubauer, the bark of young oaks contains from
                    7 to 10 per cent, of this principle; in old trees the proportion is much
                    less.</p>
                <p>The acorns of the oak possess a considerable economic importance as food for
                    swine. In the Saxon period the “mast” seems to have been regarded as the most
                    valuable produce of an oak wood; nor was its use always confined to the support
                    of the herds, for in time of dearth acorns were boiled and eaten by the poor as
                    a substitute for bread both in England and France, as the sweeter produce of <hi
                    rend="italic">Q. Esculus</hi> is still employed in southern Europe. Large herds
                    of swine in all the great oak woods of Germany depend for their autumn
                    maintenance on acorns; and in the remaining royal forests of England the
                    inhabitants of the neighbouring villages yet claim their ancient right of
                    “pannage,” turning their hogs into the woods in October and November. Some trees
                    of the sessile-fruited oak bear sweet acorns in Britain, and several varieties
                    were valued by the ancient Italians for their edible fruit. A peculiar kind of
                    sugar called <hi rend="italic">quercite</hi> exists in all acorns. A bitter
                    principle to which the name of <hi rend="italic">quercin</hi> has been applied
                    by Gerber, its discoverer, has also been detected in the acorn of the common
                    oak; the nutritive portion seems chiefly a form of starch. A spirit has been
                    distilled from acorns in process of germination, when the saccharine principle
                    is most abundant.</p>
                <p>The British oak grows well in the northern and middle States of America; and,
                    from the superiority of the wood to that of <hi rend="italic">Q. alba</hi> and
                    its more abundant production of acorns, it will probably be much planted as the
                    natural forests are destroyed. The young trees require protection from storms
                    and late frosts even more than in England; the red pine of the north-eastern
                    States, <hi rend="italic">Pinus resinosa,</hi> answers well as a nurse, but the
                    pitch pine and other species may be employed. In the southern parts of Australia
                    and in New Zealand the tree seems to flourish as well as in its native home.</p>
                <p>The oak in Europe is liable to injury from a great variety of insect enemies: the
                    young wood is attacked by the larvae of the small stag-beetle and several other
                    <hi rend="italic">Coleoptera,</hi> and those of the wood-leopard moth, goat
                    moth, and other <hi rend="italic">Lepidoptera</hi> feed upon it occasionally;
                    the foliage is devoured by innumerable larvae; indeed, it has been stated that
                    half the plant-eating insects of England prey more or less upon the oak, and in
                    some seasons it is difficult to find a leaf perfectly free from their
                    depredations. The young shoots are chosen by many species of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cynipidae,</hi> and their allies as a receptacle for their eggs, giving rise to
                    a variety of gall-like excrescences, from which few oak trees are quite
                    free.</p>
                <p>Of the European timber trees of the genus, the next in importance to the British
                    oak is <hi rend="italic">Q. Cerris,</hi> the Turkey oak of the nurserymen. This
                    is a fine species, having when young straighter branches than <hi rend="italic"
                    >Q.</hi><hi rend="italic">Robur,</hi> but in old age the boughs generally curve
                    downwards, and the tree acquires a wide spreading head; the bark is dark brown,
                    becoming grey and furrowed in large trees; the foliage varies much, but in the
                    prevailing kinds the leaves are very deeply sinuated, with pointed, often
                    irregular lobes, the footstalks short, and furnished at the base with long
                    linear stipules that do not fall with the leaf, but remain attached to the bud
                    till the following spring, giving a marked feature to the young shoots. The
                    large sessile acorns are longer than those of <hi rend="italic">Q. Robur,</hi>
                    and are darkbrown when ripe; the hemispherical cups are covered with long,
                    narrow, almost bristly scales, giving them a mossy aspect; the fruit ripens the
                    first autumn. The foliage in some of the numerous varieties is almost evergreen,
                    and in Britain is retained long after the autumnal withering.</p>
                <p>This oak abounds all over the Turkish peninsula, and forms a large portion of the
                    vast forests that clothe the slopes of the Taurus ranges and the south shores of
                    the Black Sea; it is likewise common in Italy and Sardinia, and occurs in the
                    south of France and also in Hungary. It was introduced into England by Miller
                    about 1735, and is now common in parks and plantations, where it seems to
                    flourish in nearly all soils. The Turkey oak in southern England grows twice as
                    fast as <hi rend="italic">Q. Robur</hi>; in the mild climate of Devonshire and
                    Cornwall it has reached a height of 100 feet and a diameter of 4 feet in eighty
                    years, which is about the limit of its profitable growth for timber. The wood is
                    hard, heavy, and of fine grain, quite equal to the best British oak for indoor
                    use, but of very variable durability where exposed to weather. The ships of
                    Greece and Turkey are largely built of it, but it has not always proved
                    satisfactory in English dockyards. The heart-wood is dark in colour, takes a
                    fine polish, and from the prominence of the medullary rays is valuable to the
                    furniture maker; it weighs from 40 to 50 lb the cubic foot. The comparatively
                    rapid growth of the tree is its great recommendation to the planter; it is best
                    raised from acorns sown on the spot, as they are very bitter and little liable
                    to the attacks of vermin; the tree sends down a long taproot, which should be
                    curtailed by cutting or early transplanting, if the young trees are to be
                    removed. It seems peculiarly adapted for the mild moist climate of Ireland. It
                    succeeds in many parts of the United States, but is less hardy than the native
                    species. It would appear well fitted for New Zealand planting. Acorns are
                    produced on the Turkey oak in great abundance in some seasons, but in cold wet
                    years do not always ripen in Britain; notwithstanding their bitterness they are
                    greedily eaten by swine. Some southern varieties of this tree bear acorns
                    comparatively sweet, and they are sometimes eaten after being roasted, in which
                    process the tannic acid is partly destroyed. Dalechamps says that some of the
                    esculent acorns of southern Europe occasionally prove unwholesome, causing
                    effects resembling those of poisoning by <hi rend="italic">Lolium
                    temulentum.</hi></p>
                <p>In North America, where the species of oak are very numerous, the most important
                    member of the group is <hi rend="italic">Q. alba,</hi> the white oak, abounding
                    all over the eastern districts of the continent from Lake Winnipeg and the St
                    Lawrence countries to the shores of the Mexican Gulf. In aspect it more nearly
                    resembles <hi rend="italic">Q. Robur</hi> than any other species, forming a
                    thick trunk with spreading base and, when <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n750/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0750-0693"/> growing in glades or other open places, huge
                    spreading boughs, less twisted and gnarled than those of the English oak and
                    covered with a whitish bark that gives a marked character to the tree. The
                    leaves are large, often irregular in form, usually with a few deep lobes dilated
                    at the end; they are of a bright light green on the upper surface, but whitish
                    beneath; they turn to a violet tint in autumn. The egg - shaped acorns are
                    placed singly or two together on short stalks; they are in most years sparingly
                    produced, but are occasionally borne in some abundance. On rich loams and the
                    alluvial soils of rivervalleys, when well drained, the tree attains a large
                    size, often rivalling the giant oaks of Europe; trunks of 3 or 4 feet in
                    diameter are frequently found, and sometimes these dimensions are greatly
                    exceeded. The wood is variable in quality and, though hard in texture, is less
                    durable than the best oak of British growth; the heart-wood is of a light
                    reddish brown varying to an olive tint; a Canadian specimen weighs 52⅛ lb the
                    cubic foot. In the States it is largely used in shipbuilding, for house timber,
                    and many other purposes; wheels and the frames of waggons and sleighs as well as
                    casks are often made of it; large quantities are exported to England from
                    Canada. The young wood is very strong, flexible, and elastic; it is split into
                    thin strips, to be made into baskets. The large roots, often presenting a very
                    fine grain and taking a good polish, are sought for by the cabinetmaker. The
                    bark is inferior to that of many oaks. The acorns are sweet, and were formerly
                    eaten by the Ked Men, but are too scantily produced in most seasons to be of
                    much economic importance. White oaks have often been planted in England, but the
                    trees do not grow as fast as in their native land, while the wood is inferior.
                    According to some American authorities, the timber of <hi rend="italic">Q.
                    alba</hi> is of better quality in the southern and middle States than in Canada
                    and New England.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Q. obtusiloba,</hi> the post oak of the backwoodsman, a smaller
                    tree with rough leaves and notched upper lobes, produces an abundance of acorns
                    and good timber, said to be more durable than that of the white oak.</p>
                <p>The pin oak, sometimes called the “over-cup” oak, <hi rend="italic">Q.
                    macrocarρa,</hi> is remarkable for its large acorns, the cups bordered on the
                    edge by a fringe of long narrow scales; the leaves are very large, sometimes
                    from 10 inches to a foot in length, with very deep lobes at the lower part, but
                    dilated widely at tlje"*apex, and there notched. The tree is not of large
                    growth, but its tough wood is useful for bolts and trenails; it is sometimes
                    called the “burr-oak.”</p>
                <p>The true over-cup oak, <hi rend="italic">Q. lyτata,</hi> is a large tree, chiefly
                    found on swampy land in the southern States; the lyrate leaves are dilated at
                    the end; the globose acorns are nearly covered by the tuberculated cups.</p>
                <p>In the woods of Oregon, from the Columbia river southwards, an oak is found,
                    bearing some resemblance to the British oak in foliage and in its thick trunk
                    and widely-spreading boughs, but the bark is white as in <hi rend="italic">Q.
                    alba</hi>; it is <hi rend="italic">Q. Garryana,</hi> the western oak of Nuttall.
                    This tree acquires large dimensions, the trunk being often from 4 to 6 feet in
                    diameter; the wood appears to be good, but experience has scarcely tested its
                    durability; the acorns are produced in great quantity, and are used by the
                    Indians as food.</p>
                <p>The red oak, <hi rend="italic">Q. rubra,</hi> has thin large leaves on long
                    petioles, the lobes very long and acute, the points almost bristly; they are
                    pink when they first expand in spring, but become of a bright glossy green when
                    full-grown; in autumn they change to the deep purple-red which gives the tree
                    its name. Common throughout the northern and middle States and Canada, the red
                    oak attains a large size only on good soils; the wood is of little value, being
                    coarse and porous, but it is largely used for cask - staves; the bark is a
                    valuable tanning material.</p>
                <p>A species nearly allied is the scarlet oak, Q. <hi rend="italic">coccinea,</hi>
                    often confounded with the red oak, but with larger leaves, with long lobes
                    ending in several acute points; they change to a brilliant scarlet with the
                    first October frosts, giving one of the most stri king of the various glowing
                    tints that render the American forests so beautiful in autumn. The trunk, though
                    often of considerable size, yields but an indifferent wood, employed for similar
                    purposes to that of <hi rend="italic">Q. rubra</hi>; the bark is one of the best
                    tanning materials of the country. Both these oaks grow well in British
                    plantations, where their bright autumn foliage, though seldom so decided in tint
                    as in their native woods, gives them a certain picturesque value.</p>
                <p>Nearly akin to these are several other forms of little but botanical interest;
                    not far removed is the black or dyer’s oak, <hi rend="italic">Q. Unctoria,</hi>
                    a large and handsome species, with a trunk sometimes 4 feet in diameter, not
                    uncommon in most forests east of the Mississippi, especially in somewhat upland
                    districts. The leaves are frequently irregular in outline, the lobes rather
                    short and blunt, widening towards the end, but with setaceous points; the acorns
                    are nearly globular. The wood is coarsely grained, as in all the red-oak group,
                    but harder and more durable than that of <hi rend="italic">Q. rubra,</hi> and is
                    often employed for building and for flour-barrels and cask-staves. The bark,
                    very dark externally, is an excellent tanning substance; the inner layers form
                    the <hi rend="italic">quercitron</hi> of commerce, used by dyers for
                    communicating to fabrics various tints of yellow, and, with iron salts, yielding
                    a S3ries of brown and drab hues; the colouring property depends on a crystalline
                    principle called <hi rend="italic">quercitrin,</hi> of which it should contain
                    about 8 per cent. The cut-leaved oaks are represented in eastern Asia by several
                    species, of which <hi rend="italic">Q. mongolica</hi> is widely spread over
                    Dahouria, north China, and the adjacent countries; one of the Chinese silkworms
                    is said to feed on the leaves.</p>
                <p>The chestnut oaks of America represent a section distinguished by the merely
                    serrated leaves, with parallel veins running to the end of the serratures. <hi
                    rend="italic">Q. Prinus,</hi> a beautiful tree of large growth, and its
                    subspecies <hi rend="italic">Q. castanea</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Q.
                    montana,</hi> yield timber little inferior to white oak. <hi rend="italic">Q.
                    Chinquapin</hi> or <hi rend="italic">prinoides,</hi> a dwarf variety, often only
                    a foot in height, forms dense miniature thickets on the barren uplands of Kansas
                    and Missouri, and affords abundant sweet acorns; the tree is called by the
                    hunters of the plains the “shin-oak.”</p>
                <p>Evergreen oaks with entire leaves are represented in North America by <hi
                    rend="italic">Q. virens,</hi> the live oak of the southern States; more or less
                    abundant on the Atlantic coasts of Carolina and Florida, its true home is the
                    country around the Mexican Gulf, where it rarely, grows more than 50 or 60 miles
                    inland. The oval leaves are dark-green above, and whitish with stellate hairs
                    beneath, the margin entire and slightly recurved. The live oak is one of the
                    most valuable timber trees of the genus, the wood being extremely durable, both
                    exposed to air and under water; heavy and close-grained, it is perhaps the best
                    of the American oaks for shipbuilding, and is invaluable for -water-wheels and
                    mill-work. Live oaks grow but slowly, and few large trees are left in the
                    settled districts; but when standing in open places the trunk sometimes attains
                    a great size, and an old tree, with its far-spreading boughs, often clothed with
                    the beard-like «“Spanish moss,” has a peculiarly <pb break="no"

                    near Charleston, is said to have attained a girth of 45 feet at the ground;
                    trees of 12 feet in circumference were formerly not unfrequent. The stalked
                    oblong acorns in elongated cups are pleasant in taste, and were eaten by the
                    Indians of Texas. The tree in England is scarcely hardy, though it will grow
                    freely in some sheltered places. Many varieties of <hi rend="italic">Q.
                    virens</hi> are found in the Mexican isthmus.</p>
                <p>The evergreen oak of southern Europe is <hi rend="italic">Q. Hex,</hi> usually a
                    smaller tree, frequently of rather shrub-like appearance, with abundant glossy
                    dark-green leaves, generally ovate in shape and more or less prickly at the
                    margin, but sometimes with the edges entire; the under surface is hoary; the
                    acorns are oblong on short stalks. The ilex, sometimes called by gardeners the
                    “holm oak” from its resemblance to the holly, abounds in all the Mediterranean
                    countries, showing a partiality for the sea air. The stem sometimes grows 80 or
                    90 feet in height, and old specimens are occasionally of large diameter; but it
                    does not often reach a great size. In its native lands it attains a vast age;
                    Pliny attributes to several trees then growing in Rome a greater antiquity than
                    the city itself. The wood is very heavy and hard, weighing 70 lb the cubic foot;
                    the colour is dark brown; it is used in Spain and Italy for furniture, and in
                    the former country for firewood and charcoal. In Britain the evergreen oak is
                    quite hardy in ordinary winters, and is useful to the ornamental planter from
                    its capacity for resisting the sea gales; but it generally remains of small
                    size. <hi rend="italic">Q. Ballota,</hi> an allied form, abundant in Morocco,
                    bears large edible acorns, which form an article of trade with Spain; an oil,
                    resembling that of the olive, is obtained from them by expression. <hi
                    rend="italic">Q. Gramuntia,</hi> another allied species, also furnishes a fruit
                    which, after acquiring sweetness by keeping, is eaten by the Spaniards.</p>
                <p>In America several oaks exist with narrow lanceolate leaves, from which
                    characteristic they are known as “willow oaks.” <hi rend="italic">Q.
                    Phellos,</hi> a rather large tree found on swampy land in the southern States,
                    is the most important of this group; its timber is of indifferent quality.</p>
                <p>The cork oak, <hi rend="italic">Q. Suber,</hi> has been described in a preceding
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">(Cork).</hi> In Spain the wood is of some value,
                    being hard and close - grained, and the inner bark is used for tanning. From its
                    rugged silvery bark and dark-green foliage, it is a handsome tree, quite hardy
                    in Cornwall and Devonshire, where it has grown to a large size.</p>
                <p>The valonia of commerce, one of the richest of tanning materials, is the acorn of
                    <hi rend="italic">Q. Aegilops,</hi> a fine species indigenous to Greece and the
                    coasts of the Levant, and sometimes called the “Oak of Bashan.” The very large
                    acorns are remarkable for their thick cups with long reflexed scales; the leaves
                    are large, oblong, with deep serratures terminating in a bristle-like point. The
                    cups are the most valuable portion of the valonia, abounding in tannic acid;
                    immature acorns are sometimes exported under the name of ‘ ‘ camatina.” The
                    allied <hi rend="italic">Q. Vallonea</hi> likewise yields valonia.</p>
                <p>Some oaks are of indirect importance from products formed by their insect
                    enemies. Of these the Aleppo gall (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Galls)</hi> is
                    yielded by <hi rend="italic">Q. infectoria. Q. coccifera,</hi> a small bush
                    growing in Spain and many countries around the Mediterranean, furnishes the
                    kermes dye <hi rend="smallcaps">(Kermes).</hi><hi rend="italic">Q. persica,</hi>
                    or according to some <hi rend="italic">Q. mannifera,</hi> attacked by a kind of

                    and use as manna, or as a substitute for honey or sugar in various confections
