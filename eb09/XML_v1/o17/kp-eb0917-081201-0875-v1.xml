                <p><label type="entry">ORANGE</label>, a city of France, the chief town of an
                    arrondissement in the department of Vaucluse, is situated 18 miles north of
                    Avignon on the railway from Lyons to Marseilles at some distance from the left
                    bank of the Rhone, in the midst of meadows, orchards, and mulberry plantations,
                    watered by a stream called the Meyne, and overlooked by the majestic summit of
                    Mount Ventose, which lies 22 miles to the east. The district is highly fertile,
                    and the city deals largely in silks, woollens, and fruits, and also till quite
                    recently in wines and madder. The population of the city numbers 6860. Orange is
                    interesting mainly from its Roman remains. The triumphal arch is not only far
                    finer than any other in France, but ranks third in size and importance among
                    those still extant in Europe. Measuring 72 feet in height, 69 feet in width, and
                    26 feet in depth, it is composed of three arches supported by four Corinthian
                    columns. On three sides it is well preserved, and displays remarkable variety
                    and elegance in its sculptured decorations. To judge from a partly decipherable
                    inscription, the arch seems to have been erected in the reign of Tiberius. It
                    suffered from being used as a fortification in the Middle Ages. Another most
                    imposing structure is the theatre, built against the hill commanding the town.
                    The façade, which is 118 feet high, 340 feet long, and 13 feet thick, is pierced
                    by three square gates surmounted by a range of blind arches and a double row of
                    far-projecting corbels. Of the seats occupied by the spectators—to the number,
                    it might be, of 7000—only the lower ranges remain. By many this theatre is
                    regarded as the most beautiful, or at least the most imposing, of the Roman
                    monuments of France. The princes of Orange made it an outwork of the castle
                    which they erected on the hill, and which was demolished by De Grignan after he
                    had taken the town for Louis XIV. Up to the beginning of the present century it
                    was filled with hovels and stables; these are now quite swept away, and the
                    preservation of the building assured. In the neighbourhood of the theatre traces
                    have been found of a hippodrome capable of containing 20,000 persons; and
                    statues, bas-reliefs, and ruins of an aqueduct also serve to show the importance
                    of the Roman town. Several of the churches at Orange are very old. Notre Dame,
                    the old cathedral, originally erected by the prefect of Gaul, was ruined by the
                    Barbarians, rebuilt in the 11th century, and damaged by the Protestants. A
                    statue of Rambaud II. count of Orange and that of Gasparin the celebrated
                    agriculturist may also be mentioned.</p>
                <p>Orange <hi rend="italic">(Arausio),</hi> capital of the Cavari, became after
                    Caesar an important Roman colony. Its ramparts and fine buildings were partly
                    destroyed by the Alemanni and Visigoths, and partly ruined by the erections of
                    the Middle Ages. Orange was included in the kingdom of Austrasia, fell into the
                    hands of the Saracens, and was recovered by Charlemagne. It became an
                    independent countship in the 11th century; and Count Bertrand de Baux (d. 1181)
                    received from Frederick I. the title of prince of Orange. On the death of
                    Philibert of Chalons in 1530 the inheritance fell to his sister’s son, René
                    (Renatus) of Nassau Dillenburg, stadholder of the Netherlands, who, dying
                    childless, chose (1544) as his successor his cousin William, afterwards William
                    I. Though Francis I., king of France, whose predecessors had long claimed to be
                    suzerains of the principality, caused it to be declared part of the domain of
                    Provence, Henry II. recognized William’s lights in the treaty of Cateau
                    Cambresis, and “prince of Orange” remained the title of the stadholders from
                    Maurice to William III. In 1672 Louis XIV. seized the principality and handed it
                    over to the count of Auvergne in compensation for his loss of the marquisate of
                    Bergen-op-Zoom confiscated by William; but the claims of the house of Nassau
                    were acknowledged by the peace of Ryswick. On William’s death there were two
                    claimants, John William Friso of Nassau-Dietz, designated heir by William’s
                    will, and Frederick I. king of Prussia, who <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n876/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0876-0813"/> held that he was nearer of kin and had been
                    appointed by the will of Frederick Henry. Thereupon Louis XIV. declared the
                    principality forfeited to the French crown and bestowed it on the prince of
                    Conti, who also had pretensions. The parlement of Paris decided that this prince
                    should have the <hi rend="italic">dominium utile</hi>; and its finding was
                    confirmed by the treaty of Utrecht, which, however, left the title and coat of
                    arms to the king of Prussia, who is still styled prince of Orange (Prinz von
                    Oranien). John William Friso, however, also took the title, and his descendants,
                    the stadholders and kings of the Netherlands, have all been designated princes
                    of Orange-Nassau.</p>
