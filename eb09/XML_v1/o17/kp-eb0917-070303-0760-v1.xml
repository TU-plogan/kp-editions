                <p><label type="entry">OBERAMMERGAU</label>, a small village in the mountain valley
                    of the Ammer, in Upper Bavaria, lies 2760 feet above the sea, and about 45 miles
                    to the south-west of Munich. In 1880 it contained 1349 inhabitants, who were
                    mainly engaged in making toys and in carving crucifixes, images of saints, and
                    rosaries. Many of the houses are adorned with quaint frescos of Biblical
                    subjects. The interest of Oberammergau to the outer world is derived from the
                    Passion Plays which are performed here by the villagers at intervals of ten
                    years (the last in 1880), and are now attended by many thousands of European and
                    American visitors.</p>
                <p>The Oberammergau Passion Play, or dramatic representation of the sufferings of
                    Christ, is not a survival of a mediaeval mystery or miracle-play, but took its
                    rise from a vow made by the inhabitants in 1633, with the hope of staying a
                    plague then raging. The original text and arrangements were probably made by the
                    monks of Ettal, a monastery a little higher up the valley; but they were
                    carefully remodelled by the parish priest at the beginning of the present
                    century, when the Oberammergau play obtained exemption from the general
                    suppression of such performances by the Bavarian Government. The music was
                    composed by Rochus Dedler, schoolmaster of the parish in 1814. The performances
                    take place on the Sundays of summer, in a large open-air theatre holding 6000
                    persons, and each lasts about nine hours, with a short intermission at noon.
                    Each scene from the history of Christ is prefaced by a tableau of typical import
                    from the Old Testament. About 700 actors are required, all belonging to the
                    village. The proceeds of the performances are devoted to the good of the
                    community<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n761/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0761-0704"/>, after defrayal of the costs and payment of a
                    small remuneration to the actors. The villagers regard the Passion Play as a
                    solemn act of religious worship, and the performances are characterized by the
                    greatest reverence. The principal parts are usually hereditary in certain
                    families, and are assigned with regard to moral character as well as dramatic
                    ability. It is considered a disgrace not to be allowed to take part in the play,
                    and the part of Christ is looked upon as one of the greatest of earthly honours.
                    In the years intervening between the representations the villagers are carefully
                    drilled in dramatic performances by their pastor, and most witnesses agree in
                    rating very highly the results produced by the combined religious fervour and
                    artistic instinct of these Alpine peasants. It is to be feared, however, that
                    the concourse of fashionable visitors who now flock to the performance will
                    gradually have the effect of impairing its genuineness and simplicity.</p>
                <p>Edward Devrient (in 1850) was among the first to direct general attention to
                    Oberammergau; and numerous German monographs have since appeared on the same
                    subject. A short notice of the play is also given by Hase, <hi rend="italic">Das
                    Geistliche Schauspiel</hi> (Engl. tr. by A. W. Jackson, 1880). English accounts
                    of the performances have been given by Blackburn (new ed., 1880), MacColl
                    (reprinted from the <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> 1880), Molloy (1880), Oxenham
                    (1880), and others. An English version of the text of the Passion Play has been
                    published by E. Chιlde (1880). Articles on the subject have also appeared in the
                    following magazines :— <hi rend="italic">Century,</hi> 1883; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Blackwood’s,</hi> vol. cvii.; <hi rend="italic">Contemporary,</hi> vol. xyiii.;
