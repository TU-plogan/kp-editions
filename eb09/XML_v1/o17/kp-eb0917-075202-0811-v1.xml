                <p><label type="entry">ÖLAND, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Oeland</hi></label>, next to
                    Gottland, the largest of the islands belonging to Sweden, stretches for 85 miles
                    along the east coast of the southern extremity of that country, from which it is
                    separated by the Calmar Sound, about 5 miles broad at the narrowest point, and
                    not more than 10 fathoms deep in the central portion. Its greatest breadth does
                    not exceed 8 or 9 miles, and its area is estimated at 510 square miles.
                    Consisting for the most part of Silurian limestone, and thus forming a striking
                    contrast to the mainland with its granite and gneiss, Öland is further
                    remarkable on account of the peculiarities of its structure. Down the west side
                    for a considerable distance runs a limestone ridge, rising usually in terraces,
                    but at times in steep cliffs, to an extreme height of 200 feet; and along the
                    east side there is a parallel ridge of sand (resting on limestone), never
                    exceeding 90 feet. These ridges, known as the Western and Eastern Landtborgar,
                    are connected towards the north and the south by belts of sand and heath; and
                    the hollow between them is occupied by a desolate and almost barren tract: the
                    southern portion or Allvar (forming fully half of the southern part of the
                    island) presents a surface of bare red limestone scored by superficial cracks
                    and unfathomed fissures, and calcined by the heat refracted from the surrounding
                    heights; and the northern portion is covered at best with a copse of hazel
                    bushes. Outside the ridges, however, Öland has quite a different aspect,— the
                    hillsides being not unfrequently adorned with clumps of trees, and the narrow
                    strip of alluvial coast-land with its cornfields and villages and church towers
                    presenting an appearance of fruitfulness and prosperity. There are only a few
                    small streams in the island; and only one lake, Hornsjö, about 3 miles long,
                    deserves to be mentioned. Of the fir woods which once clothed a considerable
                    area in the north the Böda crown-park is the only remnant. Grain, sandstone, and
                    alum are exported from the island,— the alum mines at South (Södra) Mockleby
                    being in fact the most extensive in Sweden, and furnishing 7000 tons per annum.
