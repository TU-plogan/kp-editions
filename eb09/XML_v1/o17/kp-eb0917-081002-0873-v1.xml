                    plant that produces the familiar fruit of commerce, is closely allied to the
                    citron, lemon, and lime, all the cultivated forms of the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Citrus</hi> being sα nearly related that their specific demarcation must be
                    regarded as somewhat doubtful and indefinite. Risso and Poiteau have described
                    eighty kinds of orange (including the bergamots), chiefly differing in the
                    external shape, size, and flavour of the fruit; but all may probably be traced
                    to two well-marked varieties—the Sweet or China Orange and the Bitter Orange or
                    Bigarade,— though several of these modifications seem to indicate crossing with
                    the lemon or citron, if, indeed, they do not rather point to a more remote
                    common origin from a primitive citrine type.</p>
                <p>The bitter orange, by some made a sub-species <hi rend="italic">(C.
                    vulgaris'),</hi> is a rather small tree, rarely exceeding 30 feet in height. The
                    green shoots are furnished with sharp axillary spines, and alternate evergreen
                    oblong leaves, pointed at the extremity, and with the margins entire or very
                    slightly serrated; they are of a bright glossy green tint, the stalks distinctly
                    winged and, as in the other species, articulated with the leaf. The fragrant
                    white or pale pinkish flowers appear in the summer months, and the fruit,
                    usually round or spheroidal, does not perfectly ripen until the following
                    spring, so that flowers and both green and mature fruit are often found on the
                    plant at the same time. The bitter aromatic rind of the bigarade is rough, and
                    dotted closely over with concave oil-cells; the pulp is acid and more or less
                    bitter in flavour. The sweet orange generally has the shoots destitute of
                    spines, the petioles less distinctly winged, and the leaves more ovate in shape,
                    but chiefly differs in the fruit, the pulp of which is agreeably acidulous and
                    sweet, the rind comparatively smooth, and the oil-cells convex. The ordinary
                    round shape of the sweet orange fruit is varied greatly in certain varieties, in
                    some being greatly elongated, in others much flattened; while several kinds have
                    a conical protuberance at the apex, others are deeply ribbed or furrowed, and a
                    few are distinctly “horned” or lobed, by the partial separation of the carpels.
                    The two sub-species of orange are said by some authorities to reproduce
                    themselves infallibly by seed; and, where hybridizing is prevented, the
                    seedlings of the sweet and bitter orange appear to retain respectively the more
                    distinctive features of the parent plant; but where growing wild for successive
                    generations they show a tendency to degenerate, the progeny of the sweet orange
                    being apt to assume the broadly-winged petioles and spiny shoots of the
                    bigarade.</p>
                <p>Though now cultivated widely in most of the warmer parts of the world, and
                    apparently in many completely naturalized, the diffusion of the orange has taken
                    place in comparatively recent historical periods. To ancient Mediterranean
                    agriculture it was unknown; and, though the later Greeks and Romans were
                    familiar with the citron as an exotic fruit, their “Median Apple” appears to
                    have been the only form of the citrine genus with which they were acquainted.

                    orange spread to western Asia and eventually to Europe. Oranges are at present
                    found wild in the jungles along the lower mountain slopes of Sylhet, Kumaon,
                    Sikkim, and other parts of northern India, and, according to Boyle, even in the
                    Nilgiri Hills; the plants are generally thorny, and present the other characters
                    of the bitter variety, but occasionally wild oranges occur with sweet fruit; it
                    is, however, doubtful whether either sub-species is really indigenous to
                    Hindustan, and De Candolle is probably correct in regarding the Burmese
                    peninsula and southern China as the original home of the orange. Cultivated from
                    a remote period in Hindustan, it was carried to southwestern Asia by the Arabs,
                    probably before the 9th century, towards the close of which the bitter orange
                    seems to have been well known to that people; though, according to Mas'ùdi, it
                    was not cultivated in Arabia itself until the beginning of the 10th century,
                    when it was first planted in Omàn, and afterwards carried to Mesopotamia and
                    Syria. It spread ultimately, through the agency of the same race, to Africa and
                    Spain, and perhaps to Sicily, following everywhere the tide of Mohammedan
                    conquest and civilization. In the 12th century the bigarade was abundantly
                    cultivated in all the Levant countries, and the returning soldiers of the Cross
                    brought it from Palestine to Italy and Provence. An orange tree of this variety
                    is said to have been planted by St Dominic in the year 1200, though the identity
                    of the one still standing in the garden of the monastery of St Sabina at Rome,
                    and now attributed to the energetic friar, may be somewhat doubtful. No allusion
                    to the sweet orange occurs in contemporary literature at this early date, and
                    its introduction to Europe took place at a considerably later period, though the
                    exact time is unknown. It was commonly cultivated in Italy early in the 16th
                    century, and seems to have been known there previously to the expedition of Da
                    Gama (1497), as a Florentine narrator of that voyage appears to have been
                    familiar with the fruit. The importation of this tree into Europe, though often
                    attributed to the Portuguese, is with more probability referred to the
                    enterprise of the Genoese merchants of the 15th century, who must have found it
                    growing abundantly then in the Levant. The prevailing European name of the
                    orange is sufficient evidence of its origin and of the line taken in its
                    migration westward. The Sanskrit designation <hi rend="italic">nagrungo,</hi>
                    becoming <hi rend="italic">narungee</hi> in Hindustani, and corrupted by the
                    Arabs into <hi rend="italic">ndran</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">j</hi> (Spanish <hi rend="italic">naranja),</hi> passed by easy

                    the later Provençal <hi rend="italic">orange.</hi> The true Chinese variety,
                    however, was undoubtedly brought by the Portuguese navigators direct from the
                    East both to their own country and to the Azores, where now luxuriant groyes of
                    the golden-fruited tree give a modern realization to the old myth of the gardens
                    of the Hesperides.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    modern Arabic name, Bortukân (that is, Portuguese), shows that the China apple
                    reached the Levant from the West</p></note> Throughout China and in Japan the
                    orange has been grown from very ancient times, and it was found diffused widely
                    when the Indian Archipelago was first visited by Europeans. In more recent days
                    its cultivation has extended over most of the warmer regions of the globe, the
                    tree growing freely and producing fruit abundantly wherever heat is sufficient
                    and enough moisture can be supplied to the roots; where night-frosts occur in
                    winter or spring the culture becomes more difficult and the crop precarious.</p>
                <p>The orange flourishes in any moderately fertile soil, if it is well drained and
                    sufficiently moist; but a rather stiff loam or calcareous marl, intermingled
                    with some vegetable humus, is most favourable to its growth. Grafting or budding
                    on stocks raised from the seed of some vigorous variety is the plan usually
                    adopted by the cultivator. The seeds, carefully selected, are sown in
                    well-prepared ground, and the seedlings removed to a nursery-bed in the fourth
                    or fifth year, and, sometimes after a second transplantation, grafted in the
                    seventh or eighth year with the desired variety. When the grafts have acquired
                    sufficient vigour, the trees are placed in rows in the permanent orangery.
                    Propagation by layers is occasionally adopted; cuttings do not readily root, and
                    multiplication directly by seed is always doubtful in result, though recommended
                    by some authorities. The distance left between the trees in the permanent
                    plantation or grove varies according to the size of the plants and subsequent
                    culture adopted. In France, when the trunks are from 5 to 6⅜ feet in height, a
                    space of from 16 to 26 feet is left between; but the dwarfer trees admit of much
                    closer planting. In the West Indies and Azores an interval of 24 or even of 30
                    feet is often allowed. The ground is kept well stirred between the trunks, and
                    the roots manured with well-rotted dung, guano, or other highly nitrogenous
                    matter; shallow pits are sometimes formed above the roots for the reception of
                    liquid or other manures; in dry climates water must be abundantly and frequently
                    supplied. The trees require regular and careful pruning, the heads being trained
                    as nearly as possible to a spherical form. Between the rows melons, pumpkins,
                    and other annual vegetables are frequently raised. In garden culture the orange
                    is often trained as an espalier, and with careful attention yields fruit in
                    great profusion when thus grown. In favourable seasons the oranges are produced
                    in great abundance, from 400 to 1000 being commonly borne on a single plant in
                    full bearing, while on large trees the latter number is often vastly exceeded.
                    The trees will continue to bear abundantly from fifty to eighty years, or even
                    more; and some old orange trees, whose age must be reckoned by centuries, still
                    produce their golden crop; these very ancient trees are, however, generally of
                    the bitter variety. Oranges intended for export to colder climates are gathered
                    long before the deep tint that indicates maturity is attained, the fruit
                    ripening rapidly after picking; but the delicious taste of the mature China
                    orange is never thus acquired, and those who have not eaten the fruit in a
                    perfectly ripe state have little idea of its flavour when in that condition.
                    Carefully gathered, the oranges are packed in boxes, each orange being wrapped
                    in paper, or with dry maize husks or leaves placed between them. The immense
                    quantities of this valuable fruit imported into Britain are derived from various
                    sources, but those kinds in most esteem are the produce of the Azores, whence,
                    in 1878, 410,101 boxes, each holding 400 “St Michael’s” oranges, are said to
                    have been sent to Great Britain alone. Large numbers are also exported to
                    England from Sicily, Portugal, and Spain, and a considerable amount from other
                    Mediterranean countries. North America is largely supplied from Jamaica and the
                    Bahamas; but the extensive and rapidly increasing cultivation of the tree in
                    Florida will probably in a few years supersede the foreign importation. In that
                    State the bitter orange has grown, from an unknown period, in a wild condition,
                    and some of the earlier botanical explorers regarded it as an indigenous tree;
                    but it was undoubtedly brought by the Spanish colonists to the West India
                    Islands, and was probably soon afterwards transplanted to Florida by them or
                    their buccaneering enemies. The climate of Florida seems remarkably adapted for
                    orange culture, and orangeries are becoming yearly more numerous and
                    extensive,—the wild stocks, or those raised from wild seed, being generally
                    employed by the grafter. In the other Gulf States this branch of agricultural
                    industry is pursued to some extent; and in California the orange groves are
                    productive and increasing.</p>

                <p>Orange cultivation has been attempted with success in several parts of Australia,
                    especially in New South Wales, where the orange groves near Paramatta yield an
                    abundant colonial supply. The orangeries of Queensland and South Australia are
                    likewise producing well, though, as yet, Australian fruit is chiefly consumed at
                    home. In many of the Pacific Islands the plant has been long established: Tahiti
                    exports oranges largely to San Francisco, and in Fiji the culture promises to
                    become of considerable importance.</p>
                <p>Certain varieties of orange deserve mention, from the peculiar character of their
                    fruit. The Mandarin orange of China, sometimes made a distinct species, <hi
                    rend="italic">C.</hi><hi rend="italic">nobilis,</hi> is remarkable for its very
                    flat spheroidal fruit, the rind of which readily separates with the slightest
                    pressure; the pulp has a peculiarly luscious flavour when ripe. The small
                    Tangerine oranges, valued for their fine fragrance, are derived from the
                    Mandarin. “Maltese” or “Blood” oranges, much grown in southern Italy, are
                    distinguished by the deep-red tint of the pulp. The Bergamot has been already
                    described (see vol. iii. p. 587). Orange plantations in Europe suffer much at
                    times from a disease called by the French <hi rend="italic">charbon,</hi> caused
                    by a fungus <hi rend="italic">(Demathium monophyllιιm),</hi> which rapidly
                    spreads over stems, leaves, and green fruit Several insect enemies attack the
                    plant, of which the scale-like <hi rend="italic">Coccus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >citri</hi> is the most injurious in Europe; in the Azores <hi rend="italic"
                    >C.</hi><hi rend="italic">Hesperidis</hi> takes its place. Cold weather in
                    winter has sometimes proved destructive in Provence, and many plantations were
                    destroyed by the hard frosts of 1789 and 1820.</p>
                <p>Besides the widespread use of the fruit as an agreeable and wholesome article of
                    diet, that of the sweet orange, abounding in citric acid, possesses in a high
                    degree the antiscorbutic properties that render the lemon and lime so valuable
                    in medicine; and the free consumption of this fruit in the large towns of
                    England during the winter months has doubtless a very beneficial effect on the
                    health of the people. The juice is sometimes employed as a cooling drink in
                    fevers, as well as for making a pleasant beverage in hot weather; it is likewise
                    an essential ingredient in “orange wine.”</p>
                <p>The bitter orange is chiefly cultivated for the aromatic and tonic qualities of
                    the rind, which render it a valuable stomachic. Planted long ago in Andalusia by
                    the Moorish conquerors, it is still extensively grown in southern
                    Spain,—deriving its common English name of “Seville” orange from the abundant
                    groves that still exist around that city, though the plant is now largely
                    cultivated elsewhere. The fruit is imported into Great Britain and the United
                    States in considerable quantities for the manufacture of the favourite
                    confection known as orange marmalade, which is prepared from the pulp and rind,
                    usually more or less mingled with the pulp of the China orange. In medicine the
                    dried peel is largely employed as an aromatic tonic, and often, in tincture and
                    infusion, as a mere vehicle to disguise the flavour of more nauseous remedies.
                    The essential oil of the rind is collected for the use of the perfumer, being
                    obtained either by the pressure of the fresh peel against a piece of sponge, or
                    by the process known as <hi rend="italic">écuclle,</hi> in which the skin of the
                    ripe fruit is scraped against a series of points or ridges arranged upon the
                    surface of a peculiarly-shaped dish or broad funnel, when the oil flows freely
                    from the broken cells. Another fragrant oil, called in France <hi rend="italic"
                    >essence de petit grain,</hi> is procured by the distillation of the leaves,
                    from which also an aromatic water is prepared. The flowers of both sweet and
                    bitter orange yield, when distilled with water, the “oil of Neroli” of the
                    druggist and perfumer, and likewise the fragrant liquid known as “orange -
                    flower water.” The candied peel is much in request by cook and confectioner; the
                    favourite liqueur sold as “curaçoa” derives its aromatic flavour from the rind
                    of the bigarade. The minute immature oranges that drop from the trees are
                    manufactured into “issuepeas”; from those of the sweet orange in a fresh state a
                    sweetmeat is sometimes prepared in France. Orange trees occasionally acquire a
                    considerable diameter; the trunk of one near Nice, still standing in 1789, was
                    so large that two men could scarcely embrace it; the tree was killed by the
                    intense cold of the winter of that year. The wood of the orange is of a fine
                    yellow tint, and, being hard and close-grained, is valued by the turner and
                    cabinetmaker for the manufacture of small articles; it takes a good polish.</p>
                <p>Although the bitter “Poma de Orenge” were brought in small quantities from Spain
                    to England as early as the year 1290, no attempt appears to have been made to
                    cultivate the tree in Britain until about 1595, when some plants were introduced
                    by the Carews of Beddington in Surrey, and placed in their garden, where,
                    trained against a wall, and sheltered in winter, they remained until destroyed
                    by the great frost of 1739-40. In the last century the tree became a favourite
                    object of conservatory growth; in the open air, planted against a wall, and
                    covered with mats in winter, it has often stood the cold of many seasons in the
                    southern counties, in such situations the trees occasionally bearing abundant
                    fruit; but in Great Britain the orange can only be regarded as an object of
                    ornamental culture. The trees are usually imported from Italy, where, especially
                    near Nervi, such plants are raised in great numbers for exportation; they are
                    generally budded on the stocks of some free-growing variety, often on the lemon
                    or citron.</p>
