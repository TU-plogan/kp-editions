                <p><label type="entry">ORANGE RIVER FREE STATE</label>, an independent republic
                    adjoining the Cape Colony, South Africa (see vol. vi., Plate I.), is bounded on
                    the N. by the Vaal river, S. by the Orange river, E. by the Caledon river and
                    Drakensberg mountains, and W. by a line dividing it from Kimberley and the
                    diamond fields of Griqualand West. The area is 70,000 square miles, and the
                    population in 1880 was 133,518, Of this total 61,022 were whites or of European
                    extraction (mostly Dutch), and 72,496 coloured or of native races.</p>
                <p>The country, which has an average elevation of 4500 feet above the sea, consists
                    of a series of extensive undulating plains, bounded or diversified by detached
                    rocky hills, These plains slope from the central watershed northward and
                    southward respectively to the Vaal and Orange rivers, and are intersected at
                    various intervals by the Wilge, Rhen oster, Valsch, Vet, Modder, and Riet
                    rivers, emptying their waters into the Vaal river, and by the Caledon, which
                    joins the Orange river. The southern and eastern districts are covered with
                    luxuriant grasses, affording excellent pasturage for stock. In the western
                    districts the grasses are gradually being supplanted by a dwarf bush vegetation.
                    The river-banks are fringed with willow, mimosa, and other indigenous trees, and
                    shrubs and trees of larger growth are found on the eastern mountain ranges; but
                    generally the country is woodless, and to remedy this Government offers premiums
                    for the encouragement of tree-planting. The geological characteristics are
                    similar to those of the inland districts of Cape Colony. The south-western
                    portion is an extension of the Karroo or lacustrine formation of South Africa,
                    consisting of sandstone and shales intersected by intrusive igneous rocks. In
                    this formation occurs the diamond mine of Jagersfontein, near the village of
                    Fauresmith, which has been worked for several years past. The north-eastern
                    part, again, consists of sandstones and carbonaceous shales resting conformably
                    on the Karroo formation, and containing horizontal coal-seams, classed as of the
                    Triassic period. The coal outcrops in the Kronstad and Heilbron districts are
                    being utilized, In the Drift deposits along some river-beds, such as the Sand,
                    Caledon, and Vaal rivers, there are accumulations of pebbles, consisting of
                    agate, jasper, chalcedony, carnelian, white quartz, garnets, and occasionally
                    diamonds.</p>
                <p>The climate is salubrious, and specially remarkable for its dryness. Thousands of
                    wild game formerly occupied the plains of the state, but their numbers and
                    variety have of late greatly diminished, and some have been entirely
                    exterminated. The lion, giraffe, elephant, and rhinoceros are no longer found.
                    But in a few districts there may still be seen considerable herds of antelopes,
                    such as the springbok, blesbok, and wildebeeste or gnu. The resources of the
                    state are agricultural, pastoral, and mineral. The principal occupations of the
                    inhabitants are the breeding of cattle, horses, goats, merino sheep, and
                    ostriches. Agriculture is attended to on a larger or smaller scale according to
                    the capabilities of the various farms, and vineyards and orchards are planted on
                    many properties. The staple articles of export, however, are wool, skins,
                    ostrich feathers, and diamonds, all of which are shipped from the seaports of
                    the Cape Colony and Natal.</p>
                <p>Bloemfontein, the capital and seat of government, is situated about the centre of
                    the state, in 28° 56' S. lat. and 26° 18' E. long. It is an agreeable town, with
                    a population of about 3000, and has a handsome range of public offices, where
                    the volksraad or assembly of the people meets, a high court (consisting of a
                    chief-justice and two puisne judges), a municipal burgher council, two banks,
                    two newspapers, two hotels, clubs, a college, schools, and several churches,
                    including the Dutch Reformed church, the Anglican church with a resident bishop,
                    and Wesleyan, Lutheran, and Roman Catholic churches. The Dutch language is
                    officially used in the volksraad and the courts of justice, but English is
                    spoken by the community generally.</p>
                <p>The other towns or villages of the state are—Fauresmith, Edenburg, Philippolis,
                    Jacobsdal, Boshoff, Winburg, Hoopstad, Kronstad, Heilbron, Frankfort,
                    Harrismith, Ladybrand, Ficksburg, Bethulie, Bethlehem, Smithfield, Rouxville,
                    and Wepener.</p>
                <p>At the commencement of this century the country was inhabited by sections of
                    aboriginal tribes—Bushmen, Korannas, and Bechuanas; and soon afterwards a number
                    of Griquas from the north-west of the Cape Colony came in among them. A chronic
                    state of warfare prevailed between these races. In 1824 nomad farmers from the
                    Colony, seeking pastures for their flocks, crossed the Orange river and settled
                    in the territory. These were followed in 1835-36 by large bodies of Dutch Boer
                    emigrants who <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n877/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0877-0814"/> left the Colony in order to be beyond British
                    control. They formed a rude government for themselves, and in attempting to
                    exercise authority came into collision with the Griquas, who claimed protection
                    from the Colony, with which they were allied by treaty. The British governor,
                    Sir P. Maitland, intervened in 1845, assisting the Griquas with troops, and
                    defeating the Boers at Zwart Koppies; and, to prevent further collisions, a
                    resident was appointed. In 1848 Governor Sir H. Smith visited the territory, and
                    came to the conclusion that peace could not be maintained among the mixed
                    elements forming the population without the establishment of a regular
                    government. He therefore issued a proclamation, afterwards confirmed by the
                    crown, annexing the territory to the empire under the name of the Orange River
                    British Sovereignty. Thereupon some of the Boers, under their leader Pretorias,
                    took up arms and expelled the British magistrates; but a military force was
                    brought against them by Sir H. Smith in person, and, after a short but sharp
                    encounter at Boomplaats, the Boers were defeated, and the crown’s authority
                    re-established and maintained from that time until towards the close of 1853.
                    During this period many Europeans and colonists of European descent took up
                    their abode in the sovereignty. But disturbances again occurred, arising from
                    long-standing disputes between the native tribes; and, in order to chastise the
                    most powerful of them—the Basutos∙—for certain acts of outrage, Governor
                    Cathcart in 1852 moved a large military expedition against their chief, Moshesh,
                    and the battle of the Berea was fought, after which the chief, on behalf of the
                    tι ’ ibe, gave in his submission. After this expedition the British Government
                    resolved to withdraw from the territory. Sir George Clerk was deputed as a
                    special commissioner to carry out the abandonment of the country; and,
                    notwithstanding the protests of many inhabitants, he formally handed it over to
                    a body of Boer delegates in terms of a convention entered into on the 23d
                    February 1854. They were released from their allegiance, and permitted to
                    constitute an independent republican community of their own, under the title of
                    the “Orange River Free State.” Since that time the government has been in the
                    hands of a president assisted by an executive council, with a volksraad or
                    congress elected by the people, exercising all legislative functions.</p>
                <p>I n the south-eastern portion of the State, and entirely surrounded by it, is a
                    small independent native territory, of which the principal village is
                    Thaba-Ncnu, where 10,000 of the Baralong tribe reside, peaceably ruled by their
                    chief according to their own laws.</p>
