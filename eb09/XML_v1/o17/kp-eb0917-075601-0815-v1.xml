                <p>I. The duchy of Oldenburg, comprising fully four-fifths of the entire area and

                    7° 37' and 8° 40' E. long., and is bounded on the N. by the German Ocean and on
                    the other three sides by Hanover, with the exception of a small strip on the
                    east, where it is conterminous with the territory of the free city of Bremen. It
                    forms part of the north-western German plain defined by the Weser and the Ems,
                    and, except on the south, where the Dammergebirge attain a height of 300 feet,
                    it is almost entirely flat, with a slight inclination towards the sea. In
                    respect of its soil it is divided broadly into two parts,—the higher and
                    inland-lying “Geest,” consisting of sandy plains intermixed with extensive
                    heaths and moors, and the “marsh lands” along the coast, consisting of rich but
                    somewhat swampy alluvial soil. The latter, which compose about one-fifth of the
                    duchy, are protected against the inroads of the sea by dykes as in Holland; and
                    beyond these are the so-called “watten,” generally covered at high tide, but at
                    many points being gradually reclaimed. The climate is temperate and humid; the
                    mean temperature of the coldest month at the town of Oldenburg is 26° Fahr., of
                    the warmest 66°. Storms are numerous and somewhat violent, owing to the almost
                    entire absence of trees; and fogs and ague are prevalent in the marsh lands. The
                    chief rivers are the Hunte, flowing into the Weser, and the Hase and Leda
                    draining into the Ems. The Weser itself forms the eastern boundary for 42 miles,
                    and internal navigation is greatly facilitated by a new canal, passing through
                    the heart of the duchy and connecting the Hunte and the Ems. On the north there
                    are several small coast streams conducted through the dykes by sluices, the only
                    one of importance being the Jade, which empties itself into the Jadebusen, a
                    deep gulf affording admirable accommodation for shipping. The duchy also
                    contains numerous small lakes, the chief of which is the Dümmer See in the
                    south-east corner, measuring 4 miles in length by 2∣ in width. About 30 per
                    cent, of the area of the duchy is under cultivation and 17 per cent, under
                    pasture and meadows, while the rest consists mainly of moor and heath. The
                    forests occupy a very small proportion of the whole, but there are some very
                    fine old oaks. In the Geest the principal crops are rye, oats, potatoes, and
                    buckwheat, for which the heath is sometimes prepared by burning. Large tracts of
                    moorland are, however, useful only as producing an abundant .supply of turf and
                    peat for fuel, or as affording a scanty subsistence to the flocks of small
                    coarse-woolled Oldenburg sheep. The rich soil of the marsh lands produces good
                    crops of wheat, oats, rye, hemp, and rape, but is especially adapted for
                    grazing. The fat cattle and horses raised on it are highly esteemed throughout
                    Germany, and the former are exported in large numbers to England. Bee-keeping is
                    also much in vogue on the moors. The live stock of Oldenburg forms a great part
                    of its wealth, and the ratio of cattle, sheep, and horses to the population is
                    one of the highest among the German states. There are few large estates, and the
                    ground is mostly in the hands of small farmers, who enjoy the right of fishing
                    and shooting on their holdings. Game, however, is scarce; but the fishing is
                    fairly productive. The mineral wealth of Oldenburg is very small, and there are
                    no mineral springs.</p>
                <p>The industries are comparatively insignificant, though recently somewhat
                    stimulated by the extension of the railway system and other causes. Woollen and
                    cotton fabrics, stockings, jute, and cigars are made at Varel, Delmenhorst, and
                    Lohne; cork-cutting is extensively practised in some districts, and there are a
                    few iron-foundries. Trade is relatively of more importance, chiefly owing to the
                    proximity of Bremen. The agricultural produce of the duchy is exported to
                    Scandinavia, Russia, England, and the United States, in return for colonial
                    goods and manufactures. Varel, Brake, and Elsfleth are the chief commercial
                    harbours. In 1881 the ports of the duchy owned a merchant fleet of 345 vessels
                    of 70,000 tons, and they are entered and cleared annually by from 2000 to 2500
                    vessels with an aggregate burden of 125,000 tons. Shipbuilding and boat-building
                    are carried on at the above-named seaports and on the tributaries of the Ems.
                    Before 1866 Oldenburg was destitute of railways, but it is now traversed by
                    various lines. The high-roads are good; in the north some of them are laid with
                    “klinkers” like those in Holland.</p>
                <p>II. The principality of Lübeck, formed of the old bishopric of that name, has an
                    area of 209 square miles, and shares in the general physical characteristics of
                    East Holstein, within which it lies. On the north-east it extends to the Baltic
                    Sea, and on the south-west it is bounded by the Trave. The chief rivers are the
                    Schwartau, a tributary of the Trave <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> and the
                    Schwentine, flowing northwards to the Gulf of Kiel. The scenery of Lübeck is
                    often picturesque, especially in the vicinity of the Plöner See and the Eutiner
                    See, the most important of the small lakes with which it is dotted. Agriculture
                    is practised here even more extensively than in the duchy of Oldenburg, about 7
                    5 per cent, of the area being cultivated. The population in 1880 was 34,973.</p>
                <p>III. The principality of Birkenfeld, 194 square miles in extent, lies in the
                    midst of the Prussian province of the Rhine, about 30 miles to the west of the
                    Rhine at Worms and 150 miles to the south of the duchy of Oldenburg. It is a
                    hilly district, intersected by the spurs of the Hochwald, which attain a height
                    of over 2000 feet; the valleys, however, are fertile and produce wine and grain
                    in considerable abundance. About two-fifths of the surface are covered with
                    forests. Iron-founding, cotton-spinning, and other manufactures are carried on;
                    but the characteristic industry (having its seat in Oberstein) is the polishing
                    of agates, of which great numbers are found within the principality (compare <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Onyx).</hi> Birkenfeld is traversed from end to end, a distance
                    of about 25 miles, by the Nahe, which rises close to its northern frontier. The
                    population in 1880 was 38,685.</p>
                <p>The total population of the grand-duchy of Oldenburg in 1880 was 337,478, showing
                    an increase of l ’ 10 per cent, per annum since the census of 1875, and an
                    average of 136 persons to the square mile. The bulk of the inhabitants are of
                    the Saxon stock, but to the north and west there are numerous descendants of the
                    ancient Frisians. The differences between the two races are still to some extent
                    perceptible, but Low German ( “Platt-deutsch ”) is universally spoken, except in
                    one limited district, where a Frisian dialect has maintained itself. In general
                    characteristics the Oldenburg peasants resemble the Dutch, and the absence of
                    large landowners has contributed to make them sturdy and independent. Oldenburg
                    has the credit of showing almost the lowest average of illegitimate births among
                    the German states, amounting in 1881 to only 5 per cent. This is in significant
                    contrast to the high rate (15 per cent. ) among the semi-feudatory peasants of
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Mecklenburg</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.υ.).</hi> The
                    population of Oldenburg is somewhat unequally distributed, some parts of the
                    marsh lands containin ’ over 300 persons to the square mile, ∖yhile in the Geest
                    the number occasionally sinks as low as 40. Nearly 80 per cent, of the
                    inhabitants are returned as belonging to the “rural” population. The only town
                    with more than 10,000 inhabitants is Oldenburg, the capital of the grand-duchy.
                    The war-harbour of Wilhelmshaven, with 12,000 inhabitants, on the shore of the
                    Jadebusen, was built by Prussia on a piece of land bought from Oldenburg. The
                    chief towns of Birkenfeld and Lübeck are Birkenfeld and Eutin, with 2539 and
                    4574 inhabitants respectively. Oberstein in Birkenfeld has 4803; in the 12th
                    century it was a lordship holding directly of the empire.</p>
                <p>Oldenburg is a Protestant country, and the grand-duke is required to be a member
                    of the Lutheran Church. Roman Catholicism, however, preponderates in the
                    south-western provinces, which formerly belonged to the bishopric of Munster.
                    Oldenburg Roman Catholics are under the sway of the bishop of Münster, who is
                    represented <pb break="no"

                    Birkenfeld belong to the diocese of Treves. At the census of 1880 there were in
                    the grand-duchy 260,416 Protestants, 74,254 Homan Catholics, and 1654 Jews. The
                    educational system of Oldenburg is on a similar footing to that of north Germany
                    in general, though the scattered position of the farmhouses interferes to some
                    extent with school attendance. The proportion of Oldenburg recruits in 1882
                    unable to read or write was only 0 ’ 27 per cent., which compares favourably
                    with ..the average of 154 for the whole empire. There is no university in
                    Oldenburg territory, but an ample supply of primary, secondary, and special
                    schools.</p>
                <p>The constitution of Oldenburg, based upon a decree of 1849, revised in 1852, is
                    one of the most liberal in Germany. It provides for a single representative
                    chamber, elected indirectly by universal suffrage and exercising concurrent
                    rights of legislation and taxation with the grand-duke. The chamber, which
                    consists of thirty-four members (twenty-six for Oldenburg and four for each of
                    the principalities), meets at regular intervals of three years. The executive
                    consists of three ministers, who are aided by a committee of the landtag, when
                    that body is not in session. The local affairs of Birkenfeld and Lubeck are
                    entrusted to provincial councils. All citizens are alike in the eye of the law.
                    and all exemptions and privileges have been abolished. The municipal communities
                    enjoy an unusual amount of independence.</p>
                <p>The finances of each constituent state of the grand-duchy are managed separately,
                    and there is also a fourth budget concerned with the joint administration. The
                    last generally shows a sum of about £50,000 on each side, the expenditure
                    including a matricular contribution of £33,500 to the imperial treasury. In the
                    budget of 1882 the revenues of the duchy of Oldenburg, the principality of
                    Lübeck, and the principality of Birkenfeld were estimated at £289,965, £40,419,
                    and £43.864, while the estimated expenditure was in each case somewhat less. The
                    duchy of Oldenburg has a debt of nearly £2,000.000 and Lübeck one of £2000,
                    while Birkenfeld and the grand-duchy as a whole are free of debt. An annual
                    allowance of about £13,000 is made to the grand-duke, and he is believed to
                    derive as much more from his private estates. The troops of Oldenburg furnish
                    the German army with a regiment of infantry, a regiment of cavalry, and two
                    batteries of artillery.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The earliest recorded inhabitants of this
                    district were the Germanic Chauci, who were afterwards merged in the Frisians.
                    Old chroniclers delight in tracing the genealogy of the counts of Oldenburg up
                    to Wittekind, the stubborn opponent of Charlemagne; but their first historical
                    representative is Elimar I., who flourished at the close of the 11th century.
                    His descendants appear as vassals of the powerful Saxon dukes, but attained the
                    rank of independent princes of the empire on the dissolution of the Saxon power
                    by Frederick Barbarossa (c. 1180). The countship of Delmenhorst at this time
                    formed part of the Oldenburg dominions, but was afterwards frequently separated
                    from them, and was not lastingly united under the same ruler till the beginning
                    of the 17th century. The northern and western parts of the present duchy of
                    Oldenburg were in the hands of more or less independent Frisian princes, who had
                    generally remained pagans; and Oldenburg history for the next two centuries is
                    largely concerned with feuds with these small potentates, and gradual extension
                    of territory at their expense. Bremen and Münster were also frequently at war
                    with the counts of Oldenburg. In 1448 Count Christian VIII. was elected king of
                    Denmark, and, a little later, duke of Holstein and Schleswig, the latter event
                    pregnant with important consequences for future history. Oldenburg was made over
                    to his brother Gerhard, an ambitious prince, whose turbulent disposition
                    resulted in an abdication in favour of his sons, forced on him by a league of
                    Hamburg, Lübeck, and Bremen. Protestantism was introduced by Anton I.
                    (1531-1573), who, however, remained loyal to Charles V. in the Schmalkald war,
                    and was thus enabled to increase his territories. On the accession of Anton
                    Günther in the beginning of the 17th century Oldenburg and Delmenhorst were
                    finally welded into one, and about the same period the last free Frisian states,
                    Jever and Kniphausen, were also absorbed by Oldenburg. Anton Günther proved
                    himself the wisest prince who had ruled in Oldenburg, and by his prudent
                    neutrality in the Thirty Years’ War secured for Lis domains immunity from the
                    devastations to which most other German states were exposed. He also obtained
                    from the emperor the right to levy tolls on vessels passing up the Weser, a
                    lucrative grant, which soon formed one-fifth of his revenues. On his death
                    without issue in 1667 the succession passed to the Danish reigning house, after
                    the claims of the Holstein-Gottorp and Holstein-Sonderburg branches of the
                    family had been compromised. Oldenburg remained under the sway of the Danish
                    monarchs for about a century,— a period, on the whole, of peaceful development.
                    At length, in 1773, the Danish monarch agreed to a family compact, in accordance
                    with which he resigned Oldenburg to the Holstein-Gottorp line in return for a
                    renunciation on their part of all claim to Schleswig and Holstein. The head of
                    the Holstein-Gottorp family at this time was the grand-duke Paul of Russia
                    (afterwards the emperor Paul I.); but he handed over Oldenburg, which was now
                    created a duchy, to his cousin Frederick Augustus, bishop of Lübeck,
                    representative of a younger line. The bishop’s son, who followed his father in
                    1785, was a man of weak intellect; and his cousin, Peter Frederick Louis, who
                    acted as administrator and eventually succeeded to the t hrone, is the direct
                    progenitor of the present grand-duke. Peter had the task of managing the duchy
                    in the troublous times of the Napoleonic wars, and, though he joined the
                    Confederation of the Rhine, had afterwards to see his domains forcibly annexed
                    to France on his refusal to exchange them for Erfurt. This led him to join the
                    allies, and his services were rewarded at the congress of Vienna by the addition
                    of Birkenfeld to his dominions, which were also raised to the rank of a
                    grand-duchy. The secularized bishopric of Lübeck had been already added to
                    Oldenburg in 1803. Oldenburg did not escape the revolutionary wave that swept
                    over Europe in 1848, but no very serious disturbances took place, and the
                    grandduke granted a constitution in 1849. This constitution was of an
                    ultra-liberal character, and, as the country had hitherto been ruled in the
                    spirit of an enlightened but absolute despotism, strengthened by the absence of
                    a privileged class of nobles, the unimportance of the towns, and the comparative
                    independence of the peasantry, it was inevitable that it should not work at once
                    without friction. In 1852 it had to submit to some modification, which, however,
                    still left it one of the most liberal constitutions in Germany. In 1864 the
                    grand-duke seemed at first inclined to insist upon his claims to the
                    Schleswig-Holstein succession, but he ultimately resigned them in favour of
                    Prussia. In 1866 he sided with that power against Austria, and in 1871 the
                    grand-duchy became a member of the German empire.</p>

                    surrounded by avenues laid out on the site of the former ramparts, beyond which
                    are the villas, parks, and gardens of the more modern quarters. Oldenburg has
                    almost nothing to show in the shape of interesting old buildings. The
                    Lambertikirche, though dating from the 13th century, has been so transformed in
                    the present century as to show no trace of its antiquity. The palaces of the
                    grand-duke and the town-house are Renaissance buildings of the 17 th and 18th
                    centuries. Among the other prominent buildings—all modern—are the theatre, the
                    law-courts, the gymnasium, the commercial school, the three hospitals, and the
                    new Roman Catholic church. The grand-ducal picture-gallery in the Augusteum
                    includes works by Veronese, Velazquez, Murillo, and Rubens; and there are
                    collections of modern paintings and sculptures in the two palaces. The public
                    library contains 150,000 vols., and the duke’s private library has 50,000. There
                    is also a museum with a collection of antiquities and a cabinet of natural
                    history. The industries of Oldenburg, which are of no great importance, include
                    iron-founding and the making of tobacco, soap, and leather. A considerable trade
                    is carried on in grain, and the horse-fairs are largely frequented. The
                    population in 1880 was 20,575, or, including the suburban village of Osternburg
                    on the other side of the Hunte and the Hunte-Ems Canal, 24,678. About
                    four-fifths of these are Protestants.</p>
                <p>According to popular tradition Oldenburg was founded by Walbert, grandson of
                    Wittekind, and named after his wife Altburga; but the first historical mention
                    of it occurs in a document of 1108. It was fortified in 1155, and received a
                    municipal charter in 1345. The subsequent history of the town is merged in that
                    of the grandduchy. (J. F. Μ.)</p>
