                    (1740-1826), pastor and philanthropist, was the son of a teacher, and was born
                    31st August 1740 at Strasburg, where he studied theology. In 1766 he became
                    Protestant pastor of Waldbach, a remote and poverty-stricken region in the
                    Steinthal (Ban de la Roche) in Alsace. At once he set himself to better the
                    material equally with the spiritual condition of the inhabitants. He began by
                    constructing roads through the valley and erecting bridges, inciting the
                    peasantry to the enterprise by himself taking a mattock and commencing
                    operations. His example proved equally effectual in introducing an improved
                    system of agriculture, with the result that the sterile Waldbach soon “began to
                    blossom as the rose.” Substantial cottages were erected, various industrial arts
                    were introduced, and activity and comfort began to prevail in homes formerly
                    tenanted by listless and ignoble poverty. Regarding the intellectual needs of
                    his parishioners Oberlin was also keenly solicitous. He founded an itinerant
                    library, originated infant schools—the first that have existed—and established
                    an ordinary school at each of the five villages in the parish. In the work of
                    education he received great assistance from Louise Scheppler, who lived in his
                    house in the capacity of servant and housekeeper. By his unselfish devotion to
                    their interests Oberlin won so entirely the confidence of his parishioners that
                    he was consulted in the most minute domestic affairs, and his word became the
                    recognized unwritten law of the district. He died 1st June 1826, and was
                    interred with great manifestations of honour and affection at the village of
                    Fouday. Since his death the Steinthal has suffered no interruption to its
                    prosperity. When he began his labours its inhabitants did not number more than
                    500; in the beginning of the century they had increased to about 3000; and now
                    they are supposed to number about 6000.</p>
