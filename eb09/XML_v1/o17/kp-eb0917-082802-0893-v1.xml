                    Bonaventure</hi></label> (1787-1853), the founder of modern toxicology, and one
                    of the most eminent of the French school of medicine during its brightest
                    period, was by birth a Spaniard, having been born at Mahon in Minorca on 24th
                    April 1787. An island merchant’s son looked naturally first to the sea for a
                    profession; but a voyage at the age of fifteen to Sardinia, Sicily, and Egypt
                    did not prove satisfactory. He next took to medicine, which he studied at the
                    universities of Valencia and Barcelona with so great applause that the local
                    authorities of the latter city granted him a pension to enable him to follow his
                    studies at Madrid and Paris, preparatory to appointing him professor. He had
                    scarcely settled for that purpose in Paris when the outbreak of the Spanish war,
                    in 1807, threatened destruction to his prospects. But he had the good fortune to
                    find a parent in a merchant uncle at Marseilles, and a patron in the good and
                    great Vauquelin the chemist, who braved the wrath of Napoleon against the
                    Spaniards, claimed him as his pupil, guaranteed his conduct, and saved him from
                    expulsion from Paris. Four years afterwards he graduated, and immediately became
                    a private lecturer on chemistry in the French capital. In 1819 he was appointed
                    professor of medical jurisprudence, and four years later he succeeded Vauquelin
                    as professor of chemistry in the faculty of medicine at Paris. In 1830 he was
                    nominated dean of that faculty, a high medical honour in France. Under the
                    Orleans dynasty, honours were lavishly showered upon him: he became successively
                    member of the council of education of France, member of the general council of
                    the department of the Seine, and commander of the Legion of Honour. The republic
                    of 1848 put an end to these adventitious distinctions; and chagrin at the
                    treatment he experienced at the hands of the Governments which succeeded that of
                    Louis Philippe is supposed to have shortened his life. He died, after a short
                    illness, in March 1853.</p>
                <p>Orfila’s chief publications are four in number :— <hi rend="italic">On General
                    Toxi</hi><hi rend="italic">cology</hi> (1814), <hi rend="italic">On Medical
                    Jurisprudence</hi> (1823), <hi rend="italic">A Treatise on Chemistry</hi>
                    (1817), and <hi rend="italic">Medico - legal Exhumations</hi> (1836); but he
                    also wrote many valuable papers, chiefly on subjects connected with medical
                    jurisprudence. His fame wül rest mainly on the first-named (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Traité de Toxicologie Générale'),</hi> published when he was only in his
                    twenty-seventh year. It is a vast mine of experimental observation on the
                    symptoms of poisoning of all kinds, on the appearances which poisons leave in
                    the dead body, on their physiological action, and on the means of detecting
                    them. Few branches of science, so important in their bearings on every-day life
                    and so difficult of investigation, can be said to have been created and raised
                    at once to a state of high advancement by the labours of a single man.</p>
