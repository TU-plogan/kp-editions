                <p><label type="entry">OREGON</label>, one of the Pacific States of the American
                    Union, is bounded N. by Washington Territory, E. by Idaho Territory, S. by
                    Nevada and California, and W. by the Pacific, and lies between 42° and 46° 15'
                    N. lat. and 116° 45' and 124° 30' W. long. It has an area of 94,560 square
                    miles, besides 1470 square miles of watersurface; its average width from east to
                    west is 345 miles, and from north to south 276 miles.</p>
                <p>The State is divided by the Coast, Cascade, and Blue Mountains into well-marked
                    sections. The Cascade range extends in an almost due north and south direction,
                    parallel with the Pacific coast, and a little over 100 miles from it, entirely
                    across the State, and thence northerly through Washington Territory into British
                    Columbia; still farther north it forms the undefined boundary between the latter
                    province and Alaska. In Oregon the range is heavily timbered, chiefly with
                    coniferous evergreens, the principal trees being yellow, sugar, and scrub pine,
                    yellow and white fir, several varieties of spruce, red and white cedar, yew,
                    juniper, tamarack, and cypress; there is also a considerable quantity of maple,
                    ash, and alder, and some oak in the western foot-hills to the south. Its most
                    striking feature is the number of beautiful cone-shaped peaks, rising above the
                    line of perpetual snow. Several quite low passes exist, which, however, are very
                    little used. Commencing at the southern boundary of Oregon, the first of these
                    peaks is Mount Pitt (9818 feet), flanked on all sides by outlying spurs and
                    foot-hill’ ranges. Forty miles to the north stands Mount Scott (9016 feet), the
                    eastern slope of which, covered with ashes and light débris, is comparatively
                    easy of ascent; on the west the bluffs are almost perpendicular walls of igneous
                    rock, sheltering great masses of snow. Mount Scott overlooks Mystic or Crater
                    Lake, an elliptically-shaped basin of water about 5 miles long by 3 miles broad,
                    entirely surrounded by unbroken cliff-walls ranging from 500 to 2000 feet; this
                    occupies the crater of a gigantic old volcano of which Mount Scott is a portion
                    of the eastern rim, all the rest having been carried away by erosion and other
                    causes. Forty miles farther north is Diamond Peak (8807 feet high), which also
                    gives evidence of being the south-eastern portion of an old crater rim. The
                    portion of the mountain-chain from Mount Scott to Diamond Peak was a region of
                    numerous volcanoes and of very extensive local lava-flows. It has a very high
                    average elevation, and in it all the principal rivers of western Oregon have
                    their sources: the Willamette, running to the north-west; the Des Chutes,
                    running to the north-east; the head-water streams of Klamath river, flowing to
                    the south, and breaking through the range to the west; the Rogue river, flowing
                    to the south-west; and the Umpqua to the west and north. The Three Sisters (in
                    reality five) are the next marked peaks (about 9000 feet); they seem to be
                    portions of an old crater rim, 12 miles in diameter, now broken and worn away
                    Mount Jefferson (about 10,200 feet) comes next, and then Mount Hood, the highest
                    of all (11,225 feet). To the north of this the Columbia breaks through the
                    range, having cut for itself a canon, 4000 feet in depth, through the overlying
                    lava and far into the previously-formed conglomerate on which it rests.</p>
                <p>Eastern Oregon is in its southern part a vast volcanic plateau, rocky and
                    sterile, lacking water, and possessing few natural attractions. The great
                    interior basin, without outlet to the ocean, extends far up into the State. In
                    this region are a few lakes, generally alkaline and marshy sinks, fed by little
                    streams which have their origin in the small neighbouring mountain masses. The
                    principal vegetation consists of several varieties of sage brush, dwarf pine,
                    and juniper, the last furnishing the winter food of immense numbers of deer,
                    which, during the summer, range through the highlands and glens of the Cascades.
                    Many small peaks and ranges rise from the plateau, all probably of volcanic
                    origin, and some of them made up almost exclusively of blocks and masses of
                    obsidian. From near its junction with the Boisée to the northern line of the
                    State the Snake river forms the eastern boundary of Oregon, and nowhere in the
                    world is there to be found a more perfect and impassable barrier than is formed
                    by this river and its tremendous canon, of which the walls (consisting of
                    basaltic and kindred rocks) are from 2000 to 5000 feet in height, and so steep
                    and precipitous that the most skilful mountaineer can scarcely find a place to
                    ascend or descend them. In several cases the columnar black basalt takes
                    wonderful shapes and produces most fantastic effects. The Snake in this part of
                    its course is not navigable, and can never be made so. The northern portion of
                    eastern Oregon is far superior in all its physical characteristics to the
                    southern. Confused masses, known as the Blue and Powder River Mountains, lie in
                    the north-east, modifying the climate for the better, and giving many rich
                    valleys and table-lands to the agriculturist. The Grande Ronde, Umatilla, John
                    Day, Burnt, and Powder rivers are the principal streams, and their main and
                    tributary valleys are very lovely. The mountains are covered with pine of a very
                    fair quality, with fir, cedar, and some maple, all of which is being rapidly
                    cleared away. In the valleys cottonwood, willow, birch, aspen, and poplar grow
                    freely. The hills are well stocked with the larger game, as bear, deer, mountain
                    sheep, grey wolves, panthers, foxes, &amp;c., the valleys and lakes with
                    feathered game in considerable variety, and the streams with trout and salmon.
                    Many mines of gold and silver have been found in the Blue and Powder River
                    Mountains, but none of remarkable richness. Nearly all the untimbered plains and
                    valleys of north-eastern Oregon are covered with a rich growth of the hardy and
                    nutritious “bunch grass.” The soil is very deep, and, coming, as it does, from
                    the disintegration of volcanic rocks, is very fertile. The Des Chutes river
                    drains most of the eastern slope of the Cascades, flowing in a wild turbulent
                    stream through a deeply-cut canon. The river is so swift, crooked, and with such
                    rugged banks and so many jagged rocks that it is deemed impracticable even for
                    the lumberman’s use in floating logs to the Columbia.</p>
                <p>The warm oceanic current from Japan, flowing south along the coast, is the cause
                    of the mild climate of western Oregon, and of the heavy and incessant rains with
                    which it is visited. These rains, continued through the centuries, have
                    chiselled away the mountains, and, with other geological agencies, produced the
                    three principal valleys into which this portion of the State may be considered
                    as divided,— the Willamette, Umpqua, and Rogue river valleys. The Willamette
                    valley has an area of about 8000 square miles, and contains more than half the
                    population and wealth of the entire State. Its lower portions are level loamy
                    plains, covered with rank grass, and here and there great areas of lowland
                    timber, such as alder, maple, ash, cottonwood, poplar, &lt;tc.. and a vast
                    profusion of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n888/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0888-0823"/> shrubbery. All about these lower plains are
                    well-marked terraces, composing the higher levels, and from these, east, west,
                    and south to the encircling mountains, are spread away the rolling fertile
                    uplands, gradually merging into the dense fir and pine forests which crown the
                    higher summits. Many things attest the former presence of an arm of the sea
                    extending from Puget Sound to the southern end of the valley. Many basaltic
                    ridges yet remain, but this rock has been largely washed away. Western Oregon is
                    well supplied with the ordinary building stones, as granite, syenite, and
                    sandstone. Marble and limestone are found in the extreme south-west, and a
                    valuable cement stone in the valley of the Umpqua. The Umpqua is a rapid
                    mountain stream, and its valley is narrow but extremely fertile. This and Rogue
                    river break through the Coast range in canons, deep, rugged, and heavily
                    timbered. The valley of Rogue river is beautiful, with a delightful climate, but
                    it has always been very difficult of access, and has only now been reached for
                    the first time from the north by the railroad. Much gold has been taken from the
                    placer mines of the valley, and the sands and gravels of nearly all the
                    tributary valleys carry the precious metal. The country lying between the Coast
                    range and the ocean is narrow and very rugged, with some small cultivable
                    valleys very difficult of access. There are no good harbours on the coast, but
                    the Government is making efforts to improve Coos and Yaquina bays and Port
                    Orford.</p>
                <p>The Columbia river enters the Pacific Ocean near the 46th degree of north
                    latitude; it drains by means of its tributaries the western slope of the Rocky
                    Mountains, from about the 42d to the 53d parallel, a distance of 900 miles. The
                    area of its drainage-basin is nearly 245,000 square miles. The route of
                    communication by the Columbia has been of the greatest importanoe in the early
                    development of Oregon, and its value increases daily. The head of navigation for
                    sea-going ships is at Portland, about 100 miles up the Columbia and 12 miles up
                    the Willamette. From this point up to the Cascades, river craft go freely with
                    plenty of water at all seasons of the year, with, generally, the exception of a
                    short time each winter when the river is frozen. The cascades of the Columbia
                    are due north from Mount Hood, just on the central line of the range where it is
                    cut through by the river. The obstruction to navigation here is complete; but
                    the Government has for several years been engaged in the construction of a canal
                    which will make navigation continuous 45 miles farther, up to the Dalles, at the
                    eastern base of the Cascades. Here there is another total obstruction, the river
                    flowing swiftly through intricate channels, which seem to have been originally
                    great cracks in a field of lava; surveys have been made, however, and plans
                    prepared for improvements. Above the Dalles the Columbia is navigable for 190
                    miles and the Snake for 180. The Northern Pacific Railroad passes down on the
                    Oregon side, through the canon of the Columbia. The Columbia is noted for its
                    beautiful scenery, for the great quantity of salmon taken from its waters, and
                    for the dreaded bar at its mouth. The dangers from this bar have been greatly
                    lessened of late years by improved pilotage and more accurate knowledge of the
                    phenomena; and further ameliorations by the general Government are in
                    contemplation.</p>
                <p>The south-west warm winds from the Pacific distribute vapours over western Oregon
                    abundantly in autumn, winter, and spring in dews, fogs, rains, and occasional
                    snows, and over eastern Oregon in less amounts. The north-west summer winds are
                    cool. The average temperature in western Oregon is—in spring 52°, in summer 67°,
                    in autumn 53°, and in winter 39° Fahr. The thermometer seldom rises above 90° in
                    the hottest days of the summer, and rarely falls below 20° in the winter. In the
                    thirteen years 1849-51 and 1858-68, two-thirds of the days were pleasant, and
                    only one-third were either showery or rainy or snowy in the north-west part of
                    the State. In the Willamette valley the average yearly rainfall is 44 to 54
                    inches, which is about the same as at Philadelphia and at Davenport (Iowa). In
                    the Umpqua and Rogue river valleys it is somewhat less. Thunder-storms seldom
                    occur in the State, and cyclones and tornadoes are unknown.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geology.—</hi> The geological history of the Cascade and Coast
                    ranges of Oregon is very interesting. For an immense period before these ranges
                    existed the primeval ocean washed the western shores of the great Rocky Mountain
                    chain, and throughout the Palaeozoic era and the whole Triassic and Jurassic
                    periods of the Mesozoic era numerous rivers kept bringing down débris until an
                    enormously thick mass of off-shore deposits had accumulated. This marginal
                    seabottom became the scene of intense aqueo-igneous action in its deeply-buried
                    strata, producing a line of weakness, which, yielding to the horizontal thrust
                    produced by the secular contraction of the interior of the earth, was crushed
                    together and swollen up into the Sierra Nevada and Cascade Mountains at the end
                    of the Jurassic period. The range thus produced, as far as can be ascertained,
                    was not of very great height, though probably higher to the south than to the
                    north. It existed for unknown centuries, and in its turn was the theatre of
                    ero¾on and plant-growth, and was roamed over by the now extinct fauna of the
                    Cretaceous and Tertiary periods. It was not yet covered by the great lava-flow
                    and mountain range of the modern Cascades, but by forests of conifers and oaks.
                    Beneath the overlying lava, where the Columbia breaks through the range, there
                    is found along the water’s edge, and for about 15 feet upwards, a very coarse
                    conglomerate of rounded porphyritic pebbles and boulders of all sizes up to 6
                    feet in diameter, held together by an imperfectly-lithified earthy paste. Above
                    this conglomerate is a very distinct irregular old ground-surface bed, in which
                    are found silicified stumps with roots extending over a diameter of 20 feet and
                    penetrating into the boulder material beneath, evidently <hi rend="italic">in
                    situ.</hi> Resting directly on this forest ground-surface, and therefore
                    enclosing the erect stumps, is a layer of stratified sandstone, 2 or 3 feet
                    thick, filled with beautiful and perfect impressions of leaves of several kinds
                    of forest trees, possibly of the very trees about whose silicified bases they
                    are found; this layer is not continuous, like the ground - surface on which it
                    rests. Above this leaf-bearing stratum rests a coarse conglomerate similar to
                    that beneath at the water-level. Scattered about in the lower part of this upper
                    conglomerate and in the stratified sandstone, and sometimes lying in the
                    dirt-bed beneath it, fragments of silicified drift-wood are found. Above this
                    last conglomerate, and resting upon it, rise the layers of lava, mostly columnar
                    basalt, one above another, to a height of more than 3000 feet. The following
                    order of events has been deduced from these facts by Professor Le Conte, their
                    first observer.</p>
                <p>The region of the Columbia river was a forest, probably a valley, overgrown by
                    conifers and oaks. The subsoil was a coarse boulder drift produced by erosion of
                    some older rocks. An excess of water came on, either by floods or changes of
                    level, and the trees were killed, their leaves shed and buried in mud, and their
                    trunks rotted to stumps. Then came on a tumultuous and rapid deposit of coarse
                    drift, containing drift-wood, which covered up the forest ground and the still
                    remaining stumps, to a depth of one, perhaps several, hundred feet. The surface
                    thus formed was eroded into hills and dales, and then followed the outburst of
                    lava in successive flows, and the silicification of the wood and cementation of
                    the drift by the percolation of the hot alkaline waters containing silica.
                    Finally followed the process of erosion by which the present stream, channels,
                    and valleys, whether main or tributary, have been cut to their enormous depths.
                    The great masses of sediment sent down to the sea by the erosion of the primary
                    Cascade range, formin" a thick off-shore deposit, gave rise in turn at the end
                    of the Miocene to the upheaval of the Coast range, the Cascade Mountains being
                    at the same time rent along the axis into enormous fissures, from which
                    outpoured the grand lava-floods, building the mountains higher, and covering the
                    country for great distances. This is probably the grandest lava-flow known to
                    geology, covering as it does an area of about 200,000 square miles. Commencing
                    in middle California as separate streams, in northern California it becomes a
                    flood, completely mantling the smaller and flowing around the greater
                    inequalities. In northern Oregon and Washington it becomes an absolutely
                    universal flood, beneath which the whole original face of the country, with its
                    hills and dales, mountains and valleys, lies buried several thousand feet. It
                    covers the greater portion of northern California and north-western Nevada,
                    nearly the whole of Oregon, Washington, and Idaho, and runs far into British
                    Columbia on. the north. The average thickness is <pb break="no"

                    (shown where the Columbia, Des Chutes, Snake, Salmon, and other rivers cut
                    through it) about 4000 feet. To produce this many successive flows took place,
                    and a very long period of time must have elapsed during which the volcanic
                    actions were going on. During the period of these Cascade eruptions the Coast
                    range was being slowly elevated, and became in its turn the scene of local
                    volcanic action, which was, however, not very severe. At last the great fissure
                    eruptions in the Cascades drew to a close by the fissures becoming blocked up;
                    the volcanic action was concentrated in a few localities, and the period of
                    crater-eruptions followed. These eruptions continued for a long time, almost to
                    our own day, and to them the upbuilding of the snow-clad peaks is due. By the
                    formation of the Cascade range there came into existence a grand interior basin,
                    the waters of which collected into secondary reservoirs, some of very large
                    extent, and were carried off by the rivers which have cut their way from the
                    interior to the sea. The Columbia and its tributaries drained the northern part
                    of this immense basin, and it was at this period, doubtless, that the Great Salt
                    Lake of Utah assumed its once colossal proportions and found its outlet to the
                    sea by the Snake and Columbia rivers. Then came the lava-floods, since denuded
                    in places, exposing the Tertiary and Cretaceous beds, and furnishing evidence of
                    the former condition of the region by the fossils found therein. At the end of
                    the Miocene the Coast range was upheaved, and the lava-flows from the Cascade
                    fissures commenced, but it was long before these reached the entire extent of
                    the basins of Oregon, which continued to exist and to be endowed with life well
                    into the Pliocene. The principal fossil beds of the State are those of the John
                    Day, Des Chutes, and Grande Ronde countries, and near Christmas Lake in southern
                    Oregon. The Glacial, Champlain, and Terrace epochs are very well illustrated in
                    several places, and have left marked evidences of their existence.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Fauna and Flora.—</hi> Since the occupation of the State by
                    civilized men the grizzly, black, and cinnamon bears, grey wolf, coyote,
                    panther, catamount, wild cat and polecat, deer, antelope, elk, and mountain
                    sheep have slowly retreated from the settlements to the recesses of the hills.
                    Fur-bearing animals have increased since the Hudson’s Bay Company withdrew from
                    the country. Silver foxes, martens, hares, rabbits, squirrels, raccoons,
                    porcupines, beaver, otter, musk-rats, and seals are found in greater or less
                    abundance within the State. Salmon, sturgeon, trout, holibut, smelt, and other
                    fish in countless numbers exist in the Columbia and its branches and in the bays
                    and coast rivers, and oysters, shrimps, crabs, and clams along the shores.
                    Eagles, hawks, cormorants, pelicans, gulls, cranes, albatross, vultures,
                    buzzards, ravens, crows, jays, robins, swallows, sparrows, rice-birds,
                    yellow-birds, hummingbirds, swans, geese, ducks, pigeons, and many other
                    varieties of birds are found. Reptiles and insects are numerous.</p>

                    >Agriculture, Manufactures, Commerce.—</hi> Wheat is the chief crop for home use
                    and for export. All the smaller cereals are grown and produce largely. Flax is
                    indigenous in southern and eastern Oregon; it is cultivated both for seed and
                    for lint. Maize gives a fair harvest, though the nights are too cool for the
                    best results. Vegetables of all kinds common to the temperate zone flourish, and
                    orchard and garden fruits are sure. One species of clover is indigenous, but all
                    varieties grow and spread rapidly over fields, pastures, and burnt forest
                    lands.</p>

                <p>Oregon has three ports of entry—Astoria on the Columbia, Portland on the
                    Willamette, and Coos Bay on the southern coast. The exports to foreign ports for
                    the twelve months ending 31st July 1882 were $9,970,410; exports to domestic
                    ports, $5,899,738; total exports, $15,870,148; wheat, $6,677,418; flour,
                    $2,853,792; salmon, $2,484,761; wool, $1,488,360; oats, $417,640; lumber,
                    $228,392. The salmon-canning business began in 1866 with a product of 4000
                    cases, valued at $64,000; the average annual value for the six years 1878-83
                    exceeded $2,000,000. Between Astoria and the cascades of the Columbia river
                    there are about forty canneries. Over 1500 boats are employed in the
                    fishery.</p>

                    Steamers ply twice a week between Portland and San Francisco (670 miles), and at
                    frequent intervals on the Columbia river for 725 miles, on the Willamette 138

                    were the models of the provisional government of Oregon, and legislation has
                    continued generally on these lines. The courts consist of a supreme court, with
                    appellate jurisdiction, situated in Salem, the capital, and five circuit or
                    district courts, with county courts and justices’ courts in every precinct of
                    city and county. Cities have police courts also. There is a United States
                    district court for Oregon, and a United States circuit court for Oregon with
                    California and Nevada. The State debt in 1880 λvas $511,376, and local, county,
                    city, and school debt was $377,126. The gross value of all property, as compiled

                    to the Union for the education of all its youth of both sexes. Congress also
                    granted about twenty-six townships (500,000 acres) for a State university, and
                    90,000 acres for an agricultural college. A portion of these lands has been
                    sold, and the proceeds have been made an irreducible fund for the objects named.
                    The free-school system has been established in every county and almost every
                    settlement. In Portland and other cities grades have been established from
                    “primary” to “high school.” The State university is established at Eugene City,
                    and an agricultural college at Corvallis. This public-school system is
                    supplemented by many corporate academies, seminaries, and colleges, and by
                    parochial and private schools representing different denominations. A school for
                    mutes and one for the blind have been established at Salem by the legislature.
                    Ten institutions report as endowments $290,132, yielding an annual income of
                    $16,050, and thirteen report $35,166 from tuition, and a total annual income of
                    $61,070. The number of children of school age (four to twenty years) is 65,216;
                    enrolled in public schools 37,748, in private schools 5101. Public school
                    expenses for the year ending 1st March 1882 amounted to $338,386; the public
                    schoolhouses numbered 1061, of the value of $684,298. The United States Indian
                    Industrial Training School at Forest Grove, which numbers 146 pupils, taken from
                    schools on the reservation, has become a marked success. Of 119,482 white
                    persons over ten years of age in 1880 only 3’6 per cent, were unable to

                    property was $654,000. The rank of the several denominations in respect to
                    numbers is approximately as follows: Methodists, Baptists, Roman Catholics,
                    Presbyterians, Episcopalians, Congregationalists, and five minor sects. The

                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> Oregon at first included all the United States
                    territory between the Pacific Ocean and the Rocky Mountains north of the 42d
                    parallel, and thus had a total area of over 300,000 square miles. The Greek
                    pilot De Fuca, in the service of Spain, in 1592, Admiral Fonte in 1640, and
                    others had visited and mapped the coast as far as the 55th parallel. In 1792
                    Captain Robert Gray of Boston, in the ship “Columbia,” discovered and ascended
                    the river as far as Gray’s Bay, and named the river after his vessel. Oregon was
                    afterwards held by the United States Government to have been included in the
                    sale of “Louisiana” by France in 1803. In 1804-5 Lewis and Clark explored the
                    Columbia to its mouth and reported the great resources of the country. In 1810
                    Captain Winship, a New Englander, built the first house in Oregon, on the
                    Columbia; and in 1811 John Jacob Astor of New York established a fur-trading
                    post 15 miles from the ocean at Astoria on that river. In 1813, during the war,
                    his agent sold it to the North-Western Fur Company, who called it Fort George.
                    Though restored to the United States after the war, it was held by the company,
                    and in 1821 it passed, with their other possessions, into the hands of the
                    Hudson’s Bay Company. The British laid claim to Oregon by virtue of Drake’s
                    discovery of the coast in 48° N. lat. in 1558, of Cook’s visit to De Fuca Strait
                    in search of a north-west passage in 1778, and of the survey of the coast from
                    30° to 60° N. lat., by order of the British Admiralty, made by Vancouver (who
                    was with Cook in 1778), to find a north-west passage, and his discovery and
                    ascent of the Columbia to the site of the present city of Vancouver in 1792. A
                    treaty of “joint occupation” was made in 1818 between the United States and
                    Great Britain which left these conflicting claims for future settlement and only
                    served to prolong and increase the disagreement The British finally offered to
                    compromise on the Columbia. In 1824 some employees of the Hudson’s Bay Company
                    set out a few fruit trees and cultivated a garden at Fort George (Astoria). In
                    1832 Captain Nathaniel Wyeth of Wenham, Massachusetts, established a fishery
                    onSauvie’s Island. In 1834 the Revs. Jason and Daniel Lee and others came to
                    Oregon on Captain Wyeth’s second trip, to establish a mission of the Methodist
                    Episcopal Church, east of the Cascade Mountains, but they were persuaded by the
                    superintendent of the Hudson’s Bay Company to settle in the Willamette valley.
                    They soon collected some dozens of Indian children near the present site of
                    Salem, and established the “Oregon Manual Labour School.” Others came, until, in
                    1840, their mission families numbered fifty-two adults and twenty children.
                    Their mission closed in 1847, and the families became settlers. In 1835 Rev.
                    Samuel Parker and Dr Marcus Whitman were commissioned to explore and plant a
                    mission in Oregon. Under convoy of the yearly expedition of the American Fur
                    Company, Dr and Mrs Whitman, Rev. H. H. Spalding and Mrs Spalding, and Mr W. H.
                    Gray “crossed the plains” in 1836, travelling 2300 miles from the Missouri line,
                    and began a mission among the Indians of eastern Oregon. These two ladies were
                    the first white women who crossed the Rocky Mountains. The missionaries formed
                    the nuclei of settlements’; trappers, adventurers, and western pioneers
                    followed; cattle were secured from California, and in 1842 steps were taken for
                    a government, by a choice of officers. The λvhites numbered only about 240.
                    Western pioneers having been told that waggons could not be taken to the
                    Columbia, and induced to exchange them at Fort Hall for horses, Dr Whitman, to
                    remove the bar thus put up against immigration, recrossed the plains in the
                    winter of 1842-43. He published his plan to help emigrants through to Oregon
                    with their families and waggons, hastened to Washington to arouse Government
                    officials to retain their hold of Oregon and care for it, and then returned,
                    overtaking nearly 1000 emigrants at the North Platte river. A provisional
                    government was organized that year by the people. More immigrants followed. In
                    1846 a treaty was concluded between Great Britain and the United States fixing
                    the boundary at 49° N. lat. In 1848 Congress established a Territorial
                    government, and the governor, General Joseph Lane, arrived in March 1849. United
                    States courts were then established. On 28th November 1847, Dr and Mrs Whitman,
                    along with twelve others, were murdered by the Indians. War followed, and again
                    broke out in 1855. Other wars against the Indians occurred in 1877 and 1878, but
                    the tribes have mostly been placed upon reservations, under educational and
                    industrial training. They have become peaceable and partially self-supporting,
                    though paid in annuities for their lands. The Territory was admitted into the
                    Union as a State on 14th February 1859. (T. W. S.—G. H. A.)</p>
