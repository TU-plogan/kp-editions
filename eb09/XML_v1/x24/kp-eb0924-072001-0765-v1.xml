                    may fairly assume not over thirty years of age.</p></note> He was a citizen of
                    good position, belonging to the order of the knights. Early in life he came
                    under the influence of Socrates. In 401 B.c., being invited by his friend
                    Proxenus to join the expedition of the younger Cyrus against his brother,
                    Artaxerxes II. of Persia, he jumped at the offer, for he was a needy man, and
                    his prospects at home may not have been very good, as the knights were at this
                    time out of favour from having supported the Thirty Tyrants. At the suggestion
                    of Socrates Xenophon went to Delphi to consult the oracle; but his mind was
                    already made up, and he at once crossed to Asia, to Sardis, the place of
                    rendezvous. He joined neither as officer nor as soldier: he went simply to see
                    new countries and peoples out of a spirit of curiosity and love of excitement.
                    Of the expedition itself he has given a full and detailed account in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Anabasis,</hi> or the “Up-Country March.” (See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Persia,</hi> vol. xviii. p. 577.) After the battle of Cunaxa
                    the officers in command of the Greeks were treacherously murdered by the Persian
                    satrap Tissaphernes, with whom they were negotiating an armistice with a view to
                    a safe return. The army was now in the heart of an unknown country, more than a
                    thousand miles from home and in the presence of a troublesome enemy. It was
                    decided to march northwards up the Tigris valley and make for the shores of the
                    Euxine, on which there were several Greek colonies. Xenophon became the leading
                    spirit of the army; he was elected an officer, and he it •was who mainly
                    directed the retreat. To his skill, good temper, and firmness the Greeks seem to
                    have largely owed their safety. He seems indeed to have been an Athenian of the
                    best type, having tact and sympathy, with a singular readiness of resource and a
                    straightforward businesslike eloquence which could both persuade and convince.
                    All through the perils and hardships of the retreat he shared the men’s
                    privations. Part of the way lay through the wilds of Kurdistan, where they had
                    to encounter the harassing guerilla attacks of savage mountain tribes, and part
                    through the highlands of Armenia and Georgia. After a five months’ march they
                    reached Trapezus (Trebizond) on the Black Sea (February 400 B.C.), having given
                    splendid proof of what Greek discipline and spirit could accomplish. When they
                    reached the Euxine a tendency to demoralization began to show itself, and even
                    Xenophon almost lost his control over the soldiery. At Cotyora he aspired to
                    found a new colony; but the idea, not being unanimously accepted, was abandoned,
                    and ultimately Xenophon with his Greeks arrived at Chrysopolis (Scutari) on the
                    Bosphorus, opposite Byzantium. After a brief period of service under a Thracian
                    chief, Seuthes, they were finally incorporated in a Lacedaemonian army which had
                    crossed over into Asia to wage war against the Persian satraps Tissaphernes and
                    Pharnabazus, Xenophon going with them. Near Pergamum he captured a wealthy
                    Persian nobleman with his family, and the ransom paid for his recovery seems to
                    have been sufficient to provide Xenophon with a fair competency.</p>
                <p>On his return to Greece Xenophon served under Agesilaus, king of Sparta, which
                    state was at this time at the head of the Greek world. With his native Athens
                    and its general policy and institutions he was not in sympathy. At Coronea he
                    fought with the Spartans against the Athenians and Thebans, for which his
                    fellow-citizens decreed his banishment. The exile found a home at Scillus in
                    Elis, about two miles from Olympia; there he settled down to indulge his tastes
                    for sport and for literature. It was probably at Scillus that he wrote most of
                    his books; there too he built and endowed a temple to Artemis, modelled on the
                    great temple at Ephesus. After Sparta’s great defeat at Leuctra in 371 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> which fatally shattered <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0766-0721"/> its ascendency, Xenophon was driven from his home
                    by the people of Elis. Meantime Sparta and Athens had become allies, and the
                    Athenians repealed the decree which had condemned Xenophon to exile. There is,
                    however, no evidence that he ever returned to his native city. According to the
                    not very trustworthy authority of his biographer (Diogenes Laertius), he made
                    his home at Corinth. He was still living in 357 B.C.;<note anchored="true"

                    B. C.</p></note> but how much longer he lived we have no means of knowing.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Anabasis</hi> is a work of singular interest, and is
                    brightly and pleasantly written. Xenophon, like Caesar, tells the story in the
                    third person, and there is a straightforward manliness about the style, with a
                    distinct flavour of a cheerful lightheartedness, which at once enlists our
                    sympathies. His description of places and of relative distances is very minute
                    and painstaking. The researches of modern travellers attest his general
                    accuracy.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Major
                    Milligan, in his <hi rend="italic">Wild Life among the Koords,</hi> says, "My
                    researches have put beyond doubt the accuracy of his statements, and are of a
                    nature to show the historical, geographical, and ethnological importance which
                    is to be attached to the accounts handed down to posterity by that illustrious
                    writer.”</p></note></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Cyropaedia,</hi> which describes the boyhood and training
                    of Cyrus, hardly answers to its name, being for the most part an account of the
                    beginnings of the Persian empire and of the victorious career of Cyrus its
                    founder. But Xenophon had little or nothing to build on except the floating
                    stories and traditions of the East that had gathered round the figure of the
                    great Persian hero-king. The <hi rend="italic">Cyropaedia</hi> contains in fact
                    the author’s own ideas of training and education, as derived conjointly from the
                    teachings of Socrates and his favourite Spartan institutions. A distinct moral
                    purpose, to which literal truth is sacrificed, runs through the work.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Hellenica,</hi> though by no means a first-class historical
                    work, fills a gap by giving the events of the fifty years from 411 to 362 B.c.
                    Thus it includes the downfall of the Athenian empire, the supremacy of Sparta,
                    and the sudden collapse of that power after Leuctra in 371 B.c. It takes up
                    Greek history at the point at which Thucydides’s great work abruptly ends. His
                    credit as an historian has been specially impugned, and it has been suggested
                    that he was much more influenced by his political likes and dislikes than by a
                    love of truth. However that may be, there are certainly serious omissions and
                    defects in the work, which greatly detract from its value. At the time he
                    probably wrote it he was no doubt a strong political partisan and a thorough
                    believer in Sparta. But subsequently a change came over him; and, when he
                    described the terrible reverse at Leuctra, he seems to have felt that Sparta’s
                    prestige had been deservedly destroyed, and that its downfall was heaven’s
                    vengeance on an ungracious and treacherous policy. He always clings to a belief
                    in a divine overrating providence, though in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hellenica</hi> there are unmistakable traces of a pettiness of mind and
                    narrowness of view very far below the dignity of an historian.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Memorabilia,</hi> or “Recollections of Socrates,” is the
                    tribute of an affectionate and admiring disciple who felt that the nobleness of
                    his master’s aims and life was his best defence. The work is not a literary
                    masterpiece: it lacks coherence and unity, and the picture it gives of Socrates
                    fails to do him justice. Still it is an honest piece of work and a labour of
                    love, and, as far as it goes, we may well believe it faithfully describes the
                    philosopher’s manner of life and style of conversation. It was the moral and
                    practical side of Socrates’s teaching which most interested Xenophon; into his
                    abstruse metaphysical speculations he seems to have made no attempt to enter;
                    for these indeed he had neither taste nor genius. It was the philosophy which
                    aims at “a sound mind in a sound body” which specially suited the robust and
                    healthy mind of Xenophon. Moving within a limited range of ideas, he doubtless
                    gives us "considerably less than the real Socrates, while Plato gives us
                    something more.”</p>
                <p>Xenophon has left several minor works, some of which are very interesting and
                    give us an insight into the home-life of the Greeks.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">(Economics,</hi> which deals with the management of the
                    house and of the farm, presents a pleasant and amusing picture of the Greek wife
                    and of her home duties. She was to be thoroughly domestic, devoted to her
                    household work, without any intellectual aspiration; she must keep up her good
                    looks by healthy exercise, not by rouging or painting. There are some good
                    practical remarks on matrimony and on the respective duties of husband and wife;
                    in these it is assumed that providence has endowed each sex with capacities
                    peculiar to itself and that the highest happiness is to be found in union and in
                    well-organized cooperation. The true sphere of woman is in the faithful and
                    diligent discharge of her home duties; this, above all things, will win her
                    husband’s respect and esteem.</p>
                <p>In the essays on horsemanship ('Ι <hi rend="italic">ππική)</hi> and hunting <hi
                    rend="italic">(Cynegeticus),</hi> Xenophon deals with matters with which he had
                    a thorough practical acquaintance. In the former he gives rules how to choose a
                    horse, and then tells how it is to be groomed and ridden and generally managed.
                    All this has still great interest for the modern reader. We gather from this
                    little work that the ancient Greeks never used the stirrup, nor had they any
                    idea of providing their horses with iron shoes. The book on hunting deals
                    chiefly with the hare, though the author speaks also of boar-hunting and
                    describes the hounds, tells how they are to be bred and trained, and gives
                    specimens of suitable names for them. On all this he writes with the zest of an
                    enthusiastic sportsman, and he observes that those nations will be most likely
                    to be successful in war of which the upper classes have a taste for
                    field-sports.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Hipparchicus</hi> explains the duties of a cavalry officer;
                    it is not, according to our ideas, a very scientific treatise, showing that the
                    art of war was but very imperfectly developed and that the military operations
                    of the Greeks were on a somewhat petty scale. He dwells at some length on the
                    moral qualities which go to the making of a good cavalry officer, and hints very
                    plainly that there must be strict attention to religious duties.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Agesilaus</hi> is a eulogy of the Spartan king, who had two
                    special merits in Xenophon’s eyes: he was a rigid disciplinarian and he was
                    particularly attentive to all religious observances. We have a summary of his
                    virtues rather than a good and striking picture of the man himself.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Hiero</hi> works out the line of thought indicated in the
                    story of the Sword of Damocles. It is a protest against the notion that the
                    “tyrant” is a man to be envied, as having more abundant means of happiness than
                    a private person. This is one of the most pleasing of his minor works; it is
                    cast into the form of a dialogue between Hiero, tyrant of Syracuse, and the
                    lyric poet Simonides.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Symposium,</hi> or “Banquet,” is a brilliant little
                    dialogue in which Socrates is the prominent figure. He is represented as
                    “improving the occasion,” which is that of a lively Athenian supper-party, at
                    which there is much drinking, with flute-playing, and a dancing girl from
                    Syracuse, who amuses the guests with the feats of a professional conjuror.
                    Socrates’s table-talk runs through a variety of topics, and winds up with a
                    philosophical disquisition on the superiority of true heavenly love to its
                    earthly or sensual counterfeit, and with an earnest exhortation to one of the
                    party, who had just won a victory in the public games, to lead a noble life and
                    do his duty to his country.</p>
                <p>There are also two short essays on the political constitution of Sparta and
                    Athens, written with a decided bias in favour of the former, which he praises
                    without attempting to criticize. Sparta seems to have presented to Xenophon the
                    best conceivable mixture of monarchy and aristocracy.</p>
                <p>In the essay on the <hi rend="italic">Revenues of Athens,</hi> he offers
                    suggestions for making Athens less dependent on tribute received from its
                    allies: first, more foreign settlers should be attracted to the city by holding
                    out strong commercial inducements and from these a moderate capitation tax
                    should be collected; secondly, more should be made of the silver mines of
                    Laurium by leasing them out to private capitalists, who might work them by
                    slaves purchased with public money and hired at a fixed rate by the lessees. But
                    above all, he would have Athens use its influence for the maintenance of peace
                    in the Greek world and for the settlement of questions by diplomacy, the temple
                    at Delphi being for this purpose an independent centre and supplying a divine
                    sanction.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Apology,</hi> Socrates’s defence before his judges, is
                    rather a feeble production, and in the general opinion of modern critics not a
                    genuine work of Xenophon.</p>
                <p>The editions both of Xenophon’s entire and of his separate works, especially of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Anabasis</hi>, are very numerous. A few of the best are
                    enumerated below :— (1) <hi rend="italic">Anabasis,</hi> text of L. Dindorf,
                    with notes by J. S. Watson, 1868; (2) <hi rend="italic">Memorabilia,</hi>
                    edited, with short notes, by J. R. King, 1874 (Oxford); (3) <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hellenics,</hi> text of C. G. Cobet, 1862; (4) <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cyropaedia,</hi> from the text of L. Dindorf, with notes by E. H. Barker, 1831.
                    The minor works have been repeatedly edited. Useful editions of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Hiero</hi> (London, 1883) and <hi rend="italic">(Economics</hi>
                    (London, 1884) have been issued by H. A. Holden. There is an English translation
                    of the entire works by various hands, published in 1831; also a French
                    translation, similarly executed, in 1845. To Sir A. Grant’s monograph on
                    Xenophon, in Blackwood’s “Ancient Classics for English Readers,” the present
                    writer is considerably indebted. (W. J. B.)</p>
