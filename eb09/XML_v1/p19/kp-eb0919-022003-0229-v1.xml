                <p><label type="entry">PLESIOSAURIANS</label>. The remarkable extinct marine
                    reptiles included in the group of the <hi rend="italic">Plesiosauria</hi> (or
                    <hi rend="italic">Sauropterygia,</hi> as they are sometimes called) existed
                    during the whole of the Mesozoic period, that is, from Triassic into Cretaceous
                    times, when they appear to have died out. The best known of these reptiles, and
                    that which gives its name to the group is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Plesiosaurus,</hi> a genus established by Conybeare in 1821, and including
                    numerous species, some of which may have attained a length of as much as 20
                    feet. The nearly allied <hi rend="italic">Elasmosaurus</hi> of North America,
                    however, reached a much greater size, its remains indicating an animal about 45
                    feet in length. Several almost perfect skeletons of <hi rend="italic"

                    proportions of the body are well known. Although the different species vary in
                    regard to proportions, the small size of the head and extreme length of the neck
                    are always striking points in the skeleton of a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Plesiosaurus,</hi> while the tail is proportionately short. The limbs, both
                    fore and hind, are well developed and modified for swimming, the forms of the
                    various bones making it clear that the digits of each limb were not separate,
                    but enclosed in one covering of integument, as in the flippers of a whale or a
                    turtle. The exterior of the body, there is every reason to believe, was smooth
                    as it is in <hi rend="italic">Cetacea,</hi> and not provided with either bony or
                    horny scutes or scales as in the living crocodiles and turtles. The internal
                    skeleton therefore is the only part available for study.</p>
                <p>The skull of <hi rend="italic">Plesiosaurus</hi> has a tapering and depressed
                    snout, and in consequence of the large size of the premaxillary bones the nasal
                    apertures are placed far back, just in front of the orbit, as in birds. There is
                    a distinct parietal foramen, as in lizards. The orbit is completely surrounded
                    by bone, and there are supra-and infratemporal fossae. The single occipital
                    condyle is formed almost entirely by the basi-occipital bone. The basisphenoid
                    is well developed, and is produced into a long rostrum. On the base of the skull
                    four fossae are to be seen; the front pair of these are bounded behind by the
                    palatine bones, and are regarded as the true posterior nares. The teeth are
                    slender, sharp, curved, and striated; they have single fangs, and are placed
                    loosely in separate alveolar sockets.</p>
                <p>The spinal column is composed of a large number of vertebrae, some species having
                    ninety or more in the entire series. The centrum of each vertebra has the fore
                    and hind surfaces slightly concave; the neural arch is connected with the
                    centrum by a suture, which seems never to have been entirely obliterated. The
                    cervical vertebrae vary in number from twenty-four to upwards of forty in
                    different species. Each is provided with a pair of ribs, closely resembling
                    those found in the cervical region in the crocodile, but with a single articular
                    head only. Towards the hinder part of the neck the ribs become more elongated,
                    and take on the form of dorsal ribs; but, as none of the ribs join the sternum,
                    the usual means of distinguishing the dorsal and cervical regions is wanting.
                    There may be from twenty to thirty dorsal vertebrae. True sternal ribs have
                    never been detected; but abdominal bones, or ribs, are well developed. The
                    sacrum consists of two vertebrae, with stout broad ribs for attachment to the
                    iliac bones. The caudal vertebrae, between thirty and forty in number, have
                    distinct chevron bones, which are attached between the successive vertebrae. The
                    pectoral arch (fig. 2) consists of a large coracoid on each side, in front and
                    outside of which is a peculiarly shaped scapula with a plate extending dorsally
                    from the glenoid cavity, and a second process directed inwards and downwards.
                    The latter process is now regarded as the precoracoid by Mr J. W. Hulke, who
                    also considers the plate of bone—originally of two pieces—found in the middle
                    and in front of the coracoids to be the homologue of the omosternum of <hi
                    rend="italic">Batrachia.</hi> If this interpretation be correct, <hi
                    rend="italic">Plesiosaurus</hi> has neither clavicles nor interclavicles. In the
                    fore limb all the characteristic bones are present. The humerus is an elongated
                    bone with the anterior border nearly straight and the hinder border concave; it
                    is rounded at the upper end, and flattened below, where it is articulated to two
                    much shorter bones, the radius and ulna. Next to these is a row of three carpal
                    bones—the radiale (scaphoid), the ulnare (cuneiform), and the intermedium
                    (lunar); a second row of four bones succeeds these, three of which are carpals,
                    but the outer one may be a metacarpal; next comes a row of five metacarpals. The
                    digits are five in number, and with the exception of the first are made up of
                    numerous separate ossicles, or phalanges.</p>
                <p>The pelvic arch (fig. 3) is large, and ventrally consists of a pair of flattened
                    more or less quadrate pubes, and a pair of somewhat triangular ischia. The iliac
                    bones are elongated, narrower where they form part of the acetabular
                    articulation and becoming broader above where they join the sacral ribs. The
                    hind limb very closely resembles the fore limb. The front and back margins of
                    the femur are straighter than they are in the humerus; but the other parts
                    almost exactly repeat the corresponding bones of the fore limb.</p>
                <p>With regard to the probable habits of the <hi rend="italic">Plesiosaurus</hi> we
                    are not without some indications. The paddle-like form of the limbs leaves no
                    doubt as to its aquatic mode of life, and judging from the fossils with which it
                    is usually associated it must have been an inhabitant of the sea; it is highly
                    probable, however, that some species at least ascended rivers, for remains of
                    <hi rend="italic">Plesiosauria</hi> are found in the Wealden freshwater
                    deposits. The comparatively small tail and large paddles render it probable that
                    the limbs were the chief means of propulsion. The long neck would tend to impede
                    its progress through the water, and it would be better adapted, therefore, for
                    swimming on or near the surface. It is unlikely that the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Plesiosaurus</hi> could move as rapidly through the water as the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ichthyosaurus</hi>; but this slower movement would be compensated
                    for by the rapidity with which its long and flexible neck could be darted at its
                    prey. Seeing that the marine turtles and seals of the present day make their way
                    on shore, it is quite possible that the <hi rend="italic">Plesiosaurus</hi> may
                    also have occasionally visited the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n231/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0231-0222"/> land. The sharp and slender teeth would be
                    admirably adapted for catching and holding a slippery prey, and there is no
                    doubt that fishes formed in part, if not altogether, its natural food. Indeed
                    the scales and teeth of fishes have been found, in one case at least, just below
                    the vertebrae, in the region which must have been occupied by the creature’s
                    stomach.</p>
                <p>It is of interest to note the differences which exist between the <hi
                    rend="italic">Plesiosaurus</hi> and the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Ichthyosaurus</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.υ.</hi>), the latter being the type of
                    another group, the <hi rend="italic">Ichthyosauria,</hi> which is by some
                    palaeontologists included with the <hi rend="italic">Plesiosauria</hi> in a
                    larger group called <hi rend="italic">Enalio-sauria.</hi> In outward form the
                    <hi rend="italic">Ichthyosaurus</hi> must have resembled some of the recent <hi
                    rend="italic">Cetacea,</hi> inasmuch as the head is proportionately large, and
                    without any appearance of a neck joins directly on to the trunk. The hind limbs
                    are smaller than the front ones, and the bones of both limbs are much more
                    shortened and flattened than in <hi rend="italic">Plesiosaurus</hi>; in addition
                    to this there are supernumerary rows of bones, besides the five typical digital
                    series. The pectoral arch differs in having distinct clavicles and
                    interclavicles. The vertebrae are short from back to front, deeply biconcave,
                    and their neural arches never have a bony connexion with the centra. There is no
                    sacrum. The teeth are placed in a groove, and not in separate sockets. The
                    eye-ball was protected by a series of bony sclerotic plates, which are not found
                    in <hi rend="italic">Plesiosaurus.</hi></p>
                <p>The group <hi rend="italic">Plesiosauria</hi> includes several other genera
                    besides the <hi rend="italic">Plesiosaurus</hi>; but most of these are only
                    represented by such imperfect specimens that the distinctions between them, as
                    at present known, are far from satisfactory. The characters which have been
                    relied upon for their separation are to be found chiefly in the structure of the
                    pectoral arch, limbs, and vertebrae. <hi rend="italic">Plesiosaurus</hi> is only
                    certainly known to have existed from the time of the Lower Lias to the Chalk;
                    and it is especially characteristic of the Lias. More than fifty species,
                    sometimes placed in several subgenera, have been described from different
                    localities in Britain, some of which are represented by remarkably perfect
                    specimens, and others by fragments only. This genus has a wide geographical
                    distribution, species having been named from Secondary strata, on the continent
                    of Europe, in India, Australia, South America, and North America. The closely
                    allied and gigantic form <hi rend="italic">Pliosaurus</hi> is chiefly
                    characteristic of the English Oolites.</p>
                <p>In European Triassic beds, <hi rend="italic">Plesiosauria</hi> are represented by
                    such genera as <hi rend="italic">Nothosaurus, Simosaurus,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Pistosaurus,</hi> in all of which the neural arches seem to have
                    been less closely united to the vertebral centra than in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Plesiosaurus. Neusticosaurus</hi> is another Triassic form, remarkable, not
                    only on account of its small size, being less than 12 inches in length, but also
                    because its limbs seem to show a transitional condition; for, while the
                    structure of the hind limb resembles that of a land reptile, the fore limb seems
                    to have had more the structure of a paddle.</p>
                <p>A number of forms closely related to the <hi rend="italic">Plesiosaurus</hi> have
                    been described from rocks of Cretaceous age in North America under the following
                    generic names — <hi rend="italic">Cimoliasaurus, Elasmosaurus, Oligo-simus,
                    Piratosaurus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Polycotylus.</hi> Of these the <hi
                    rend="italic">Elasmosaurus</hi> is better known than any of the others. It was
                    an extremely elongated form, as may be gathered from the fact that the
                    snake-like neck alone consisted of more than sixty vertebrae,—the entire body,
                    as we have noticed above, being more than 45 feet in length.</p>
