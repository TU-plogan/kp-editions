                <p><label type="entry">PRESTER JOHN</label>. The history of Prester John is that of
                    a phantom, taking many forms. It no doubt originally was based on some nucleus
                    of fact, or connected itself with some such nucleus, though what that nucleus
                    was has been much controverted and is extremely difficult to determine. But the
                    name and the figure which it suggested occupied so prominent a place in the mind
                    of Europe for two or three centuries that a real history could hardly have a
                    stronger claim to exposition here than this history of a will-o’-the-wisp.</p>
                <p>Before Prester John, <hi rend="italic">eo nomine,</hi> appears upon the scene we
                    find the way prepared for his appearance by the presentation of a kindred fable,
                    and one which certainly entwined itself with the legends about Prester John
                    after his figure had lodged itself in the popular imagination of Europe. This is
                    the story of the appearance at Rome (1122), in the pontificate of Calixtus II.,
                    of a certain Oriental ecclesiastic, whom one account styles “John, the patriarch
                    of the Indians,” and another “an archbishop of India.” This ecclesiastic related
                    the most wonderful stories of the shrine of St Thomas in India, and of the
                    posthumous and still recurring miracles which were wrought there periodically by
                    the body of the apostle, including the distribution of the sacramental wafer by
                    his hand, and many other marvellous things. We cannot regard the appearance at
                    Rome of the personage who related these marvels in presence of the pope as a
                    mere popular fiction: it rests on two authorities apparently independent (one of
                    them a letter from Odo of Rheims, abbot of St Remy from 1118 to 1151), for their
                    discrepancies show that one was not copied from the other, though in the
                    principal facts they agree.</p>
                <p>Nearly a quarter of a century later Prester John appears upon the scene, in the
                    outline, at least, of the character which long adhered to him, viz., that of a
                    Christian conqueror and potentate of enormous power and splendour, who combined
                    the characters of priest and king, and ruled over vast dominions in the far
                    East. This idea was universal in Europe from about the middle of the 12th
                    century to the end of the 13th or beginning of the 14th. The Asiatic story then
                    gradually died away, but the name remained as firmly rooted as ever, and the
                    royal presbyter was now assigned a locus in Ethiopia. Indeed, as we shall see,
                    it is not an improbable hypothesis that from a very early date in the history of
                    this phantom its title was assigned to the Abyssinian king, though for a time
                    this identification was overshadowed by the prevalence of the Asiatic legend. At
                    the bottom of the double allocation there was, no doubt, that association or
                    confusion of Ethiopia with India which is as old as Virgil, and perhaps much
                    older.</p>
                <p>The first mention of Prester John occurs in the chronicle of Otho or Otto, bishop
                    of Freisingen. This writer states that when at the papal court in 1145 he met
                    with the bishop of Gabala (Jibal in Syria), who related how “not many years
                    before one John, king and priest <hi rend="italic">(rex</hi><hi rend="italic">et
                    sacerdos),</hi> who dwelt in the extreme Orient beyond Persia and Armenia, and
                    was, with his people, a Christian but a Nestorian, had made war against the
                    brother kings of the Persians and Medes, who were called Samiards (or Saηjards),
                    and captured Egbatana their capital. The battle with those princes endured three
                    days, but at last <hi rend="italic">Presbyter John—</hi> for so he was wont to
                    be styled—routed the Per sians with immense slaughter. After this victory the
                    aforesaid John was advancing to fight in aid of the church <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n738/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0738-0715"/> at Jerusalem; but, when he arrived at the Tigris,
                    and found no possible means of transport for his army, he turned northward, as
                    he had heard that the river in that quarter was frozen over in winter-time.
                    After halting on its banks for some years <hi rend="italic">(per aliquot</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">annos)</hi> in expectation of a frost he was obliged to return to
                    his own land. This personage was said to be of the ancient race of the Magi
                    mentioned in the gospel, to rule the same nations that they ruled, and to have
                    such a plenitude of wealth and glory that he used none but a sceptre of solid
                    emerald. It was as fired by the example of his ancestors (they said) that he was
                    proposing to go to Jerusalem when thus obstructed.” We cannot say how far the
                    report of the bishop of Gabala, or other rumours of the events on which this was
                    founded, made an impression on Europe at that time. But there can be no doubt
                    about the impression that was made some twenty years later (c. 1165) by the wide
                    circulation of a letter which purported to have been addressed by the potentate
                    in question to the Greek emperor Manuel. This letter, professing to come from
                    “Presbyter Joannes, by the power and virtue of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ,
                    Lord of Lords,” is filled with the most extravagant details of the greatness and
                    splendour of the writer. He claims to be the greatest monarch under heaven, as
                    well as a devout Christian and protector of Christians. And it was his desire to
                    visit the Holy Sepulchre with a great host, and to subdue the enemies of the
                    Cross. Seventy-two kings, reigning over as many kingdoms, were his tributaries.
                    His empire extended over the three Indies, including that Further India where
                    lay the body of St Thomas, to the sun-rising, and back again down the slope to
                    the ruins of Babylon and the tower of Babel. All the wild beasts and monstrous
                    creatures commemorated in current legend were to be found in his dominions, as
                    well as all the wild and eccentric races of men of whom strange stories were
                    told, including those unclean nations whom Alexander Magnus walled up among the
                    mountains of the north, and who were to come forth at the latter day,—and so
                    were the Amazons and the Bragmans. His dominions contained the monstrous ants
                    that dug gold and the fish that gave the purple; they produced all manner of
                    precious stones and all the famous aromatics. Within them was found the Fountain
                    of Youth; the pebbles which give light, restore sight, and render the possessor
                    invisible; the Sea of Sand was there, stored with fish of wondrous savour; and
                    the River of Stones was there also; besides a subterranean stream whose sands
                    were of gems. His territory produced the worm called “salamander,” which lived
                    in fire, and which wrought itself an incombustible envelope from which were
                    manufactured robes for the presbyter, which were washed in flaming fire. When
                    the king went forth to war thirteen great crosses made of gold and jewels were
                    carried in waggons before him as his standards, and each was followed by 10,000
                    knights and 100,000 footmen. There were no poor in his dominions, no thief or
                    robber, no flatterer or miser, no dissensions, no lies, and no vices. His palace
                    was built after the plan of that which St Thomas erected for the Indian king
                    Gondopharus. Of the splendour of this details are given. Before it was a
                    marvellous mirror erected on a many-storied pedestal (described in detail); in
                    this speculum he could discern everything that went on throughout his dominions,
                    and detect conspiracies. He was waited on by seven kings at a time, by sixty
                    dukes and 365 counts; twelve archbishops sat on his right hand, and twenty
                    bishops on his left, besides the patriarch of St Thomas’s, the protopope of the
                    Sarmagantians (Samarkand ?), and the archprotopope of Susa, where the royal
                    residence was. There was another palace of still more wonderful character, built
                    by the presbyter’s father in obedience to a heavenly command, in the city of
                    Bribric.</p>
                <p>Should it be asked why, with all this power and splendour, he calls himself
                    merely “presbyter,” this is because of his humility, and because it was not
                    fitting for one whose sewer was a primate and king, whose butler an archbishop
                    and king, whose chamberlain a bishop and king, whose master of the horse an
                    archimandrite and king, whose chief cook an abbot and king, to be called by such
                    titles as these. But the extent of his power and dominion could only be told
                    when the number of the stars of heaven and of the sands of the seashore could be
                    told.</p>
                <p>How great was the popularity and diffusion of this letter may be judged in some
                    degree from the fact that Herr Zarncke in his elaborate treatise on Prester John
                    gives a list of close on a hundred MSS. of it. Of these there are eight in the
                    British Museum, ten at Vienna, thirteen in the great Paris library, fifteen at
                    Munich. There are also several renderings in old German verse. Many
                    circumstances of the time tended to render such a letter acceptable. Christendom
                    would welcome gladly the intelligence of a counterpoise arising so unexpectedly
                    to the Mohammedan power; whilst the statements of the letter itself combined a
                    reference to and corroboration of all the romantic figments concerning Asia
                    which already fed the curiosity of Europe, which figured in the world-maps, and
                    filled that fabulous history of Alexander which for nearly a thousand years
                    supplanted the real history of the Macedonian throughout Europe and western
                    Asia.</p>
                <p>The only other surviving document of the 12th century bearing on this subject is
                    a letter of which MS. copies are preserved in the Cambridge and Paris libraries,
                    and which is also embedded in the chronicles of several English annalists,
                    including Benedict of Peterborough, Roger Hovedon, and Matthew Paris. It
                    purports to have been indited from the Rialto at Venice by Pope Alexander III.
                    on the 5th day before the calends of October (2 7th September), data which fix
                    the year as 1177. The pope addresses himself as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Alexander</hi><hi rend="italic">episcopus, servus servorum dei, carissimo in
                    Christo filio</hi><hi rend="italic">Johanni,</hi><hi rend="italic">illustro et
                    magnifico indorum regi</hi> [Hovedon’s copy here inserts <hi rend="italic"
                    >sacerdoti sanctissimo], salutem et apostolicam benedictionem.</hi> He recites
                    how he had heard of the monarch’s Christian profession, diligence in good works,
                    and piety by manifold narrators and common report, but also more particularly
                    from his (the pope’s) beloved son Master Philip, his physician and confidant <hi
                    rend="italic">(medicus et familiaris noster),</hi> who had received information
                    from honourable persons of the monarch’s kingdom, with whom he had intercourse
                    in those (Eastern) parts. Philip had also reported the king’s anxiety for
                    instruction in Catholic discipline and for reconciliation with the apostolic see
                    in regard to all discrepancies. Philip had also heard from the king’s people
                    that he fervently desired to have a church in Rome and an altar at Jerusalem.
                    The pope goes on to say that he found it too difficult, on account of the length
                    and obstructions of the way, to send any one (of ecclesiastical position <hi
                    rend="italic">1) a latere,</hi> but he would despatch the aforesaid Philip to
                    communicate instruction to him. And on accepting Philip’s communications the
                    king should send back honourable persons bearing letters sealed with his seal,
                    in which his wishes should be fully set forth. “The more nobly and magnanimously
                    thou conductest thyself, and <hi rend="italic">the less thou vauntest of thy
                    wealth and power</hi> (quanto . . . minus de divitiis et potentia tua videris
                    inflatus), the more readily shall we regard thy wishes both as to the concession
                    of a church in the city and of altars in the church of SS. Peter and Paul, and
                    in the church of the Lord’s Sepulchre at Jerusalem, and as to other reasonable
                    requests.”</p>
                <p>There is no express mention of the title “Prester John” in what seem the more
                    genuine copies of this letter. But the address and the expression in the
                    italicized passage <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n739/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0739-0716"/> just quoted (which evidently alludes to the
                    vaunting epistle of 1165) hardly leave room for doubt that the pope supposed
                    himself to be addressing the (imaginary) author of that letter. To whom the
                    reports of Philip the physician in reality referred is a point that will be
                    discussed below. We do not know how far the imaginations about Prester John
                    retained their vitality in 1221, forty-four years after the letter of Pope
                    Alexander, for we know of no mention of Prester John in the interval. But in
                    that year again a rumour came out of the East that a great Christian conqueror
                    was taking the hated Moslems in reverse and sweeping away their power.
                    Prophecies current among the Christians in Syria of the destruction of
                    Mohammed’s sect after six centuries of duration added to the excitement
                    attending these rumours. The name ascribed to the conqueror was David, and some
                    called him the son or the grandson of Prester John of India. He whose conquests
                    and slaughters now revived the legend was in fact no Christian or King David but
                    the famous Jenghiz Khân. The delusion was dissipated slowly, and even after the
                    great Tartar invasion and devastation of eastern Europe its effects still
                    influenced the mind of Christendom and caused popes and kings to send missions
                    to the Tartar hordes with a lingering feeling that their khâns, if not already
                    Christians, were at least always on the verge of conversion.</p>
                <p>Before proceeding farther we must go back on the bishop of Gabala’s story and
                    elucidate it as far as we can. The most accomplished of modern geographical
                    antiquaries, Μ. d’Avezac, first showed to whom the story must apply. The only
                    conqueror whose career suits in time and approximates in circumstances is the
                    founder of Karâ-Khitâi, which existed as a great empire in Central Asia during
                    the latter two-thirds of the 13th century. This personage was a prince of the
                    Khitâi or Khitaian dynasty of Liao, which had reigned over northern China and
                    the regions beyond the Wall during a great part of the 10th and 11th centuries,
                    and from which came the name Khitâi (Cathay), by which China was once known in
                    Europe and still is known in Russia. On the overthrow of the dynasty about 1125
                    this prince, who is called by the Chinese Yeliu Tashi, and who had gone through
                    a complete Chinese education, escaped westward with a body of followers. Being
                    well received by the Uighurs and other tribes west of the desert, subjects of
                    his family, he gathered an army and commenced a course of conquest which
                    eventually extended over eastern and western Turkestan. He took the title of Gur
                    Khân or Kor Khan, said to mean “universal” or “supreme” khân, and fixed at
                    Balasaghun, north of the T’ian Shan range, the capital of his empire, which
                    became known as that of Karâ-Khitâi (Black Cathay). In 1141 the assistance of
                    this Khitaian prince was invoked by the shâh of Kharezm against Sanjâr, the
                    Seljfi⅛ sovereign of Persia, who had expelled the shâh from his kingdom and
                    killed his son. The Gur Khân came with a vast army of Turks, Khitaians, and
                    others, and defeated Sanjâr near Samarkand (September 1141) in a great battle,
                    which the historian Ibn al-Athir calls the greatest and most sanguinary defeat
                    that Islam had ever undergone in those regions. Though the Gur Khân himself is
                    not described as having extended his conquests into Persia, the shâh of Kharezm
                    followed up the victory by invading Khorâsan and plundering the cities and
                    treasuries of Sanjâr. In this event—the defeat of Sanjâr, whose brother’s son,
                    Mas’ùd, reigned over western Persia—occurring just four years before the story
                    of the Eastern conqueror was told at Rome to Bishop Otto, we seem to have the
                    destruction of the <hi rend="italic">Samiardi</hi><hi rend="italic">fratres</hi>
                    or Sanjâr brothers, which was the germ of the story of Prester John.</p>
                <p>There is no evidence of any profession of Christianity on the part of the Gur
                    Khân, though it is a fact that the daughter of the last of his race is recorded
                    to have been a Christian. The hosts of the Gur Khân are called by Moslem
                    historians <hi rend="italic">Al-Turk-al-Kuffcir,</hi> the kafir or infidel
                    Turks; and we know that in later days the use of this term “kafir” often led to
                    misapprehensions, as when Vasco da Gama’s people were led to take for Christians
                    the Banyan traders on the African coast, and to describe as Christian sovereigns
                    so many princes of the farther East of whom they heard at Calicut. Of the rest
                    of the accretions to the story little can be said except that they are of the
                    kind sure to have grown up in some shape when once the Christianity of the
                    conqueror was assumed. We have said that Prester John was a phantom; and we know
                    out of what disproportionate elements phantoms are developed. How the name John
                    arose is one of the obscure points. Oppert supposes the title “Gur Khân” to have
                    been confounded with Yukhanan or Johannes; and of course it is probable that
                    even in the Levant the stories of “John the patriarch of the Indies,” repeated
                    in the early part of this article, may have already mingled with the rumours
                    from the East.</p>
                <p>The obvious failure in the history of the Gur Khân to meet all points in the
                    story of the bishop of Gabala led Professor Bruun of Odessa to bring forward
                    another candidate for identity with the original Prester John, in the person of
                    the Georgian prince John Orbelian, the “sbasalar,” or generalissimo under
                    several kings of Georgia in that age. Space forbids our stating all the
                    ingenious arguments and coincidences with which Professor Bruun supported his
                    theory. Among other arguments he does show some instances, in documents of the
                    15th century, of the association of Prester John with the Caucasus. In one at
                    least of these the title is applied to the king of Abassia, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> of the Abhasians of Caucasus. Some confusion between Abash
                    (Abyssinia) and Abhas seems to be possibly at the bottom of the imbroglio. An
                    abstract of Professor Bruun’s argument will be found in the 2d edition of <hi
                    rend="italic">Marco Polo,</hi> vol. ii. pp. 539-542. We may quote here the
                    conclusion arrived at in winding up that abstract. “Professor Bruun’s thesis
                    seems to me more than fairly successful in <hi rend="italic">paving the way</hi>
                    for the introduction of a Caucasian Prester John; the barriers are removed, the
                    carpets are spread, the trumpets sound royally,—but the conquering hero comes
                    not. He does very nearly come. The almost royal power and splendour of the
                    Orbelians at this time is on record . . . (see St Martin,. <hi rend="italic"

                    the chief princes of the Seljukian house, and of no event in his history so
                    important as to account for his being made to play the part of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Presbyter Johannes</hi> in the story of the Bishop of Gabala.” As regards any
                    real foundation for the title of “Presbyter” we may observe that nothing worth
                    mentioning has been alleged on behalf of any candidate.</p>
                <p>When the Mongol conquests threw Asia open to Frank travellers in the middle of
                    the 13th century their minds were full of Prester John; they sought in vain for
                    an adequate representative, nor was it in the nature of things that they should
                    not find <hi rend="italic">some</hi> representative. In fact they found <hi
                    rend="italic">several.</hi> Apparently no real tradition existed among the
                    Eastern Christians of such a personage; the myth had taken shape from the clouds
                    of rumour as they rolled westward from Asia. But the persistent demand produced
                    a supply; and the honour of identification with Prester John, after hovering
                    over one head and another, settled for a long time upon that of the king of the
                    Nestorian tribe of Kerait, famous in the histories of Jenghiz under the name of
                    Ung or Awang Khân. We may quote an illustration from geographical analogy:
                    “Pre-Columbian maps of the Atlantic showed an island of Brazil, an island of
                    Antiilia, founded—who knew on what?—whether on the real adventure of a vessel
                    driven in sight of the Azores or Bermudas, or on mere fancy and fogbank. But
                    when discovery really came to be undertaken, men looked for such lands and found
                    them accordingly. And. there they are in our geographies, Brazil and the
                    Antilles.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>App. to <hi

                    to Kushluk, king of the Naimans, who had married the daughter of the last lineal
                    representative of the gur khans.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>It has been pointed out by Mr Alexander Wylie that Kushluk
                    was son of a powerful king of the Naimans, whose name Ta-Yang-Khän is precisely
                    “Great King John” as nearly as that could be expressed in Chinese.</p></note>
                    And from the remarks which Rubruquis makes in connexion with this King John, on
                    the habit of the Nestorians to spin wonderful stories out of nothing, and of the
                    great tales that went forth about King John, it is evident that the intelligent
                    traveller supposed this king of the Naimans to be the original of the
                    widely-spread legend. He mentions, however, a brother of this John called Une
                    who ruled over the Crit and Merkit (or Kerait and Mekrit, two of the great
                    tribes of Mongolia), whose history he associates with that of Jenghiz Khan. Une
                    Khan reappears in Marco Polo, who tells much about him as “a great prince, the
                    same that we call Prester John, him in fact about whose great dominion all the
                    world talks.” This Une was in fact the prince of the Kerait, called by the
                    Chinese Tuli, and by the Persian historians of the Mongols Toghral, on whom the
                    Kin emperor of north China had conferred the title of “wang” or king, whence his
                    coming to be known as Awang or Ung Khan. He was long the ally of Jenghiz, but a
                    breach occurred between them, and they were mortal enemies till the death of Ung
                    Khan in 1203. In the narrative of Marco Polo “Une Can,” <hi rend="italic"
                    >alias</hi> Prester John, is the liege lord of the Tartars, to whom they paid
                    tribute until Jenghiz arose. And this is substantially the story repeated by
                    other European writers of the end of the 13th century, such as Ricold of
                    Monte-croce and the Sieur de Joinville, as well as by one Asiatic, the famous
                    Christian writer, Gregory Abulfaraj. We can find no Oriental corroboration of
                    the claims of Ung Khan to supremacy over the Mongols. But that his power and
                    dignity were considerable appears from the term “Padshah,” which is applied to
                    him by the historian Rashiduddin.</p>
                <p>We find Prester John in one more phase before he vanishes from Asiatic history,
                    real or mythical. Marco Polo in the latter part of the 13th century, and Friar
                    John of Montecorvino, afterwards archbishop of Cambaluc, in the beginning of the
                    14th, speak of the descendants of Prester John as holding territory under the
                    great khan in a locality which can be identified with the plain of Kuku-Khotan,
                    north of the great bend of the Yellow River and about 280 miles north-west of
                    Peking. The prince reigning in the time of these two writers was named King
                    George, and was the “6th in descent from Prester John,” <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> no doubt from Awang Khan. Friar Odoric, about 1326, visited the
                    country still ruled by the prince whom he calls Prester John; “but,” he says,
                    “as regards him, not one hundredth part is true that is told of him.” With this
                    mention Prester John ceases to have any pretension to historical existence in
                    Asia (for we need not turn aside to Mandeville’s fabulous revival of old stories
                    or to the barefaced fictions of his contemporary, John of Hese, which bring in
                    the old tales of the miraculous body of St Thomas), and Iris connexion with that
                    quarter of the world gradually died out of the memory of Europe.<note

                <p>When next we begin to hear his name it is as an African, not as an Asiatic
                    prince; and the personage so styled is in fact the Christian king of Abyssinia.
                    The learned Ludolf has asserted that this application was an invention of the
                    Portuguese and arose only in the 15th century. But this is a mistake; for in
                    fact the application had begun much earlier, and probably long before the name
                    had ceased to be attached by writers on Asia to the descendants of the king of
                    the Kerait. It is true that Simon Sigoli, who visited Cairo in 1384, still
                    speaks of “Presto Giovanni” as a monarch dwelling in India; but it is the India
                    which is conterminous with the dominions of the soldan of Egypt, and whose lord
                    is master of the Nile, to close or open its discharge upon Egypt.<note

                    patriarch of Nubia and Ethiopia, and is lord of many great lands, and many
                    cities of Christians, though they be black as pitch, and brand themselves with
                    the sign of the cross in token of their baptism” (Libro del conosciemento de

                    farther, Friar Jordanus, who returned from the East before 1328, speaks of the
                    emperor of the Ethiopians “quem vos vocatis <hi rend="italic">Prestre
                    Johan."</hi></p>
                <p>But, indeed, we shall have strong probability on our side if we go back much
                    farther still, and say that, however vague may have been the ideas of Pope
                    Alexander III. respecting the geographical position of the potentate whom he
                    addressed from Venice in 1177, the only real person to whom the letter can have
                    been sent was the king of Abyssinia. Let it be observed that the “honourable
                    persons of the monarch’s kingdom” whom the leech Philip had met with in the East
                    must have been the representatives of some real power, and not of a phantom. It
                    must have been a real king and not a rumour-begotten ignis fatuus who professed
                    to desire reconciliation with the Catholic Church and the assignation of a
                    church at Rome and of an altar at Jerusalem. Moreover, we know that the Ethiopie
                    Church did long possess a chapel and altar in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre,
                    and, though we have been unable to find travellers’ testimony to this older than
                    about 1497, it is quite possible that the appropriation may have originated much
                    earlier.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Indeed, we can
                    carry the date back half a century further by the evidence of a letter
                    translated in Ludolf (Comment., p. 303). This is addressed from Shoa by the king
                    Zara Jacob in the eighth year of his reign (1442) to the Abyssinian monks,
                    dwellers at Jerusalem. The king desires them to light certain lamps in the
                    Church of the Sepulchre, including “three in our chapel.” In the Pilgerfahrt des
                    Ritters Arnold von Harff (1496-99), Cologne, 1860, p. 175, we find it stated
                    that the Abyssinians had their chapel, &amp;c., to the left of the Holy
                    Sepulchre, between two pillars of the temple, whilst the Armenian chapel was
                    over theirs, reached by a stone staircase alongside of the Indians (or
                    Abyssinians). This exactly corresponds with the plan and references given in
                    Sandys’s Travels (1615, p. 162), which shows the different chapels. The first on
                    the south, i.e., the left looking from the body of the church, is “No. 35.—The
                    Chappell of the Abisines, over which the chappell of the Armenians.’’ A
                    reference to Jerusalem, which we procured through the kindness of Mr Walter
                    Besant, shows that the Abyssinians no longer have a chapel or privileges in the
                    Church of the Sepulchre. Between the Armenians and the Copts they have been
                    deprived of these, and even of the keys of their convent. The resentment of King
                    Theodore at the loss of these privileges was one of the indirect causes which
                    led to the war between him and England in 1867-68.</p></note> We know from Marco
                    Polo that about a century after the date of Pope Alexander’s epistle a mission
                    was sent by the king of Abyssinia to Jerusalem to make offerings on his part at
                    the Church of the Sepulchre. It must be remembered that at the time of the
                    pope’s letter Jerusalem, which had been taken from the Moslem in 1099, was still
                    in Christian possession. Abyssinia had been going through a long period of
                    vicissitude and distraction. In the 10th century the royal line had been
                    superseded by a dynasty of Falasha Jews, followed by other Christian families;
                    but weakness and disorder continued till the restoration of the “House of
                    Solomon” (c. 1268). Nothing is more likely than that the princes of the
                    “Christian families” who had got possession of the throne of northern Abyssinia
                    should have wished to strengthen themselves by a connexion with European
                    Christendom, and to establish relations with Jerusalem, then in Christian hands.
                    We do not know whether the leech Philip ever reached his destination, or whether
                    a reply ever came back to the Lateran.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Matthew Paris gives a letter from Philip, prior of the
                    Dominicans in Palestine, which reached the pope in 1237, and which speaks of a
                    prelate from whom he had received several letters, “qui praeest omnibus quos
                    Nestoriana haeresis ab ecclesia separavit (cujus praelatio per Indiam Majorem,
                    et per regnum sacerdotis Johannis, et per regna magis proxima Orienti

                    indicated, though it was a mistake to identify the Abyssinian Church with the
                    Nestorians.</p></note></p>
                <p>Baronins, who takes the view for which we have been arguing, supposes it possible
                    that the church in Rome possessed in his own time by the Abyssinians (St
                    Stephen’s in the Vatican) might have been granted on this occasion. But we may
                    be sure that this was a modern concession during the attempts to master the
                    Ethiopian Church early in the 16th century. Ludolf intimates that its occupancy
                    had been taken from them in his own time after it had been held “for more than a
                    century.”</p>

                    the Nubians dug a chapel out of the rock under Calvary in honour of the three
                    kings: “et vocatur illa capella in partibus illis capella Nubiyanorum ad reges
                    in praesentem diem, sed Sarracini ... ob invidiam obstruxerunt (p. 158).”</p>
                <p>There is no need to proceed further. From the 14th century onwards Prester John
                    had found his seat in Abyssinia. It is there that Fra Mauro’s great map (1459)
                    presents a fine city with the rubric, “Qui il Preste Janni fa residentia
                    principal.” When, nearer the end of the century (1481-95), King John II. of
                    Portugal was prosecuting inquiries regarding access to India his first object
                    was to open communication with “Prester John of the Indies,” who was understood
                    to be a Christian potentate in Africa, and regarding whom information was sought
                    “through Abyssinian monks who visited these Spanish regions, and also through
                    certain friars who went from this country to Jerusalem.” And when Vasco da Gama
                    went on his memorable voyage from Mozambique northwards he began to hear of
                    “Preste Joham” as reigning in the interior,— or rather, probably, by the light
                    of his preconceptions of the existence of that personage in east Africa he thus
                    interpreted what was told him. More than twenty years later, when the first book
                    on Abyssinia was composed—that of Alvarez,—the title, constantly and as a matter
                    of course designating the king of Abyssinia, is <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0741-0718"/> “Prester John,” or simply “the Preste.” The name
                    occurs on almost every page of the narrative beginning with page 1, though in
                    the translation printed for the Hakluyt Society that which the editor calls
                    “general index” gives no indication of the fact.</p>
                <p>The name of “Prester John” suggested alike to scholars and sciolists, first in
                    its Oriental and then in its Ethiopian connexion, many fanciful and strained
                    etymologies, from Persian, Hebrew, Ethiopie, and what not, and on the assumption
                    that neither “Presbyter” nor “John” was any proper element of the name. But for
                    these dreams this passing notice must suffice.</p>
                <p>On the whole subject in its older aspects, see Ludolf’s Historia Aethiopica and
                    its Commentary, passim. The excellent remarks of Μ. d’Avezac, comprising a
                    conspectus of almost the whole essence of the subject, are in the Recueil de
                    Voyages et de Mémoires, published by the Société de Géographie, vol. iv., Paris,
                    1839, pp. 547-564. Two German works of importance which have been used in this
                    article are the interesting and suggestive Der Presbyter Johannes in Sage und
                    Geschichte, bv Dr Gustav Oppert (2d ed., Berlin, 1870), and, most important of
                    all in its learned, careful, and critical collection and discussion of all the
                    passages bearing on the subject, Der Priester Johannes, by Friedrich Zarncke of
                    Leipsic (1876-79), still unfortunately unfinished, and without the summing up
                    which is required to complete the subject. The present writer has given
                    considerable attention to the subject, and discussed it partially in Cathay and
                    the Way Thither, p. 173 sq., and in Marco Polo, 2d eα., i. 229- 233, ii.
