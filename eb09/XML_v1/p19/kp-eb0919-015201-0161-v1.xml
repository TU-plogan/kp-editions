                <p><label type="entry">PIUS II</label>. (Enea Silvio Piccolomini, commonly known in
                    literature as Aeneas Sylvius), pope from 1458 to 1464, “whose character reflects
                    almost every tendency of the age in which he lived,” was born at Corsignano in
                    the Sienese territory, October 18, 1405, of a noble but decayed family. After
                    studying at the universities of Siena and Florence, he settled in the former
                    city as a teacher, but in 1431 accepted the post of secretary to Domenico
                    Capranica, bishop of Fermo, then on his way to Basel to protest against the
                    injustice of the new pope Eugenius IV. in refusing him the cardinalate for which
                    he had been designated by Martin V. Arriving at Basel after numerous adventures,
                    he successively served Capranica and several other masters. In 1435 he was sent
                    by Cardinal Albergata, Eugenius’s legate at the council, on a secret mission to
                    Scotland, the object of which is variously related, even by himself. He visited
                    England as well as Scotland, underwent many perils and vicissitudes in both
                    countries, and has left a valuable account of each. Upon his return he sided
                    actively with the council in its conflict with the pope, and, although still a
                    layman, obtained a leading share in the direction of its affairs. But when in
                    1442 the council elected Amadeus, duke of Savoy, as an antipope under the name
                    of Felix V., Aeneas, perceiving that the step was generally disapproved, found a
                    pretext for withdrawing to the emperor Frederick III.’s court at Vienna. He was
                    there crowned imperial poet laureate, and obtained the patronage of the
                    emperor’s chancellor, Kaspar Schlick, a love adventure of whose at Siena he
                    celebrated in his romance, <hi rend="italic">Eurialus and Lucretia.</hi> His
                    character had hitherto been that of an easy man of the world, with no pretence
                    to strictness in morals or consistency in politics. He now began to be more
                    regular in the former respect, and in the latter adopted a decided line by
                    making his peace with Rome. Being sent on a mission to Rome in 1445, with the
                    ostensible object of inducing Eugenius to convoke a new council, he was absolved
                    from ecclesiastical censures, and returned to Germany under an engagement to
                    assist the pope. This he did most effectually by the diplomatic dexterity with
                    which he smoothed away differences between the court of Rome and the German
                    electors; and he had a leading part in the compromise by which, in 1447, the
                    dying Eugenius accepted the reconciliation tendered by the German princes, and
                    the council and the antipope were left without support. He had already taken
                    orders, and one of the first acts of Eugenius’s successor Nicholas V. was to
                    make him bishop of Trieste. In 1450 he was sent ambassador by the emperor
                    Frederick to negotiate his marriage with the Princess Leonora of Naples, which
                    object he successfully achieved; in 1451 he undertook a mission to Bohemia, and
                    concluded a satisfactory arrangement with the Hussite chief George Podiebrad; in
                    1452 he accompanied Frederick to Rome, where the emperor wedded Leonora and was
                    crowned king of the Romans. In August 1455 Aeneas again arrived in Rome on an
                    embassy to proffer the obedience of Germany to the new pope, Calixtus III. He
                    brought strong recommendations from the emperor and King Ladislaus of Hungary
                    for his nomination to the cardinalate, but delays arose from the pope’s
                    resolution to promote his own nephews first, and he did not attain the object of
                    his ambition until December in the following year.</p>
                <p>Calixtus III. died on August 6, 1458. On August 10 the cardinals entered into
                    conclave. The wealthy cardinal of Rouen, though a Frenchman and of exceptionable
                    character, seemed certain to be elected. Aeneas has told us in a passage of his
                    own history of his times, long retrenched from that work but printed
                    clandestinely in the <hi rend="italic">Conclavi</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi> ’
                    <hi rend="italic">Pontifici</hi><hi rend="italic">Romani,</hi> by what art,
                    energy, and eloquence he frustrated this false step. It seemed but meet that the
                    election should fall upon himself: no other candidate appears to have been
                    seriously thought of; nor, although the sacred college probably included a few
                    men of higher moral standard, had it any on the whole so worthy of the tiara. It
                    was the peculiar faculty of Aeneas to accommodate himself perfectly to whatever
                    position he might be called upon to occupy; it was his peculiar good fortune
                    that every step in life had placed him in circumstances appealing more and more
                    to the better part of his nature, an appeal to which he had never failed to
                    respond. The party pamphleteer had been more respectable than the private
                    secretary, the diplomatist than the pamphleteer, the cardinal than the
                    diplomatist; now the unscrupulous adventurer and licentious novelist of a few·
                    short years ago seated himself quite naturally in the chair of St Peter, and
                    from the resources of his versatile character produced without apparent effort
                    all the virtues and endowments becoming his exalted station. After allying
                    himself with Ferdinand, the Aragonese claimant of the throne of Naples, his next
                    important act was to convene a congress of the representatives of Christian
                    princes at Mantua for joint action against the Turks. His long progress to the
                    place of assembly resembled a triumphal procession; and the congress, a complete
                    failure as regarded its ostensible object, at least showed that the impotence of
                    Christendom was not owing to the pope. On his return from the congress Pius
                    spent a considerable time in his native district of Siena, and has described his
                    delight and the charms of a country life in very pleasing language. He was
                    recalled to Rome by the disturbances occasioned by Tiburzio de Maso, who was
                    ultimately seized and executed. The papal states were at this time greatly
                    troubled by rebellious barons and marauding condottieri, but these evils
                    gradually abated. The Neapolitan war was also terminated by the success of the
                    pope’s ally Ferdinand. In July 1461 Pius canonized St Catherine of Siena, and in
                    October of the same year he gained what at first appeared to be a most brilliant
                    success by inducing the new king of France, Louis XI., to abolish the pragmatic
                    sanction, by which the pope’s authority in France had been grievously impaired.
                    But Louis had expected that Pius would in return espouse the French cause in
                    Naples, and when he found himself disappointed he virtually re-established the
                    pragmatic sanction by royal ordinances. Pius was also engaged in a series of
                    disputes with the Bohemian king and the count of Tyrol, and the crusade for
                    which the congress of Mantua had been convoked made no progress. The pope did
                    his best: he addressed an eloquent letter to the sultan urging him to become a
                    Christian; he succeeded in reconciling the emperor and the king of Hungary, and
                    derived great encouragement as well as pecuniary advantage from the discovery of
                    mines of alum in the papal territory. But France was estranged; the duke of
                    Burgundy broke his positive promise; Milan was engrossed with the attempt to
                    seize Genoa; Florence cynically advised the pope to let the Turks and the
                    Venetians wear each other out. Pius was unawares nearing his end, and his malady
                    probably prompted the feverish impatience with which on June 18, 1464, he
                    assumed the cross and departed for Ancona to conduct the crusade in person. It
                    seemed certain that the issue of such an enterprise could only be ridiculous or
                    disastrous. Pius II.’s good genius again stepped in, and rendered it pathetic.
                    He was suffering from fever when he left Rome. The crusading army melted away at
                    Ancona for want of transport, and when at last the Venetian fleet arrived the
                    dying pope could only view it from a window. He expired two days afterwards,
                    August <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n162/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0162-0153"/> 14, 1464, in his death as in his life a figure
                    picturesque and significant far beyond the wont of Roman pontiffs. He was
                    succeeded by Paul II.</p>
                <p>Pius, indeed, regarded as a man and not merely as an historical personage, is the
                    most interesting of all the successors of St Peter. It is easy to take his
                    character to pieces, but the aroma of something exquisite lingers around every
                    fragment. He had a healthy, sincere, loving nature, frank and naive even in his
                    aberrations and defects, which seem after all sufficiently venial. The failings
                    of other popes have most frequently been those of the priest, and therefore in
                    the true sense of the term inhuman. It is a refreshing transition to the faults
                    of the adventurer, the diplomatist, the man of letters and pleasure. The leading
                    trait of Pius’s character was his extreme impressionableness. Chameleon-like he
                    took colour from surrounding circumstances, and could always depend on being
                    what these circumstances required him to be. As, therefore, his prospects
                    widened and his responsibilities deepened, his character widened and deepened
                    too; and he who had entered upon life a shifty adventurer quitted it a model
                    chief shepherd. His virtues were not only great, but the most conspicuous were
                    those especially characteristic of the finer natures. While he vied with any man
                    in industry, prudence, wisdom, and courage, he excelled most men in simplicity
                    of tastes, constancy of attachments, kindly playfulness, magnanimity, and mercy.
                    As chief of the church he was able and sagacious, and showed that he
                    comprehended the conditions on which its monopoly of spiritual power could for a
                    season be maintained; his views were far-seeing and liberal ∙, and he was but
                    slightly swayed by personal ends. He is especially interesting as the type of
                    the scholar and publicist who wins his way by intellectual strength,
                    foreshadowing the age to come when the pen should be mightier than the sword;
                    and no less as the figure in whom the mediaeval and the modern spirit are most
                    distinctly seen to meet and blend, ere the latter definitively gains the
                    mastery.</p>
                <p>Pius was a versatile and voluminous author, one of the best and most industrious
                    of his period. His most important work is his <hi rend="italic">Commentaries of
                    his own Times,</hi> published in 1584 under the name of Gobelinus, to whom it
                    has been ascribed, but who was in fact only the copyist. It appears to have been
                    altered to some slight extent by his secretary Campanus. Numerous passages
                    suppressed at the time of publication have been recently published in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Transactions</hi> of the Accademia de’ Lincei by Signor Cugnone,
                    together with other inedited works. Pius’s <hi rend="italic">Commentaries</hi>
                    are delightful reading, and their historical value is very great. “Pius II.,
                    says Creighton, “is the first writer who attempted to represent the present as
                    it would look to posterity, who consciously applied a scientific conception of
                    history to the explanation and arrangement of passing events.” His <hi
                    rend="italic">Epistles,</hi> which were collected by himself, are also an
                    important source of historical information. The most valuable of his minor
                    historical writings are his histories of Bohemia and of the emperor Frederick
                    III., the latter partly autobiographical. He sketched geographical treatises on
                    Europe and Asia, and in early and middle life produced numerous tracts on the
                    political and theological controversies of his day, as well as on ethical
                    subjects. Pius was greatly admired as a poet by his contemporaries, but his
                    reputation in belles lettres rests principally upon his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eurialus and Lucretia,</hi> which continues to be read to this day, partly from
                    its truth to nature, and partly from the singularity of an erotic novel being
                    written by a pope. He also composed some comedies, one of which alone is extant,
                    and as yet only in MS. All these works are in Latin. Pius was not an eminent
                    scholar: his Latin is frequently incorrect, and he· knew little Greek; but his
                    writings have high literary qualities, and will always be prized as vivid and
                    accurate reproductions of the spirit of a very remarkable age.</p>
                <p>All the chief authorities for Pius’s life are sifted and condensed in the
                    admirable biography by Voigt (3 vols., Berlin, 1856-63). Professor Creighton, in
                    his masterly <hi rend="italic">History of the Papacy during the Reformation</hi>
                    (vol. ii., London, 1882), has given the English reader the substance of Voigt's
                    narrative, while preserving a full independence of judgment. (R. G.)</p>
