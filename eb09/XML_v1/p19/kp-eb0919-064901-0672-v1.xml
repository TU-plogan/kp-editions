                    (1594-1665), French painter, was born at Les Andelys (Eure) in June 1594. Early
                    sketches, made when he should have been learning Latin, attracted the notice of
                    Quentin Varin, a local painter, whose pupil Poussin became, till he went to
                    Paris, where he entered the studio of Ferdinand Elie, a Fleming, and then of the
                    Lorrainer L’Allemand. He found French art in a stage of transition: the old
                    apprenticeship system was disturbed, and the academical schools destined to
                    supplant it were not yet established; but, having been brought into relations
                    with Courtois the mathematician, Poussin was fired by the study of his
                    collection of engravings after Italian masters, and resolved to go to Italy.
                    After two abortive attempts to reach Rome, and when he was again on the road, he
                    fell in with the chevalier Marini at Lyons. Marini employed him on illustrations
                    to his poems, took him into his household, and in 1624 enabled Poussin (who had
                    been detained by commissions in Lyons and Paris) to rejoin him at Rome. There,
                    his patron having died, Poussin fell into great distress; but his high qualities
                    had won him friends amongst his brother artists, and on his falling ill he was
                    received into the house of his compatriot Dughet and tenderly nursed by his
                    daughter Anna Maria, to whom in 1629, when his affairs were easier, Poussin was
                    married. Amongst his first patrons were Cardinal Barberini, for whom was painted
                    the Death of Germanicus (Barberini Palace); Cardinal Omodei, for whom he
                    produced, in 1630, the Triumphs of Flora (Louvre); Cardinal de Richelieu, who
                    commissioned a Bacchanal (Louvre); Vicenzo Giustiniani, for whom was executed
                    the Massacre of the Innocents, of which there is a first sketch in the British
                    Museum; Cassiano dal Pozzo, who became the owner of the first series of the
                    Seven Sacraments (Belvoir Castle); and Fiéart de Chanteloup, with whom in 1640
                    Poussin, at the call of Sublet De Noyers, returned to France. He was well
                    received by Louis XIII., who conferred on him the title of “first painter in
                    ordinary,” and in two years at Paris he produced not only several pictures for
                    the royal chapels (the Last Supper, painted for Versailles, now in the Louvre)
                    but eight cartoons for the Gobelins, the series of the Labours of Hercules for
                    the Louvre, the Triumph of Truth for Cardinal Richelieu (Louvre), and much minor
                    work: but in 1643, annoyed and disgusted <pb break="no"

                    the architect Lemercier, Poussin withdrew to Rome. There, in 1648, he finished
                    for De Chanteloup the second series of the Seven Sacraments (Bridgewater
                    Gallery), and also his noble landscape with Diogenes throwing away his Scoop
                    (Louvre); in 1649 he painted the Vision of St Paul (Louvre) for the comic poet
                    Scarron, and in 1651 the Holy Family (Louvre) for the duke of Créqui. Year by
                    year he continued to produce an enormous variety of works, many of which are
                    included in the list given by Félibien, in which we find the names of Pointel
                    the banker, Cardinal Manimo, Madame Mauroi, and others. He is said to have
                    settled in a house on the Pincio, but in 1656, the year of the plague, he is
                    entered in the census as living with his wife in the Via Paolina. He died in
                    November 1665 and was buried in the church of St Lawrence in Lucina, his wife
                    having predeceased him.</p>
                <p>The finest collection of Poussin’s paintings as well as of his drawings is
                    possessed by the Louvre; but, besides the pictures in the National Gallery and
                    at Dulwich, England possesses several of his most considerable works: the
                    Triumph öf Pan is at Basildon (Berkshire), and his great allegorical painting of
                    the Arts at Knowsley. At Rome, in the Colonna and Valentini Palaces, are notable
                    works by him, and one of the private apartments of Prince Doria is decorated by
                    a great series of landscapes in distemper, which are little known. Throughout
                    his life he stood aloof from the popular movement of his native school. French
                    art in his day was purely decorative, but in Poussin we find a survival of the
                    impulses of the Renaissance coupled with conscious reference to classic work as
                    the standard of excellence. In general we see his paintings at a great
                    disadvantage, for the colour, even of the best preserved, has changed in parts,
                    so that the keeping is disturbed; and the noble construction of his designs can
                    be better seen in engravings than in the original. Amongst the many who have
                    reproduced his works the two Audran, Claudine Stella, Picart, and Pesne are the
                    most successful.</p>
                <p>Poussin left no children, but he adopted as his son Gaspar Dughet, his wife’s
                    brother, who took the name of Poussin. <hi rend="smallcaps">Gaspar Poussin</hi>
                    (1613-1675) devoted himself to landscape painting and rendered admirably the
                    severer beauties of the Roman Campagna; a noteworthy series of works in tempera
                    representing various sites near Rome is to be seen in the Colonna Palace, but
                    one of his finest easel-pictures, the Sacrifice of Abraham, formerly the
                    property of the Colonna, is now, with other works by the same painter, in the
                    English National Gallery. The frescos executed by Gaspar Poussin in S. Martino
                    di Monti are in a bad state of preservation. The Louvre does not possess a
                    single work by his hand. Gaspar died at Rome in 1675.</p>
