                    inflammation of the pleura or serous membrane investing the lungs and lining the
                    interior of the thoracic cavity. It is a common form of chest complaint, and may
                    be either acute or chronic, more frequently the former.</p>
                <p>The morbid changes which the pleura undergoes when inflamed are similar to those
                    which take place in other serous membranes, such as the peritoneum (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Pebitoni-</hi> τιs), and consist of three chief conditions or
                    stages of progress. (1) Inflammatory congestion and infiltration of the pleura,
                    which may spread to the tissues of the lung on the one hand, and to those of the
                    chest wall on the other. (2) Exudation of lymph on the pleural surfaces. This
                    lymph is of variable consistence, sometimes composed of thin and easily
                    separated pellicles, or of extensive thick masses or strata, or again showing
                    itself in the form of a tough membrane. It is of greyish-yellow colour, and
                    microscopically consists mainly of coagulated fibrine along with epithelial
                    cells and red and white blood corpuscles. Its presence causes roughening of the
                    two pleural surfaces, which, slightly separated in health, may now be brought
                    into contact by bands of lymph extending between them. These bands may break up
                    or may become organized by the development of new blood-vessels, and adhering
                    permanently may obliterate throughout a greater or less space the pleural sac,
                    and interfere to some extent with the free play of the lungs. (3) Effusion of
                    fluid into the pleural cavity. This fluid may vary in its characters. Most
                    commonly it is clear or slightly turbid, of yellowish-green colour,
                    sero-fibrinous, and containing flocculi of lymph. In bad constitutions or in
                    cases where the pleurisy complicates' some severe form of disease, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the acute infectious maladies, it is deeply-coloured,
                    bile-stained, sero-purulent, purulent, or bloody, occasionally containing
                    bubbles of air from decomposition. The amount may vary from an almost
                    inappreciable quantity to a gallon or more. When large in quantity it may fill
                    to distension the pleural sac, bulge out the thoracic wall externally, and
                    compress more or less completely the lung, which may in such cases have all its
                    air displaced and be reduced to a mere fraction of its natural bulk lying
                    squeezed up upon its own root. Other organs, such as the heart and liver, may in
                    consequence of the presence of the fluid be shifted away from their normal
                    position. In favourable cases the fluid is absorbed more or less completely and
                    the pleural surfaces again may unite by adhesions; or, all traces of
                    inflammatory products -having disappeared, the pleura may be restored to its
                    normal condition. When the fluid is not speedily absorbed it may remain long in
                    the cavity and compress the lung to such a degree as to render it incapable of
                    re-expansion as the effusion passes slowly away. The consequence is that the
                    chest wall falls in, the ribs become approximated, the shoulder is lowered, the
                    spine becomes curved and internal organs permanently displaced, while the
                    affected side scarcely moves in respiration. Sometimes the unabsorbed fluid
                    becomes purulent, and an <hi rend="italic">empyoema</hi> is the result. In such
                    a case the matter seeks vent in some direction, and it may point as an abscess
                    upon the chest or abdominal wall, or on the other hand burst into the lung and
                    be discharged by the mouth. It must be observed that many cases of pleurisy do
                    not reach the stage of effusion, the inflammation terminating with the exudation
                    of lymph. To this form the term <hi rend="italic">dry pleurisy</hi> is applied.
                    Further pleurisy may be limited to a very small area, or, on the contrary, may
                    affect throughout a greater or less extent the pleural surfaces of both
                    lungs.</p>
                <p>Pleurisy frequently arises from exposure to cold; hence it is more common in the
                    colder weather; but besides this various other causes are connected with its
                    occurrence. Thus it is often associated with other forms of disease within the
                    chest, more particularly pneumonia, bronchitis, and phthisis, and also
                    occasionally accompanies pericarditis. Again it is apt to occur as a secondary
                    disease in certain morbid constitutional states, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi>
                    the infectious fevers, rheumatism, gout, Bright’s disease, diabetes, &amp;c.
                    Further, wounds or injuries of the thoracic walls are apt to set up pleurisy,
                    and the rupture of a phthisical cavity in the lungs causing the escape of air
                    and matter into the pleura has usually a similar effect.</p>
                <p>The symptoms of pleurisy vary, being generally well-marked, but sometimes
                    obscure. In the case of dry pleurisy, which is on the whole the milder form, the
                    chief symptom is a sharp pain in the side, felt especially in breathing. Fever
                    may or may not be present. There is slight dry cθugh; the breathing is quicker
                    than natural, and is shallow and of catching character. If much pain is present
                    the body leans somewhat to the affected side, to <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n232/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0232-0223"/> relax the tension on the intercostal muscles and
                    their covering, which are even tender to touch. On listening to the chest by the
                    stethoscope the physician recognizes sooner or later “friction,” a superficial
                    rough rubbing sound, occurring only with the respiratory acts and ceasing when
                    the breath is held. It is due to the coming together during respiration of the
                    two pleural surfaces which are roughened by the exuded lymph. The patient may
                    himself be aware of this rubbing sensation, and its vibration or fremitus may be
                    felt by the hand laid upon the thoracic wall during breathing. This form of
                    pleurisy may be limited or may extend over the greater part of one or both
                    sides. It is a not unfrequent complication of phthisis in all its stages. In
                    general it disappears in a short time, and complete recovery takes place <hi
                    rend="italic">; or</hi> on the other hand extensive adhesions may form between
                    the costal and pulmonary surfaces of the pleura, preventing uniform expansion of
                    the lung in respiration, and leading to emphysema. Although not of itself
                    attended with danger, dry pleurisy is sometimes preliminary to more serious lung
                    disease, and is always therefore to be regarded while it lasts with some degree
                    of anxiety.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Pleurisy with effusion</hi> is usually more severe than dry
                    pleurisy, and, although it may in some cases develop insidiously, it is in
                    general ushered in sharply by rigors and fever, like other acute inflammatory
                    diseases. Pain is felt in the side or breast, of a severe cutting character,
                    referred usually to the neighbourhood of the nipple, but it may be also at some
                    distance from the affected part, such as through the middle of the body or in
                    the abdominal or iliac regions. This transference of the pain occasionally
                    misleads the medical examiner. The pain is greatest at the outset, and tends to
                    abate as the effusion takes place. A dry cough is almost always present, which
                    is particularly distressing owing to the increased pain the effort excites. The
                    breathing is painful and difficult, tending to become shorter and shallower as
                    the disease advances and the lung on the affected side becomes compressed. The
                    patient at first lies most easily on the sound side, but as the effusion
                    increases he finds his most comfortable position on his back or on the affected
                    side. When there is very copious effusion and, as is apt to happen, great
                    congestion of the other lung, or disease affecting it, the patient’s breathing
                    may be so embarrassed that he cannot lie down.</p>
                <p>On physical examination of the chest the following are among the chief points
                    observed. (1) On inspection there is more or less bulging of the side affected,
                    obliteration of the intercostal spaces, and sometimes elevation of the shoulder.
                    (2) On palpation with the hand applied to the side there is diminished expansion
                    of one-half of the thorax, and the normal vocal fremitus is abolished. Should
                    the effusion be on the right side and copious, the liver may be felt to have
                    been pushed downwards, and the heart somewhat displaced to the left; while if
                    the effusion be on the left side the heart is displaced to the right. (3) On
                    percussion there is absolute dulness over the seat of the effusion. If the fluid
                    does not fill the pleural sac the floating lung may yield a hyper-resonant note.
                    (4) On auscultation the natural breath sound is inaudible over the effusion.
                    Should the latter be only partial the breathing is clear and somewhat harsh,
                    with or without friction, and the voice sound is aegophonic. Posteriorly there
                    may be heard tubular breathing with aegophony. These various physical signs
                    render it impossible to mistake the disease for other maladies the symptoms of
                    which may bear a resemblance to it, such as pleurodynia.</p>
                <p>The absorption or removal of the fluid is marked by the disappearance or
                    diminution of the above-mentioned physical signs, except that of percussion
                    dulness, which may last a long time, and is probably due in part to the
                    thickened pleura. Friction may again be heard as the fluid passes away and the
                    two pleural surfaces come together. The displaced organs are restored to their
                    position, and the compressed lung re-expanded. Frequently this expansion is only
                    partial, and consequently, as already indicated, the chest falls in, the
                    respiration on one side is imperfectly performed, and the patient remains
                    permanently short in breathing to a greater or less degree.</p>
                <p>In most instances the termination is favourable, the acute symptoms subsiding and
                    the fluid (if not drawn off) gradually or rapidly becoming absorbed, sometimes
                    after re-accumulation. On the other hand it may remain long without undergoing
                    much change, and thus a condition of <hi rend="italic">chronic pleurisy</hi>
                    becomes established. Such cases are to be viewed with suspicion, particularly in
                    those who are predisposed to phthisis, of which it is sometimes the
                    precursor.</p>
                <p>Çleurisy may exist in a latent form, the patient going about for weeks with a
                    large accumulation of fluid in his thorax, the ordinary acute symptoms never
                    having been present in any marked degree. Cases of this sort are often
                    protracted, and their results unsatisfactory as regards complete recovery.</p>
                <p>The chief dangers in pleurisy are the occurrence of a large and rapid effusion,
                    particularly if both sides be affected, causing much embarrassment to the
                    breathing and tendency to collapse; the formation of an empyaema (often marked
                    by recurring rigors and hectic symptoms); severe collateral congestion of the
                    other lung; imperfect recovery; and the supervention of phthisis. Further the
                    consequences are apt to be more serious where pleurisy exists as a complication
                    of some pre-existing disease.</p>
                <p>The treatment of pleurisy need only be alluded to in general terms. It will
                    necessarily depend as regards details upon the form and severity of the attack.
                    One of the first symptoms calling for treatment is the pain. Opiates in the form
                    of morphia or Dover’s powder are useful along with the application to the chest
                    of hot poultices or fomentations sprinkled with turpentine. In severe cases much
                    relief to the pain and difficulty of breathing may be afforded by the
                    application of a few leeches to the side. Cases of simple dry pleurisy usually
                    soon yield to such treatment, aided if need be by the application of a
                    fly-blister or of iodine to the chest. The fixing as far as possible of the one
                    side of the thorax by means of cross straps of adhesive plaster according to the
                    plan recommended by Dr Roberts seems of use in many instances. In the case of
                    pleurisy with effusion, in addition to these measures, including blistering, the
                    internal use of saline cathartics and diuretics appears to be often of service
                    in diminishing the amount of the fluid in the pleural cavity, as are also
                    powerful diaphoretics such as pilocarpin. When these measures fail to reduce the
                    effusion the question of the artificial removal of the fluid comes to be
                    considered. The operation (thoracentesis) was practised by the ancient
                    physicians, but was revived in modern times by Trousseau in France and Bowditch
                    in America, by the latter of whom an excellent instrument was devised for
                    emptying the chest, which, however, has been displaced in practice by the still
                    more convenient aspirator. The propriety of this proceeding in pleurisy with
                    effusion has been much discussed, but there now appears to be a general consent
                    that in cases of extensive accumulation, when other means such as those briefly
                    referred to fail to reduce or remove the fluid in a short time, the only hope of
                    preventing such compression of the lung as will impair its function lies in the
                    performance of thoracentesis. All the more will the operation be justifiable if
                    the accumulated fluid is interfering with the function of other organs, such as
                    the heart, or is attended with marked embarrassment of the breathing. The chest
                    is punctured in the lateral or posterior regions, and in most cases the greater
                    portion or all of the fluid, may be safely drawn off. In general the operation
                    is unattended with danger, although not entirely exempt from such risks as
                    sudden syncope, and therefore not to be undertaken without due vigilance as well
                    as a careful consideration of the individual case and its associations. In many
                    instances not only is the removal of distressing symptoms speedy and complete,
                    but the lung is relieved from pressure in time to enable it to resume its normal
                    function. When there is any evidence that the fluid is purulent the operation
                    should be performed early. In such cases it is sometimes necessary to establish
                    for a time a drainage of the pleural cavity by surgical measures.</p>
                <p>The convalescence from pleurisy requires careful tending, and the state of the
                    chest should be inquired into from time to time, in view of the risks of more
                    serious forms of lung disease supervening. (J∙ θ∙ -A.) <pb break="no"
