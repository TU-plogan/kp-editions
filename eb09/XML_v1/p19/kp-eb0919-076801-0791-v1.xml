                <p>HE mathematical theory of probability is a science which aims at reducing to
                    calculation, where possible, the amount of credence due to propositions or
                    statements, or to the occurrence of events, future or past, more especially as
                    contingent or dependent upon other propositions or events the probability of
                    which is known.</p>
                <p>Any statement or (supposed) fact commands a certain amount of credence, varying
                    from zero, which means conviction of its falsity, to absolute certainty, denoted
                    by unity. An even chance, or the probability of an event which is as likely as
                    not to happen, is represented by the fraction ⅜. It is to be observed that ∣
                    will be the probability of an event about which we have no knowledge whatever,
                    because if we can see that it is more likely to happen than not, or less likely
                    than not, we must be in possession of some information respecting it. It has
                    been proposed to form a sort of thermometrical scale, to which to refer the
                    strength of the conviction we have in any given case. Thus if the twenty-six
                    letters of the alphabet have been shaken together in a bag, and one letter be
                    drawn, we feel a very feeble expectation that A has been the one taken. If two
                    letters be drawn, we have still very little confidence that A is one of them; if
                    three be drawn, it is somewhat stronger; and so on, till at last, if twenty-six
                    be drawn, we are certain of the event, that is, of A having been taken.</p>
                <p>Probability, which necessarily implies uncertainty, is a consequence of our
                    ignorance. To an omniscient Being there can be none. Why, for instance, if we
                    throw up a shilling, are we uncertain whether it will turn up head or tail?
                    Because the shilling passes, in the interval, through a series of states which
                    our knowledge is unable to predict or to follow. If we knew the exact position
                    and state of motion of the coin as it leaves our hand, the exact value of the
                    final impulse it receives, the laws of its motion as affected by the resistance
                    of the air and gravity, and finally the nature of the ground at the exact spot
                    where it falls, and the laws regulating the collision between the two
                    substances, we could predict as certainly the result of the toss as we can which
                    letter of the alphabet will be drawn after twenty-five have been taken and
                    examined.</p>
                <p>The probability, or amount of conviction accorded to any fact or statement, is
                    thus essentially subjective, and varies with the degree of knowledge of the mind
                    to which the fact is presented (it is often indeed also influenced by passion
                    and prejudice, which act powerfully in warping the judgment),—so that, as
                    Laplace observes, it is affected partly by our ignorance partly by our
                    knowledge. Thus, if the question were put, Is lead heavier than silver? some
                    persons would think it is, but would not be surprised if they were wrong; others
                    would say it is lighter; while to a worker in metals probability would be
                    superseded by certainty. Again, to take Laplace’s illustration, there are three
                    urns A, B, C, one of which contains black balls, the other two white balls; a
                    ball is drawn from the urn C, and we want to know the probability that it shall
                    be black. If we do not know which of the urns contains the black balls, there is
                    only one favourable chance out of three, and the probability is said to be ⅜.
                    But if a person knows that the urn A contains white balls, to him the
                    uncertainty is confined to the urns B and C, and therefore the probability of
                    the same event is ∣. Finally to one who had found that A and B both contained
                    white balls, the probability is converted into certainty.</p>
                <p>In common language, an event is usually said to be likely or probable if it is
                    more likely to happen than not, or when, in mathematical language, its
                    probability exceeds ⅜; and it is said to be improbable or unlikely when its
                    probability is less than j. Not that this sense is always adhered to; for, in
                    such a phrase as “It is likely to thunder to-day,” we do not mean that is more
                    likely than not, but that in our opinion the chance of thunder is greater than
                    usual; again, “Such a horse is likely to win the Derby,” simply means that he
                    has the best chance, though according to the betting that chance may be only ⅜.
                    Such unsteady and elliptical employment of words has of course to be abandoned
                    and replaced by strict definition, at least mentally, when they are made the
                    subjects of mathematical analysis. <hi rend="italic">Certainty,</hi> or absolute
                    conviction, also, as generally understood, is different from the mathematical
                    sense of the word certainty. It is very difficult and often impossible, as is
                    pointed out in the celebrated <hi rend="italic">Grammar of Assent,</hi> to draw
                    out the grounds on which the human mind in each case yields that conviction, or
                    assent, which, according to Newman, admits of no degrees, and either is entire

                    the force of the mental conviction, from moral or practical certainty. It is
                    questionable whether the former kind of certainty is not entirely hypothetical,
                    and whether it is ever attainable in any of the affairs or events of the real
                    world around us. The truth of no conclusion can rise above that of the premises,
                    of no theorem above that of the data. That two and two make four is an
                    incontrovertible truth; but before applying even it to a concrete instance we
                    have to be assured that there were really two in each constituent group; and we
                    can hardly have mathematical certainty of this, as the strange freaks of memory,
                    the tricks of conjurors, &amp;c., have often made apparent.</p>
                <p>There is no more remarkable feature in the mathematical theory of probability
                    than the manner in which it has been found to harmonize with, and justify, the
                    conclusions to which mankind have been led, not by reasoning, but by instinct
                    and experience, both of the individual and of the race. At the same time it has
                    corrected, extended, and invested them with a definiteness and precision of
                    which these crude, though sound, appreciations of common sense were till then
                    devoid. Even in cases where the theoretical result appears to differ from the
                    common-sense view, it often happens that the latter may, though perhaps unknown
                    to the mind itself, have taken account of circumstances in the case omitted in

                <p>theoretical problem. Thus, it may be that a person accords a lower degree of
                    credence to a fact attested by two or more independent witnesses than theory
                    warrants,—the reason being that he has unconsciously recognized the possibility
                    of collusion, which had not been presented among the data. Again, it appears
                    from the rules for the credibility of testimony that the probability of a fact
                    may be <hi rend="italic">diminished</hi> by being attested by a new witness,
                    viz., in the case where his credibility is less than ∣. This is certainly at
                    variance with our natural impression, which is that our previous conviction of
                    any fact is clearly not weakened, however little it be intensified, by any fresh
                    evidence, however suspicious, as to its truth. But on reflexion we see that it
                    is a practical absurdity to suppose the credibility of any witness less than
                    ∣—that is, that he speaks falsehood oftener than truth—for all men tell the
                    truth probably nine times out of ten, and only deviate from it when their
                    passions or interests are concerned. Even where his interests are at stake, no
                    man has any preference for a lie, as such, above the truth; so that his
                    testimony to a fact will at worst leave the antecedent probability exactly what
                    it was.</p>
                <p>A celebrated instance of the confirmation and completion by theory of the
                    ordinary view is afforded by what is known as James Bernoulli’s theorem. If we
                    know the odds in favour of an event to be three to two, as for instance that of
                    drawing a white ball from a bag containing three white and two black, we should
                    certainly judge that if we make five trials we are more likely to draw white
                    three times and black twice than any other combination. Still, however, we
                    should feel that this was very uncertain; instead of three white, we might draw
                    white 0, 1, 2, 4, or 5 times. But if we make say one thousand trials, we should
                    feel confident that, although the numbers of white and black might not be in the
                    proportion of three to two, they would be very nearly in that proportion. And
                    the more the trials are multiplied the more closely would this proportion be
                    found to obtain. This is the principle upon which we are continually judging of
                    the possibility of events from what is observed in a certain number of
                    cases.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>So it is said,
                    “the tree is known by its fruits”; “practice is better than theory”; and the
                    universal sense of mankind judges that the safest test of any new invention,
                    system, or institution is to see how it works. So little are we able by <hi
                    rend="italic">a priori</hi> speculations to forecast the thousand obstacles and
                    disturbing influences which manifest themselves when any new cause or agent is
                    introduced as a factor in the world’s affairs.</p></note> Thus if, out of ten
                    particular infants, six are found to live to the age of twenty, we judge, but
                    with a very low amount of conviction, that nearly six-ten ths of the whole
                    number born live to twenty. But if, out of 1,000,000 cases, we find that 600,000
                    live to be twenty, we should feel certain that the same proportion would be
                    found to hold almost exactly were it possible to test the whole number of cases,
                    say in England during the 19th century. In fact we may say, considering how
                    seldom we know <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> the probability of any event,
                    that the knowledge we have of such probability in any case is entirely derived
                    from this principle, viz., that the proportion which holds in a large number of
                    trials will be found to hold in the total number, even when this may be
                    infinite, —the deviation or error being less and less as the trials are
                    multiplied.</p>
                <p>Such no doubt is the verdict of the common sense of mankind, and it is not easy
                    to say upon what considerations it is based, if it be not the effect of the
                    unconscious habit which all men acquire of weighing chances and probabilities,
                    in the state of ignorance and uncertainty which human life is. It is now
                    extremely interesting to see the results of the unerring methods of mathematical
                    analysis when applied to the same problem. It is a very difficult one, and James
                    Bernoulli tells us he reflected upon it for twenty years. His methods, extended
                    by De Moivre and Laplace, fully confirm the conclusions of rough common sense;
                    but they have done much more. They enable us to estimate exactly how far we can
                    rely on the proportion of cases in a large number of trials, truly representing
                    the proportion out of the total number—that is, the real probability of the
                    event. Thus he proves that if, as in the case above mentioned, the real
                    probability of an event is ∣, the odds are 1000 to 1 that, in 25,550 trials, the
                    event shall occur not more than 15,841 timesand not less than 14,819 times,—that
                    is, that the deviation from 15,330, or ⅛ of the whole, shall not exceed - <hi

                    of mathematics, the only one, apparently, lying quite outside the field of
                    physical science. De Moivre has remarked that, “some of the problems about
                    chance having a great appearance of simplicity, the mind is easily drawn into a
                    belief that their solution may be attained by the mere strength of natural good
                    sense”; and it is with surprise we find that they involve in many cases the most
                    subtle and difficult mathematical questions. It has been found to tax to the

                <p>From its earliest beginnings, a notable feature in our subject has been the
                    strange and insidious manner in which errors creep in—often misleading the most
                    acute minds, as in the case of D’Alembert—and the difficulty of detecting them,
                    even when one is assured of their presence by the evident incorrectness of the
                    result. This is probably in many cases occasioned by the poverty of language
                    obliging us to use one term in the same context for different things—thus
                    introducing the fallacy of ambiguous middle; <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the
                    same word “probability” referring to the same event may sometimes mean its
                    probability <hi rend="italic">before</hi> a certain occurrence, sometimes <hi
                    rend="italic">after</hi>; thus the chance of a horse winning the Derby is
                    different after the Two Thousand from what it was before. Again, it may mean the
                    probability of the event according to one source of information, as
                    distinguished from its probability taking everything into account <hi
                    rend="italic">; for</hi> instance, an astronomer thinks he can notice in a
                    newly-discovered planet a rotation from east to west; the probability that this
                    is the case is of course that of his observations in like cases turning out
                    correct, if we had no other source of information; but the actual probability is
                    less, because we know that at least the vast majority of the planets and
                    satellites revolve from west to east. It is easy to see that such employment of
                    terms in the same context must prove a fruitful source of fallacies; and yet,
                    without wearisome repetitions, it cannot always be avoided. But, apart from mere
                    logical errors, the main stumbling-block is no doubt the uncertainty as to the
                    limits of our knowledge in each case, or—though this may seem a contradiction in
                    terms— the difficulty of knowing what we do know; and we certainly err as often
                    in forgetting or ignoring what we do know, as in assuming what we do not. It is
                    a not uncommon popular delusion to suppose that if a coin has turned up head,
                    say five times running, or the red has won five times at roulette, the same
                    event is likely to occur a sixth time; and it arises from overlooking (perhaps
                    from the imagination being struck by the singularity of the occurrence) the <hi
                    rend="italic">a priori</hi> knowledge we possess, that the chance at any trial
                    is an even one (supposing all perfectly fair); the mind thus unconsciously
                    regards the event simply as one that has recurred five times, and therefore
                    judges, correctly, that it is very likely to occur once more. Thus if we are
                    given a bag containing a number of balls, and we proceed to draw them one by
                    one, and the first five drawn are white, the odds are 6 to 1 that the next will
                    be white,—the slight'information afforded by the five trials being thus of great
                    importance, and strongly influencing the probabilities of the future, when it is
                    all we have to guide us, but absolutely valueless, and without influence on the
                    future, when we have <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> certain information. The
                    lightest air will move a ship which is adrift, but has simply no effect on one
                    securely moored.</p>
                <p>It is not to be supposed that the results arrived at when the calculus of
                    probabilities is applied to most practical questions are anything more than
                    approximations; but the same may be said of almost all such applications of
                    abstract science. Partly from ignorance of the real state of the case, partly
                    from the extreme intricacy of the calculations requisite if all the conditions
                    which we do or might know are introduced, we are obliged to substitute in fact,
                    for the actual problem, a simpler one approximately representing it. Thus, in
                    mechanical questions, assumptions such as that the centre of gravity of an
                    actual sphere is at its centre, that the friction of the rails on a railway is
                    constant at different spots or at different times, or that in the rolling of a
                    heavy body no depression is produced by its weight in the supporting substance,
                    are instances of the convenient fictions which simplify the real question, while
                    they prevent us accepting the result as more than something near the truth. So
                    in probability, the chance of life of an individual is taken from the general
                    tables (unless reasons to the contrary are very palpable) although, if his past
                    history, his mode of life, the longevity of his family, àc., were duly weighed,
                    the general value ought to be modified in his case; again, in attempting to
                    estimate the value of the verdict of a jury, whether unanimous or by a majority,
                    each man is supposed to give his honest opinion,—feeling and prejudice, or
                    pressure from his fellow-jurors, being left out of' the account. Again, the
                    value of an <hi rend="italic">expectation</hi> to an individual is taken to be
                    measured by the sum divided by his present fortune, though it is clearly
                    affected by other circumstances, as the number of his family, the nature of his
                    business, &amp;c. An event has been found to occur on an average once a year
                    during a long period: it is not difficult to show that the chance of its
                    happening in a particular year is 1 - e^ <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>, or 2 to
                    1 nearly. But, on examining the record, we observe it has never failed to occur
                    during three years running. This fact increases the above chance; but to
                    introduce it into the calculation at once renders the question a very difficult
                    one. Even in games of chance we are obliged to judge of the relative skill of
                    two players by the result of a few games; now one may not have been in his usual
                    health, &amp;c., or may have designedly not played his best; when he did win he
                    may have done so by superior play, or rather by good luck; again, even in so
                    simple a case as pitch and toss, the coin may, in the concrete, not be quite
                    symmetrical, and the odds of head or tail not quite even.</p>
                <p>Not much has been added to our subject since the close of Laplace’s career. The
                    history of science records more than one parallel to this abatement of activity.
                    When such a genius has departed, the field of his labours seems exhausted for
                    the time, and little left to be gleaned by his successors. It is to be regretted
                    that so little remains to us of the inner working of such gifted minds, and of
                    the clue by which each of their discoveries was reached. The didactic and
                    synthetic form in which these are presented to the world retains but faint
                    traces of the skilful inductions, the keen and delicate perception of fitness
                    and analogy, and the power of imagination—though such a term may possibly excite
                    a smile when applied to such <hi rend="italic">dry</hi> subjects—which have
                    doubtless guided such a master as Laplace or Newton in shaping out each great
                    design— only the minor details of which have remained over, to be supplied by
                    the less cunning hand of commentator and disciple.</p>
                <p>We proceed to enumerate the principal divisions of the theory of probability and
                    its applications. Under each we will endeavour to give at least one or two of
                    the more remarkable and suggestive questions which belong to it,— especially
                    such as admit of simplification or improvement in the received solutions; in
                    such an article as the present we are debarred from attempting even an outline
                    of the whole. We will suppose the general fundamental principles to be already
                    known to the reader, as they are to be now found in several elementary works,
                    such as Todhunter’s <hi rend="italic">Algebra,</hi> Whitworth’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Choice and Chance,</hi> &lt;tc.</p>
                <p>Many of the most important results are given under the apparently trifling form
                    of the chances in drawing balls from an urn, &lt;fcc., or seem to relate to
                    games of chance, as dice or cards, but are in reality of far wider application,—
                    this form being adopted as the most definite and lucid manner of presenting the
                    chances of events occurring under circumstances which may be assimilated, more
                    or less closely, to such cases.</p>

                    when the Probabilities of the Simple Events on which</hi> THEY DEPEND ARE
                    KNOWN.</p>
                <p>1. Under this head come a very large and diversified range of questions; a very
                    few of the most important are all that we can give. One great class relates to
                    the fulfilment of given conditions in repeated trials as to the same event,
                    knowing the probability of what will happen in each trial.</p>
                <p>2. Let there be an event which must turn out in one of two ways, W and B (as in
                    drawing a ball from an urn containing white and black balls only); let the
                    respective probabilities for each trial be <hi rend="italic">p, q</hi>; so that
                    <hi rend="italic">p + q=Λ.</hi> Lettwo trials be made: the four possible cases
                    which may arise are</p>
                <p>WW, WB, BW, BB.</p>
                <p>The probability of the first is <hi rend="italic">p</hi><hi rend="italic

                    of a white and a black in any order is <hi rend="italic">2pq.</hi></p>
                <p>Suppose now <hi rend="italic">n</hi> trials to be made. The probability of W

                <p>3. As an example, let A and B be two players whose respective chances of winning
                    one game are <hi rend="italic">p</hi> and <hi rend="italic">q</hi>; to find the

                <p>The chance of A winning the first <hi rend="italic">m</hi> games is <hi
                    rend="italic">p</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> m</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    then win the (™ + l)th; otherwise we should be including the first case. Again,

                <p>Thus, if A’s skill be double that of B, the chance that A wins 112 131</p>
                <p>four games before B wins two is · That of B winning is .</p>
                <p>If A and B agree to leave off playing before the match is decided, the stakes
                    ought clearly to be divided between them in proportion to their respective
                    probabilities of winning, as given above,—putting for <hi rend="italic">m</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">n</hi> the numbers of games required to be won, at any
                    given point of the match, by A and B respectively.</p>
                <p>This was one of the questions proposed to Pascal by the Chevalier de Mere in the
                    year 1654.</p>
                <p>4. In the expansion (1) it may be asked which combination of the events W, B is
                    most likely to occur in the <hi rend="italic">n</hi> trials. As the ratio of the
                    2d term to the 1st is <hi rend="italic">n -,</hi> of the 3d to the 2d <hi
                    rend="superscript"> n</hi> ~ - -, <hi rend="italic">p</hi> 2 <hi rend="italic"
                    >p'</hi> and of the (r + l)th to the rth -—so long as this ratio <hi
                    rend="italic">τ p</hi> continues to increase the terms will increase. The
                    condition, therefore, for the rth teπn to be the greatest is n-r+1 <hi
                    rend="italic">^p . ,.</hi></p>
                <p>—~ <hi rend="subscript"> r</hi> — &lt;f; <hi rend="superscript"> or</hi> ’&gt;
                    («+l)s <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> i that is, <hi rend="italic">r</hi> is the
                    next integer above (n + l)g ’.</p>
                <p>We conclude that if <hi rend="italic">r</hi> is the next integer below (n + l)g ’
                    the <hi rend="italic">(r</hi> + l)th term is.the greatest—that is, it is most
                    likely that the event Μ occurs <hi rend="italic">n — r</hi> times and B <hi
                    rend="italic">r</hi> times. If <hi rend="italic">(n + V)q</hi> should be an
                    integer (r), B is as likely to occur <hi rend="italic">r</hi> as r + 1 times;
                    and either is more probable than any other number. Thus, in twelve throws of a
                    die, the ace is more likely to turn up twice than any other number; while in
                    eleven throws it is as likely to turn up once only as twice.</p>
                <p>It is important to remark that, if the number of trials <hi rend="italic">n</hi>
                    be very large, we may treat <hi rend="italic">qn and pn</hi> as whole numbers,
                    and conclude that the event W is more likely to happen <hi rend="italic">pn</hi>
                    times and B <hi rend="italic">qn</hi> times than in any other proportion.</p>
                <p>5. Among the many questions which relate to the occurrence of different
                    combinations in successive trials as to the same event, one is as to the chances
                    for a succession, or run, of the same result several times.</p>
                <p>Let us consider the very simple case—In <hi rend="italic">n</hi> throws of a
                    coin, what is the chance that head occurs (at least) twice running?</p>
                <p>This will be an instance of the aid afforded by the calculus of finite
                    differences in questions on probability. Let w <hi rend="subscript"> r</hi> =
                    the number of cases of <hi rend="italic">r</hi> throws of a coin in which head
                    turns up twice running, the whole number of cases being of course 2 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> r</hi>. Now if we consider the value of ‰ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> +3</hi>, it includes <hi rend="italic">2u</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> n</hi><hi rend="italic">+2,</hi> because the (n + 3)th throw may
                    turn up two ways; but it includes also those cases when head turns up in the
                    last two throws, tail in the preceding one, and no run of two heads occurs in
                    the <hi rend="italic">n</hi> preceding ones. The number of these cases is 2 <hi

                    equivalent to it, especially as the result is not a simple one (see Todhunter,

                    —as in 1000 tosses of a coin, or 1000 drawings from an urn containing one white
                    and one black ball, replacing the ball each time,—or again in drawing 1000 balls
                    together from an urn containing a great number of black and white in equal
                    proportion.</p>
                <p>As <hi rend="italic">p=q=⅛,</hi> we find from formula (8) that the chance of
                    exactly half the entire number drawn, viz., 500, being white is</p>
                <p>T= <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>. = 02523;</p>
                <p>√500π</p>

                <p>If then we take the central ordinate to represent T on any scale, and arrange

                    of that number, we have a graphical diagram of the relative possibilities of all
                    possible proportions of black and white in the result.</p>
                <p>We see from it that all values of the number of white balls drawn less than 450,
                    or greater than 550, may be considered impossible, the probabilities for them
                    being excessively small.</p>
                <p>The probability of the number of white balls falling between any two assigned
                    limits, as 490 and 520, is found by measuring the area of the figure comprised
                    between the two ordinates opposite those numbers, and dividing the result by the
                    total area.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="smallcaps">Probability of Future Events Deduced from
                    Experience.</hi></p>
                <p>13. In our ignorance of the causes which influence future events, the cases are
                    rare in which we know <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> the chance, or “facility,”
                    of the occurrence of any given event, as we do, for instance, that of a coin
                    turning up head when tossed. In other cases we have to judge of the chances of
                    it happening from experience alone. We could not say what is the chance that
                    snow will fall in the month of March next from our knowledge of meteorology, but
                    have to go back to the recorded facts. In walking down a certain street at 5
                    o’clock on three different days, I have twice met a certain individual, and wish
                    to estimate from these data the likelihood of again meeting him under the same
                    circumstances—in ignorance of the real state of things, viz., that he lives in
                    that street, and returns from his business at that hour. Such is nearly the
                    position in which we stand as to the probabilities of the future in the majority
                    of cases.</p>
                <p>We have to judge then, from certain recorded facts, of the probability of the
                    causes which have occasioned them, and thence to deduce the probabilities of
                    future events occurring under the operation of the same causes. The term “cause”
                    is not here used in its metaphysical sense, but as simply equivalent to
                    “antecedent state of things.”</p>
                <p>Let us suppose two urns, A containing two white balls, B containing one white and
                    one black ball, and that a person not knowing which is which has drawn a white
                    ball from one, to find the probability that this is the urn A. This is in fact
                    to find, supposing a great number of such drawings to be made, what proportion
                    of them have come from the urn A. If a great number N of drawings are made
                    indiscriminately from both urns, ⅜N come from the urn A and are all white, ∣ N
                    white come from the urn B, and ∣N black. The drawing actually made is either one
                    of the ⅜N white from A, or of the ∣N white from B. As it is equally likely to
                    have been any one of these, the chance that it came from A is ⅜ N ÷ ∣ N, or
                    ∣.</p>
                <p>Suppose there had been two urns A and three ums B, and a white ball has been
                    drawn from one of the five; as in a great number N of drawings ⅝N come from A
                    and are white, ⅜N from B and ⅜ of them are white, the chance that it came from
                    one of the urns A is</p>
                <p>⅝÷(⅜+⅜4)-f∙</p>
                <p>In general suppose an event to have occurred which must have been preceded by one

                    so on. As the event has happened, the actual case is one out of the number</p>

                <p>Supposing the event to have occurred as above, we now see how the probability as
                    to the future, viz., whether the event will happen or fail in a fresh trial, is
                    affected by it. If the first cause exists, the chance that it will happen is <hi
                    rend="italic">p</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 1</hi>; hence the chance of its
                    happening from the first cause is ^ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> 1r <hi

                <p>14. To give a simple example: suppose an um to contain three balls which are
                    white or black; one is drawn and found to be white. It is replaced in the urn
                    and a fresh drawing made; find the chance that the ball drawn is white. There
                    are three hypotheses, which are taken to be equally probable <hi rend="italic">a
                    priori,</hi> viz., the urn contains three white, two white, or one white,—that
                    of none white being now impossible. The probability after the event of the first
                    is by (12)</p>
                <p>⅜+H∏Γ* <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> that of the second is ⅛, that of the third
                    ⅜.</p>
                <p>Hence the chance of the new drawing giving a white ball is</p>
                <p>⅜ + ∣∙⅛ + ⅛∙⅛ = l∙</p>
                <p>15. The calculations required in the application of formulas (12) and (13) are
                    often tedious, and such questions may often be solved in a simpler manner. Let
                    us consider the following</p>
                <p>An urn contains <hi rend="italic">n</hi> black or white balls. A ball is drawn
                    and replaced; if this has been done <hi rend="italic">r</hi> times, and in every
                    case a white ball has appeared, to find the chance that the (r + l)th drawing
                    will give a white ball.</p>
                <p>If <hi rend="italic">s</hi> drawings are made successively from an um containing
                    <hi rend="italic">n</hi> balls, always replacing the ball drawn, the number of
                    different ways this may be done is clearly <hi rend="italic">n</hi><hi

                <p>If there be <hi rend="italic">n</hi> +1 such urns, one with 0 white balls, one
                    with 1 white, one with 2 white, &amp;c., the last with <hi rend="italic">n</hi>
                    white, the whole number of ways in which <hi rend="italic">r</hi> drawings can
                    be made from any one of them is (n+l)n <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi>.</p>
                <p>Now the number of ways in which <hi rend="italic">r</hi> drawings, <hi

                    rend="superscript"> r</hi>, and so on; so that the whole number of ways in which

                <p>If now a great number N of trials of <hi rend="italic">r</hi> drawings be made
                    from such urns, the number of cases where all are white is p <hi

                <p>16. Let us consider the same question <hi rend="italic">when the ball is not
                    replaced.</hi> First suppose the <hi rend="italic">n</hi> balls arranged in a
                    row from À to B as below, the white on the left, the black on the right, the
                    arrow marking the point of separation, which point is unknown (as it would be to
                    a blind man), and is equally likely to be in any of its π + l possible
                    positions.</p>
                <p>A ι a B</p>
                <p>OOOOOOOOOOO.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Î</hi></p>
                <p>Now if two balls, 1 and 2, are selected at random, the chance that both are white
                    is the chance of the arrow falling in the division 2B of the row. But this
                    chance is the same as that of a third ball 3 (different from 1 and 2), chosen at
                    random, falling in 2B,— which chance is ⅜, because it is equally probable that
                    1, 2, or 3 shall be the last in order. It is easy to see that these chances are
                    the same if we reflect that, the ball 3 being equally likely to fall in Al, 12,
                    or 2B, the number of possible positions for the arrow in each division always
                    exceeds by 1 the number of positions for 3; therefore as 3 is equally likely to
                    fall in any of the three divisions, so is the arrow.</p>
                <p>The chance that two balls drawn at random shall both be white is thus ⅜; in the
                    same way that for three balls is ⅛, and so on. Hence the chance that <hi
                    rend="italic">r</hi> balls drawn shall all be white is</p>
                <p>1^ <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> " ’ r+l ’the same chance for <hi rend="italic"
                    >r</hi> +1 balls is</p>
                <p>^ <hi rend="superscript"> r+1</hi> ~r+2 ’</p>
                <p>thus, as in a large number N of trials the number of cases where the first <hi
                    rend="italic">r</hi> drawn are white is 7&gt; <hi rend="subscript"> r</hi> N,
                    and the number where the first <hi rend="italic">r</hi> +1 are white is 2⅛+ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> N, we have the result :—</p>
                <p>If <hi rend="italic">r</hi> balls are drawn and all prove to be white, the chance
                    that the next drawn shall also be white is</p>

                    rend="italic subscript"> r</hi><hi rend="italic">r + 2'</hi></p>
                <p>This result is thus independent of <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> the whole number of
                    balls. This result applies to repeated trials as to any event, provided we have
                    really no <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> knowledge as to the chance of success
                    or failure on one trial, so that all values for this chance are equally likely
                    before the trial or trials. Thus, if we see a stranger hit a mark four times
                    running, the chance he does so again is ⅜; or, if a person, knowing nothing of
                    the water where he is fishing, draws up a fish each time in four casts of his
                    line, the same is the chance of his succeeding a fifth time. <hi

                <p>In cases where we know, or rather think we know, the facility as to a single
                    trial, if the result of a number of trials gives a large difference in the
                    proportion of successes to failures from what we should anticipate, this will
                    afford an appreciable presumption that our assumption as to the facility was
                    erroneous, as indeed common sense indicates. If a coin turns up head twenty
                    times running, we should say the two faces are probably not alike, or that it
                    was not thrown fairly. We shall see later on, when we come to treat of the
                    combination of separate probabilities as to the same event, the method of
                    dealing with such cases (see art. 39).</p>
                <p>We will give another example which may be easily solved by means of (12), or by
                    the simpler process below.</p>
                <p>There are <hi rend="italic">n</hi> horses in a race, about which I have no
                    knowledge except that one of the horses A is black; as to the result of the race
                    I have only the information that a black horse has certainly won: to find the
                    chance that this was A—supposing the proportion of black among racehorses in

                <p>Suppose a large number N of trials made as to such a case. A wins in —N of these.

                <p>17. We now proceed to consider the important theorem of Bayes (see Todhunter, p.
                    294; Laplace, <hi rend="italic">Théorie Analytique</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >des</hi><hi rend="italic">Prob.,</hi> chap. 6), the object of which is to
                    deduce from the experience of a given number of trials, as to an event which
                    must happen or fail on each trial, the information thus afforded as to the real
                    facility of the event in any one trial, which facility is identical with the
                    proportion of successes out of an infinite number of trials, were it possible to
                    make them.</p>
                <p>Thus we find in the Carlisle Table of Mortality that of 5642 persons aged thirty
                    1245 died before reaching fifty; it becomes then a question how far we can rely
                    on the real facility of the event, that is, the proportion of mankind aged
                    thirty who die before fifty not differing from the ratio ⅜⅜⅜⅞ by more than given
                    limits of excess or defect. Again, it may be asked, if 5642 (or any other number
                    of) fresh trials be made, what is the probability that the number of deaths
                    shall not differ from 1245 by more than a given deviation?</p>
                <p>The question is equivalent to the following :—An urn contains a very great number
                    of black and white balls, the proportion of each being unknown; if, on drawing
                    <hi rend="italic">m+n</hi> balls, <hi rend="italic">m</hi> are found white and
                    <hi rend="italic">n</hi> black, to find the probability that the proportion of
                    the numbers in the urn of each colour lies between given limits.</p>
                <p>The question will not be altered if we suppose all the balls ranged in a line AB
                    (fig. 2), the white ones on the left, the black on the right, the point X where
                    they meet being unknown and all positions for it in AB being <hi rend="italic">a
                    priori</hi> equally probable. Then, <hi rend="italic">m + n</hi> points having
                    been chosen at random in AB, <hi rend="italic">m</hi> are found to fall on AX,
                    <hi rend="italic">n</hi> on XB. That is, all we know of X is that it is the (τn
                    + l)th in order beginning from A of τn + τι + l points chosen at random in AB.
                    If we put AB = 1, AX=ae, the number of cases when the point X falls on the
                    element <hi rend="italic">dx,</hi> is measured by <hi rend="italic">lm+n</hi>,

                    is that the antecedent probabilities of the different hypotheses are not equal.
                    Tims, let α shilling have turned up head once; to find the chance of its doing
                    so a second time. In formula (12) three hypotheses may be made as to a double

                    after the event Is ⅛÷(i+l · ⅛)=}; that of the second is also 1; and by (13) the

                    because, if hypothesis 2* is the true one, the second trial must fail.</p>

                    <hi rend="italic">m+n+1</hi> points taken on it (including X). Now if one more

                    is equally likely to fall in any section; and <hi rend="italic">m</hi> +1
                    sections are favourable.</p>
                <p>19. When the number of trials <hi rend="italic">m + n</hi> in art. 17 is large,
                    the probability is considerable that the facility of the event on a single trial

                <p>We must refer to the sixth chapter of Laplace for the investigation of how far
                    the number of successes in a given number of fresh trials may be expected to
                    deviate from the natural proportion, viz., that of the observed cases—as also
                    for several closely allied questions, with important applications to
                    statistics.</p>
                <p>III. <hi rend="smallcaps">On</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Expectation.</hi></p>
                <p>20. The value of a given chance of obtaining a given sum of money is the chance
                    multiplied by that sum; for in a great number of trials this would give the sum
                    actually realized. The same may be said as to loss. Thus if it is 2 to 1 that a
                    horse will win a race, it is considered a fair wager to lay £10 to £20 on the
                    result; for the value of the expected gain is j of 10, and that of the expected
                    loss ⅜ of 20, which are equal. Thus, if the probabilities for and against an
                    event are <hi rend="italic">p, q,</hi> and I arrange in any way to gain a sum
                    <hi rend="italic">a</hi> if it happens and lose a sum <hi rend="italic">b</hi>
                    if it fails, then if <hi rend="italic">pa≈qb</hi> I shall neither gain-nor lose
                    in the long run; but if the ratio <hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >:</hi><hi rend="italic">b</hi> be less than this, my expectation of loss
                    exceeds that of gain; or, in other words, I must lose in the long run.</p>
                <p>The above definition is what is called the <hi rend="italic">mathematical
                    expecta</hi><hi rend="italic">tion</hi>; but it clearly is not a proper measure
                    of the advantage or loss to the individual; for a poor man would undoubtedly
                    prefer £500 down to the chance of £1000 if a certain coin turns up head. The
                    importance of a sum of money to an individual, or its <hi rend="italic"
                    >moral</hi><hi rend="italic">value,</hi> as it has been called, depends on many
                    circumstances which it is impossible to take into account; but, roughly and
                    generally, there is no doubt that Daniel Bernoulli’s hypothesis, viz., that this
                    importance is measured by <hi rend="italic">the sum divided by the fortune of
                    the</hi><hi rend="italic">individual</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>This rule must be understood to hold only when the sum is
                    very small, or rather infinitesimal, strictly speaking. It would lead to
                    absurdities if it were used for large increments (though Buffon has done so; see
                    Todhunter, p. 345). Thus, to a man possessing £100, it is of the same importance
                    to receive a gift of £100 as two separate gifts of £50; but this rule would give
                    as the measure of the importance of the first ⅜gg=l; while in the other case, it
                    would give √⅞‰+ ,^⅛=g. The real measure of the importance of an increment when
                    not small is a matter for calculation, as shown in the text.</p></note> —is a
                    true and natural one. Thus, generally speaking, £5 is the same to a man with
                    £1000 as £50 to one with £10,000; and it may be observed that this principle is
                    very generally acted on, in taxation, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>21. To estimate, according to this hypothesis, the advantage or moral value of
                    his whole fortune to the individual, or his <hi rend="italic">moral</hi><hi

                    possible. Now his moral expectation from the first chance—that is, the increment

                    by the following instance. A merchant, whose fortune is represented by 1, will

                <p>The merchant will still gain by paying, over and above what covers the risk of

                    renders a real service to the public, while making a profit for itself. In this
                    it differs from a gambling establishment, in which case the public must lose, in

                <p>It may be shown that it is better to expose one’s fortune in separate sums to

                <p>IV. <hi rend="smallcaps">Probability of Testimony.</hi></p>
                <p>26. We have here to treat of the probability of events attested by several
                    witnesses of known credibility, or which have several different probabilities in
                    their favour, derived from different independent sources of information of any
                    kind, of known values.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>The question now before us is quite different from that of the chance of an
                    event happening or having happened whiclι may happen in different ways, in which
                    case we add the separate probabilities. Tims if there are but two horses in a
                    race, of equal merit and belonging to one owner, his chance of winning is i+}=l.
                    But suppose I only know that one of the two is his, and, besides, some one whose
                    credibility is ∣ tells me he has won the race; here I have two separate
                    probabilities of i each for the same event; but it would clearly be wrong to add
                    them together.</p></note></p>
                <p>A witness may fail in two ways: he may be intentionally dishonest, or he may be
                    mistaken; his evidence may be false, either because he wishes to deceive, or
                    because he is deceived himself. However, we will not here take separate account
                    of these two sources of error, but simply consider the probability of the truth
                    of a statement made by a witness, which will be a true measure of the value of
                    his evidence. To estimate this probability in any given case is not an easy
                    matter; but if we could examine a large number of statements made by a certain
                    person, and find in how many of them he was right, the ratio of these numbers
                    would give the probability that any statement of his, taken at random, whether
                    past or future, is a true one.</p>
                <p>27. Suppose a witness, whose credibility is <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> states that
                    a fact occurred or did not occur, or that an event turned out in one way, when
                    only two ways are possible. If nothing was known <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi>
                    as to the probability of the fact, or if its real facility was ⅜, it is clear
                    that the probability that it did occur is <hi rend="italic">p.</hi> For if a
                    great number N of trials were made (either really as to the event, if its
                    facility is known to be ⅜, as in tossing a coin; or as to it and other cases
                    resembling it as to our ignorance of the real facility, if such is the state of
                    things) in ⅜N the event happens, and out of these the witness asserts in ⅛N
                    cases that it did happen. Now, out of the whole number, he asserts in ⅜N cases
                    that it happened, as there is no reason for his affirming offener than he denies
                    (or, it may be said, he affirms in ⅜pN cases where it did happen, and in ⅛(1
                    -p)N cases where it did not). Hence, dividing the whole number of cases when it
                    happens and he affirms it by the whole number of cases where he affirms it, we
                    find ⅜pN÷⅜N <hi rend="italic">=p.</hi></p>
                <p>We have entered at length on the proof of what is almost self-evident (perhaps
                    indeed included in the definition) in this case, because the same method will
                    succeed in other cases which are not so easily to be discerned.</p>
                <p>28. Let us now consider the same question when the <hi rend="italic">a
                    priori</hi> probability of the fact or event is known. Suppose a bag contains
                    <hi rend="italic">n</hi> balls, one white and the rest black, and the same
                    witness says he has seen the white ball drawn; what is the chance that it was
                    drawn?</p>
                <p>A great number N of trials being made, the number in which the white ball is
                    drawn is — N, and out of these he states it in <hi rend="italic">n ’</hi> n^⅛N
                    cases. Out of the remaining (l-n^ <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>) N cases where
                    a black ball was drawn, he says (untruly) that in (1 <hi rend="italic">-p)</hi>
                    (1 -n^ <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>) N cases it was white.</p>
                <p>Now, dividing the number of favourable cases, viz., those where he says it is
                    white and it is so, by the whole number of cases, viz., those where he says it
                    is white, we have for the probability required <hi rend="italic subscript">
                    w</hi><hi rend="italic">=</hi><hi rend="italic">⅛</hi><hi rend="italic">_ p</hi>
                    (26).</p>
                <p>π^ <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> p + (l-n^ <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>)(l-
                    <hi rend="subscript"> j</hi> p) n-l-(n-2)p ' <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi></p>
                <p>This holds for any event whose « <hi rend="italic">priori</hi> probability is <hi
                    rend="italic">n^</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >.</hi></p>
                <p>If <hi rend="italic">n</hi> be very large, this probability will be very small,
                    unless <hi rend="italic">p</hi> is nearly =1; and, indeed, if we go back to the
                    common sense view, it is clear we should hesitate to believe a man who said he
                    had drawn the white ball from a bag containing 10,000 balls, all but it being
                    black. It may be observed that if <hi rend="italic">n=2, -≈r=p,</hi> as in art.
                    27.</p>
                <p>We have thus a scientific explanation of the universal tendency rather to reject
                    the evidence of a witness than to accept the truth of a fact attested by him,
                    when it is in itself of an extraordinary or very improbable nature.</p>
                <p>29. Two independent witnesses, A and B, both state a fact, or that an
                    event-turned out in a particular way (only two ways being possible), to find the
                    probability of the truth of the statement.</p>
                <p>Supposing nothing is known <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> as to the event in
                    question, let a great number N of trials be made as to such events; the number
                    of successes will be ⅜N; out of these the witness A affirms the success in ⅜pN
                    cases; out of these the witness B affirms it, too, in ⅜pτ&gt;'N cases.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Here we are assuming the
                    independence of the witnesses. If B, for instance, were disposed to follow A <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> s statements or to dissent from them, he would affirm
                    the success here in more or less than App'N cases.</p></note> Out of the ⅜N
                    failures A affirms a success in ⅜(1 -p)N cases; and out of these B also affirms
                    one in ⅜(1 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 7 <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>)(1
                    -∕)N cases. Hence, dividing the favourable cases by the whole number, the
                    probability sought is <hi rend="superscript"> W=</hi> BP' + (1 -Γ)(l-∕) ^ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2z</hi> ^ ’ where <hi rend="italic">p, p'</hi> are the
                    credibilities of the two witnesses.</p>
                <p>This very important result also holds if <hi rend="italic">p</hi> be the
                    probability of the event derived from any source, and <hi rend="italic">p'</hi>
                    the credibility of one witness, as in art. 28; or if <hi rend="italic">p</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">p'</hi> be any independent probabilities, derived from any
                    sources, as to one event.</p>
                <p>30. We give another method of establishing the formula (27). Referring to art.
                    13, the observed event is the concurrent evidence of A and B that a statement is
                    true. There are two <hi rend="italic">hypotheses</hi> —that it is true or false.
                    Antecedent to B’s evidence the probabilities of these hypotheses are <hi
                    rend="italic">p</hi> and 1 <hi rend="italic">-p</hi> (art. 27), as A has said
                    that it is true. The observed event now is that B says the same. On the first
                    hypothesis, the probability that he will say this is <hi rend="italic">p'</hi>;
                    on the second, it is 1 <hi rend="italic">-p'.</hi> Hence by formula (12) the
                    probability <hi rend="italic">a posteriori</hi> of the first hypothesis, viz.,
                    that the joint statement is true, is, as before, <hi rend="italic"> PP'</hi> pp'
                    + (l-^)(l-p') '</p>
                <p>31. If a third witness, whose credibility is p", concurs with the two former, we
                    shall have to combine <hi rend="italic">p"</hi> with w in formula (27); hence
                    the probability &amp;' of the statement when made by three witnesses is <hi
                    rend="italic">,</hi><hi rend="italic"> -≈p''</hi><hi rend="italic

                <p>As an example, let us find how many witnesses to a fact, the odds against which
                    are 1,000,000,000,000 to 1, would be required to make it an even chance that the
                    fact did occur, supposing the credibility of each witness to be <hi

                <p>so that thirteen such witnesses would render the chance more than an evejι
                    one.</p>
                <p>32. Let us now consider an event which may turn out in more than two ways, and
                    let each way be equally probable <hi rend="italic">a priori,</hi> and suppose a
                    witness whose credibility is <hi rend="italic">p</hi> states that it turned out
                    in a certain way; what is the chance that it did so?</p>
                <p>Thus if a die has been thrown, and he states that ace turned up; or if tickets in
                    a lottery are numbered 1, 2, 3, &amp;c., and he states that 1 was drawn; to find
                    the chance that he is right.</p>
                <p>Take the case of the die, and suppose a great number N of throws. In ⅜N the ace
                    turns up, and he says so in ⅛N cases. In ⅛N the two turns up, and he is wrong in
                    ⅛(1 -,p)N cases out of these; but he says ace in only ⅜ of these, as there is no
                    reason why he should give it more or less often than any of the five wrong
                    numbers. In the same way for the other throws; so that the whole number of cases
                    where he says ace turned up is</p>
                <p>⅛N + ⅜.∣(l- <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi>)N=⅜N5</p>
                <p>and, the number, out of these, when it actually turned up being ⅜T&gt;N, we find
                    <hi rend="italic">the chance it did turn up is p, the credibility of the
                    witness.</hi> In any such case, this result will hold. We might indeed safely
                    have argued that when the die is thrown a great number of times, any witness,
                    whatever his veracity, will quote each face as often as any other, as there is
                    no reason for one to turn up oftener than another, nor for him to affirm,
                    rightly or wrongly, one rather than another; so that he will say ace in ⅜N of
                    the throws, while he says ace in ⅛N out of the ⅜N cases where it does turn
                    up.</p>
                <p>This result compared with art. 28 affords an apparent paradox. If a large number
                    of tickets are marked 1,0,0,0,0,0 . . . . and a witness states that 1 has been
                    drawn from the bag, we see from art. 28 that the chance he is right is very
                    small; whereas if the tickets were marked 1,2,3,4,5,6 .... and he states that 1
                    has been drawn, the chance he is right is <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> his own
                    credibility. However, we must remember that in the first case he is limited to
                    two statements, 1 and,0, and he makes the first, which is very improbable in
                    itself; whereas in the other case, the assertion he makes is in itself as
                    probable as any other he can make— <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> that 2 was the
                    ticket drawn—and therefore our expectation of its truth depends on his own
                    credibility only.</p>
                <p>33. Suppose now that <hi rend="italic">two</hi> witnesses A, B both assert that
                    the event has turned out in a certain way,—there being, as in art. 32, <hi
                    rend="italic">n</hi> equally probable ways.</p>
                <p>Both, for instance, say that in a lottery numbered 1,2,3,4,5 .... No. 1 has been
                    drawn. A large number N of drawings being made, 1 is drawn inn <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -1</hi> N cases; out of these A says 1 in n^⅛N cases, and
                    out of these B also says 1 in <hi rend="italic">n-</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> r</hi><hi rend="italic">pp'N.</hi> No. 2 is drawn in n^ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> N cases; here A is wrong in n^ <hi rend="superscript"
                    > 1</hi> (l - jj)N, but says 1 in only (n-l)- <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> ∕i^
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> (l-p)N; and B will also say 1 in (l-y)(n-l)^ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> of these; that is, both agree that 1 has been drawn
                    in</p>
                <p>(n-l)^ <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> n <hi rend="superscript"> -1</hi>
                    (l-p)(l-p')N</p>
                <p>cases. So likewise if No. 3 has been drawn, and so on; hence, when No. 1 has not
                    been drawn, they both say that it has in n* <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>
                    (n-l)-i(l-p)(l-p')N</p>
                <p>cases. Hence the number of cases where they are right divided by the whole number
                    of cases where they make the statement, that is, the probability that No. 1 has
                    been drawn, is <hi rend="superscript"> w</hi> ^2&gt;p' + (n-1)- <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> (1 -p)(l <hi rend="italic">-p') · · · · (</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> 29</hi><hi rend="italic">)∙</hi></p>
                <p>If <hi rend="italic">n</hi> be a large number the chance that they have named the
                    ticket drawn is nearly certainty. Thus, if two independent witnesses both select
                    the same man out of a large number, as the one they have seen commit a crime,
                    the presumption is very strong against him. Of course, for the case to come
                    under the above formula, it is supposed that some one of the number must be
                    guilty.</p>
                <p>34. In the same case, when the event may turn out in <hi rend="italic">n</hi>
                    ways not equally probable, as in a race between <hi rend="italic">n</hi> horses
                    A, B, C . . . . whose chances of winning are <hi rend="italic">a,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">b,</hi><hi rend="italic">c . .</hi>. ., so that <hi rend="italic"

                    >p</hi> states that A has won, it is easily shown by the same reasoning as in
                    art. 33 that the probability A has really won is <hi rend="italic">ap</hi><hi

                    there are ten horses in a race, and that one of them, A, has a chance ⅛ of
                    winning, and that just after the race I learn that a black horse has won, black
                    being A’s colour; now, if I know that ⅜ of racehorses in general are black, this
                    gives me a new chance ⅛ (see art. 16) that A has won. Therefore from (30) the
                    chance of the event is now <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅛ = f.</p>

                <p>This result will also follow if we consider B’s evidence as testimony <hi

                <p>37. As remarked in art. 26, the methods we have given for determining the
                    probability of testimony apply to cases where the evidence is derived from other
                    sources. Thus, suppose it has been found that a certain symptom (A) indicates
                    the presence of a certain disease in three cases out of four, there is a
                    probability ∣ that any patient exhibiting the symptom has the disease. This,
                    however, must be considered in conjunction with the <hi rend="italic">a
                    priori</hi> probability of the presence of the disease, if we wish to know the
                    value of the evidence deduced from the symptom being observed. For instance, if
                    we knew that f of the whole population had the disease, the evidence would have
                    no value, and the credibility of the symptom <hi rend="italic">per se</hi> would
                    be ⅜, telling us nothing either way. For if <hi rend="italic">a</hi> be the <hi
                    rend="italic">a priori</hi> probability, <hi rend="italic">tτ</hi> that after
                    the evidence, <hi rend="italic">p</hi> the credibility of the evidence, we have
                    found <hi rend="italic"> ap</hi><hi rend="superscript"> v</hi> ~ αp + (l-α)(l-p)
                    ’</p>
                <p>so that, if w = α, ρ=⅜.</p>
                <p>If w and <hi rend="italic">a</hi> are given, the credibility <hi rend="italic"
                    >p</hi> of the evidence is deduced from this equation, viz.,</p>
                <p>(l-α)w <hi rend="italic">” a</hi> + w — 2aw ’</p>
                <p>38. Suppose now the probability of the disease when the symptom A occurs is w
                    (that is, it is observed that the disease exists in σN cases out of a large
                    number N where the symptom is found), and likewise the same probability when
                    another <hi rend="italic">independent</hi> symptom B occurs is <hi rend="italic"
                    >zr'.</hi> What is the probability of the disease where both symptoms occur?</p>
                <p>Let <hi rend="italic">a</hi> be the <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> probability
                    of the disease in all the cases; then the value of the evidence of B is, as
                    explained above, y-¾⅞* <hi rend="superscript"> z</hi>-&gt; <hi rend="italic">a +
                    ·or</hi>-2αw and this has to be combined with w, which is the probability of the
                    disease after A is observed. We find the probability (∏) required to be</p>
