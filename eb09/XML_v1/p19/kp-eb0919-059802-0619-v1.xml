                    Alexandrovich</hi></label> (1739-1791), Russian soldier and statesman, was born
                    in 1739 in the village of Domnovo, in the government of Smolensk. His father was
                    a poor nobleman of Polish extraction, but the family had been settled for some
                    time in Russia. Owing to the slender means of his parents, Potemkin’s first plan
                    seems to have been to devote himself to the church; but he did not show much
                    inclination for this profession, and eventually embraced the calling of a
                    soldier. His fortunes rose from the time when he assisted the empress Catherine
                    in her conspiracy against her husband on the memorable 10th of July 1762. On
                    this occasion, when Catherine rode through the ranks, Potemkin, perceiving that
                    she had no plume in her hat, offered her his own. Soon afterwards he became one
                    of the leading favourites and his rise was rapid. We first find him serving
                    under Marshal Roumantzoff against the Turks, but, after having spent some time
                    in the camp, he returned to St Petersburg, where he became more influential than
                    ever. From 1778 till his death the foreign policy of Russia was almost entirely
                    in his hands. By his agency the Crimea was annexed in 1783, the khan being
                    induced to put himself under Russian protection. In January 1787 the empress set
                    out with Potemkin to survey her new conquests. The description of this journey
                    and of the fantastic luxury which accompanied it has been often given, and need
                    not be recapitulated here. At Kherson Catherine was met by the emperor Joseph,
                    who had travelled from Austria for that purpose. She there passed under a
                    triumphal arch, on which was inscribed, in Greek letters, “The way to
                    Byzantium.” The empress went as far south as Bakhchisarai and Stari Krim, at
                    which point she turned back, reaching St Petersburg on the 22d of July. Soon
                    afterwards war was declared against Turkey and the siege of Otchakoff commenced
                    in July 1788. Here Potemkin acted as commander-in-chief, with 150,000 men at his
                    disposal, but it is difficult to say if he had any talent as a soldier, as many
                    able men, among others Souwaroff, served under him, and he was able to
                    appropriate the fruits of their labour and ability. According to some he showed
                    military genius, according to others he was entirely destitute of it. He is said
                    to have introduced some very useful changes in the dress and discipline of the
                    Russian armies. Otchakoff was taken in December 1788, with terrible slaughter on
                    both sides, and was followed by the victories of Souwaroff at Bender and Ismail,
                    the latter of which was taken in 1790, when Souwaroff sent his celebrated
                    couplet to Catherine:</p>
                <p>“Slava Bogu! Slava Vam!</p>
                <p>Krepost vsiata i ya tarn.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Gloιy to God! glory to you!</p><p>The fortress is taken and I am
                    there.</p></note></p>
                <p>In March 1791 Potemkin made his triumphal entry into St Petersburg. The
                    description of the banquet which he gave in honour of the empress at his Taurian
                    palace rivals any scene of Oriental magnificence. But his constitution was now
                    breaking; his body at a comparatively early age was worn out by his labours and
                    excesses. Yet he refused to have recourse to medicine, lived upon salt meat and
                    raw turnips, and drank strong wines and spirits. In the latter part of the year
                    1791 he went to the south of Russia, the scene of his former triumphs, and lay
                    ill for some time at Jassy, whence he attempted to move to Otchakoff, but after
                    travelling a few versts he could no longer endure the motion of the carriage. He
                    accordingly was lifted out and a carpet was spread for him at the foot of a
                    tree, upon which he soon expired in the arms of his niece, Countess Branicka, on
                    the 15th of October 1791. His body was interred at Kherson, but, from inquiries
                    made on the spot by the traveller Edward Clarke at the commencement of the
                    present century, it seems to have been disinterred and thrown into a ditch by
                    order of the emperor Paul, who hated him.</p>
                <p>During his lifetime Potemkin did not escape the censure of his countrymen, in
                    proof of which may be cited the attacks of Derzhavin and Radistcheff. Strange
                    stories are told of his extravagance and whimsicality, among others that he had
                    in his library several volumes of bank notes bound together. He seems to have
                    “sickened of a vague disease” in the midst of all his splendour. His wealth was
                    boundless, as, besides his personal property, he had large landed estates and
                    many thousands of serfs. He was arrogant and capricious, a thorough despot, and
                    a man of grossly licentious life. That he was possessed of some ability cannot
                    be doubted, but, taking him all in all, we must say that the prominence of a man
                    of such character has left a deep stain upon the annals of Russia.</p>
