                <p><label type="entry">PROHIBITION</label> is defined by Blackstone as “a writ
                    directed to the judge and parties of a suit in any inferior court, commanding
                    them to cease from the prosecution thereof, upon a surmise either that the cause
                    originally or some collateral matter arising therein does not belong to that
                    jurisdiction, but to the cognizance of some other court.” A writ of prohibition
                    is a prerogative writ—that is to say, it does not issue as of course, but is
                    granted only on proper grounds being shown. Before the Judicature Acts
                    prohibition was granted by one of the Superior Courts at Westminster; it also
                    issued in certain cases from the Court of Chancery. It is now granted by the
                    High Court of Justice. Up to 1875 the High Court of Admiralty was for the
                    purposes of prohibition an inferior court. But now by the Judicature Act, 1873,
                    36 &amp; 37 Vict. c. 66, § 24, it is provided that no proceeding in the High
                    Court of Justice or the Court of Appeal is to be restrained by prohibition, a
                    stay of proceedings taking its place where necessary. The Admiralty Division
                    being now one of the divisions of the High Court can therefore no longer be
                    restrained by prohibition. The courts to which it most frequently issues in the
                    present day are the ecclesiastical courts, and county and other local courts,
                    such as the Lord Mayor’s Court of London, the Court of Passage of the city of
                    Liverpool, and the Court of Record of the hundred of Salford. In the case of
                    courts of quarter sessions, the same result is generally obtained by <hi
                    rend="italic">certiorari.</hi> The extent to which the ecclesiastical courts
                    were restrainable by prohibition led to continual disputes for centuries between
                    the civil and ecclesiastical authorities. Attempts were made at different times
                    to define the scope of the writ, the most conspicuous instances being the
                    statute <hi rend="italic">Circumspecte Agatis,</hi> 13 Edw. I. st. 4; the <hi
                    rend="italic">Articuli Cleri,</hi> 9 Edw. II. st. 1; and the later <hi
                    rend="italic">Articuli Cleri</hi> of 3 Jac. I., consisting of the claims
                    asserted by Archbishop Bancroft and the reply of the judges.' The law seems to
                    be undoubted that the spiritual court acting in spiritual matters <hi
                    rend="italic">pro salute</hi><hi rend="italic">animae</hi> cannot be restrained.
                    The difficulties arise in the application of the principle to individual
                    cases.</p>
                <p>Prohibition lies either before or after judgment. In order that proceedings
                    should be restrained after judgment it is necessary that want of jurisdiction in
                    the inferior court should appear upon the face of the proceedings, that the
                    party seeking the prohibition should have taken his objection in the inferior
                    court, or that he was in ignorance of a material fact. A prohibition goes either
                    for excess of jurisdiction, as if an ecclesiastical court were to try a claim by
                    prescription to a pew, or for transgression of clear laws of procedure, as if
                    such a court were to require two witnesses to prove a payment of tithes. It will
                    not as a rule be awarded on a matter of practice. The remedy in such a case is
                    appeal. Nor will it go, unless in exceptional cases, at the instance of a
                    stranger to the suit. The procedure in prohibition is partly common law, partly
                    statutory. By 50 Edw. III. c. 4 prohibition is not to be awarded after
                    consultation, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> after the judges of the superior
                    court have remitted the case as within the jurisdiction of the inferior court. 1
                    Will. IV. c. 21 (an Act to improve the proceedings in prohibition and on writs
                    of mandamus) was repealed as to England by 46 &amp; 47 Viet, c. 49, but it still
                    applies to Ireland, to which it was extended by 9 &amp; 10 Vict. c. 113.
                    Application for a prohibition is usually made <hi rend="italic">ex parte</hi> to
                    a judge in chambers on affidavit. The application may be granted or refused. If
                    granted, a rule to show cause why a writ of prohibition should not issue goes to
                    the inferior judge and the other party. In prohibition to courts other than
                    county courts pleadings in prohibition may be ordered. These pleadings are as
                    far as possible assimilated to pleadings in actions. They are rare in practice,
                    and are only ordered in cases of great difficulty and importance. In prohibition
                    to county courts they cannot be ordered, 19 &amp; 20 Vict. c. 108, § 42. Further
                    statutory regulations as to prohibition to county courts are contained in §§ 40,
                    41, and 44 of the same Act, and in 13 &amp; 14 Vict. c. 61, § 22. Much learning
                    on the subject of prohibition will be found in the opinion of Mr Justice Wills
                    delivered to the House of Lords in The Mayor and Aidermen of London <hi
                    rend="italic">v.</hi> Cox <hi rend="italic">(Law Reports,</hi> 2 Eng. and Ir.
                    Appeals, 239).</p>
                <p>In Scotch law prohibition is not used in the English sense. The same result is
                    obtained by suspension or reduction. In the United States the supreme court has
                    power to issue a prohibition to the district courts when proceeding as courts of
                    admiralty and maritime jurisdiction. Most of the States have also their own law
                    upon the subject, generally giving power to the supreme judicial authority in
                    the State to prohibit courts of inferior jurisdiction.</p>
