                <p><label type="entry">POLYCARP</label>. The importance of Polycarp, bishop of
                    Smyrna, for the earliest period of church history arises from his historical
                    position. He was on the one hand a disciple of John and other apostles and
                    disciples of Jesus; on the other hand he was the teacher of Irenaeus, the first
                    of the catholic fathers.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Iren., iii. 3, 4.</p></note> In his letter to Florinus, Irenaeus (ap.
                    Euseb., <hi rend="italic">H.E.,</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> n.</hi> 20)
                    says :—</p>
                <p>“I saw you when I was yet, as a boy, in Lower Asia with Polycarp. . . . . I could
                    even now point out the place where the blessed Polycarp sat and spoke, and
                    describe his going out and coming in, his manner of life, his personal
                    appearance, the addresses he delivered to the multitude, how he spoke of his
                    intercourse with John and with the others who had seen the Lord, and how he
                    recalled their words. And everything that he had heard from them about the Lord,
                    about His miracles and His teaching, Polycarp told us, as one who had received
                    it from those who had seen the Word of Life with their own eyes, and all this in
                    complete harmony with the Scriptures. To this I then listened, through the mercy
                    of God vouchsafed to me, with all eagerness, and wrote it not on paper but in my
                    heart, and still by the grace of God I ever bring it into fresh
                    remembrance.”</p>

                    importance.</p>
                <p>The sources for the life and activity of Polycarp are as follows :—(1) a few
                    notices of Irenaeus; (2) the epistle of Polycarp to the church at Philippi; (3)
                    the epistle of Ignatius to Polycarp; (4) the epistle of the church at Smyrna to
                    the church at Philomelium, giving an account of the martyrdom of Polycarp. Since
                    these authorities have all been called in question, and some of them entirely
                    rejected, by recent criticism, it is necessary to say a few words about each of
                    them.</p>
                <p>1. Of the statements of Irenaeus, those contained in the letter to Victor and in
                    the large work have passed unchallenged. The letter to Florinus, however, which
                    places Polycarp in unequivocal connexion with the apostle John, has been
                    discredited, because, it is alleged, John never was in Asia Minor. But this
                    denial of John’s residence in Asia Minor is itself a piece of critical
                    arbitrariness, and to assert that the epistle to Florinus is spurious is a
                    desperate resource. The only argument which can be adduced against it with any
                    sort of plausibility is the fact that in his great work Irenaeus does not
                    satisfy the expectations which the letter to Florinus is apt to raise in a
                    modern reader. It is certainly the case that he tells us very little about
                    Polycarp and still less about John. But statements from the mouth of Poly carp
                    of the very kind which the letter to Florinus would lead us to expect are not
                    altogether wanting in the great work of Irenaeus (see iii. 3, 4; ii. 22, 5; v.
                    30, 1)<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"

                    so few is accounted for by the plan and object of the treatise. The facts
                    mentioned by Irenaeus, therefore, cannot be set aside, although the assertion
                    that Polycarp was appointed bishop of the church at Smyrna by the apostles (iii.
                    3, 4) is probably a deduction from the Catholic theory of the origin of the
                    episcopate. If it was once understood that Polycarp had seen apostles, the
                    necessary inference for the time of Irenaeus was that he had received his office
                    from the hands of the apostles.</p>
                <p>2. Under the name of Polycarp we possess, in a Latin translation, a complete
                    letter to the church at Philippi, which was first published by Faber Stapulensis
                    in 1498. Of the Greek original, which was first edited by Halloix in 1633,
                    unfortunately only three-fourths has been preserved.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>All the Greek MSS. are derived from a single
                    archetype, in which the epistle of Barnabas followed that of Polycarp, but a
                    sheet of four leaves had been torn out, so that the end of Polycarp’s epistle
                    and the beginning of that of Barnabas are missing.</p></note> ® Since Irenaeus
                    (iii. 3, 4) expressly mentions and commends a letter of Polycarp to the church
                    of Philippi, since Eusebius <hi rend="italic">(H. E.,</hi> iii. 36) was
                    acquainted with the epistle as we have it and makes extracts from it, and since
                    Jerome <hi rend="italic">(De Vir. III.,</hi> xvii.) testifies that in his time
                    it was publicly read in the Asiatic churches, the external evidence in its
                    favour is as strong as could be desired. But the internal evidence is also very
                    strong. The occasion of the letter was a case of embezzlement, the guilty
                    individual being a presbyter at Philippi. It shows a fine combination of
                    mildness with severity; the language is simple but powerful; and, while there is
                    undoubtedly a lack of original ideas, the author shows remarkable skill in
                    weaving together pregnant sentences and impressive warnings selected from the
                    apostolic epistles and the first epistle of Clement. There is no trace of any
                    tendency beyond the immediate purpose of maintaining the true Christian life in
                    the church, and warning it against covetousness and against an unbrotherly
                    spirit. In these circumstances it would certainly never have occurred to any one
                    to doubt the genuineness of the epistle, or to suppose that it had been
                    interpolated, but for the fact that in several passages reference is made to
                    Ignatius and his epistles. In point of fact the historical situation which is
                    presupposed by the epistle is this, that Ignatius, on his last journey to Rome,
                    has just passed through Philippi, and that his letters are circulating in the
                    churches. Hence all those scholars who hold the seven Ignatian epistles to be
                    spurious are compelled to regard the epistle of Polycarp as also a forgery,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>So, for example, Lipsius,
                    Hilgenfeld, and others.</p></note> or at least as having been largely

                    however, breaks down in view of the fact that the first epistle of Clement is
                    quoted even in those passages which are alleged to be interpolated; and besides
                    it is inconsistent with the very obvious arrangement and unity of the
                    composition. On the other hand the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0430-0415"/> assumption that the whole work is a forgery is
                    untenable—(1) because in that case we should expect that its tone and language
                    and tendency would be in keeping with the Ignatian epistles, which is very far
                    from being the fact, and (2) because we must assume that Irenaeus himself had
                    been deceived by a forged epistle of Polycarp, or else that he had read the
                    genuine epistle, but in the course of the 3d century it had been supplanted by a
                    spurious substitute. Either of these suppositions is extremely improbable, and,
                    since internal marks of forgery are altogether absent, we must rather reverse
                    the argument and say that the epistle of Polycarp is a very important piece of
                    evidence for the historical existence of a bishop of Antioch named Ignatius, for
                    his journey to martyrdom at Rome, and for the fact that on this journey he wrote
                    several letters. In these circumstances it is very desirable that we should be
                    able to fix the exact date of Polycarp’s epistle. This unfortunately is
                    impossible, owing to the colourless character of the writing. Still it is
                    noteworthy that there is not a single trace of the time of Trajan, that on the
                    contrary an expression in the seventh chapter seems to presuppose the activity
                    of Marcion.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Compare vii.

                    history of Ignatius furnish no argument to the contrary, for the idea that
                    Ignatius was martyred under Trajan cannot be traced higher than the 3d
                    century,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Harnack,
                    <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic">Zeit</hi><hi rend="italic">des

                    Ignatian epistles themselves point to a later period. The epistle of Polycarp is
                    of more importance for the Ignatian problem than for Polycarp himself. It
                    conveys no distinct impression of his individuality, beyond the fact that the
                    writer of this letter lived wholly in the ideas of the older generation and of
                    the apostles, and would admit no addition to their teaching. That, however, is a
                    feature which harmonizes admirably so far as it goes with the description which
                    Irenaeus gives of Polycarp in the letter to Florinus. On account of its
                    dependence on older epistles, the epistle of Polycarp is of great value for the
                    history of the canon. For the constitutional history of the church also it
                    contains valuable materials; but for the history of dogma it is of little
                    use.</p>
                <p>3. The epistle of Ignatius to Polycarp is an important document, whether it is
                    genuine or not. It belongs at any rate to the 2d century, so that even if it
                    were spurious it would at least show what conception of the bishop’s character
                    was then prevalent. Polycarp appears in the letter as a man of a passive
                    disposition, with too little energy and decision for the vehement Ignatius. The
                    admonitions which Ignatius thinks fit to bestow on Polycarp (c. 1-6) are
                    surprising, when we remember that they are addressed to an old and venerable
                    man. But Ignatius was writing under the consciousness of impending martyrdom,
                    and evidently felt, with all his affected modesty, that this gave him a right to
                    censure the churches and bishops of Asia. To pronounce the epistle spurious on
                    account of its tone is hazardous, because it is difficult to imagine how it
                    could have entered the head of a forger to subject the honoured Polycarp to such
                    treatment at the hands of Ignatius.</p>
                <p>4. The most valuable source for the history of Polycarp is the letter of the
                    church in Smyrna about his martyrdom. Eusebius has preserved the greater part of
                    this epistle in his <hi rend="italic">Church History</hi> (iv. 15); but we
                    possess it entire with various concluding observations in several Greek
                    manuscripts, and also in a Latin translation.<note anchored="true"

                    been written not long after the events to which it refers, it has always been
                    regarded as one of the most precious remains of the 2d century. Certain recent
                    critics, however, have 3uestioned the authenticity of the narrative.

                    was not composed till the middle of the 3d century. But Keim’s own investigation
                    is sufficient to convince every unprejudiced mind that the genuineness of the

                    The statement in the epistle that Polycarp suffered martyrdom under the
                    proconsulate of Quadratus has quite recently given rise to a voluminous
                    literature. Eusebius in his <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi> gives 166 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> as the year of Polycarp’s death, and until the year
                    1867 this statement was never questioned. In that year appeared Waddington’s
                    “Mémoire sur la chronologie de la vie du rhéteur Aelius Aristide” <hi
                    rend="italic">{Mém. de l’institut,</hi><hi rend="italic">imp.</hi><hi

                    acute combination of circumstances that Quadratus was proconsul of Asia in
                    155-6, and that conseqùently Polycarp was martyred on the 23d of February
                    155.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>He died on a “great
                    Sabbath ”—another expression which has given rise to much discussion—by which is

                    agrees with what the church of Smyrna says about the day of its bishop’s death:

                <p>The chief facts to be gathered about the life of Polycarp from the above sources
                    are these. He must have been born before the year 69, for on the day of his
                    death he declared that he had served the Lord for eighty-six years <hi
                    rend="italic">{Martyrium,</hi> ix.). He became a Christian in his earliest
                    youth, and was an associate of the apostle John and other disciples of Jesus who
                    had come from Palestine to Asia Minor. What he heard from them he kept in
                    life-long remembrance, and in his manhood and old age he used to gather the
                    young people round him, and repeat to them what he had learned from those who
                    had seen Christ in the flesh. Amongst these youthful hearers was Irenaeus, who
                    has recorded much of what he thus learned (for example, an encounter between
                    John and Cerinthus in the bath, a statement about the age of Jesus, &amp;c.).
                    Especially when heresy began to raise its head, the aged Polycarp never ceased
                    to appeal to the pure doctrine of the apostles. He lived to see the rise of the
                    Marcionite and Valentinian sects, and vigorously opposed them. Irenaeus tells us
                    that on one occasion Marcion “endeavoured to establish relations with him”
                    (Iren., iii. 3, 4), and accosted him with the words eτrιγιvωσκeιs ^∕z∙Sς; there
                    is no doubt that Marcion wished to be on friendly terms with so influential a
                    man; but Polycarp displayed the same uncompromising attitude which his master
                    John had shown to Cerinthus, and answered <hi rend="italic">cπιγwωσκω</hi> σe
                    <hi rend="italic">τον πρωτότοκον τον Σατανά.</hi> These stern words are again
                    applied to Marcion in the epistle to the Philippians <hi rend="italic">;
                    for</hi> it is undoubtedly Marcion who is referred to in the following passage
                    (c. vii.) :—“He who falsifies the sayings of the Lord after his own pleasure,
                    and affirms that there is no resurrection [of the flesh] and no judgment, is the
                    first-born of Satan.” The <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n431/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0431-0416"/> steady progress of the heretical movement, in
                    spite of all opposition, was a cause of deep sorrow to Polycarp, so that in the
                    last years of his life (Iren. ap. Euseb., v. 20) the words were constantly on
                    his lips, “Oh good God, to what times hast thou spared me, that I must suffer
                    such things.” He never allowed himself to engage in discussion with heretics,
                    but as far as possible avoided their presence. Even in early life he had become
                    the head of the church of Smyrna, where he was held in the highest respect. The
                    congregation looked up to him as an apostolic and prophetic teacher <hi
                    rend="italic">(Mart.,</hi> xvi.), and consequently as combining in himself all
                    the spiritual gifts which God had conferred on Christendom. In his old age the
                    members of the congregration vied with each other in providing for his support
                    <hi rend="italic">(ibid.,</hi> xiii.). How great his reputation was is best
                    shown by the fury of the heathen and the Jews in his martyrdom. He was arrested
                    amidst shouts of “This is the teacher of Asia; this is the father of the
                    Christians; this is the destroyer of our gods; this is the man who has taught so
                    many no longer to sacrifice and no longer to pray to the gods” <hi rend="italic"
                    >(ibid.,</hi> xii.). When sentence was pronounced against him, every creature of
                    the Jewish and heathen rabble hastened to add something to the pile of wood on
                    which he was to be burned <hi rend="italic">(ibid.,</hi> xiii.). They refused to
                    deliver up his bones to the Christians for burial, for, said the Jews to the
                    mob, “The Christians will now forsake the Crucified, and worship Poly carp” <hi
                    rend="italic">(ibid.,</hi> xvii.). The sacrifice of Polycarp immediately
                    quenched the fury of the multitude, and the persecution ceased. All these facts
                    prove the great influence which the bishop had in the city. But his reputation
                    extended far beyond the limits of his own diocese. His letter to the church at
                    Philippi shows us how fully his apostolic spirit, his wisdom and justice, must
                    have been recognized even in Macedonia; otherwise he could not have ventured to
                    interfere in the purely internal affairs of the Philippian church. Ignatius, the
                    bishop of Antioch, begins his letter to him with the words (c.
                    1)—’Aτroδ∈χ0∕zev0ς <hi rend="italic">σoυ τηv</hi><hi rend="italic">èv</hi><hi

                    patronizing tone, evidently writes with deep respect. But even the ch arch at
                    Rome were to have an opportunity of making the acquaintance of the venerable
                    bishop. It is one of the most interesting and important incidents in the church
                    history of the 2d century that Polycarp, in the year before his death (when he
                    was above ninety years of age) undertook the journey to Rome in order to visit
                    the bishop Anicetus.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Anicetus was bishop from 154 (156) to 166 (167) (see Lipsius, <hi
                    rend="italic">Chron. d.</hi><hi rend="italic">Röm. Bischöfe,</hi> § 263.) Those
                    critics who reject Waddington’s view as to the date of Polycarp’s death use this
                    as their principal argument, that according to it there is no room for
                    Polycarp’s journey to Rome. It is certainly remarkable that the journey can just
                    be brought under Waddington’s calculations and no more; but, since after all it
                    can be brought under them, no conclusive argument can be drawn from this
                    circumstance. A voyage to Rome at a favourable season of the' year was not a
                    very formidable affair, and that Polycarp was still comparatively vigorous is
                    shown by his conduct during the persecution <hi rend="italic">(Mart.,</hi> v.
                    <hi rend="italic">sg.).</hi></p></note> Irenaeus, to whom we are indebted for
                    this information <hi rend="italic">(Haer.</hi> iii. 3, 4; <hi rend="italic">Ep.
                    ad</hi><hi rend="italic">Victorem,</hi> in Eusebius, <hi rend="italic"
                    >H.E.,</hi> v. 24, 16-17), gives as the reason for the journey that differences
                    existed between Asia and Rome, or between Polycarp and Anicetus, “with regard to
                    certain things,” and especially about the time of the Easter festival, which it
                    was desirable to remove. He might easily have told us what these “certain
                    things” were, and given us fuller details of the negotiations between the two
                    great bishops; for in all probability he was himself in Rome at the time <hi
                    rend="italic">(Mart.,</hi> Epilog. Mosq.). But unfortunately all he says is
                    that, with regard to the “certain things,” the two bishops speedily came to an
                    understanding, while, as to the time of Easter, each adhered to his own custom
                    without breaking off communication with the other. We learn further that
                    Anicetus, as a mark of special honour, allowed Polycarp to celebrate the
                    Eucharist in the church (the Eucharist must therefore have still been celebrated
                    at Rome in the Greek tongue), that many Marcionites and Valentinians were
                    converted by Poly carp in Rome (so that his visit must have lasted for a
                    considerable time), and that Polycarp took leave of Anicetus in peace. On his
                    return to Smyrna he enjoyed only about six months of uninterrupted activity.
                    Then, on the occasion of the festive games, there arose, as in so many other
                    instances, an outburst of popular feeling against the Christians, in which
                    Polycarp was to die a martyr’s death. From the letter of the church of Smyrna we
                    see with what magnanimity and manliness and true Christian spirit the greyhaired
                    bishop conducted himself. It leaves the most vivid impression of a man of
                    dignity and noble demeanour, and at the same time of humble disposition and
                    compassionate love. Every action he does, every word he speaks, in the
                    prosecution and during the trial is noble and great; even that quiet irony which
                    we detect in his answer to Marcion does not forsake him <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Mart.,</hi> ix. 2). The proconsul was anxious to save him, and tried to induce
                    him to recant, but he remained steadfast. He was delivered up to the populace,
                    and his body was burned. The Christians present believed that they saw a dove
                    soaring aloft from the burning pile, and it was reported that an odour issued
                    from it like that of costly incense <hi rend="italic">(ibid.,</hi> xvi. 15).
                    Such legends do not require years for their formation, but only a few hours. By
                    his death Polycarp shielded his congregation from further persecution. <hi
