                    scrinii epistolarum ”). Three minor treatises are dedicated to Symmachus (the
                    father-in-law of Boetius). Cassiodorus, writing in the ninety-third year of his
                    age (560? 573?), heads some extracts from Priscian with the statement that he
                    taught at Constantinople in his (Cassiodor’s) time (Keil, <hi rend="italic">Gr.
                    Lot.,</hi> vii. p. 207). His title <hi rend="italic">Caesariensis</hi> points,
                    according to Niebuhr and others, to Caesarea in Mauretania. Priscian’s teacher
                    was Theoctistus, “noster praeceptor, omnis eloquentiae decus, cui quicquid in me
                    sit doctrinae post deum imputo” <hi rend="italic">(Inst. Gr.,</hi> vi. 51), who
                    also wrote an <hi rend="italic">Institutio artis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >grammaticae</hi><hi rend="italic">(ibid.,</hi> xviii. 56). A later grammarian,
                    Eutyches, pays Priscian himself a still higher compliment—“de quibus Romanae
                    lumen facundiae, meus, immo comtfiunis omnium hominum, praeceptor, summa cum
                    subtilitate copiosissime grammaticus Priscianus disseruisse cognoscitur”
                    (Eutych., i. 8; Keil, <hi rend="italic">Gr. Lat.,</hi> v. p. 456). Priscian was
                    quoted by several writers in Britain of the 8th century—Aidhelm, Bede,
                    Alcuin—and was abridged or largely used in the next century by Hrabanus Maurus
                    of Fulda and Servatus Lupus of Ferrara. Of the general use made of his great
                    work the best proof is that, as Hertz says, there is hardly a library in Europe
                    that did not and does not contain a copy, and that there are now about a
                    thousand MSS. of it. The greater part of these contain only books i-xvi.
                    (sometimes called <hi rend="italic">Priscianus major);</hi> a few contain (with
                    the three books <hi rend="italic">Ad</hi><hi rend="italic">Symmachum)</hi> books
                    xvii., xviii. <hi rend="italic">(Priscianus minor);</hi> and a few contain both
                    parts. The earliest MSS. are of the 9th century, though a few fragments are
                    somewhat earlier. All are ultimately derived from the copy made by Theodorus.
                    The first printed edition was in 1470 at Venice. It may fairly be said that from
                    the beginning of the 6th century until recently Priscian has reigned over Latin
                    grammar with almost as generally recognized an authority as Justinian has over
                    Roman law. Some account of so remarkable a treatise may reasonably be
                    required.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Institutiones</hi><hi rend="italic">Grammatical·</hi> is a
                    systematic exposition of Latin grammar, dedicated to Julian, consul and
                    patrician, whom some have identified with the author of a well-known epitome of
                    Justinian’s <hi rend="italic">Novellae,</hi> but the lawyer appears to be
                    somewhat later than Priscian. In length the treatise is about twice the size of
                    Quintilian’s <hi rend="italic">Institutio Oratoria,</hi> and about equal to
                    Madvig’s <hi rend="italic">Latin Grammar.</hi> It is divided into eighteen
                    books, of which the first sixteen deal mainly with sounds, word-formation, and
                    inflexions, the last two, which form from a fourth to a third of the whole work,
                    deal with syntax. Priscian informs us in his preface that he has translated into
                    Latin such precepts of the Greeks Herodian and Apollonius as seemed suitable,
                    and added to them from Latin grammarians. Of the latter he occasionally refers
                    to Caper, Donatus, Probus, and Servius; and more rarely to Charisius, Diomedes,
                    Asper, Nonius, Remmius Palaemon, and others. He proceeds in orderly and almost
                    exhaustive fashion, though with some digressions and repetitions, gives
                    definitions, rules, examples, and exceptions, and constantly quotes passages
                    from various writers to illustrate the use of a form. He has thus preserved to
                    us numerous fragments which would otherwise have been lost, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> from Ennius, Pacuvius, Attius, Lucilius, Cato, and Varro. But the
                    authors whom he quotes most frequently are Virgil, and, next to him, Terence,
                    Cicero, Plautus; then Lucan, Horace, Juvenal, Sallust, Statius, Ovid, Livy, and
                    Persius. His industry in collecting forms and examples is both great and
                    methodical. His style is somewhat heavy, but sensible and clear; it has not the
                    admirable grace of Quintilian, nor the adroit use of a technical language such
                    as is found in the Roman jurists; but there is no attempt at fine writing, and
                    it is free not of course from usages of late</p>
                <p>Latin, but from anything that can be called barbarism. Considering the time at
                    which it was written, it is very creditable to the author, and not unworthy of
                    the high placo it obtained in the grammatical world. Its defects are such as
                    were till lately common more or less to all grammars.</p>
                <p>These defects may be referred in the main to four heads. (1) Priscian avowedly
                    treats Greek writers on (Greek) grammar as his supreme authorities <hi
                    rend="italic">(cf.</hi> i. 13; vi. 1; xii. 13, &amp;c.), and, though noticing
                    differences between the two languages, bears too little in mind that each has a
                    history of its own and is a law to itself. (2) There had been no scientific
                    study of phonetics, and consequently the changes and combinations of languages
                    are treated in a mechanical way: <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >i</hi> passes into <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> as <hi rend="italic">genus,
                    generis,</hi><hi rend="italic">generatum</hi>; into o as <hi rend="italic">saxi,
                    saxosus</hi> (i. 33); <hi rend="italic">q</hi> passes into <hi rend="italic"
                    >s</hi> as <hi rend="italic">torqueo,</hi><hi rend="italic">torsi</hi> (i. 48),
                    &amp;c. (3) The resolution of a word into root or stem and inflexional or
                    derivative affixes was an idea wholly unknown, and the rules of formation are
                    often based on unimportant phenomena, and yet are invested with an authority
                    which is irrational and misleading: <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Venus,</hi> like other names ending in <hi rend="italic">us,</hi>
                    ought to have genitive <hi rend="italic">Veni,</hi> but, as this might be taken
                    for a verb, it has <hi rend="italic">Veneris</hi> (vi. 86; viii. 5). <hi
                    rend="italic">Λdor</hi> has no genitive because two rules conflict; for neuters
                    in <hi rend="italic">or</hi> have a short penult <hi rend="italic"
                    >(e.g.,</hi><hi rend="italic">aequor, aequoris),</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >αdoro,</hi> from which it is derived, has a long penult (vi. 49; viii. 6). (4)
                    The practical meaning of the inflexions is not realized, and syntactical usages
                    are treated as if they were arbitrary or accidental associations. Thus, after
                    laying down as a general rule for declinable words that, when they refer to one
                    and the same person, they must have the same case, gender, and number, Priscian
                    adds, that when there are transitive words we may use different numbers, as <hi
                    rend="italic">doceo</hi><hi rend="italic">discipulos,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >docemus discipulum</hi> (xvii. 153-155). He often states a rule too broadly or
                    narrowly, and then, as it were, gropes after restrictions and extensions.</p>
                <p>His etymologies are of course sometimes very wild: <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi><hi rend="italic">caelebs</hi> from <hi rend="italic">caelestium
                    vitam ducens,</hi><hi rend="italic">b</hi> being put for <hi rend="italic"
                    >u</hi> because a consonant cannot be put before another consonant (i. 23); <hi
                    rend="italic">deterior</hi> from the verb <hi rend="italic">detero,
                    deteris</hi><hi rend="italic">; potior</hi> (adj.) from <hi rend="italic"
                    >potior, potiris</hi> (iii. 3); <hi rend="italic">arbor</hi> from <hi
                    rend="italic">robur</hi> (vi. 48); <hi rend="italic">verbum</hi> from <hi
                    rend="italic">verberatus aeris</hi> (viii. 1), &lt;fcc. Nor is he always right
                    in Greek usages: thus, in illustrating Latin moods by Greek he frequently uses
                    the future optative with <hi rend="italic">av, e.g., iκ8υσoιvτo av, τrιστevσoιpι
                    av</hi> (xviii. 106), and still more strangely treats <hi rend="italic">apa</hi>
                    as identical in force with <hi rend="italic">av, e.g., quasi</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">tolleretur ac constitueretur,</hi><hi rend="italic">eπaipoιτo av
                    κaι</hi><hi rend="italic">κατατάττοιτο</hi><hi rend="italic">apa,</hi> and
                    misuses both particles, <hi rend="italic">e.g., in me</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >causam conferebat</hi><hi rend="italic">quod</hi><hi rend="italic">eum codicem
                    obsignassem,</hi><hi rend="italic">άτφράγισα αν ήτοι Ισφραγικώς Ριην</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">apa</hi> (xviii. 110). He evidently regarded <hi rend="italic"
                    >αν</hi> or <hi rend="italic">apa</hi> as normally required with the Greek
                    optative or other moods corresponding to the Latin subjunctive (xviii. 117,
                    &amp;c.).</p>
                <p>A rapid notice of the order and of some salient points will show both merits and
                    defects in the treatment of his subject-matter. The references are to the book
                    and to KrehΓs paragraphs.</p>
                <p>Book i. treats of vocal sound and of letters, their changes and combinations. <hi
                    rend="italic">Elementa</hi> are vowels, semi-vowels, or mutes. Vowels are named
                    from their own sound; semi-vowels sound a vowel before them; mutes sound a vowel
                    after them (i. 7). As semivowels he classes <hi rend="italic">f,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">I, m, n, r, s, x,</hi> and in Greek names <hi rend="italic"
                    >z.</hi><hi rend="italic">F</hi> was, among the earliest Latins, the Aeolic
                    digamma, but afterwards was equivalent to <hi rend="italic">φ.</hi> It is,
                    however, rather a mute, because it is not found at the end of a word, and can be
                    placed before <hi rend="italic">I</hi> and <hi rend="italic">r</hi> in the same
                    syllable <hi rend="italic">(ib.</hi> 13). <hi rend="italic">K</hi> is quite
                    superfluous; <hi rend="italic">g</hi> merely shows that a <hi rend="italic"
                    >u</hi> following has no metrical effect; <hi rend="italic">h</hi> is a mere
                    aspiration; <hi rend="italic">i</hi> and <hi rend="italic">u</hi> sometimes pass
                    into consonants, and then have a different metrical effect from what they have
                    as vowels <hi rend="italic">(ib.</hi> 14-17). <hi rend="italic">D</hi> has often
                    the sound of <hi rend="italic">z</hi>: e.g., in <hi rend="italic">meridies,
                    hodie</hi><hi rend="italic">(ib.</hi> 31).</p>
                <p>Book ii. treats of the syllable and of the letters used to end it, then of the
                    parts of speech. A syllable is an ordered combination of letters uttered with
                    one accent and one breath (ii. 1). A word <hi rend="italic">(dictio)</hi> is the
                    unit of orderly speech <hi rend="italic">(ib.</hi> 14). Speech <hi rend="italic"
                    >(oratio)</hi> is a suitable arrangement of words expressing a complete meaning
                    <hi rend="italic">(ib.</hi></p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n768/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0768-0745"/>
                <p>15). The parts of speech are, according to Priscian, eight, viz., noun, verb,
                    participle, pronoun, preposition, adverb, interjection, conjunction. Infinites
                    <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> infinitive moods) are included under the verb,
                    because they have tenses and no cases. Participles are not included, because
                    they have cases and genders but no moods <hi rend="italic">(ib.</hi> 18).
                    Priscian obtains a framework for the arrangement of his facts from the
                    “accidents” of each part of speech, and subordinate classifications are taken
                    from the endings of the words. Nouns have the following accidents :— <hi
                    rend="italic">species, genus,</hi><hi rend="italic">numerus, figura,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">casus.</hi> As regards <hi rend="italic">species</hi> (“class”)
                    nouns are proper or appellative, and each of these classes are subdivided into
                    many others. Adjectives are (rightly) treated by Priscian in common with other
                    nouns (ii. 22 <hi rend="italic">sq. ).</hi> The rest of this book and books iii.
                    and iv. treat of the formation of the different classes of nouns, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> of patronymics, possessives, comparatives,
                    superlatives, diminutives, and other derivatives. Book v. treats of gender,
                    number, figure, and case. For gender, nouns are discussed by their endings.
                    Figure is either simple or composite or decomposite (ι.e., derivative from
                    composite), as, <hi rend="italic">magnus, magnanimus, magnanimitas</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">{y.</hi> 61). There are four modes of composition :—(1) <hi
                    rend="italic">ex</hi><hi rend="italic">duobus integris,</hi> as <hi
                    rend="italic">tribunusplebis</hi>; (2) <hi rend="italic">ex</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">duobus corruptis,</hi> as <hi rend="italic">benivolus</hi>; (3)
                    <hi rend="italic">ex</hi><hi rend="italic">integro et corrupto,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi><hi rend="italic">inimicus·,</hi> (4) <hi rend="italic"
                    >ex corrupto et integro,</hi> as <hi rend="italic">impius</hi> (v. 58). There
                    are six cases, thus arranged :—(1) the nominative as the original; (2) the
                    genitive, because it is born from the nominative, and begets the other oblique
                    cases; (3) the dative, “qui magis amicis convenit ;” (4) the accusative, “qui
                    magis ad inimicos attinet (5) the vocative as the most imperfect; (6) the
                    ablative as new and peculiar to the Latins (v. 74). In book vi. the formation of
                    the genitive is discussed, each nominative termination being taken in order,
                    irrespective of the declension. Book vii. treats of the other cases in each of
                    the five declensions. Neither here nor in the books on the verb are full
                    paradigms set out as in modern grammars. <hi rend="italic">Hic, hujus,</hi>
                    &amp;c., are often prefixed as symbols of gender and case.</p>
                <p>Books viii.-x. deal with the verb. Verbs have eight accidents :— <hi
                    rend="italic">genus,</hi><hi rend="italic">tempus,</hi><hi rend="italic">modus,
                    species,</hi><hi rend="italic">figura, conjugatio,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >persona,</hi><hi rend="italic">numerus.</hi> Some verbs (as other parts of
                    speech) are defective, either by natural necessity or by chance. Necessity may
                    lie in the meaning <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi><hi rend="italic">puerperus</hi>
                    is not found) or in the incompatibility of sound <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,
                    cursor</hi> but not <hi rend="italic">cursrix).</hi> Chance may lie simply in
                    non-use, <hi rend="italic">e.g., faux,</hi><hi rend="italic">prex,
                    dicio,</hi><hi rend="italic">for, dor</hi>; or because the form would be
                    unpleasant, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi><hi rend="italic">metuturus</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">metuiturus, nutritrix</hi> (from <hi rend="italic">nutritor),</hi>
                    for which <hi rend="italic">nutrix</hi> is used. Sometimes a word is not used in
                    order to avoid confusion, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >conjunx</hi> has <hi rend="italic">conjugis,</hi> lest <hi rend="italic"
                    >conjungis</hi> should be taken fora verb; <hi rend="italic">maneo</hi> has <hi
                    rend="italic">mansi,</hi> not <hi rend="italic">manui</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi><hi rend="italic">fac,</hi> if wc avoid confusion with ablatives <hi
                    rend="italic">face, duce,</hi> &amp;c. (viii. 4-6).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Genus</hi> or <hi rend="italic">significatio</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">verbi</hi> is its being active or passive. Verbs in <hi
                    rend="italic">o</hi> are active, neuter, and neutro-passive, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g., amo, spiro,</hi><hi rend="italic">gaudeo</hi><hi rend="italic">(cf.</hi>
                    xi. 28). Verbs in <hi rend="italic">or</hi> are passive, common, and deponent,
                    <hi rend="italic">e.g., amor,</hi><hi rend="italic">osculor</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">te</hi> and <hi rend="italic">a te, sequor.</hi> Verbs whose
                    meaning and use do not correspond with the form are enumerated <hi rend="italic"
                    >(ib.</hi> 7-39). <hi rend="italic">Tempus</hi> is present, past, and future.
                    Past time is divided into past imperfect, past perfect, past pluperfect. Present
                    and future time are not divided by the Romans (tδ. 38). <hi rend="italic"

                    57). The indicative and subjunctive have all tenses; the imperative has present,
                    future, and, in passive, a past <hi rend="italic">{e,g.,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >amatus</hi><hi rend="italic">sit).</hi> The optative and infinite have one form
                    expressing both present and past imperfect, and another expressing perfect and
                    pluperfect <hi rend="italic">(ib.</hi> 38-43). The present tense embraces to
                    some extent both past and future <hi rend="italic">(e.g., Priscianus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">vocor, scribo versum).</hi> The perfect corresponds to Greek
                    aorist as well as to perfect <hi rend="italic">(ib.</hi> 51-54). Priscian makes
                    five moods,—the optative (same in forms as the subjunctive) always requiring an
                    adverb of wishing; the subjunctive, requiring not only an adverb or conjunction,
                    but also another verb, <hi rend="italic">e.g., cum</hi><hi rend="italic">faciam
                    venito.</hi> In expressions of command, as <hi rend="italic">ne dicas,</hi>
                    another verb is not required <hi rend="italic">(ib.</hi> 68). Supines and
                    gerunds (sometimes confused, sometimes distinguished, by Priscian) are nouns
                    used in place of the infinite. <hi rend="italic">Amandus,</hi> &amp;c., is
                    called <hi rend="italic">participiale</hi> or <hi rend="italic">nomen verbale
                    (ib.</hi> 44, 70). Impersonal verbs have a peculiar meaning <hi rend="italic"
                    >(ib.</hi> 69).</p>
                <p>In class verbs are primitive or derivative. Derivatives are numerously classified
                    as inchoatives, fréquentatives, &amp;c. <hi rend="italic">(ib.</hi> 72 <hi
                    rend="italic">sq. ).</hi> In figure verbs are simple or compound <hi
                    rend="italic">(ib.</hi> 81). Conjugations in Latin are determined by the vowel
                    of the 2nd person, and are thus four only, while the Greeks have ten. Person and
                    number close the eighth book. <hi rend="italic">Pero, volo, edo</hi> are
                    specially treated (ix. 4-11). The formation of the perfect is first treated
                    generally (ix. 13), and then the perfects and supines of 1st and 2nd
                    conjugations and (in book X.) of 3rd and 4th conjugations.</p>
                <p>Book xi. deals with participles, which were invented to act as verbs applied to
                    nouns, especially in oblique cases. Hence we can say not only <hi rend="italic"
                    >bonus homo</hi><hi rend="italic">loquebatur</hi> but <hi rend="italic">boni
                    hominis</hi><hi rend="italic">loquenlis</hi><hi rend="italic">orationem
                    audivi,</hi> &amp;c. (xi. 3). The participle has six accidents: — <hi
                    rend="italic">genus, casus,</hi><hi rend="italic">significatio, tempus, numerus,
                    figura (ib.</hi> 13),—where <hi rend="italic">gemis</hi> is gender, and <hi
                    rend="italic">significatio</hi> and <hi rend="italic">jigura</hi> have same
                    application as in verbs. The formation of the participles, especially of the
                    past participle, is fully discussed.</p>
                <p>Books xii. and xiii. deal with pronouns. They have six accidents :— <hi
                    rend="italic">species, persona, genus,</hi><hi rend="italic">numerus,
                    figura,</hi><hi rend="italic">casus.</hi> There are four declensions, viz.,
                    personal, <hi rend="italic">ille,</hi> &amp;c., <hi rend="italic">meus,</hi>
                    &amp;c., <hi rend="italic">nostras,</hi> &amp;c. Priscian classes as nouns, and
                    not as pronouns, <hi rend="italic">quis, qualis, talis, quantus, tantus,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">tot,</hi><hi rend="italic">unus, solus, totus, alius, nullus,
                    uter, alter,</hi> and their compounds (xiii. 11, 29-35).</p>
                <p>Having finished the four declinable parts of speech, Priscian turns to the four
                    indeclinable. Prepositions (book xiv. ) are (except sometimes in verse) put
                    before nouns both by apposition and composition; before pronouns only by
                    apposition; before all else by composition (xiv. 8). He treats first of
                    prepositions used with the accusative case, then of those used with the
                    ablative, and lastly of those occurring only in composition. Adverbs (book xv.)
                    have <hi rend="italic">species,</hi><hi rend="italic">significatio, figura,</hi>
                    where <hi rend="italic">species</hi> refers to their being primitive or
                    derivative, and <hi rend="italic">significatio</hi> to their meaning as
                    temporal, local, confirmative, optative, &amp;c. Some are used with all tenses
                    and moods, others with some only. They are arranged for discussion under their
                    endings <hi rend="italic">(ib.</hi> 7). Under the endings inα are treated also
                    ablatives of nouns used as adverbs, <hi rend="italic">e.g., una, qua, Roma,</hi>
                    and also other local uses of nouns, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Romaesum,</hi><hi rend="italic">Romam</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >eo,</hi> &amp;c. <hi rend="italic">(ib.</hi> 9). Interjections are separated
                    from adverbs by Roman writers, because they express fully an emotion of the
                    mind, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi><hi rend="italic">papae,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >quid video, yvhere</hi><hi rend="italic">papae==</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >miror</hi><hi rend="italic">(ib.</hi> 40). Conjunctions have <hi rend="italic"
                    >figzιra</hi> and <hi rend="italic">species, species</hi> denoting meaning and
                    use as copulative, causal, disjunctive, &amp;c. Some conjunctions belong to
                    several of these classes.</p>
                <p>The two books on syntax are looser in arrangement, and are not so clear and
                    exhaustive as the former books. The truth is, Priscian lacked a good framework
                    for the facts of construction, and first tries one and then another. The
                    seventeenth book rests mainly on Apollonius; the eighteenth is less dependent on
                    him, and ends with a long miscellaneous list, in alphabetical order, of Greek
                    idioms, chiefly verbal, which he compares with corresponding Latin usages. Part
                    of this list occurs twice over. Omitting duplicates, there are nearly 300 such
                    comparisons. Hertz suggests (Praef. iii. p. vii.) that it was only closed by the
                    fortunate occurrence of <hi rend="italic">χορτάζομαζ,</hi> illustrated by a line
                    of Terence which ended with <hi rend="italic">satzιr!</hi> These idioms are
                    illustrated by copious quotations from Demosthenes and Plato, and not a few from
                    Homer, Herodotus, Thucydides, and Xenophon, besides Latin authors.</p>
                <p>The syntax commences with showing the analogy of elements, words, and speech. In
                    each of these we have repetition, omission, conjunction, transposition, &amp;c.
                    (xvii. 3 <hi rend="italic">sq.).</hi> Then Prisciau discusses why interrogatives
                    are all of two parts of speech only, viz., nouns and adverbs <hi rend="italic"
                    >(ib.</hi> 22): why not also verbs <hi rend="italic">(ib.</hi> 36)? He discusses
                    the difference of pronouns from one another, their use with impersonals,
                    particularly <hi rend="italic">interest,</hi><hi rend="italic">refert</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(ib.</hi> 92), the use of the possessive and reflexive pronouns.
                    He says that <hi rend="italic">mei</hi><hi rend="italic">ager</hi> may be used
                    for <hi rend="italic">meus ager,</hi> but also for “the land of my husband” <hi
                    rend="italic">(ib.</hi> 129, 130). There are many possible unions and
                    interchanges of different parts of speech and of their accidents. Such unions as
                    <hi rend="italic">ille ego</hi><hi rend="italic">qui</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >quondam,</hi> &amp;c., are justified analogically by the union of different
                    cases, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi><hi rend="italic">animalizιm</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">quaedam</hi><hi rend="italic">sunt</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >mortalia,</hi> or by the rise of compounds from different cases, as <hi
                    rend="italic">mediterraneus</hi><hi rend="italic">a medio</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >terrae</hi><hi rend="italic">(ib.</hi> 144-152). Different numbers and genders
                    are combined, as <hi rend="italic">pars secant</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">aperite aliquis</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >in</hi><hi rend="italic">Eunuchum suam</hi>; or different cases, as <hi
                    rend="italic">urbem quam statuo vestra</hi><hi rend="italic">est</hi>; or
                    different times, as <hi rend="italic">post</hi><hi rend="italic">quam</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">cecidit</hi><hi rend="italic">. . . Ilion</hi><hi rend="italic">et
                    omnis humo fumat Troja (ib.</hi> 155-163). Often we find interchange, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> of parts of speech, as <hi rend="italic"
                    >sublime</hi><hi rend="italic">(volas)</hi> for an adverb, <hi rend="italic"
                    >genus unde</hi><hi rend="italic">Latinum</hi> for <hi rend="italic">ex
                    quo,</hi> &amp;c. <hi rend="italic">(ib.</hi> 168).</p>
                <p>In the eighteenth book he discusses the use of the cases. The nominative and
                    vocative are absolute, and with substantival or vocatival verbs of the first or
                    second person they do not require a pronoun, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,
                    homo</hi><hi rend="italic">sum, Cicero nominor,</hi> but with other verbs they
                    do, <hi rend="italic">e.g., ego</hi><hi rend="italic">Priscianus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">scribo,</hi><hi rend="italic">tu</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Apollonius</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">Apolloni) scribis.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Tu</hi> may, however, be omitted with the vocative, but <hi rend="italic"
                    >Priscianus</hi><hi rend="italic">scribo</hi> is a solecism, because nouns by
                    themselves and participles, without the vocative case, are of the third person
                    <hi rend="italic">(ib.</hi> 2-4). If a noun requires an oblique case, we must
                    have the verb substantive or participle, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">filius</hi><hi rend="italic">Herculis sum.</hi> In <hi
                    rend="italic">filius Pelei</hi><hi rend="italic">Achilles</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >multos interfecit,</hi> the participle <hi rend="italic">ens</hi> (“for which
                    we now use <hi rend="italic">qui est</hi> or <hi rend="italic">qzιi</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">fuit")</hi> must be understood <hi rend="italic">(ib.</hi> 6). The
                    nominative is joined to the genitive when possession and a possessor are meant.
                    In <hi rend="italic">Hector</hi><hi rend="italic">filius Priami</hi> the
                    genitive denotes the possessor; in <hi rend="italic">magnae</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">virtutis vir</hi> it denotes the possession. In the latter use the
                    Latins often have the ablative, as they have also for the Greek genitive of
                    consequence, <hi rend="italic">lμoυ ζωvτos</hi><hi rend="italic">=me vivo
                    (ib.</hi> 14). The genitive after comparatives and superlatives and after
                    verbals in <hi rend="italic">-or</hi> and <hi rend="italic">-rix</hi> is
                    mentioned; also such usages as <hi rend="italic">fidens animi,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">dives</hi><hi rend="italic">lactis</hi><hi rend="italic">(ib.</hi>
                    18, 19). In <hi rend="italic">doctus grammaticam</hi><hi rend="italic">-we have
                    a.</hi> participle; in <hi rend="italic">doctus grammaticae</hi> a noun <hi
                    rend="italic">(ib.</hi> 21). The dative is used acquisitively, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi><hi rend="italic">commodus</hi><hi rend="italic">tibi</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">sum,</hi> also after verbals in <hi rend="italic">-Us</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">-dus.</hi> Words of equivalence or subjection or the reverse are
                    used in any order with either genitive or dative, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,
                    pater</hi><hi rend="italic">filii,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">·</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">filio</hi><hi rend="italic">est</hi><hi rend="italic">pater</hi>;
                    so <hi rend="italic">similis,</hi><hi rend="italic">par,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >amicus,</hi> &amp;c. Nominatives are joined to accusatives when what belongs to
                    a part is assigned to the whole, <hi rend="italic">c.g.,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >fortis dextram</hi> for <hi rend="italic">fortem dextram habens.</hi> In all
                    (even in oblique) cases we must understand <hi rend="italic">qzιi</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">est,</hi> as <hi rend="italic">albi</hi><hi rend="italic">colorem
                    equi</hi><pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n769/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0769-0746"/><hi rend="italic">’-tqui ejus qui est albi coloris
                    (ib.</hi> 27). The ablative is joined to the nominative to express the
                    instrument, the possession, the consequence (see above). It is used also with
                    words of passive meaning, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi><hi rend="italic">viduus
                    pharetra, dignus</hi><hi rend="italic">morte-,</hi> and in comparisons <hi
                    rend="italic">(ib.</hi> 32). He then proceeds (in awkward language) to point out
                    that the nominative which is joined to a verb remains unchanged, and either
                    takes no oblique cases of another declinable word or only such as are construed
                    with the verb, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi><hi rend="italic">Terentius
                    ambulat</hi><hi rend="italic">; Caesar</hi><hi rend="italic">vincit Pompeium;
                    pater indulget filio.</hi> But the nominative, which in consequence of the
                    nature of the noun itself takes oblique cases, takes those cases, be its own
                    case what it may; <hi rend="italic">e.g., victor Pompeii Caesar</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">interfectus est a Bruto</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">victoris</hi><hi rend="italic">Pompeii</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Caesaris filia</hi><hi rend="italic">fuit</hi><hi rend="italic">Julia·, victori
                    Pompeii Caesari,</hi> &amp;c. <hi rend="italic">(ib.</hi> 35, 36). Similarly
                    datives like <hi rend="italic">curse,</hi><hi rend="italic">cordi,</hi> &amp;c.,
                    are used with all cases, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi><hi rend="italic">cordi
                    hominis</hi> for <hi rend="italic">jucundi hominis (ib.</hi> 38; xi. 24).
                    Priscian would have found it difficult to give an instance of this.</p>
                <p>The syntax of the verb follows. The infinite is taken first as the most general.
                    Infinites are often joined to nouns, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">bonum</hi><hi rend="italic">est</hi><hi rend="italic">legere,</hi>
                    and, by a beautiful figure, to adjectives, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">fortis bellare·,</hi> also to verbs and participles (xviii.
                    40-46). All verbs may be resolved into infinites, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,
                    ambulo=dico me</hi><hi rend="italic">ambulare, scribebam.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >=</hi><hi rend="italic">scribere</hi><hi rend="italic">coepi.</hi> Hence <hi
                    rend="italic">coepit</hi> was sometimes omitted, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,
                    ego</hi><hi rend="italic">illud sedulo negare</hi><hi rend="italic">factum
                    (ib.</hi> 48). Participials and supines have the same case as the verb; verbal
                    nouns in <hi rend="italic">-dus</hi> have the same case as the nouns to which
                    they are joined <hi rend="italic">(ib.</hi> 61-63). All transitive verbs are
                    joined either to a genitive or dative or accusative or ablative, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi><hi rend="italic">egeo tui, insidior tibi,</hi> &amp;c.
                    Similarly participials or supines, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >miserendo tui moveor, nocitum tibi propero, nocitu tibi gaudet (ib.</hi> 61).
                    An instance of the last would be hard to find.</p>
                <p>The uses of indicative, imperative, and optative moods are briefly treated. The
                    subjunctive, which is the same in form as the optative <hi rend="italic"
                    >(ib.</hi> 82), requires always to be joined to another mood or to another verb
                    of the same mood. It is especially frequent with <hi rend="italic">si,</hi> when
                    expressing doubt and put for <hi rend="italic">lav (ib.</hi> 80). With the
                    indicative <hi rend="italic">si</hi> used for <hi rend="italic">el</hi> shows
                    confirmation and belief. In <hi rend="italic">siqua id</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >fortuna vetabit, vetabit</hi> is put <hi rend="italic">metri</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">gratia</hi> for <hi rend="italic">vetet.</hi> The subjunctive
                    expresses doubt or approval or possibility, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> doubt
                    in <hi rend="italic">eloquar</hi><hi rend="italic">an</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >sileam,</hi> approval in <hi rend="italic">si non</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >pertaesum thalami</hi><hi rend="italic">taedaeque</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >fuisset,</hi> where <hi rend="italic">fuisset</hi><hi rend="italic">=
                    lyey6veι</hi><hi rend="italic">&amp;pa. Ut</hi> and <hi rend="italic">qui, quae,
                    quod,</hi> giving a reason or expressing a doubt, are often used with
                    subjunctive <hi rend="italic">(ib.</hi> 82-93). In discussing <hi rend="italic"
                    >ut for Iva,</hi> his examples carefully give the same tense of the principal
                    verb (whether indicative or subjunctive) as that of the dependent subjunctive,
                    <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi><hi rend="italic">doces ut proficias, doceres ut
                    proficeres, docuisti ut profeceris, docuisses ut profecisses, docebis ut
                    profeceris</hi> (future subjunctive). But he also notes that <hi rend="italic"
                    >fecissem</hi> or <hi rend="italic">facerem</hi> are equally right with <hi
                    rend="italic">nisi</hi><hi rend="italic">impedires,</hi> and that <hi
                    rend="italic">faciam</hi> or <hi rend="italic">fecero</hi> is used with either
                    <hi rend="italic">nisi</hi><hi rend="italic">impedias</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >impedires</hi><hi rend="italic">(ib.</hi> 101- 104).</p>
                <p>After then discussing the cases used after verbs according to the meaning of the
                    verbs as transitive, passive, common, absolute <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">rubeo pudore),</hi> or expressing various affections of the body
                    or mind <hi rend="italic">(ib.</hi> 127-167), he proceeds to the long list of
                    idioms spoken of above.</p>
                <p>Priscian’s three short treatises dedicated to Symmachus are on weights and
                    measures, the metres of Terence, and some rhetorical elements. He also wrote <hi
                    rend="italic">De nomine,</hi><hi rend="italic">pronomine, et verbo</hi> (an
                    abridgment of part of his <hi rend="italic">Institutiones),</hi> and an
                    interesting specimen of the school teaching of grammar in the shape of complete
                    parsing by question and answer of the first twelve lines of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Aeneid</hi><hi rend="italic">(Partitiones</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >xii.</hi><hi rend="italic">versuum</hi><hi rend="italic">Aeneidos</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">principalium).</hi> The metre is discussed first, each verse is
                    scanned, and each word thoroughly and instructively examined. Its meaning, its
                    form, its accent, its class, its other cases or tenses, its compounds and
                    derivatives are all required from the pupil, as well as the rules to which they
                    ought to conform. Such parsing, rarely, if ever, takes place in modern schools.
                    A treatise on accents is ascribed to Priscian, but is rejected by modern writers
                    on the ground of matter and language. He also wrote two poems, notin any way
                    remarkable, viz., a panegyric on Anastasius in 312 hexameters with a short
                    iambic introduction, and a faithful translation into 1087 hexameters of
                    Dionysius’s <hi rend="italic">Periegesis</hi> or geographical survey of the
                    world. A few passages have, says Bernhardy, been altered by Priscian on account
                    of their heathen contents.</p>
                <p>The grammatical treatises have been critically edited, in excellent fashion, in
                    Keil’s Grammatici Latini, vols. ii. and iii., 1855-60; the Inttitutiones by
                    Martin Hertz; and the smaller treatises by Keil. The poems have been recently
                    edited by Bahrens, in his Poetae Latini Minoret, vol. v., 1883. (H. J. R.)</p>
