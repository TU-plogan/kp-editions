                    (1800-1858), a famous scientific metallurgist, was born in Kleinwaltersdorf,
                    near Freiberg in Saxony, on the 2d January 1800, and died <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n222/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0222-0213"/> in the latter town on the 22d January 1858.
                    Plattner’s father, though only a poor working miner, found the means for having
                    his son educated first at the “Berg-schule” and then at the “Bergakademie” of
                    Freiberg. After having completed his curriculum there in 1820, he obtained a
                    position in connexion with the royal mines and metal works, and was employed
                    chiefly as an assayer, in which capacity he soon became conspicuous by his rare
                    exactness and circumspection, and his constant striving after scientific
                    advancement.</p>
                <p>The mouth-blowpipe, after doing service for centuries to metal-workers as a
                    soldering tool (hence the German name Löthrohr), in the hands of Gahn and
                    subsequently of Berzelius became the most useful of instruments for the
                    qualitative testing of mineral substances. Through the efforts of the latter, in
                    fact, blowpipe analysis had developed into almost an independent branch of
                    analysis. But nobody dreamt of quantitative mouth-blowpipe assaying until
                    Harkortin 1827 (while a student in the Freiberg academy) succeeded in working
                    out a blowpipe-assay for silver. Harkort stopped there; but the idea of
                    blowpipe-assaying was taken up subsequently by Plattner, who, by bringing his
                    characteristic thoroughness, indefatigability, and unexampled dexterity to bear
                    on the subject, succeeded in working out reliable methods for all the ordinary
                    useful metals. His modes of assaying for cobalt and nickel more especially
                    quickly found favour with metallurgists, because they were more exact than the
                    then known corresponding methods of “wet-way” analysis, and required a less
                    number of hours than the latter required of days for their execution. Our
                    analytical methods for the determination of cobalt have since become far more
                    perfect but no less troublesome, and to the present day Plattner’s nickel-assay
                    is the most precise method for the estimation of this metal in complex
                    mixtures.</p>
                <p>Plattner, while working at this specialty of his own, at the same time overhauled
                    the entire field of qualitative blowpipe assaying, and ultimately summed up the
                    whole of his vast experience in his <hi rend="italic">Probirkunst</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">mit dem Löthrohr,</hi> which soon became, and to the present day
                    ranks as, the standard book on the subject. Since its first publication in 1835
                    the work has gone through four editions, apart from two independent English
                    translations.</p>
                <p>With all his high and recognized distinction in his own specialty, Plattner most
                    keenly felt that his scientific education in Freiberg had been somewhat
                    one-sided; and in 1839 he left his post and family to work for a year in
                    Heinrich Rose’s laboratory in Berlin, and supplement his knowledge of modern
                    methods of chemical analysis. While there as a student he at the same time acted
                    as a teacher in his branch, and won the lasting friendship of a number of
                    distinguished scientific men. On his return home in 1840 he was raised to the
                    rank of assessor at the Government board of mining and metallurgy, and made
                    chief of the royal department of· assaying. In 1842 he was deputed to complete a
                    course of lectures on metallurgy in the Bergakademie which had been commenced by
                    Lampadius; and he subsequently became Lampadius’s successor as professor of that
                    branch, and for the then newly instituted course of blowpipe-assaying. In
                    addition to these functions he instituted, in 1851, a special course on the
                    metallurgy of iron. He continued lecturing in the academy as long as he was
                    able,—until the session of 1856-57. It was during this period of professorial
                    activity that he made the extensive studies and experimental researches which
                    form the basis of his work <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >metallurgischen Röstprocesse theoretisch betrachtet</hi> (Freiberg, 1856). His
                    well-known <hi rend="italic">Vorlesungen über allgemeine Hüttenkunde</hi> (vol.
                    i. and ii., Freiberg, 1860) is a posthumous publication edited by Prof. Thomas
                    Richter.</p>
                <p>In addition to these great works (and the <hi rend="italic">Probirkunst)</hi>
                    Plattner published (in <hi rend="italic">Erdmann!s Journal</hi> and in <hi
                    rend="italic">Schweigger</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">s Journal</hi> and elsewhere)
                    numerous memoirs on metallurgical or mineralogical subjects, regarding which we
                    must confine ourselves to saying that they mark him as an investigator of rare
                    diligence and power. How he found time for all his original work is difficult to
                    say; it certainly did not cause him to neglect his students. He attended to them
                    in the most conscientious and efficient manner, as hundreds of his pupils all
                    over the world can testify. His marked success as a teacher was no doubt owing
                    greatly to his high personal qualities,—his cheerful, untiring, unselfish
                    devotion to duty, his kindliness of heart and manner, his freedom from all cant
                    and morbid ambition. The latter years of his life were embittered by intense
                    suffering. After a long period of lingering illness he succumbed to a disease of
                    the brain.</p>
