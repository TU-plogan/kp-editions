                    French <hi rend="italic">Plovier,</hi> which doubtless has its origin in the
                    Latin <hi rend="italic">pluvia,</hi> rain (as witness the German equivalent <hi
                    rend="italic">Regenpfeifer,</hi> Rain-fifer); but the connexion of ideas between
                    the words therein involved, so that the former should have become a bird’s name,
                    is doubtful. Belon (1555) says that the name <hi rend="italic">Pluvier</hi> is
                    bestowed “pour ce qu’on le prend mieux en temps pluvieux qu’ en nulle autre
                    saison,” which is not in accordance with modern observation, for in rainy
                    weather Plovers are wilder and harder to approach than in fine. Others have
                    thought it is from the spotted (as though with rain-drops) upper plumage of two
                    of the commonest species of Plovers, to which the name especially belongs—the
                    <hi rend="italic">Charadrius</hi><hi rend="italic">pluvialis</hi> of Linnaeus,
                    or Golden Plover, and the <hi rend="italic">Squatarola helvetica</hi> of recent
                    ornithologists, or Grey Plover. Both these birds are very similar in general
                    appearance, but the latter is the larger and has an aborted hind-toe on each
                    foot.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>But for this

                    extend further than from Iceland to western Siberia, but include the more
                    elevated tracts in the British Islands, whence in autumn it spreads itself,
                    often in immense flocks, over the cultivated districts if the fields be
                    sufficiently open. Here some will remain so long as the absence of frost or snow
                    permits, but the majority make for the Mediterranean basin, or the countries
                    beyond, in which to winter; and, as with the Grey Plover, stragglers find their
                    way to the southern extremity of Africa. The same may be said, <hi rend="italic"

                    specify the minute points in which they differ;<note anchored="true"

                    their European ally by their smaller size, their greyish-brown axillary
                    feathers, and their proportionally longer and more slender legs. All,
                    however,—and the same is the case with the Grey Plover, —undergo precisely the
                    same seasonal change of colour, greatly altering their appearance and equally
                    affecting both sexes. In the course of spring or early summer nearly the whole
                    of the lower plumage from the chin to the vent, which during winter has been
                    nearly pure white, becomes deep black. This is partly due to the growth of new
                    feathers, but partly to some of the old feathers actually changing their colour,
                    though the way in which the alteration is brought about is still uncertain.<note

                    that ornithologists favourably situated in regard to zoological gardens have not
                    more extensively used opportunities which might thus be accorded to them of
                    conducting useful observations on this subject and others of similar kind.
                    Elsewhere it would be hardly possible to carry on such an investigation, and
                    even under the best circumstances it would not be easy and would require
                    unremitting attention. The results of some partial observations superintended by

                    observable in the upper plumage; but this seems chiefly due (as in many other
                    birds) to the shedding of the lighter-coloured margins of the feathers, and does
                    not produce so complete a transformation of appearance, though the beauty of the

                    to the name, which is also extended to some other more distant forms that can
                    here have only the briefest notice. Among them one of the most remarkable is the
                    “Zickzack” (so called from its cry)—the τροχίλος of Herodotus (see <hi
