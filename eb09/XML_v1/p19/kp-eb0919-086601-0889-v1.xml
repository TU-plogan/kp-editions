                    rend="smallcaps">Joseph</hi> (1809-1865), a well-known revolutionary writer, was
                    born in 1809 at Besançon, France, the native place also of the socialist
                    Fourier. His origin was of the humblest, his father being a brewer’s cooper; and
                    the boy herded cows and followed other simple pursuits of a like nature. But he
                    was not entirely self-educated; at sixteen he entered the college of his native
                    place, though his family was so poor thqt he could not procure the necessary
                    books, and had to borrow them from his mates in order to copy the lessons. There
                    is a story of the young Proudhon returning home laden with prizes, but to find
                    that there was no dinner for him. At nineteen he became a working compositor;
                    afterwards he rose to be a corrector for the press, reading proofs of
                    ecclesiastical works, and thereby acquiring a very competent knowledge of
                    theology. In this way also he came to learn Hebrew, and to compare it with
                    Greek, Latin, and French; and it was the first proof of his intellectual
                    audacity that on the strength of this he wrote an “Essai de grammaire générale.”
                    As Proudhon knew nothing whatever of the true principles of philology, his
                    treatise was of no value. In 1838 he obtained the <hi rend="italic">pension
                    Suard,</hi> a bursary of 1500 francs a year for three years, for the
                    encouragement of young men of promise, which was in the gift of the academy of
                    Besançon, In 1839 he wrote a treatise “On the Utility of Keeping the Sunday,”
                    which contained the germs of his revolutionary ideas. About this time he went to
                    Paris, where he lived a poor, ascetic, and studious life,—making acquaintance,
                    however, with the socialistic ideas which were then fomenting in the capital. In
                    1840 he published his first work <hi rend="italic">Qu'est-ce</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">que la Propriété</hi><hi rend="italic">1</hi> His famous answer to
                    this question, “La propriété, c’est le vol,” naturally did not please the

                <p>For his third memoir on property, which took the shape of a letter to the
                    Fourierist, Μ. Considérant, he was tried at Besançon but was acquitted. In 1846
                    he published his greatest work, the <hi rend="italic">Système</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">des Contradictions</hi><hi rend="italic">économiques ou
                    Philosophie de la Misère.</hi> For some time Proudhon carried on a small
                    printing establishment at Besançon, but without success; afterwards he became
                    connected as a kind of manager with a commercial firm at Lyons. In 1847 he left
                    this employment, and finally settled in Paris, where he was now becoming
                    celebrated as a leader of innovation. He regretted the sudden outbreak of the
                    revolution of February (1848), because it found the social reformers unprepared.
                    But he threw himself with ardour into the conflict of opinion, and soon gained a
                    national notoriety. He was the moving spirit of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Représentant du Peuple</hi> and other journals, in which the most advanced
                    theories were advocated in the strongest language; and as member of assembly for
                    the Seine department he brought forward his celebrated proposal of exacting an
                    impost of one-third on interest and rent, which of course was rejected. His
                    attempt to found a bank which should operate by granting gratuitous credit was
                    also a complete failure; of the five million francs which he required only
                    seventeen thousand were offered. The violence of his utterances led to an
                    imprisonment at Paris for three years, during which he married a young working
                    woman. As Proudhon aimed at economic rather than political innovation, he had no
                    special quarrel with the second empire, and he lived in comparative quiet under
                    it till the publication of his work,_Z&gt;&lt;? <hi rend="italic">la

                    and other existing institutions with unusual fury. This time he fled to Brussels
                    to escape imprisonment. On his return to France his health broke down, though he
                    continued to write. He died at Passy in 1865.</p>

                <p>Personally Proudhon was one of the most remarkable figures of modern France. His
                    life was marked by the severest simplicity and even Puritanism; he was
                    affectionate in his domestic relations, a most loyal friend, and strictly
                    Upright in conduct. He was strongly opposed to the prevailing French socialism
                    of his time because of its utopianism and immorality; and, though he uttered all
                    manner of wild paradox and vehement invective against the dominant ideas and
                    institutions, he Was remarkably free from feelings of personal hate. In all that
                    he said and did he was the son of the people, who had not been broken to the
                    usual social and academic discipline; hence his roughness, his one-sidedness,
                    and his exaggerations; but he is always vigorous, and often brilliant and
                    original.</p>
                <p>It would of course be impossible to reduce the ideas of such an irregular thinker
                    to systematic form. In later years Proudhon himself confessed that “the great
                    part of his publications formed only a work of dissection and ventilation, so to
                    speak, by means of which he slowly makes his way towards a superior conception
                    of political and economic laws.” Yet the groundwork of his teaching is clear and
                    firm; no one could insist with greater emphasis on the demonstrative character
                    of economic principles as understood by himself. He strongly believed in the
                    absolute truth of a few moral ideas, with which it was the aim of his teaching
                    to mould and suffuse political economy. Of these fundamental ideas, justice,
                    liberty, and equality were the chief. What he desiderated, for instance, in an
                    ideal society was the most perfect equality of remuneration. It was his
                    principle that service pays service, that a day’s labour balances a day’s
                    labour—in other words, that the duration of labour is the just measure of value.
                    He did not shrink from any of the consequences of this theory, for he would give
                    the same remuneration to the worst mason as to a Phidias; but he looks forward
                    also to a period in human development when the present inequality in the talent
                    and capacity of men would be reduced to an inappreciable minimum. From the great
                    principle of service as the equivalent of service is derived his axiom that
                    property is the right of <hi rend="italic">aubaine.</hi> The <hi rend="italic"
                    >aul·ain</hi> was a stranger not naturalized; and the right of <hi rend="italic"
                    >aubaine</hi> was the right in virtue of which the sovereign claimed the goods
                    of such a stranger who had died in his territory. Property is a right of the
                    same nature, with a like power of appro-f&gt;riation in the form of rent,
                    interest, &amp;c. It reaps without abour, consumes without producing, and enjoys
                    without exertion. Proudhon’s aim, therefore, was to realize a science of society
                    resting on principles of justice, liberty, and equality thus understood; “a
                    science absolute, rigorous, based on the nature of man and of his faculties, and
                    on their mutual relations; a science which we have not to invent, but to
                    discover.” But he saw clearly that such ideas with their necessary
                    accompaniments could only be realized through a long and laborious process of
                    social transformation. As we have said, he strongly detested the prurient
                    immorality of the schools of Saint-Simon and Fourier. He attacked them not less
                    bitterly for thinking that society could be changed off-hand by a ready-made and
                    complete scheme of reform. It was “the most accursed lie,” he said, “that could
                    be offered to mankind.” In social change he distinguishes between the transition
                    and the perfection or achievement. With regard to the transition he advocated
                    the progressive abolition of the right of <hi rend="italic">aubaine,</hi> by
                    reducing interest, rent, &amp;c. For the goal he professed only to give the
                    general principles; he had no ready-made scheme, no utopia. The positive
                    organization of the new society in its details was a labour that would require
                    fifty Montesquieus. The organization he desired was one on collective
                    principles, a free association which would take account of the division of
                    labour, and which would maintain the personality both of the man and the
                    citizen. With his strong and fervid feeling for human dignity and liberty,
                    Proudhon could not have tolerated any theory of social change that did not give
                    full scope for the free development of man. Connected with this was his famous
                    paradox of <hi rend="italic">anarchy,</hi> as the goal of the free development
                    of society, by which he meant that through the ethical progress of men
                    government should become unnecessary. “Government of man by man in every form,”
                    he says, “is oppression. The highest perfection of society is found in the union
                    of order and <hi rend="italic">anarchy.”</hi></p>
                <p>Proudhon’s theory of property as the right of <hi rend="italic">aubaine</hi> is
                    substantially the same as the theory of capital held by Marx and most of the
                    later socialists. Property and capital are defined and treated as the power of
                    exploiting the labour of other men, of claiming the results of labour without
                    giving an equivalent. Proudhon’s famous paradox, “Lapropriété, c’est le vol,” is
                    merely a trenchant expression of this general principle. As slavery is
                    assassination inasmuch as it destroys all that is valuable and desirable in
                    human personality, so property is theft inasmuch as it appropriates the value
                    produced by the labour of others in the form of rent, interest, or profit
                    without rendering an equivalent. For property Proudhon would substitute
                    individual possession, the right of occupation being equal for all men (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Socialism).</hi></p>
