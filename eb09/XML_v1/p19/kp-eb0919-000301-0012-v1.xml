                <p><label type="entry">PHYSIOGNOMY</label>. By the Act of Parliament 17 George II.
                    c. 5 all persons pretending to have skill in physiognomy were deemed rogues and
                    vagabonds, and were liable to be publicly whipped, or sent to the house of
                    correction until next sessions.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The Act 39 Elizabeth c. 4 declared “all persons fayning to
                    have knowledge of Phisiognomie or like Fantasticall Ymaginacions” liable to “be
                    stripped naked from the middle upwards and openly whipped until his body be
                    bloudye.” This was modified by 13 Anne c. 26, still further by 17 George II. c.
                    5, which was re-enacted by 5 George IV. c. 83. This last Act only specifies
                    palmistry.</p></note> The pursuit thus stigmatized as unlawful is one of great
                    antiquity, and one which in ancient and mediaeval times had an extensive though
                    now almost forgotten literature. Physiognomy was regarded by those who
                    cultivated it as a twofold science— (1) a mode of discriminating character by
                    the outward appearance and (2) a method of divination from form and feature. It
                    was very early noticed that the good and evil passions by their continual
                    exercise stamp their impress on the face, and that each particular passion has
                    its own expression. Thus far physiognomy is a branch of physiology, and from a
                    very early age of human thought it attracted philosophic attention. But in its
                    second aspect it touched astrology, of which Galen<note anchored="true"

                    sexes, and the characters derived from the different features, and from colour,
                    hair, body, limbs, gait, and voice. He compares the varieties of mankind to
                    animals, the male to the lion, the female to the leopard. The general character
                    of the work may be gathered from the following specimen. While discussing noses,
                    he says that those with thick bulbous ends belong to persons who are
                    insensitive, swinish; sharp-tipped belong to the irascible, those easily
                    provoked, like dogs; rounded, large, obtuse noses to the magnanimous, the
                    lion-like; slender hooked noses to the eagle-like, the noble but grasping;
                    round-tipped retroussé noses to the luxurious, like barndoor fowl; noses with a
                    very slight notch at the root belong to the impudent, the crow-like; while snub
                    noses belong to persons of luxurious habits, whom he compares to deer; open
                    nostrils are signs of passion, &amp;c. Several good editions have been

                    is the next in order who has left a treatise on the subject, similar in
                    character to that of Aristotle; but he excels in graphic descriptions of
                    different dispositions and differs only from Aristotle in some of his animal

                    by Nicholas Petreius in 1534. This book was referred to by Albertus Magnus, who
                    attributes to its author a second work on the subject. A more important
                    contribution to the literature of physiognomy was added by a converted Jew,
                    Adamantins, about 415. This work is in two books, the first on the expression of
                    the eye, the second on physiognomy in general, mostly Aristotelian in character.
                    He professes to have learned much from the Egyptians, and tells us that nature
                    speaks in the forehead and face and in the silence of the mouth. He follows
                    Aristotle in holding rather a low opinion of the intellect of the female sex,
                    whom he makes the subject of some rather depreciating comparisons. His work was

                    as Christ’s could have been provided with a suitable body in such a way? Sir
                    George Wharton quotes the text Job xxxvii. 7, “He impresseth (□iri∏') the hand
                    of every man, that all may know His work,” as an authority for chiromancy, and
                    other chiromantists have followed him in so doing.<note anchored="true"

                <p>Hitherto the physiognomy of the schools had been chiefly descriptive; in the
                    succeeding period the astrological side, whose gradual development may be noted,
                    becomes the most important part. Hence in the subsequent or second stage of
                    history chiromancy is specially predictive in character, and attains an
                    importance it had not originally possessed. The treatises also contain
                    occasional digressions on onychomancy, alectoromancy, clido-mancy, coscinomancy,
                    podoscopy, spasmatomancy, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Along with the medical science of the period the Arabians took up the study of
                    physiognomy: 'Alf b. Ragel wrote a book on naevi; Rhazes (1040) devoted several
                    chapters of his medical work to it; and Averroes (1165) made many references to
                    it in his <hi rend="italic">De Sanitate</hi> (p. 82, Leyden, 1537). Avicenna
                    also makes some acute physiognomical remarks in his <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Animalibus,</hi> which was translated by Michael Scott about 1270,
                    but printed subsequently (without date or place). Albertus Magnus (born 1205)
                    devotes much of the second tract of his <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Animalibus</hi> to the consideration of physiognomy. There is,
                    however, nothing original in the treatise, which largely consists of extracts
                    from Aristotle, Polemon, and Loxus. He does not enter so much into the animal
                    comparisons of his predecessors, but occupies himself chiefly with simple
                    descriptive physiognomy as indicative of character; and the same is true of the
                    many scattered notes in the writings of Duns Scotus and Thomas Aquinas. The
                    famous sage of Balwearie, Michael Scott, while court astrologer to the emperor
                    Frederick II., wrote his treatise <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >hominis</hi><hi rend="italic">phisionomia</hi> (c. 1272), much of which is
                    physiological and of curious interest. It was not printed until 1477, and the
                    edition was not illustrated. The physiognomical treatise forms the third part of
                    his work <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">secretis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">naturae.</hi> In 1335 Petrus de Abano of Padua delivered in Paris
                    a course of lectures on this subject (afterwards edited by Blondus, 1544), a few
                    years before he was burned for heresy. Shortly after the introduction of
                    printing in the 15th century a large number of works on physiognomy were
                    produced; probably the oldest is the block book by Hartlieb, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Die Kunst Ciromantia.</hi> This is an exceedingly rare folio, of which one fine
                    copy is extant in Paris; each page bears a figure of a giant hand from 7 to 10 J
                    inches long, inscribed with characteristic words, and with a small amount of
                    description below; there are twenty-seven such <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n14/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0014-0005"/> plates. A description of another perfect copy
                    belonging to Earl Spencer occurs in Dibdin’s <hi rend="italic">Bibliographical
                    Decameron</hi> (1817), vol. i. p. 143, and four imperfect copies are known to
                    exist elsewhere. The date of Hartlieb’s work is probably 1470. This and Michael
                    Scott’s books were the first printed works on the subject.</p>
                <p>The 16th century was particularly rich in publications on physiognomy. Not only
                    were the classical works printed, but additions were made to the literature by
                    Codes, Corvus, Johannes de Indagine, Cornaro, Blondus, Douxciel, Pompeius
                    Ronnseus, Gratarolus, Niquetius, Pomponius Gauricus, Tricassus, Cardan,
                    Tiberius, Thaddaeus ab Hayek, Taisnierus, Rizzacasa, Campanella, Hund,
                    Picci-olus, Rothman, Johannes Padovanus, and, last and greatest of all,
                    Giambattista della Porta. Several works also appeared in England, the earliest
                    being the anonymous <hi rend="italic">On the Art of foretelling Future Events by
                    Inspection of the Hand</hi> (London, 1504). A second anonymous work, <hi
                    rend="italic">A pleasant Introduction to the Art of</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Chiromancie</hi><hi rend="italic">and</hi><hi rend="italic">Physiognomie,</hi>
                    was published at the same place in 1558. Neither of these is of any merit. The
                    first English work with the author’s name is that of Dr Thomas Hill (1571), <hi
                    rend="italic">The Contemplation of Mankynde, contayning a singular Discourse
                    after the Art of Phisiognomie.</hi> This is rather quaintly written, but is
                    simply an adaptation from the Italian writers of the day. Another anonymous
                    author about this period, but whose work has no date, writes, under the name
                    “Merlin Britannicus,” upon moles and naevi after the model of 'Ali b. Ragel. The
                    word “physiognomy” had been introduced into England before this century, and,
                    from analogy with the Greek, had been used in the sense of the outward
                    appearance, or the face: thus in Udall’s translation of the paraphrase of
                    Erasmus on Mark iv. it occurs spelt “phisnomi”; the pugnacious bishop of Ossory,
                    Bale, in his <hi rend="italic">English Votaries,</hi> spells it “physnomie” (pt.
                    i. ch. ii. p. 44).</p>
                <p>The rise of the study of anatomy served largely to bring physiognomy into
                    discredit by substituting real facts for fictions; hence in the 17th century its
                    literature, while not smaller in quantity, was less important in quality. The
                    principal authors are Goclenius, Fuchs, Timpler, Tischbein, Gallimard,
                    Moldenarius, Septalius, Hertod, Scarlatini, Saunders, Withers, Helvetius,
                    Lebrun, Elsholtius, De la Bellière, Philipp May, Evelyn, Freius, Baldus,
                    Torreblanca, Otto, Bui wer, Rhyne, Merbitzius, Fludd, Zanardus, Finella,
                    Tamburini, Etzler, Vecchius, Praetorius, De la Chambre, and Giraldus.</p>
                <p>The 18th century shows a still greater decline of interest in physiognomy.
                    Historians of philosophy, like Meursius and Franz, re-edited some of the
                    classical works, and Fülleborn reviewed the relation of physiognomy to
                    philosophy. Indeed the only name worthy of note is that of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >La Vater</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.).</hi> The other authors of this century
                    are Peuschel, Spon, Lichtenberg, Schutz, Wegelin, Pernetty, Girtanner, Grohmann,
                    and several anonymous writers, and from the anatomical side Lancisi, Parsons,
                    and Peter Camper. The popular style, good illustrations, and pious spirit
                    pervading the writings of Lavater have given to them a popularity they little
                    deserved, as there is really no system in his work, which largely consists of
                    rhapsodical comments upon the several portraits. Having a happy knack of
                    estimating character, especially when acquainted with the histories of the
                    persons in question, the good pastor contrived to write a graphic and readable
                    book, but one much inferior to Porta’s or Aristotle’s as a systematic treatise.
                    With him the descriptive school of physiognomists may be said to have ended, as
                    the astrological physiognomy expired with De la Bellière. The few straggling
                    works which have since appeared are scarcely deserving of notice, the rising
                    attraction of phrenology having given to pure physiognomy the <hi rend="italic"
                    >coup de grâce</hi> by taking into itself whatever was likely to live of the
                    older science. The writers of this century are Hörstig, Maas, Rainer, Cross,
                    Stöhr, Sehler, Diez, Carus, Piderit, Burgess, and Gratiolet.</p>
                <p>The physiological school of physiognomy was foreshadowed by Parsons and founded
                    by Sir Charles Bell, as his <hi rend="italic">Essay on the Anatomy of
                    Expression,</hi> published in 1806, was the first really scientific study of
                    expression. He was one of the first who accurately correlated the motions
                    expressive of the passions with the muscles which produce them, and in the later
                    editions of his work these descriptions are much enlarged and improved. Shortly
                    after the appearance of the first edition of Bell’s <hi rend="italic">Essay</hi>
                    Moreau published his first edition of Lavater along somewhat the same lines
                    (1807). The experiments of Duchenne <hi rend="italic">(Mécanisme de la
                    Physionomie Humaine,</hi> Paris, 1862) showed that by the use of electricity the
                    action of the separate muscles could be studied and by the aid of photography
                    accurately represented. These tested and confirmed by experimental demonstration
                    the hypothetic conclusions of Bell. The machinery of expression having thus been
                    clearly followed out, the correlation of the physical actions and the psychical
                    states was made the subject of speculation by Spencer <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Psychology,</hi> 1855), and such speculations were first reduced to a system
                    by Darwin <hi rend="italic">(Expression of Emotions,</hi> 1872), who formulated
                    and illustrated the following as fundamental principles.</p>
                <p>(1) Certain complex acts are of direct or indirect service under certain
                    conditions of the mind in order to relieve or gratify certain sensations or
                    desires; and whenever the same state of mind is induced the same set of actions
                    tend to be performed, even when they have ceased to be of use. (2) When a
                    directly opposite state of mind is induced to one with which a definite action
                    is correlated, there is a strong and involuntary tendency to perform a reverse
                    action. (3) When the sensorium is strongly excited nerve-force is generated in
                    excess, and is transmitted in definite directions, depending on the connexions
                    of nerve-cells and on habit.</p>
                <p>It follows from these propositions that the expression of emotion is for the most
                    part not under the control of the will, and that those striped muscles are the
                    most expressive which are the least voluntary. The philosophy of physiognomy may
                    be formulated upon this definite theoretic basis. (1) The actions we look upon
                    as expressive of emotions are such as at some time were serviceable in relieving
                    or gratifying the desires or sensations accompanying the emotion. (2) Such
                    actions become habitually associated with the mental condition and continue even
                    where their utility is lost. (3) Certain muscles which produce these actions
                    become from habitual action strengthened, and, when the skin diminishes in
                    fulness and elasticity with advancing age, the action of the muscle produces
                    furrows or wrinkles in the skin at right angles to the course of the fibres of
                    the muscle. (4) As the mental disposition and proneness to action are inherited
                    by children from parents, so the facility and proneness to expression are
                    similarly developed under the law of heredity. (5) To some extent habitual
                    muscular action and the habitual flow of nerve-force in certain directions may
                    alter the contour of such bones and cartilages as are thereby acted upon by the
                    muscles of expression. Illustrations of these theoretic propositions are to be
                    found in the works of Bell, Duchenne, and Darwin, to which the student maybe
                    referred for further information.</p>
                <p>For information on artistic anatomy as applied to physiognomy see the catalogue
                    of sixty-two authors by Ludwig Choulant, <hi rend="italic">Geschichte und

                    rehabilitate palmistry by D’Arpentigny and Desbarrolles, for summaries of which
                    see the works of Beamish and Craig. For physiognomy of disease, besides the
