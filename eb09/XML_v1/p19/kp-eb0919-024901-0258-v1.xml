                <p><label type="entry">PNEUMONIA, or inflammation of the substance of the
                    lungs</label>, manifests itself in several forms which differ from each other in
                    their nature, causes, and results,—viz., (1) Acute Croupous or Lobar Pneumonia,
                    the most common form of the disease, in which the inflammation affects a limited
                    area, usually a lobe or lobes of the lung, and runs a rapid course; (2)
                    Catarrhal Pneumonia, Broncho-Pneumonia, or Lobular Pneumonia, which occurs as a
                    result of antecedent bronchitis, and is more diffuse in its distribution than
                    the former; (3) Interstitial Pneumonia or Cirrhosis of the lung, a more chronic
                    form of inflammation, which affects chiefly the framework or fibrous stroma of
                    the lung and is closely allied to phthisis.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Acute Croupous or Lobar Pneumonia.—</hi> This is the disease
                    commonly known as inflammation of the lungs. It derives its name from its
                    pathological characters, which are well marked. The changes which take place in
                    the lung are chiefly three. (1) <hi rend="italic">Congestion,</hi> or
                    engorgement, the blood-vessels being distended and the lung more voluminous and
                    heavier than normal, and of dark red colour. Its air cells still contain air.
                    (2) <hi rend="italic">Red Hepatization,</hi> so called from its resemblance to
                    liver tissue. In this stage there is poured into the air cells of the affected
                    part an exudation consisting of amorphous fibrin together with epithelial cells
                    and red and white blood corpuscles, the λvhole forming a viscid mass which
                    occupies not only <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n259/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0259-0250"/> the cells but also the finer bronchi, and which
                    speedily coagulates, causing the lung to become firmly consolidated. In this
                    condition the cells are entirely emptied of air, their blood-vessels are pressed
                    upon by the exudation, and the lung substance, rendered brittle, sinks in water.
                    The appearance of a section of the lung in this stage has been likened to that
                    of red granite. It is to the character of the exudation, consisting largely of
                    coagulable fibrin, that the term croupous is due. (3) <hi rend="italic">Grey
                    Hepatization.</hi> In this stage the lung still retains its liver-like
                    consistence, but its colour is now grey, not unlike the appearance of grey
                    granite. This is due to the change taking place in the exudation, which
                    undergoes resolution by a process of fatty degeneration, pus formation,
                    liquefaction, and ultimately absorption,—so that in a comparatively short period
                    the air vesicles get rid of their morbid contents and resume their normal
                    function. This is happily the termination of the majority of cases of croupous
                    pneumonia, yet it occasionally happens that this favourable result is not
                    attained, and that further changes of a retrograde kind take place in the
                    inflamed lung in the form of suppuration and abscess or of gangrene. In such
                    instances there usually exists some serious constitutional cause which
                    contributes to give this unfavourable direction to the course of the disease.
                    Further, pneumonia may in some instances become chronic, the lung never entirely
                    clearing up, and it may terminate in phthisis. Pneumonia may be confined to a
                    portion or the whole of one lung, or it may be double, affecting both lungs,
                    which is a serious and often fatal form. The bases or middle of the lungs are
                    the parts most commonly inflamed, but the apex is sometimes the only part
                    affected. The right lung is considerably more frequently the seat of pneumonia
                    than the left lung.</p>
                <p>Many points in the pathology of this form of pneumonia remain still to be cleared
                    up. Thus there is a growing opinion that it is not a simple lung inflammation,
                    as was formerly supposed, but that, as regards its origin, progress, and
                    termination, it possesses many of the characters of a fever or of a
                    constitutional affection. An interesting and important fact in this connexion is
                    the recent discovery by Friedländer and others of a micro-organism or bacillus
                    in the blood, lungs, and other tissues in cases of pneumonia, which, when
                    inoculated into certain lower animals, is followed by the symptoms and
                    appearances characteristic of that disease. While it must be confessed that such
                    inoculation experiments carried on in rabbits, guinea pigs, or mice are scarcely
                    sufficient by themselves to settle the question of the specific and infectious
                    nature of pneumonia as it affects the human subject, yet they are of distinct
                    value as evidence pointing in that direction. Further, there are numerous
                    instances on record in which this disease has appeared to spread as an epidemic
                    in localities or in families in such a way as strongly to suggest the idea of
                    infectiveness. Cases of this kind, however, are open to the question as to
                    whether there may not coexist some other disease, such as a fever, of which the
                    pneumonia present is but a complication. The whole subject of the pathology of
                    pneumonia is still under investigation, and all that can in the meantime be
                    affirmed is that it presents many features which render its phenomena unlike
                    those of an ordinary inflammation, while on the other hand it has strong
                    analogies to some of the specific fevers. As regards known causes, in the vast
                    majority of instances an attack of pneumonia comes on as the result of exposure
                    to cold as the exciting agent, while such conditions as fatigue and physical or
                    mental depression are often traceable as powerful predisposing influences.</p>
                <p>The symptoms of acute pneumonia are generally well marked from the beginning. The
                    attack is usually ushered in by a rigor (or in children a convulsion,, together
                    with vomiting and the·speedy development of the febrile condition, the
                    temperature rising to a considerable degree—101° to 104° or more. The pulse is
                    quickened, and there is a marked disturbance in the respiration, which is rapid,
                    shallow, and difficult, the rate being usually accelerated to some two or three
                    times its normal amount. The lips are livid, and the face has a dusky flush.
                    Pain in the side is felt, especially should any amount of pleurisy be present,
                    as is often the case. Cough is an early symptom. It is at first frequent and
                    hacking, and is accompanied with a little tough colourless expectoration, which
                    soon, however, becomes more copious and of a rusty brown colour, either
                    tenacious or frothy and liquid. Microscopically this consists mainly of
                    epithelium, casts of the air cells, and fine bronchi, together with granular
                    matter and blood and pus corpuscles.</p>
                <p>The following are the chief physical signs in the various stages of the disease.
                    In the stage of congestion fine crackling or crepitation is heard over the
                    affected area; sometimes there is very little change from the natural breathing.
                    In the stage of red hepatization the affected side of the chest is seen to
                    expand less freely than the opposite side; there is dulness on percussion, and
                    increase of the vocal fremitus; while on auscultation the breath sounds are
                    tubular or bronchial in character, with, it may be, some amount of fine
                    crepitation in certain parts. In the stage of grey hepatization the percussion
                    note is still dull and the breathing tubular, but crepitations of coarser
                    quality than before are also audible. These various physical signs disappear
                    more or less rapidly during convalescence. With the progress of the inflammation
                    the febrile symptoms and rapid breathing continue. The patient during the
                    greater part of the disease lies on the back or on the affected side. The pulse,
                    which at first was full, becomes small and soft owing to the interruption to the
                    pulmonary circulation. Occasionally slight jaundice is present, due probably to
                    a similar cause. The urine is scanty, sometimes albuminous, and its chlorides
                    are diminished. In favourable cases, however severe, there generally occurs
                    after six or eight days a distinct crisis, marked by a rapid fall of the
                    temperature accompanied with perspiration and with a copious discharge of
                    lithates in the urine. Although no material change is as yet noticed in the
                    physical signs, the patient breathes more easily, sleep returns, and
                    convalescence advances rapidly in the majority of instances. In unfavourable
                    cases death may take place either from the extent of the inflammatory action,
                    especially if the pneumonia is double, from excessive fever, from failure of the
                    heart’s action or general strength at about the period of the crisis, or again
                    from the disease assuming from the first a low adynamic form with delirium and
                    with scanty expectoration of greenish or “prune juice” appearance. Such cases
                    are seen in persons worn out in strength, in the aged, and especially in the
                    intemperate. Death may also take place later from abscess or gangrene of the
                    lung; or again recovery may be imperfect and the disease pass into a chronic
                    pneumonia.</p>
                <p>The treatment of acute pneumonia, which at one time was conducted on the
                    antiphlogistic or lowering principle, has of late years undergone a marked
                    change; and it is now generally held that in ordinary cases very little active
                    interference is called for, the disease tending to run its course very much as a
                    specific fever. The employment of blood-letting once so general is now only in
                    rare instances resorted to; but, just as in pleurisy, pain and difficulty of
                    breathing may sometimes be relieved by the application of a few leeches to the
                    affected side. In severe cases the cautious employment of aconite or antimony at
                    the outset appears useful in diminishing the force of the inflammatory action.
                    Warm applications in the form of poultices to the chest give comfort in many
                    cases. Cough is relieved by expectorants, of which those containing carbonate of
                    ammonia are specially useful. Any tendency to excessive fever may often be held
                    in check by quinine. The patient should be fed with milk, soups, and other light
                    forms of nourishment. In the later period of the disease stimulants may be
                    called for, but most reliance is to be placed on nutritious aliment. After the
                    acute symptoms disappear counter-irritation by iodine or a blister will often
                    prove of service in promoting the absorption of the inflammatory products. After
                    recovery is complete the health should for some time be watched with care.</p>
                <p>When pneumonia is complicated with any other ailment or itself complicates some
                    pre-existing malady, it must be dealt with on principles applicable to these
                    conditions as they may affect the individual case.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Catarrhal or Lobular Pneumonia</hi> (Broncho-Pneumonia) differs
                    from the last in several important pathological and clinical points. Here the
                    inflammation is more diffuse and tends to affect lobules of lung tissue here and
                    there, rather than one or more lobes as in croupous pneumonia. At first the
                    affected patches are dense, non-crepitant, with a bluish red appearance tending
                    to become grey or yellow. Under the microscope the air vesicles and finer
                    bronchi are crowded with cells, the result of the inflammatory process, but
                    there is no fibrinous exudation such as is present in croupous pneumona. In
                    favourable cases resolution takes place by fatty degeneration, liquefaction, and
                    absorption of the cells, but on the other hand they may undergo caseous
                    degenerative changes, abscesses may form, or a condition of chronic interstitial
                    pneumonia be developed in both of which cases the condition passes into one of
                    phthisis. Evidence of previous bronchitis is usually present in the lungs
                    affected with catarrhal pneumonia. In the great majority of instances catarrhal
                    pneumonia <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n260/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0260-0251"/> occurs as an accompaniment or sequel of
                    bronchitis either from the inflammation passing from the finer bronchi to the
                    pulmonary air vesicles, or from its affecting portions of lung which have
                    undergone collapse. It occurs most frequently in children, and is often
                    connected with some pre-existing acute ailment in which the bronchi are
                    implicated, such as measles or hooping cough. It likewise affects adults and
                    aged people in a more chronic form as the result of bronchitis. Sometimes a
                    condition of catarrhal pneumonia may be set up by the plugging of one or more
                    branches of the pulmonary artery, as may occur in heart disease, pyaemia,
                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The symptoms characterizing the onset of catarrhal pneumonia in its more acute
                    form are the occurrence during an attack of bronchitis of a sudden and marked
                    elevation of temperature, together with a quickened pulse and increased
                    difficulty in breathing. The cough becomes short and painful, and there is
                    little or no expectoration. The physical signs are not distinct, being mixed up
                    with those of the antecedent bronchitis; but, should the pneumonia be extensive,
                    there may be an impaired percussion note with tubular breathing and some
                    bronchophony.</p>
                <p>Acute catarrhal pneumonia must be regarded as a condition of serious import. It
                    is apt to run rapidly to a fatal termination, but on the other hand a favourable
                    result is not unfrequent if it is recognized in time to admit of efficient
                    treatment. In the more chronic form it tends to assume the characters of chronic
                    phthisis (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Phthisis).</hi> The treatment is essentially
                    that for the more severe forms of bronchitis (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Bronchitis),</hi> where, in addition to expectorants, together with ammoniacal,
                    ethereal, and alcoholic stimulants, the maintenance of the strength by good
                    nourishment and tonics is clearly indicated. The breathing may often be relieved
                    by light warm applications to the chest and back. Convalescence is often
                    prolonged, and special care will always be required in view of the tendency of
                    the disease to develop into phthisis.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Chronic Interstitial Pneumonia or Cirrhosis of the Lung</hi> is
                    a slow inflammatory change affecting chiefly one portion of the lung texture,
                    viz., its fibrous stroma.</p>
                <p>The changes produced in the lung by this disease are marked chiefly by the growth
                    of nucleated fibroid tissue around the walls of the bronchi and vessels, and in
                    the intervesicular septa, which proceeds to such an extent as to invade and
                    obliterate the air cells. The lung, which is at first enlarged, becomes
                    shrunken, dense in texture, and solid, any unaffected portions being
                    emphysematous; the bronchi are dilated, the pleura thickened, and the lung
                    substance often deeply pigmented, especially in the case of miners, who are apt
                    to suffer from this disease. In its later stages the lung breaks down, and
                    cavities form in its substance as in ordinary phthisis.</p>
                <p>This condition is usually present to a greater or less degree in almost all
                    chronic diseases of the lungs and bronchi, but it is specially apt to arise in
                    an extensive form from pre-existing catarrhal pneumonia, and not unfrequently
                    occurs in connexion with occupations which necessitate the habitual inhalation
                    of particles of dust, such as those of colliers, flax-dressers, stonemasons,
                    millers, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The symptoms are very similar to those of chronic phthisis (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Phthisis),</hi> especially increasing difficulty of breathing,
                    particularly on exertion, cough either dry or with expectoration,· sometimes
                    copious and fetid. In the case of coal-miners the sputum is black from
                    containing carbonaceous matter.</p>
                <p>The physical signs are deficient expansion of the affected side— the disease
                    being mostly confined to one lung—increasing dulness on percussion, tubular
                    breathing, and moist sounds. As the disease progresses retraction of the side
                    becomes manifest, and the heart and liver may be displaced. Ultimately the
                    condition both as regards physical signs and symptoms takes the characters of
                    the later stages of phthisis with colliquative symptoms, increasing emaciation,
                    and death. Occasionally dropsy is present from the heart becoming affected in
                    the course of the disease. The malady is usually of long duration, many cases
                    remaining for years in a stationary condition and even undergoing temporary
                    improvement in mild weather, but the tendency is on the whole downward.</p>
                <p>The treatment is conducted on similar principles to those applicable in the case
                    of phthisis. Should the malady be connected with a particular occupation, the
                    disease might be averted or at least greatly modified by early withdrawal from
                    such source of irritation. (J. 0. A.)</p>
