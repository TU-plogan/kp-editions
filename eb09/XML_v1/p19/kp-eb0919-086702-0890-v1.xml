                    rend="smallcaps">Language.</hi> —Provençal is a name used to comprehend all the
                    varieties of Romanic speech formerly spoken and written, and still generally
                    used by country people, in the south of France. The geographical limits of this
                    infinitely varied idiom cannot be defined with precision, because it is
                    conterminous on the north, south, and east with idioms of the same family, with
                    which almost at every point it blends by insensible gradations. Roughly
                    speaking, it may be said to be contained between the Atlantic on the west, the
                    Pyrenees and Mediterranean on the south, and the Alps on the east, and to be
                    bounded on the north by a line proceeding from the Gironde to the Alps, and
                    passing through the departments of Gironde, Dordogne, Haute Vienne, Creuse,
                    Allier, Loire, Rhone, Isère, and Savoie. These limits are to some extent
                    conventional. True, they are fixed in accordance with the mean of linguistic
                    characters; but it is self-evident that according to the importance attached to
                    one character or another they may be determined differently.</p>

                    >consensus,</hi> or that it rests upon any very firm historical basis. In the
                    southern part of Gaul, Romanic developed itself, so to say, in the natural state
                    of language. Contrary to what took place in other Romanic countries, no local
                    variety here raised itself to the rank of the literary idiom <hi rend="italic"
                    >par excellence.</hi> While in Italy the Florentine, in France the French
                    dialect proper (that is to say, the dialect of the île de France), succeeded
                    little by little in monopolizing literary use, to the exclusion of the other
                    dialects, we do not find that either the Marseillais or the Toulousain idiom was
                    ever spoken or written outside of Marseilles or Toulouse. In consequence of this
                    circumstance, no name originally designating the language of a town or of a
                    small district came to be employed to designate the language of the whole of
                    southern France; and on the other hand the geographical region described above,
                    having never had any special name, was not able to give one to the idiom.</p>
                <p>In the Middle Ages the idiom was spoken of under various appellations: <hi
                    rend="italic">Romans</hi> or <hi rend="italic">lenga</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Romana</hi> was that most generally used. It is notably that employed by the
                    authors of the <hi rend="italic">Leys d? Amors,</hi> a treatise on grammar,
                    poetry, and rhetoric, composed at Toulouse in the 14th century. But this term,
                    which is capable of being applied, and which, in fact, has been applied, to each
                    of the Romanic languages individually, is too general to be retained. It is,
                    however, that which was revived in the beginning of the present century by
                    Raynouard, the author of the <hi rend="italic">Lexique</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >roman.</hi> It is now abandoned. In the 13th century a poet born in Catalonia,
                    on the southern slope of the Pyrenees, Raimon Vidal of Besalù, introduced the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">Limousin</hi> language, probably on account of the
                    great reputation of some Limousin troubadours, but he took care to define the
                    expression, which he extended beyond its original meaning, by saying that in
                    speaking of <hi rend="italic">Limousin</hi> he must be understood to include
                    Saintonge, Quercy, Auvergne, &amp;c. <hi rend="italic">(Rasos</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de trobar,</hi> ed. Stengel, p. 70). This expression found favour
                    in Spain, and especially in Catalonia, where the little treatise of Raimon Vidal
                    was extensively read. The most ancient lyric poetry of the Catalans (13th and
                    14th centuries), composed on the model of the poetry of the troubadours, was
                    often styled in Spain <hi rend="italic">poesia lemosina,</hi> and in the same
                    country <hi rend="italic">lengua lemosina</hi> long designated at once the
                    Provençal and the old literary Catalan.</p>
                <p>The name Provençal as applied to language is hardly met with in the Middle Ages,
                    except in the restricted sense of the language of Provence proper, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> of the region lying south of Dauphiné on the eastern
                    side of the Rhone. Raimon Feraut, who composed, about 1300, a versified life of
                    St Honorat, uses it, but he was himself a native of Provence. We can also cite
                    the title of a grammar, the <hi rend="italic">Donatz Proensals,</hi> by Hugh
                    Faidit (about 1250); but this work was composed in north Italy, and we may
                    conceive that the Italians living next to Provence employed the name Provençal
                    somewhat vaguely without inquiring into the geographical limits of the idiom so
                    called. In fact the name Provencal became traditional in Italy, and in the
                    beginning of the 16th century Bembo could write, “Era per tutto il Ponente la
                    favella <hi rend="italic">Provenzale,</hi> ne tempi ne quali ella fiorf, in
                    prezzo et in istima molta, et tra tutti gli altri idiomi di quelle parti, di

                    Provenzale non fosse, lo faceva Provenzalmente” <hi rend="italic">(Prose,</hi>
                    ed. 1529, fol. viii.).<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>‘
                    The Provençal speech in the times in which it flourished was prized and held in
                    great esteem all over the West, and among all the other idioms of that region
                    was by far the foremost: so that every one, whether Frenchman Fleming, Gascon,
                    Burgundian, or of what nation soever, who wished to write and versify well,
                    although he was not a Provençal, did it in the Provençal
                    language.”</p></note></p>
                <p>This passage, in which the primacy of the Provençal tongue is manifestly
                    exaggerated, is interesting as showing the name Provençal employed, though, with
                    little precision, in the sense in which we now apply it.</p>
                <p>Another designation, which is supported by the great authority of Dante, is that
                    of <hi rend="italic">langue d’oe.</hi> In his treatise <hi rend="italic"
                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Vulgari Eloquio</hi> (bk i. chaps, viii. and ix.), the
                    Florentine poet divides the languages of Latin origin into three idioms, which
                    he characterizes by the affirmative particles used in each, <hi rend="italic"
                    >oc, oïl,</hi><hi rend="italic">si;</hi> “nam alii <hi rend="italic">oc,</hi>
                    alii <hi rend="italic">dil,</hi> alii <hi rend="italic">si</hi> affirmando
                    loquuntur, ut puta Hispani, Franci, et Latini.” As is seen, he attributes the
                    affirmation <hi rend="italic">oc</hi> to the Spaniards, which is of course
                    erroneous, but there is no doubt that to the Spaniards he joined more correctly
                    the inhabitants of southern France, for in the <hi rend="italic">Vita
                    nuova,</hi> chap. XXV., he speaks of the <hi rend="italic">lingua d’oe</hi> as
                    having been long celebrated for its poets, which can apply only to the language
                    of the troubadours. The name <hi rend="italic">langue d’oe</hi> occurs also as
                    early as the end of the 13th century, in public acts, but with a different
                    sense, that of the province of Languedoc, as constituted after the union of the
                    county of Toulouse to the French king’s dominion in 1271. In the royal acts of
                    the end of the 13th and of the 14th century <hi rend="italic">partes
                    linguae,</hi><hi rend="italic">occitanae</hi> or <hi rend="italic">pays de
                    langue d’oe</hi> designates the union of the five seneschalates of Périgueux,
                    Carcassone, Beaucaire, Toulouse, and Rhodez, that is to say, the province of
                    Languedoc, such as it existed till 1790. Some scholars, following the example of
                    Dante, still actually use the term <hi rend="italic">langue d’oe</hi> in
                    opposition to <hi rend="italic">langue d’oui,</hi> but these names have the
                    inconvenience that they take such a secondary fact as the form of the
                    affirmative particle as an essential character. Moreover it can hardly help to
                    distinguish the other Romanic languages, as <hi rend="italic">langue de si</hi>
                    would cause a confusion between Italian and Spanish. Provençal, without being
                    entirely satisfactory, since in principle it applies solely to the language of
                    Provence, is, notwithstanding, the least objectionable name that can be adopted.
                    In addition to its being in some sort consecrated by the use made of it by the
                    Italians, who were the first after the Renaissance to study the works of the
                    troubadours, it must not be forgotten that, just as the Roman <hi rend="italic"
                    >Provincia,</hi> in which the name originated, extended across the south of Gaul
                    from the Alps to Toulouse and the Pyrenees, so still in the Middle Ages <hi
                    rend="italic">Provincia, Provinciales,</hi> were understood in a very wide sense
                    to designate not only Provence strictly so called, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi>
                    the present departments of Alpes Maritimes, Basses Alpes, Var, Bouches du Rhône,
                    but also a very considerable part of Languedoc and the adjacent countries. Thus
                    in the 12th century the chronicler Albert of Aix-la-Chapelle (Albertus Aquensis)
                    places the town of Puy (Haute Loire) <hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    Provençal language, within the limits above indicated, cannot be said to have
                    any general characters really peculiar to it. Such of its characters as are
                    found in all the varieties of the language are met with also in neighbouring
                    idioms; such as are not found elsewhere are not general characters, that is to
                    say, are manifested only in certain varieties of Provençal. In reality
                    “Provençal language” does not designate, properly speaking, a linguistic unity;
                    it is merely a geographical expression.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Tonic or Accented Vowels.—</hi> Latin <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    is preserved in an open syllable a märe, <hi rend="italic">amar,</hi> amâtum,
                    <hi rend="italic">amat,</hi> as well as in a closed syllable carnem, earn. This
                    character is common also to the Romanic of Spain ami Italy; but it is one of the
                    best distinguishing marks between Provençal and French, for, to the north, this
                    <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> when in an open syllable, does not pass beyond a line
                    which <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n892/mode/1up"

                    Montbrison (Loire). Starting eastward from Lyons or thereabouts, there appears a
                    notable linguistic fact which is observable in varied proportions in the
                    departments of Ain, Isère, and Savoie, and in Romanic Switzerland. This is, that
                    accented Latin <hi rend="italic">a</hi> in an open syllable, λvhen preceded by a
                    <hi rend="italic">mouillure,</hi> or palatalization (whatever the origin of
                    this), becomes e; on the contrary, when there is no <hi rend="italic"
                    >mouillure,</hi> it remains <hi rend="italic">a.</hi> Thus we find in the <hi

                    rend="italic">ensennier, deleitier,</hi> as against <hi rend="italic">desirrar,

                    >-ier,</hi> is that which is found regularly in French, the second that which is
                    regular in Pr. Pure Pr. would have <hi rend="italic">-ar</hi> in both cases <hi
                    rend="italic">{enserihar, deleitar, desirrar,</hi> &amp;c.); Fr. would have <hi

                    rend="italic">-er {desirer).</hi> Prof. Ascoli has given the name of <hi

                    the varieties of Romanic in which we find this duality of treatment of Latin <hi
                    rend="italic">a,</hi> according as it was or was not preceded by a palatalized
                    sound. Lat. ê, Ï become close <hi rend="italic">e</hi> (Ital., <hi rend="italic"

                    Spanish, but also extends over the French domain on its western side as far as

                    mercëdem, cëra, pr (eh)e(n)sum, venënum, which give in Fr. <hi rend="italic"

                    >fer, fier.</hi> Lat. <hi rend="italic">i</hi> is preserved, as in all the
                    Romanic languages: amicum, <hi rend="italic">ami,</hi> ripa, <hi rend="italic"
                    >riba.</hi> Lat. ï is treated like <hi rend="italic">i</hi> long when it
                    precedes (with hiatus) another vowel: pium, pïa, <hi rend="italic">piu,
                    pia,</hi> via, <hi rend="italic">via,</hi> ligat, <hi rend="italic">lia.</hi>
                    Lat. ô, <hi rend="italic">U</hi> result in one and the same sound, that of
                    Italian <hi rend="italic">u,</hi> Fr. <hi rend="italic">ou</hi> (Eng. <hi
                    rend="italic">oo).</hi> The same phenomenon takes place in the north of Italy,
                    and in the Romanic of Switzerland. This sound, which is styled by the <hi

                    <hi rend="italic">o),</hi> is usually symbolized in the early texts by simple
                    <hi rend="italic">o,</hi> and is thus confounded in spelling, though not in
                    pronunciation, with the open <hi rend="italic">o</hi> (o <hi rend="italic"

                    Lat. <hi rend="italic">au</hi> is rigorously preserved over the whole extent of
                    the Pr. domain: aurum, <hi rend="italic">aur,</hi> alauda, <hi rend="italic"
                    >alauza,</hi> pauperem, <hi rend="italic">paubre.</hi> At present the

                    Prov. domain; it is, however, found in certain parts of the Ladino zone in
                    Switzerland (upper Rhine valley), and in Friuli, and it is to be supposed to
                    have been once general over the whole of that zone. It is attested as late as
                    the 16th century in the Vaudois valleys of Piedmont, and there are also examples
                    of it in old Catalan. Elsewhere the diphthong has regularly become open o
                    (aurum, It. and Sp. <hi rend="italic">oro,</hi> Fr. <hi rend="italic">or,</hi>

                    those that follow the accented syllable, <hi rend="italic">ihc post-tonic</hi>
                    vowels. The Pr. is one of the Romanic idioms which, like the French, but unlike
                    the Castilian and the dialects of central and northern Italy, admit of only one
                    syllable after the accent. But the rules are not quite the same as in French. In
                    French the only vowel which can stand after the accented syllable is <hi
                    rend="italic">“e</hi> feminine,” otherwise called <hi rend="italic">“e</hi>
                    mute.” In Prov. <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">e</hi> are the
                    most frequent vowels in this position, but <hi rend="italic">i</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">o</hi> also occur. In French the first of the two post-tonic
                    vowels of a Lat. proparoxytone always disappears; in Prov. it tends to be
                    preserved, when followed by one of the consonants <hi rend="italic">n,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">r,</hi><hi rend="italic">I, d:</hi> teτminum, <hi rend="italic"
                    >te"rmen,</hi> ho ’ minem, <hi rend="italic">o"men,</hi> a <hi
                    rend="superscript"> i</hi> ngelum, <hi rend="italic">a"ngel,</hi> se <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> calem, <hi rend="italic">se"guel,</hi> cre ’ scere,
                    <hi rend="italic">crei"sser,</hi> te ’ pidum, <hi rend="italic">te’bez.</hi>
                    Finally, Prov. presents in certain words coming from Lat. proparaxytones the
                    trace of forms which (like I tai.) admitted two atonic vowels after the accented
                    syllable: thus we have <hi rend="italic">porte"</hi><hi rend="italic">gue</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">po"rgue</hi> (po'rticum), <hi rend="italic">Fabre"ga,</hi>
                    a place name, and <hi rend="italic">fa"rga</hi> (fa'Brica), <hi rend="italic"
                    >perte"</hi><hi rend="italic">ga</hi> and <hi rend="italic">pe"rga</hi>
                    (peτtica), <hi rend="italic">feme"na</hi> and <hi rend="italic">fe"mna</hi> (fe
                    <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> mina). We have also <hi rend="italic">lagre</hi>
                    ’ <hi rend="italic">ma</hi> (la ’ cryma), but a form accented like Fr. <hi
                    rend="italic">larme</hi> does not exist. There seems to be no doubt that these
                    forms in which a displacement of the Latin accent is observed were at an earlier
                    period pronounced as proparaxytones <hi rend="italic">{po</hi> ’ <hi
                    rend="italic">rtegue, fa"brega, pe"rtega, fe"mena, la^grema).</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Consonants.—</hi> The boundary usually recognized between Prov.
                    and French is founded upon linguistic characters furnished by the vowels,
                    especially <hi rend="italic">a·,</hi> if it had been determined by characters
                    furnished by the consonants, the line of demarcation would have to be drawn
                    farther south, because the consonantal system which is regarded as proper to
                    French really extends in its main features over the northern zone of the
                    Provençal region as defined above. As with the vowels, only a few of the salient
                    facts can here be indicated. <hi rend="italic">C</hi> initial, or second
                    consonant of a group, before <hi rend="italic">a</hi> (caballum, mercatum),
                    preserves its Lat. sound (=⅛) in the greater part of the Prov. region. But in
                    the northern zone it takes· the sound of <hi rend="italic">tch</hi> (Eng. <hi
                    rend="italic">ch</hi> in <hi rend="italic">chin)</hi> as in 0. Fr., and this
                    sound is still pretty well preserved, although there is here and there a
                    tendency to the present sound of <hi rend="italic">ch</hi> in Fr. <hi
                    rend="italic">{=sh</hi> Eng.). The place names Castellum, Castanëtum, Casale,
                    give <hi rend="italic">Chastel, Chastanet, Ghazal,</hi> in Dordogne, Haute
                    Vienne, Corrèze, Puy de Dôme, Cantal, Haute Loire, the north of Lozère, of
                    Ardèche, of Drome, of Isère, and of Hautes Alpes, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Castel,</hi><hi rend="italic">Castanet, Cazal,</hi> farther to the south.
                    Analogously, <hi rend="italic">g</hi> initial, or second consonant of a group,
                    followed by <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> becomes <hi rend="italic">j {i.e.,
                    dzh=G.</hi> Fr. and Eng. <hi rend="italic">j</hi> in <hi rend="italic">jam)</hi>
                    in the same zone; Garrica is <hi rend="italic">Jarrija, Jarria</hi> in.
                    Dordogne, Corrèze, Cantal, Haute Loire, Isère, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Garriga</hi> farther south. Between two vowels <hi rend="italic">t</hi> becomes
                    <hi rend="italic">d: edat, emperador, nadal, amada</hi> (aetatem, imperatorem,
                    natale, amata). This was also the case in 0. Fr. until the course of the 11th
                    century <hi rend="italic">{honurede, emperedur, lavadures,</hi> &amp;c., in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Life of St Alexis).</hi> But in the northern zone this <hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi> representing a Lat. <hi rend="italic">t</hi> fell aλvay as
                    early as in Fr.; in an 11th-century text from the environs of Valence, we read
                    <hi rend="italic">muraor, coroaa</hi> (*muratorem, corrogata), Fr. <hi
                    rend="italic">corvée</hi> (P. Meyer, <hi rend="italic">Recueil d’anciens
                    textes,</hi> Provençal section, No. 40). In the south, <hi rend="italic">d</hi>
                    between two vowels was preserved almost everywhere until about the middle of the
                    12th century, when it became <hi rend="italic">z</hi> (as in Fr. and Eng. <hi
                    rend="italic">zero): cruzel, azorar, auzir, vezer</hi> (crudëlem, adoräre,
                    audire, vidëre). In the 14th and 15th centuries this <hi rend="italic">z,</hi>
                    like every <hi rend="italic">z</hi> or <hi rend="italic">s</hi> soft of whatever
                    origin, was liable to become <hi rend="italic">r</hi> (lingual, not uvular): <hi
                    rend="italic">aurir, veren</hi> (audire, videntem). In Béarn and Gascony <hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi> remained; but in the northern zone Lat. <hi rend="italic"
                    >d,</hi> instead of changing into <hi rend="italic">z, r,</hi> disappeared as in
                    Fr. and quite as early. The poem of Boetius, of which the MS. is of the 11th
                    century, shows in this respect great hesitation: <hi rend="italic">e.g., d</hi>
                    preserved in <hi rend="italic">chaden,</hi><hi rend="italic">credet,
                    tradar,</hi><hi rend="italic">veder</hi> (cadentem, *credë’dit, *tradare,
                    vidëre); <hi rend="italic">d</hi> fallen away in <hi rend="italic">creessen,
                    feeltat, traazo,</hi><hi rend="italic">veut,</hi><hi rend="italic">far</hi>
                    (*credessent, fidelitatem, Gradationem, *vidiitum, p. pie. of vidëre, fidâre).
                    One of the most general facts in Pr. is the habit of rejecting Lat. final <hi
                    rend="italic">t,</hi> of which examples to any number are presented by the
                    verbs. In Fr. this <hi rend="italic">t</hi> was formerly retained when it
                    followed a vowel which remained, <hi rend="italic">aimet, entret</hi> (amat,
                    intrat), and still remains (in writing at least) when, in Latin, it follows a
                    consonant, <hi rend="italic">aiment,</hi><hi rend="italic">fait,</hi> ini
                    (amant, facit, *fact, vivit, *vivt); but in Pr. the <hi rend="italic">t</hi> is
                    dropped in all cases, even in the most ancient texts: <hi rend="italic">aman,
                    fai,</hi><hi rend="italic">viu.</hi> Yet in the northern zone we find the <hi
                    rend="italic">t</hi> retained in the 3d per. pl. of verbs, <hi rend="italic"
                    >-ant,</hi><hi rend="italic">-ont</hi> (Lat. -ant, -unt). <hi rend="italic"
                    >H</hi> has gone completely (or at least only appears through orthographic
                    tradition, and very intermittently, <hi rend="italic">{h)erba, (h)onor,
                    {h)umil,</hi> &amp;c.), not only in words of Lat. origin, which is the case in
                    O. Fr., but even in Teutonic words <hi rend="italic">{anta, ardit, arene,
                    ausberc, elm,</hi> Fr. <hi rend="italic">honte, hardi, hareng, haubert,
                    heaume,</hi> with <hi rend="italic">h</hi> aspirated). By this feature, the
                    northern limits of which are not yet well determined, the Provençal attaches
                    itself to the Romanic of the southern countries. N final, or standing in Lat.
                    between two vowels of which the second is to be dropped, disappears in the whole
                    central part of the Pr. domain: <hi rend="italic">gran gra, ben be,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">en</hi><hi rend="italic">e, ven ve,</hi><hi rend="italic">fin fi,
                    un</hi><hi rend="italic">u</hi> (granum, bene, in, venit, finem, unum). The
                    forms with <hi rend="italic">n</hi> belong to the eastern part (left of the
                    Rhone), the western part (Gascony, but not Béarn), and the region of the
                    Pyrenees. It is possible that this loss of <hi rend="italic">n</hi> went along
                    with a lengthening of final vowel; at least, in Béarnese when the <hi
                    rend="italic">n</hi> falls away the vowel is doubled: <hi rend="italic">caperaa,
                    besii, boo</hi> (capellänum, vicinum, bonum), &amp;c.</p>
                <p>These are the most important characteristics of the consonants, in relation to
                    the extent of space over which they prevail. Others, which appear only within a
                    more limited area, are perhaps more curious on account of their strangeness. It
                    will suffice to mention a few which belong to the district bounded on the west
                    and south by the Atlantic, the Basque provinces, and the Pyrenees, and which
                    extends northward and eastward towards the Garonne and its affluents, as far as
                    the Gironde. (This includes Béarn, Bigorre, and Gascony. ) Here the sound <hi
                    rend="italic">v</hi> no longer exists, being replaced generally by <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> between two vowels, in Gascony, by
                    w with the sound of Eng. <hi rend="italic">w.</hi> Initial <hi rend="italic"
                    >r</hi> assumes a prosthetic <hi rend="italic">a:</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >arram,</hi><hi rend="italic">arrc, Arrobert</hi> (rämum, rem, Robertum). <hi
                    rend="italic">LI</hi> between two vowels becomes <hi rend="italic">r</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">:</hi><hi rend="italic">aperar, caperan,</hi> or (Béarn) <hi
                    rend="italic">caperaa, bera, era</hi> (a p e 1- lare, cap el la num, bella, el
                    la). On the contrary, at the end of words (viz., in Romanic) <hi rend="italic"
                    >ll</hi> becomes <hi rend="italic">g</hi> or <hi rend="italic">t, d∙,</hi> the
                    former change seems to belong rather to Hautes and Basses Pyrénées, Landes, the
                    latter to Gironde, Lot et Garonne, Gers: <hi rend="italic">eg, ed,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">et</hi> (ille), <hi rend="italic">arrasteg, -ed,</hi><hi

                    (capitellum), whence Fr. <hi rend="italic">cadet</hi> (in 16th century <hi
                    rend="italic">capdet,</hi> originally a Gascon word). For further details upon

                <p><hi rend="italic">Flexion.—</hi> Old Provençal has, like Old French, a declension
                    consisting of two cases for each number, derived from the Latin nominative and
                    accusative. In certain respects this declension is more in conformity with
                    etymology in Provençal than in Old <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n893/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0893-0870"/> French, having been less influenced by analogy.
                    The following are the tvpes of this declension, taking them in the order of the
                    Lat. declensions. 1. Words in <hi rend="italic">-a</hi> coming from Lat. 1st
                    decl., increased by certain words coming from Lat. neuter plurals treated in
                    Prov. as feminine singulars; one form only for each number: sing, <hi
                    rend="italic">causa,</hi> pl. <hi rend="italic">causas.</hi> 2. Words of the
                    Lat. 2d decl., with a few from the 4th; two forms for each number: sing, subject
                    <hi rend="italic">cavals</hi> (caballus), object <hi rend="italic">caval</hi> (c
                    a b a 11 u m); pl. subject <hi rend="italic">caval</hi> (caballi), object <hi
                    rend="italic">cavals</hi> (caballos). 3. Words of Lat. 3d decl. Here there are
                    three Lat. types to be considered. The first type presents the same theme and
                    the same accentuation in all the cases, <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi>, canis. The
                    second presents the same accentuation in the nominative singular and in the
                    other cases, but the theme differs: c o <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> m e s, c
                    o ’ m it em. In the third type the accentuation changes: pecca ’ tor,
                    peccat0τem. The first type is naturally confounded with nouns of the 2d decl.:
                    sing., subj. <hi rend="italic">cans</hi> or <hi rend="italic">cas,</hi> obj. <hi
                    rend="italic">can</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ca.</hi> The second and third types
                    are sometimes followed in their original variety; thus <hi rend="italic"
                    >coms</hi> answers to co <hi rend="superscript"> φ</hi> mes, and <hi
                    rend="italic">co'mte</hi> to c o’ m i t e m. But it has often happened that
                    already in vulgar Latin the theme of the nominative singular had been
                    refashioned after the theme of the oblique cases. They said in the nom. sing,
                    heredis, parentis, principis, for heres, parens, princeps. Consequently the
                    difference both of theme and of accentuation which existed in Lat. between
                    nominative and accusative has disappeared in Pr. This reconstruction of the
                    nominative singular after the theme of the other cases takes place in all Lat.
                    words in <hi rend="italic">-as</hi> (except <hi rend="italic">abbas'),</hi> in
                    those in <hi rend="italic">-io,</hi> in the greater part of those in -or, at
                    least in all those which have an abstract meaning. Thus we obtain <hi
                    rend="italic">bontatz</hi> (bonitatis for bonitas) and <hi rend="italic"
                    >bontat</hi> (bonitatem), <hi rend="italic">ciutatz</hi> (civitatis for civitas)
                    and <hi rend="italic">ciutat</hi> (civitatem), amors (a m o r i s for a m o r)
                    and <hi rend="italic">amor</hi> (amore m). All present participles in the
                    subject case singular are formed in this way upon refashioned Latin nominatives:
                    <hi rend="italic">amans</hi> (amantis for a m a n s) <hi rend="italic"
                    >amant</hi> (amante m). It is to be remarked that in regard to feminine nouns
                    Pr. is more etymological than Fr. In the latter feminine nouns have generally
                    only one form for each number; <hi rend="italic">bonté</hi> for the subj. as
                    well as for the obj. case, and not <hi rend="italic">bontés</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">bonté</hi>; in Pr. on the contrary <hi rend="italic">bontatz</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">bontat.</hi> Still, in a large number of nouns the
                    original difference of accentuation between the nominative singular and the
                    other cases has been maintained, whence there result two very distinct forms for
                    the subj. and obj. cases. Of these words it is impossible to give a full list
                    here; we confine ourselves to the exhibition of a few types, remarking that
                    these words are above all such as designate persons: <hi rend="italic">a'bas
                    aba't, pa'stre pasto'r, sor soro'r, cantai‘re cantado'r</hi> (cantator, -δrem),
                    <hi rend="italic">emperavre emperado'r, bar baro</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">, compa</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> φ</hi><hi rend="italic">nh companho', lai</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">re lairo’</hi> (latro, ∙δnem). To this
                    class belong various proper names: <hi rend="italic">E^ble Eblo‘, Gui Guio', Uc
                    Ugo‘.</hi> A few have even oome from the 2d decl., thus <hi rend="italic">Pei're
                    Peiro', Pons Ponso', Ca'rle Carlo·,</hi> as if the Latin types had been Petro,
                    -Önern, Pon so, -öne m, Carlo, -önem. We may mention also geographical
                    adjectives, such as <hi rend="italic">Bret Breto∙, Bergo'nhz Bergonho', Case
                    Gasco</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> φ</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> &amp;c.
                    The plural of the 3d decl. is like that of the second: subj. <hi rend="italic"
                    >aba't,</hi><hi rend="italic">soro r,</hi><hi rend="italic">cantado'r,
                    emperado'r,</hi><hi rend="italic">baro', companho', lairo';</hi> obj. <hi
                    rend="italic">aba'tz, soro'rs, cantado'rs, cmperado'rs, baro's, companho's,
                    lairo</hi><hi rend="italic">'s,</hi> as if the Lat. nominative pl. had been
                    abbâti, sorδri, cantatδri, &amp;c. It is barely possible that such forms
                    actually existed in vulgar Latin; no trace of them, however, is found in the
                    texts, save in the glosses of Cassel (8th c.), sapienti for sapientes, and in a
                    great many ancient charters parentor um, which implies a nominative parenti. The
                    words of the 4th and 5th declensions present no points requiring mention
                    here.</p>
                <p>This declension of two cases is a notable character of the whole Romanic of Gaul,
                    north as well as south, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> French as well as
                    Provençal. It must be noted, however, that in the south-west it existed only in
                    a very restricted fashion. In the old texts of Gascony it is no longer general
                    in the 13th century. In Béarn it appears to have been completely unknown, the
                    nouns and adjs. having only one form, usually that of the obj. case. In Catalan
                    poetry its application is often laid down in the 13th century, but as the
                    charters and documents free from literary influence show no trace of it, its
                    introduction into the poetry of this country may be assumed to be an artificial
                    fact. In the region where it is best observed, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> in
                    the centre and north of the Provençal territory, it tends to disappear from
                    ordinary use already in the 13th century. The poet grammarian Raimon Vidal of
                    Besalù, who flourished about the middle of the century, points out in various
                    troubadours transgressions of the rules of declension, and recognizes that in
                    conversation they are no longer observed. The general tendency was to retain
                    only a single form, that of the obj. case. For certain words, however, it was
                    the subj. form which survived. Thus in modern Pr. the words in the ending <hi
                    rend="italic">-ai're</hi> (answering to Lat. -a t o r) are as frequent as those
                    in <hi rend="italic">-adou'</hi> (repr. -atδrem). But there is a slight
                    difference of meaning between these two suffixes</p>
                <p>Adjectives, generally speaking, agree in flexion with the nouns, κut there is one
                    fact particular to adjectivesand past participles winch is observed with more or
                    less regularity in certain 12th and 13th century texts. There is a tendency to
                    mark more clearly than in the substantives the flexion of the subj. pl., chiefly
                    when the adj. or participle is employed predicatively. This is marked by the
                    addition of an <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> placed, according to the district,
                    either after the final consonant, or else after the last vowel so as to form a
                    diphthong with it. The following are examples from an ancient translation of the
                    New Testament (MS. in library of the Palais Saint-Pierre, Lyons, end of 13th
                    century):—“Die a vos que no siatz <hi rend="italic">consirosi”</hi> (ne
                    solliciti sitis, Mat. vi. 25); “que siatz <hi rend="italic">visti</hi> d’els”
                    (ut videamini ab eis, Mat. vi. 1); “e davant los reis els princeps seretz <hi
                    rend="italic">menadi”</hi> (et ad praesides et ad reges ducemini, Mat. x. 18).
                    In charters of the 12th and 13th centuries we find in the subj. case pl., and
                    especially in this predicative use, <hi rend="italic">pagaig,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">certifiaih, acossailhaih,</hi> representing pagati, certificat!,
                    adconsiliati.</p>
                <p>It is in the verbs that the individuality of the different Romanic idioms
                    manifests itself most distinctly. At a very early date the etymological data
                    were crossed, in various directions and divers manners according to the country,
                    ’ by analogical tendencies. The local varieties became little by little so
                    numerous in the Romanic conjugation that it is not easy to discover any very
                    characteristic features observed over a territory so vast as that of which the
                    limits have been indicated at the commencement of this article. The following
                    are, however, a few.</p>
                <p>The infinitives are in <hi rend="italic">-ar,</hi><hi rend="italic">-ér,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">-re, ~ir,</hi> corresponding to the Lat. -are, -ere, -ere, -ire,
                    respectively; as in the whole Romanic domain, the conjugation in <hi
                    rend="italic">-ar</hi> is the most numerous. The table of verbs, which forms
                    part of the Pr. grammar called the <hi rend="italic">I)onatz Proensals</hi>
                    (13th century) contains 473 verbs in <hi rend="italic">-ar,</hi> 101 in <hi
                    rend="italic">-ér</hi> and <hi rend="italic">-re,</hi> 115 in <hi rend="italic"
                    >-ir.</hi> In the <hi rend="italic">-ar</hi> conjugation we remark one verb from
                    another conjugation: <hi rend="italic">far {cf.</hi> It. <hi rend="italic"
                    >fare)</hi> from facere. The conjugations in <hi rend="italic">-ér</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">∙re</hi> encroach each upon the territory of the other. The three
                    Lat. verbs cadëre, capëre, sapere have become <hi rend="italic">-ér</hi> verbs
                    <hi rend="italic">(caze'r, cabe'r, sabe'r)</hi> as in Fr. <hi rend="italic"
                    >cheoir, -cevoir,</hi><hi rend="italic">savoir</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and
                    several other verbs waver between the two: <hi rend="italic">crede'r,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">creér,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">crei 're</hi> (c r e <hi
                    rend="superscript"> φ</hi> d ë r e), <hi rend="italic">guerre 'r</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">que</hi><hi rend="italic">'rre</hi> (q u ae r ë r e). This
                    fluctuation is most frequent in the case of verbs which belonged originally to
                    the <hi rend="italic">-ère</hi> conjugation: <hi rend="italic">arde'r</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">a'rdre, plaze'r</hi> and <hi rend="italic">plai're,
                    taze'r</hi> and <hi rend="italic">tai're</hi> (ardëre, placëre, tacëre). Next to
                    the <hi rend="italic">-ar</hi> conjugation, that in <hi rend="italic">-ir</hi>
                    is the one which has preserved most formative power. As in the other Romanic
                    languages, it has welcomed a large number of German verbs, and has attracted
                    several verbs which etymologically ought to have belonged to the conjugations in
                    <hi rend="italic">-ér</hi> and <hi rend="italic">-re:</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >emplir</hi> (implëre), <hi rend="italic">jauzir</hi> (gaudëre), <hi
                    rend="italic">cosir</hi> (consuêre), <hi rend="italic">erebir</hi> (eripëre),
                    <hi rend="italic">fugir</hi> (fugëre), <hi rend="italic">sequir</hi> (*sequëre =
                    sequi).</p>
                <p>Except in the <hi rend="italic">-ar</hi> conjugation, the ending of the
                    infinitive does not determine in a regular manner the mode of forming the
                    different tenses. The present participles are divided into two series: those in
                    <hi rend="italic">-an</hi> (obj. sing.) for the first conj., those in <hi
                    rend="italic">-en</hi> for the others. In this the Pr. distinguishes itself very
                    clearly from the French, in which all present participles have <hi rend="italic"
                    >-ant.</hi> There is also in Pr. a participial form or verbal adjective which is
                    not met with in any other Romanic language, except Romanian, where moreover it
                    is employed in a different sense; this is a form in <hi rend="italic"
                    >∙do^r,</hi><hi rend="italic">-doi'ra,</hi> which supposes a Lat. type -törius,
                    or-türius; the sense is that of a future participle, active for the intransitive
                    verbs, passive for the transitive: <hi rend="italic">endeυenido'r, ∙doi'ra,</hi>
                    “that is to happen”; <hi rend="italic">fazedo^r,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >-doi'ra,</hi> “that is to be done <hi rend="italic">”;punido‘r, -doi'ra,</hi>
                    “to be punished.” In conjugation properly so called, we may remark the almost
                    complete disappearance of the Lat. preterite in <hi rend="italic">-ävi,</hi> of
                    which traces are found only in texts written in the neighbourhood of the
                    French-speaking region, and in Béarn. In return, a preterite which seems to have
                    been suggested by the Latin dëdi, has increased and become the type of the tense
                    almost everywhere in the <hi rend="italic">-ar</hi> conjugation, and in many
                    verbs in <hi rend="italic">-ér</hi> and <hi rend="italic">-re</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">:</hi><hi rend="italic">amei',</hi><hi rend="italic">ame'st,
                    ame't, ame</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> φ</hi><hi rend="italic">m, ame'tz,
                    ame'ron.</hi> In Fr. there is a form like this, or at least having the same
                    origin, only in a small number of verbs, none of which belong to the first
                    conjugation, and in these only in the 3rd. pers. sing, and pl. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(perdié,</hi><hi rend="italic">perdierent</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">entendié,</hi><hi rend="italic">entendierent,</hi> &amp;c. ) It is
                    well known that reduplicated preterites had greatly multiplied in vulgar Latin:
                    there have been recovered such forms as ascen dide rat, osten dedit, pandiderun
                    t, adtendedit, incendiderat, &amp;c. (see Schuchardt, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vokalismus</hi><hi rend="italic">des</hi><hi rend="italic">Vulgärlateins,</hi>
                    i. 35, iii. 10; <hi rend="italic">cf.</hi><hi rend="italic">Romania,</hi> it
                    477). But, in order to explain the Pr. form <hi rend="italic">-ei,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">-est,</hi><hi rend="italic">-et</hi> (with open <hi rend="italic"
                    >e),</hi> we must suppose a termination not in-ïdior - ë d i, but in - ë · d i.
                    In the western region the 3d pers. sing, is generally in <hi rend="italic"
                    >-ec,</hi> probably by analogy with preterites like <hi rend="italic">bee,
                    crec,</hi><hi rend="italic">dec, sec,</hi> formed after the Lat. type in -ui.
                    Another notable peculiarity, of which Old Fr. shows only rare traces, in texts
                    of a very remote period, is the'preservation of a preterite in <hi rend="italic"
                    >-ara or -era,</hi> derived from the Lat. pluperfect, <hi rend="italic"
                    >ama'ra</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ame'ra,</hi> “I loved.” The former comes
                    directly from Lat. a m â r a m, the latter has been influenced by the ordinary
                    preterite in <hi rend="italic">-ei.</hi> This preterite is used with the sense
                    of a simple past, not of a pluperfect, and consequently is an exact doublet of
                    the ordinary preterite, which explains how it was at length eliminated almost
                    everywhere by the latter, of <pb break="no"

                <p>which it was a mere synonym. But it remained in general use with the sense of a
                    past conditional: <hi rend="italic">ama'ra</hi> or <hi rend="italic">amβ'ra,
                    “</hi> I should have loved, <hi rend="italic">"fora, “</hi> I should have
                    been.”</p>

                    >Provençal.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> In consequence of political
                    circumstances (see notice of Provençal Literature below), the Provençal ceased
                    to be used for administrative as well as literary purposes about the 15th
                    century, in some places a little sooner, in others later (notably in Béarn,
                    where it continued to be written as the language of ordinary use till the 17th
                    century). The poems in local dialect composed and printed in the 16 th century
                    and on to our own day have no link with the literature of the preceding period.
                    Reduced to the condition of a <hi rend="italic">patois,</hi> or popular dialect
                    simply, the idiom experienced somewhat rapid modifications. Any one who should
                    compare the poems of Goudelin of Toulouse (1579-1649) with those of a Toulousain
                    troubadour of the 13th century would be astonished at the changes which the
                    language has undergone. Yet this impression would probably be exaggerated. In
                    order to make a rigorously accurate comparison of the language at the two
                    epochs, it would have to be written in the two cases with the same orthographic
                    system, which it is not. The first writers of Provençal, about the 10th or 11th
                    century, applied to the language the Latin orthography, preserving to each
                    letter, as far as possible, the value given to it in the contemporary
                    pronunciation of Latin. To express certain sounds which did not exist in Latin,
                    or which were not there clearly enough noted, there were introduced little by
                    little, and without regular system, various conventional symbolizations such as
                    <hi rend="italic">lh</hi> and <hi rend="italic">nh</hi> to symbolize the sound
                    of <hi rend="italic">I</hi> and <hi rend="italic">n</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >mouillée.</hi> From this method of proceeding there resulted an orthographic
                    system somewhat wanting in fixity, but which from its very instability lent
                    itself fairly well to the variations which the pronunciation underwent in time
                    and locality. But, the tradition having been interrupted about the 15 th
                    century, those who afterwards by way of pastime attempted composition in the
                    patois formed, each for himself apart, an orthography of which many elements
                    were borrowed from French usage. It is evident that differences already
                    considerable must be exaggerated by the use of two very distinct orthographical
                    systems. Nevertheless, even if we get quit of the illusion which makes us at
                    first sight suppose differences of sound where there are merely different ways
                    of spelling the same sound, we find that between the 14th and 16 th century the
                    language underwent everywhere, Béarn (for reasons already given) excepted, great
                    modifications both in vocabulary and grammar. The Provençal literature having
                    gradually died out during the 14th century, the vocabulary lost immediately the
                    greater part of the terms expressing general ideas or abstract conceptions. To
                    supply the place of these, the authors who have written in the patois of the
                    south during the last few centuries have been obliged to borrow from French,
                    modifying at the same time their form, a multitude of vocables which naturally
                    have remained for the most part unintelligible to people who know only the
                    patois. In this case the adoption of foreign words was excusable; but it did not
                    stop here. Little by little, as primary instruction (now compulsory) was
                    diffused, and introduced first in the towns and afterwards in the villages a
                    certain knowledge of French, words purely French have been introduced into use
                    in place of the corresponding dialect words. Thus, one hears constantly in
                    Provence <hi rend="italic">pe</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">ro</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> i</hi><hi rend="italic">mè'ro, frè'ro,</hi> forms adapted from
                    French, instead of <hi rend="italic">paire, maire,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >fraire∙,</hi><hi rend="italic">cacha</hi><hi rend="italic">(catsha"</hi> = Fr.
                    <hi rend="italic">cacher)</hi> instead of <hi rend="italic">escoundre,</hi>
                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p>In the phonology, the modifications are of the natural order, and so have nothing
                    revolutionary. The language has developed locally tendencies which certainly
                    already existed during the flourishing period, although the ancient orthography
                    did not recognize them. Of the vowels, <hi rend="italic">a</hi> tonic is
                    generally preserved; <hi rend="italic">an</hi> in an open syllable becomes ô
                    (open) in part of the departments of Aveyron, Lot, Dordogne, Corrèze, Cantal,
                    and south of Haute Loire: <hi rend="italic">gro</hi> (granum), mo (manum), <hi
                    rend="italic">po</hi> (panem). This nasalized <hi rend="italic">a</hi> must have
                    had a particular sound already in Old Pr., for it is qualified in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Donatz Proensals</hi> (ed. Stengel, p. 49) as <hi rend="italic">a
                    estreit</hi> (≈ close or narrow a). A feature almost general is the passage of
                    post-tonic <hi rend="italic">a</hi> into <hi rend="italic">o:</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">terro, amavo, amado</hi> (terra, amabat, amata). In Var and the
                    Maritime Alps examples of this change occur as early as the end of the 15th
                    century. But even yet there are a few cantons, notably Montpellier and its
                    neighbourhood, where the ancient post-tonic <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is
                    preserved. It is remarkable that the Latin diphthong <hi rend="italic">au,</hi>
                    which had become simple <hi rend="italic">o</hi> in almost all Romanic lands at
                    the date of the most ancient texts, is to this day preserved with a very
                    distinct diphthongal sound everywhere in the south of France.</p>
                <p>In the morphology,the leading feature of modern Provençal is the ever greater
                    simplification of grammatical forms. Not only have the two forms (nominative and
                    objective) in each number, in nouns and adjectives, been reduced to one—this
                    reduction manifested itself in ordinary use already in the 14th century—but in
                    many places there no longer remains any distinction between the singular and the
                    plural. In a great part of the south <hi rend="italic">ieu</hi> (ego) does duty
                    as an objective, <hi rend="italic">me</hi> or <hi rend="italic">mi</hi> having
                    disappeared. In part of Drôme it is the other way, <hi rend="italic">mi</hi>
                    being substituted in the nominative for <hi rend="italic">ieu,</hi> which it has
                    completely displaced. It is perhaps in <hi rend="italic">conjugation</hi> that
                    the greatest changes from the older form of the language are seen. Analogy,
                    basing itself upon one or another much used form, has acted with immense force,
                    tending to make general in the whole conjugation, without any regard to the
                    original classes to which the various verbs belonged, certain terminations,
                    chiefly those which were accented, and thus appeared to the popular instinct to
                    have more significance. The result, if the tendency were carried the full
                    length, would be the reduction of all the three conjugations to one. Perhaps
                    before this point is reached the patois of the south will themselves have
                    disappeared. As the endless modifications which the language undergoes, in
                    vocabulary and grammar alike, develop themselves in different directions, and
                    each over an area differently circumscribed, the general aspect of the language
                    becomes more and more confused, without the possibility of grouping the endless
                    varieties within dialectal divisions, there being no case in which a certain
                    number of phonetic or morphological facts present themselves within the same
                    geographical limits. The custom has been adopted of roughly designating these
                    varieties by the name of the ancient provinces in which they appear. <hi
                    rend="italic">Limousin</hi> (divided into <hi rend="italic">High</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Low</hi><hi rend="italic">Limousin),</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Marchese, Auvergnese, Gascon,</hi><hi rend="italic">Béamese,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Rouergat, Languedocian,</hi><hi rend="italic">Provençal,</hi>
                    &amp;c.; but these divisions, though convenient in use, correspond to no
                    actualities. Nîmes and Montpellier are in Languedoc, and Arles and Tarascon are
                    in Provence; nevertheless the dialect of Nîmes resembles that of Arles and
                    Tarascon more than that of Montpellier.</p>
                <p>Texts.—For the history of the Provençal in all its varieties there are many more
                    materials than for any other Romanic language, not excepting even Italian or
                    French. The literary texts go hack to the 10th or 11th century (see below). For
                    phonetic purposes many of these texts are of secondary value, because the MSS.
                    in which they have reached us, and several of which, especially for the poetry
                    of the troubadours, are of Italian origin, have altered the original forms to an
                    extent which it is not easy to determine; but we possess a countless number of
                    charters, coutumes, regulations, accounts, registers of taxation, which are
                    worthy of absolute confidence,—first, because these documents are in most cases
                    originals, and, secondly, because, none of the dialectal varieties having raised
                    itself to the rank of the literary language, as happened in France with the
                    central (Parisian) variety and in Italy with the Florentine, writers never had
                    the temptation to abandon their own idiom for another. It is proper to add that
                    Provençal possesses two ancient grammars of the 13th century (the earliest
                    compiledjor any Romanic idiom)—the Donatz Proensals and Razos de trobar (see p.
                    87G). Although very short, especially the second, which is a collection of
                    detached observations, they furnish valuable data. The 14th-century Leys d’Amors
                    (see p. 876) presents the language in rather an artificial state—the language
                    which ought to be written rather than the language actually existing.</p>
                <p>Bibliography— 1. Ancient Condition.—There does not exist any comprehensive work
                    upon the Provençal whence to obtain a precise idea of the history of the
                    language at its different epochs. Diez’s Grammatik der romanischen Sprachen is
                    still the groundwork. It gives, especially in the 3d ed. (1869-72), the last
                    revised by the author, the results of extensive researches conveniently
                    arranged. But Diez had only a slender knowledge of the language in its present
                    state, and in his time phonology had made little progress. The French
                    translation of MM. G. Paris, A. Brachet, and Morel-Fatio (Paris, 1873-76) was to
                    be completed by a supplementary volume, which was announced at vol. ix. p. 636
                    of the present work, but this expedient has had to be abandoned, it having been
                    recognized that what was wanted was not a supplement but a general recast. The
                    “Recherches philologiques sur la langue romane,” and “Résume de la grammaire
                    romane,” published by Raynouard at the beginning of vol. 1. of Ins Lexique roman
                    (1838), are entirely out of date. The “Tableau sommaire des flexions
                    provençales,” published by Μ. Bartsch, in the Chrestomathie provençale (4th ed.,
                    1880), is incomplete and often erroneous. The actual state of our knowledge of
                    ancient Provençal must be sought in a great number of scattered dissertations or
                    monographs, which will be found especially in the Mémoires of the Société de
                    Linguistique de Paris, 1868 (Phonétique provençale, O, pp. 1R&gt;-61), in the
                    Romania (1872-85), and in the Revue de la Société pour I etude des langues
                    romanes, to which may be added some doctoral dissertations published in Germany,
                    and the special studies upon the language of particular texts prefaced to
                    editions of these. As to dictionaries, the Lexique roman, ou Dictionnaire delà
                    langue des Troubadours, by Raynouard (Paris, 6 vols. 8vo, 1836-14), can always
                    be used with advantage, but the numerous special vocabularies appended by
                    editors to texts published by them cannot be neglected. These yield a
                    considerable <pb break="no"

                    gives in as complete a manner as possible all the forms used in the south of
                    France. It is by far the best of all the dictionaries of the southern dialects
                    which have yet been published, and when finished it will almost enable the
                    student to dispense with all the others.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="smallcaps">Provençal</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Literature.</hi>
                    —Provençal literature is much more easily defined than the language in which it
                    is expressed. Starting in the 11th and 12th centuries in several centres, it
                    thence gradually spread out, first over the greater portion, though not the
                    whole, of southern France, and then into the north of Italy and Spain. It
                    nowhere merged in the neighbouring literatures. At the time of its highest
                    development (12th century) the art of composing in the vulgar tongue did not
                    exist, or was only beginning to exist, to the south of the Alps and the
                    Pyrenees. In the north, in the country of French speech, vernacular poetry was
                    in full bloom; but between the districts in which it had developed—Champagne,
                    île de France, Picardy, and Normandy—and the region in which Provençal
                    literature had sprung up, there seems to have been an intermediate zone formed
                    by Burgundy, Bourbonnais, Berry, Touraine, and Anjou which, far on in the Middle
                    Ages, appears to have remained barren of vernacular literature. In its rise
                    Provençal literature stands completely by itself, and in its development it long
                    continued to be absolutely original. It presents at several points genuine
                    analogies with the sister-literature of northern France; but these analogies are
                    due principally to certain primary elements common to both and only in a slight
                    degree to mutual reaction.</p>
                <p>It must be inquired, however, what amount of originality could belong to any,
                    even the most original, Romanic literature in the Middle Ages. In all Romanic
                    countries compositions in the vernacular began to appear while the custom of
                    writing in Latin was still preserved by uninterrupted tradition. Even during the
                    most barbarous periods, when intellectual life was at its lowest, it was in
                    Latin that sermons, lives of saints more or less apocryphal, accounts of
                    miracles designed to attract pilgrims to certain shrines, monastic annals, legal
                    documents, and contracts of all kinds were composed. When learning began to
                    revive, as was the case in northern and central France under the influence of
                    Charlemagne and later in the 11th century, it was Latin literature which
                    naturally received increased attention, and the Latin language was more than
                    ever employed in writing. Slowly and gradually the Romanic languages, especially
                    those of France, came to occupy part of the ground formerly occupied by Latin,
                    but even after the Middle Ages had passed away the parent tongue retained no
                    small portions of its original empire. Consequently Romanic literatures in
                    general (and this is especially true of Provençal as it does not extend beyond
                    the mediaeval period) afford only an incomplete representation of the
                    intellectual development of each country. Those literatures even which are most
                    truly national, as having been subjected to no external influence, are only to a
                    limited extent capable of teaching us what the nation was. They were, in short,
                    created in the interests of the illiterate part of the people, and to a
                    considerable degree by those who were themselves illiterate. But that does not
                    make them less interesting.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Origin.—</hi> It was in the 11th century, and at several places
                    in the extensive territory whose limits have been described in the foregoing
                    account of the Provençal language, that Provençal literature first made its
                    appearance. It took poetic form; and its oldest monuments show a relative
                    perfection and a variety from which it may be concluded that poetry had already
                    received a considerable development. The oldest poetic text, if the date and
                    origin be correctly determined, is said to be a Provençal refrain attached to a
                    Latin poem recently published <hi rend="italic">{Zeitschrift für deutsche
                    Philologie,</hi> 1881, p. 335) from a Vatican MS., written, it is asserted, in
                    the 10th century. But it is useless to linger over these few words, the text of
                    which seems corrupt, or at least has not yet been satisfactorily interpreted.
                    The honour of being the oldest literary monument of the Provençal language must
                    be assigned to a fragment of two hundred and fifty-seven decasyllabic verses
                    preserved in an Orleans MS. and frequently edited and annotated since it was
                    first printed by Raynouard in 1817 in his <hi rend="italic">Choix</hi><hi

                    century. The peculiarities of the language point to the north of the Provençal
                    region, probably Limousin or Marche. It is the beginning of a poem in which the
                    unknown author, taking Boetius’s treatise <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Consolatione</hi><hi rend="italic">Philosophise</hi> as the
                    groundwork of his composition, adopts and develops its ideas and gives them a
                    Christian cast of which there is no trace in the original. Thus from some verses
                    in which Boetius contrasts his happy youth with his afflicted old age he draws a
                    lengthy homily on the necessity of laying up from early years a treasure of good
                    works. The poem is consequently a didactic piece composed by a “clerk,” knowing
                    Latin. He doubtless preferred the poetic form to prose because his illiterate
                    contemporaries were accustomed to poetry in the vulgar tongue, and because this
                    form was better adapted to recitation; and thus his work, while a product of
                    erudition in as far as it was an adaptation of a Latin treatise, shows that at
                    the time when it was composed a vernacular poetry was in existence. A little
                    later, at the close of the same century, we have the poems of William IX., count
                    of Poitiers, duke of Guienne. They consist of eleven very diverse strophic
                    pieces, and were consequently meant to be sung. Several are love songs; one
                    relates a <hi rend="italic">bonne fortune</hi> in very gross terms; and the most
                    important of all—the only one which can be approximately dated, being composed
                    at the time when William was setting out for Spain to fight the
                    Saracens—expresses in touching and often noble words the writer’s regret for the
                    frivolity of his past life and the apprehensions which oppressed him as he bade
                    farewell, perhaps for ever, to his country and his young son. We also know from
                    Ordericus Vitalis that William IX. had composed various poems on the incidents
                    of his ill-fated expedition to the Holy Land in 1101. And it must further be
                    mentioned that in one of his pieces <hi rend="italic">{Ben υoil</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">que</hi><hi rend="italic">sapchon li plusor)</hi> he makes a very
                    clear allusion to a kind of poetry which we know only by specimens of later
                    date, the <hi rend="italic">partimen,</hi> or, as it is called in France, thej⅛w
                    <hi rend="italic">parti.</hi> William IX. was born in 1071 and died in 1127.
                    There is no doubt that the most prolific period of his literary activity was his
                    youth. On the other hand there is no reason to believe that he created the type
                    of poetry of which he is to us the oldest representative. It is easy to
                    understand how his high social rank saved some of his productions from oblivion
                    whilst the poems of his pre- <pb break="no"

                <p>decessors and contemporaries disappeared with the generations who heard and sang
                    them; and in the contrast in form and subject between the Boetius poem and the
                    stanzas of William IX. we find evidence that by the 11th century Provençal
                    poetry was being rapidly developed in various directions. Whence came this
                    poetry? How and by whose work was it formed <hi rend="italic">1</hi> That it has
                    no connexion whatever with Latin poetry is generally admitted. There is
                    absolutely nothing in common either in form or ideas between the last
                    productions of classical Latinity, as they appear in Sidonius Apollinaris or
                    Fortunatus, and the first poetic compositions in Romanic. The view which seems
                    to meet with general acceptance, though it has not been distinctly formulated by
                    any one, is that Romanic poetry sprang out of a popular poetry quietly holding
                    its place from the Roman times, no specimen of which has survived,—just as the
                    Romanic languages are only continuations with local modifications of vulgar
                    Latin. There are both truth and error in this opinion. The question is really a
                    very complex one. First as to the form: Romanic versification, as it appears in
                    the Boetius poem and the verses of William IX., and a little farther north in
                    the poem of the <hi rend="italic">Passion</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Life of
                    St Leger</hi> (10th or 11th century), has with all its variety some general and
                    permanent characteristics: it is rhymed, and it is composed of a definite number
                    of syllables certain of which have the syllabic accent. This form has evident
                    affinity with the rhythmic Latin versification, of which specimens exist from
                    the close of the Roman empire in ecclesiastical poetry. The exact type of
                    Romanic verse is not found, however, in this ecclesiastical Latin poetry; the
                    latter was not popular, and it may be assumed that there was a popular variety
                    of rhythmic poetry from which Romanic verse is derived.</p>
                <p>Again, as regards the substance, the poetic material, we find nothing in the
                    earliest Provençal which is strictly popular. The extremely personal
                    compositions of William IX. have nothing in common with folklore. They are
                    subjective poetry addressed to a very limited and probably rather aristocratic
                    audience. The same may be said of the Boetius poem, though it belongs to the
                    quite different species of edifying literature; at any rate it is not popular
                    poetry. Vernacular compositions seem to have been at first produced for the
                    amusement, or in the case of religious poetry for the edification, of that part
                    of lay society which had leisure and lands, and reckoned intellectual pastime
                    among the good things of life. Gradually this class, intelligent, but with no
                    Latin education, enlarged the circle of its ideas. In the 12 th century and
                    still more in the 13 th, historical works and popular treatises on contemporary
                    science were composed for its use in the only language it understood; and
                    vernacular literature continued gradually to develop partly on original lines
                    and partly by borrowing from the literature of the “clerks.” But in the 11th
                    century vernacular poetry was still rather limited, and has hardly any higher
                    object than the amusement and edification of the upper classes. An aristocratic
                    poetry like the oldest Provençal cannot be the production of shepherds and
                    husbandmen; and there is no probability that it was invented or even very
                    notably improved by William IX.</p>
                <p>From what class of persons then did it proceed? Latin chroniclers of the Middle
                    Ages mention as <hi rend="italic">joculares, joculatores,</hi> men of a class
                    not very highly esteemed whose profession consisted in amusing their audience
                    either by what we still call jugglers’ tricks, by exhibiting performing animals,
                    or by recitation and song. They are called <hi rend="italic">joglars</hi> in
                    Provençal, <hi rend="italic">jongler</hi><hi rend="italic">s</hi><hi
                    rend="italic smallcaps"> qt</hi><hi rend="italic">jougleors</hi> in French. A
                    certain Barnaldus, styled <hi rend="italic">joglarius,</hi> appears as witness
                    in 1058 to a charter of the chartulary of Saint Victor at Marseilles. In 1106
                    the act of foundation of a <hi rend="italic">salva</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >terra</hi> in Rouergue specifies that neither knight nor man-at-arms nor <hi
                    rend="italic">joculator</hi> is to reside in the village about to be created.
                    These individuals—successors of the <hi rend="italic">mimi</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">thymelici</hi> of antiquity, who were professional amusers of the
                    public— were the first authors of poetry in the vernacular both in the south and
                    in the north of France. To the upper classes who welcomed them to their castles
                    they supplied that sort of entertainment now sought at the theatre or in books
                    of light literature. There were certain of them who, leaving buffoonery to the
                    ruder and less intelligent members of the profession, devoted themselves to the
                    composition of pieces intended for singing and consequently in verse. In the
                    north, where manners were not so refined and where the taste for warlike
                    adventure prevailed, the jongleurs produced <hi rend="italic">chansons</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de geste</hi> full of tales of battle and combat. In the courts of
                    the southern nobles, where wealth was more abundant and a life of ease and
                    pleasure was consequently indulged in, they produced love songs. There is
                    probably a large amount of truth in the remark made by Dante in chapter xxv. of
                    his <hi rend="italic">Vita Nuoυa,</hi> that the first to compose in the vulgar
                    tongue did so because he wished to be understood by a lady who would have found
                    it difficult to follow Latin verses.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>“E lo primo ehe comencio a dire sicome poeta volgare si
                    mosse peroche voile fare intendere le sue parole a donna alia quale era
                    mala-gevole ad intendere i versi latini.”</p></note> And in fact there are love
                    songs among the pieces by William of Poitiers; and the same type preponderates
                    among the compositions of the troubadours who came immediately after him. But it
                    is worthy of note that in all this vast body of love poetry there is no
                    epithalamium nor any address to a marriageable lady. The social conditions of
                    the south of France in the feudal period explain in great measure the powerful
                    development of this kind of poetry, and also its peculiar characteristics—the
                    profound respect, the extreme deference of the poet towards the lady whom he
                    addresses. Rich heiresses were married young, often when hardly out of their
                    girlhood, and most frequently without their fancy being consulted. But they seem
                    after marriage to have enjoyed great liberty. Eager for pleasure and greedy of
                    praise, the fair ladies of the castle became the natural patronesses of the <hi
                    rend="italic">mesnie</hi> or household of men-at-arms and jongleurs whom their
                    husbands maintained in their castles. Songs of love addressed to them soon
                    became an accepted and almost conventional form of literature; and, as in social
                    position the authors were generally far below those to whom they directed their
                    amorous plaints, this kind of poetry was always distinguished by great reserve
                    and an essentially respectful style. From the beginning the sentiments, real or
                    assumed, of the poets are expressed in such a refined and guarded style that
                    some historians, overestimating the virtue of the ladies of that time, have been
                    misled to the belief that the love of the troubadour for the mistress of his
                    thoughts was generally platonic and conventional.</p>
                <p>The conditions under which Romanic poetry arose in the south of France being thus
                    determined as accurately as the scarcity of documents allows, we now proceed to
                    give a survey of the various forms of Provençal literature, chronological order
                    being followed in each instance. By this arrangement the wealth of each form
                    will be better displayed; and, as it is rare in the south of France for the same
                    person to distinguish himself in more than one of them, there will be generally
                    no occasion to introduce the same author in different sections.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Poetry of the Troubadours.—</hi> Though he was certainly not
                    the creator of the lyric poetry of southern France, William, count of Poitiers,
                    by personally cultivating it gave it a position of honour, and indirectly
                    contributed in a very powerful degree to insure its development and
                    preservation<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0897-0874"/>. Shortly after him centres of poetic activity
                    make their appearance in various places—first in Limousin and Gascony. In the
                    former province lived a viscount of Ventadour, Eble, who during the second part
                    of William of Poitiers’s life seems to have been brought into relation with him,
                    and according to a contemporary historian, Geffrei, prior of Vigeois, <hi
                    rend="italic">erat valde gratiosus</hi><hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">cantilenis.</hi> We possess none of his compositions; but under
                    his influence Bernart of Ventadour was trained to poetry, who, though only the
                    son of one of the serving-men of the castle, managed to gain the love of the
                    lady of Ventadour, and, when on the discovery of their amour he had to depart
                    elsewhere, received a gracious welcome from Eleanor of Guienne, consort (from
                    1152) of Henry II. of England. Of Bernart’s compositions we possess about fifty
                    songs of elegant simplicity, some of which may be taken as the most perfect
                    specimens of love poetry Provençal literature has ever produced. Bernart must
                    therefore have been in repute before the middle of the 12 th century; and his
                    poetic career extended well on towards its close. At the same period, or
                    probably a little earlier, flourished Cercamon, a poet certainly inferior to
                    Bernart, to judge by the few pieces he has left us, but nevertheless of genuine
                    importance among the troubadours both because of his early date and because
                    definite information regarding him has been preserved. He was a Gascon, and
                    composed, says his old biographer, “pastorals” according to the ancient custom
                    <hi rend="italic">(pastorelas a la uzansa antiga).</hi> This is the record of
                    the appearance in the south of France of a poetic form which ultimately acquired
                    large development. The period at which Cercamon lived is determined by a piece
                    where he alludes very clearly to the approaching marriage of the king of France,
                    Louis VII., with Eleanor of Guienne (1137). Among the earliest troubadours may
                    also be reckoned Marcabrun, a pupil of Cercamon’s, from whose pen we have about
                    forty pieces, those with dates ranging from 1135 to 1148 or thereabout. This
                    poet has great originality of thought and style. His songs, several of which are
                    historical, are free from the commonplaces of their class, and contain curious
                    strictures on the corruptions of the time.</p>
                <p>We cannot here do more than enumerate the leading troubadours and briefly
                    indicate in what conditions their poetry was developed and through what
                    circumstances it fell into decay and finally disappeared :—Peter of Auvergne
                    (Peire d’Alvernha), who in certain respects must be classed with Marcabrun;
                    Arnaut Daniel, remarkable for his complicated versification, the inventor of the
                    <hi rend="italic">sestina,</hi> a poetic form for which Dante and Petrarch
                    express an admiration difficult for us to understand; Arnolt of Mareuil (Arnaut
                    de Maroill), who, while less famous than Arnaut Daniel, certainly surpasses him
                    in elegant simplicity of form and delicacy of sentiment; Bertran de Born, now
                    the most generally known of all the troubadours on account of the part he played
                    both by his sword and his <hi rend="italic">sirventescs</hi> in the struggle
                    between Henry II. of England and his rebel sons; Peire Vidal of Toulouse, a poet
                    of varied inspiration, who grew rich with gifts bestowed on him by the greatest
                    nobles of his time; Guiraut de Borneil, <hi rend="italic">lo maestre dels
                    trobadors,</hi> and at any rate master in the art of the so-called “close” style
                    <hi rend="italic">(trobar</hi><hi rend="italic">dus),</hi> though he has also
                    left us poems of charming simplicity; Gaucelm Faidit, from whom we have a
                    touching lament <hi rend="italic">(planh)</hi> on the death of Richard Coeur de
                    Lion; Folquet of Marseilles, the most powerful thinker among the poets of the
                    south, who from being a troubadour became first a monk, then an abbot, and
                    finally bishop of Toulouse.</p>
                <p>It is not without interest to discover from what class of society the troubadours
                    came. Many of them, there is no doubt, had a very humble origin. Bernart of
                    Ventadour’s father was a servant, Peire Vidal’s a maker of furred garments,
                    Perdigon ’ s a fisher. Others belonged to the bourgeoisie: Peire d’Alvernha, for
                    example, Peire Raimon of Toulouse, Elias Fonsalada. More rarely we see traders’
                    sons becoming troubadours; this was the case with Folquet of Marseilles and
                    Aimeric de Pegulhan. A great many were clerics, or at least studied for the
                    church,—for instance, Arnaut of Mareuil, Hugh of Saint Circq (Uc de Saint Circ),
                    Aimeric de Belenoi, Hugh Brunet, Peire Cardinal; some had even taken orders—the
                    monk of Montandon, the monk Gaubert of Puicibot. Ecclesiastical authority did
                    not always tolerate this breach of discipline. Gui d’Uissel, canon and
                    troubadour, was obliged by the injunction of the pontifical legate to give up
                    his song-making. One point is particularly striking—the number of nobles
                    (usually poor knights whose incomes were insufficient to support their rank) who
                    became troubadours, or even, by a greater descent, jongleurs—Raimon de Miraval,
                    Pons de Capdoill, Guillem Azemar, Cadenet, Peirol, Raimbaut de Vacqueiras, and
                    many more. There is no doubt they betook themselves to poetry not merely for
                    their own pleasure, but for the sake of the gifts to be obtained from the nobles
                    whose courts they frequented. A very different position was occupied by such
                    important persons as William of Poitiers, Raimbaut of Orange, the viscount of
                    Saint Antonin, William of Berga, and Blacatz, who made poetry for their own
                    amusement, but contributed not a little, by thus becoming troubadours, to raise
                    the profession.</p>
                <p>The profession itself was entirely dependent on the existence and prosperity of
                    the feudal courts. The troubadours could hardly expect to obtain a livelihood
                    from any other quarter than the generosity of the great. It will consequently be
                    well to mention the more important at least of those princes who are known to
                    have been patrons and some of them practisers of the poetic art. They are
                    arranged approximately in geographical order, and after each are inserted the
                    names of those troubadours with whom they were connected.</p>

                <p>The first thing that strikes öne in this list is that, while the troubadours find
                    protectors in Spain and Italy, they do not seem to have been welcomed in
                    French-speaking countries. This, however, must not be taken too absolutely.
                    Provençal poetry was appreciated in the north of France. There is reason to
                    believe that when Constance, daughter of one of the counts of Arles, was married
                    in 998 to Robert, king of France, she brought along with her Provençal
                    jongleurs. Poems by troubadours are quoted in the French romances of the
                    beginning of the 13th century; some of them are transcribed in the old
                    collections of French songs, and the preacher Robert de Sorbon informs us in a
                    curious passage that one day a jongleur sang a poem by Folquet of Marseilles at
                    the court of the king of France. But in any case it is easy to understand that,
                    the countries of the <hi rend="italic">langue tfoui</hi> having a full developed
                    literature of their own suited to the taste of the people, the troubadours
                    generally preferred to go to regions where they had less to fear in the way of
                    competition.</p>
                <p>The decline and fall of troubadour poetry was mainly due to political causes.
                    When about the beginning of the 13th century the Albigensian war had ruined a
                    large number of the nobles and reduced to lasting poverty a part of the south of
                    France, the profession of troubadour ceased to be lucrative. It was then that
                    many of those poets went to spend their last days in the north of Spain and
                    Italy, where Provençal poetry had for more than one generation been highly
                    esteemed. Following their example, other poets who were not natives of the south
                    of France began to compose in Provençal, and this fashion continued till, about
                    the middle of the 13th century, they gradually abandoned the foreign tongue in
                    northern Italy, and somewhat later in Catalonia, and took to singing the same
                    airs in the local dialects. About the same time in the Provençal region the
                    flame of poetry had died out save in a few places— Narbonne, Rodez, Foix, and
                    Astarac—where it kept burning feebly for a little longer. In the 14th century
                    composition in the language of the country was still practised; but the
                    productions of this period are mainly works for instruction and edification,
                    translations from Latin or sometimes even from French, with an occasional
                    romance. As for the poetry of the troubadours, it was dead for ever.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Form.—</hi> Originally the poems of the troubadours were
                    intended to be sung. The poet usually composed the music as well as the words;
                    and in several cases he owed his fame more to his musical than to his literary
                    ability. Two manuscripts preserve specimens of the music of the troubadours;
                    but, as the subject has not as yet been investigated, we are still ignorant of
                    one of the elements of their success. The following are the principal poetic
                    forms which they employed. The oldest and most usual generic term is <hi
                    rend="italic">vers,</hi> by which is understood any composition intended to be
                    sung, no matter what the subject. At the close of the 12th century it became
                    customary to call all verse treating of love <hi rend="italic">canso,—</hi> the
                    name <hi rend="italic">vers</hi> being then more generally reserved for poems on
                    other themes. The <hi rend="italic">sirventesc</hi> differs from the <hi
                    rend="italic">vers</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">canso</hi> only by its
                    subject, being for the most part devoted to moral and political topics. Peire
                    Cardinal is celebrated for the <hi rend="italic">sirventescs</hi> he composed
                    against the clergy of his time. The political poems of Bertran de Born are <hi
                    rend="italic">sirventescs.</hi> There is reason to believe that originally this
                    word meant simply a poem composed by a <hi rend="italic">sirvent</hi> (Lat. <hi
                    rend="italic">serviens)</hi> or man-at-arms. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >sirventesc</hi> is very frequently composed in the form, sometimes even with
                    the rhymes, of a popular song, so that it might be sung to the same air. The <hi
                    rend="italic">tenson</hi> is a debate between two interlocutors, each of whom
                    has a stanza in turn. The <hi rend="italic">partimen</hi> (Fr. <hi rend="italic"
                    >jeu</hi><hi rend="italic">parti)</hi> is also a poetic debate, but it differs
                    from the tenson in so far that the range of debate is limited. In the first
                    stanza one of the partners proposes two alternatives; the other partner chooses
                    one of them and defends it, and the opposite side remains to be defended by the
                    original propounder. Often in a final couplet a judge or arbiter is appointed to
                    decide between the parties. This poetic game is mentioned by William, count of
                    Poitiers, at the end of the 11th century. The <hi rend="italic">pastoreta,</hi>
                    afterwards <hi rend="italic">pastorela,</hi> is in general an account of the
                    love adventures of a knight with a shepherdess. All these classes have one form
                    capable of endless variations, five or more stanzas and one or two envois. The
                    <hi rend="italic">dansa</hi> and <hi rend="italic">balada,</hi> intended to mark
                    the time in dancing, are pieces with a refrain. The <hi rend="italic">alba,</hi>
                    which has also a refrain, is, as the name indicates, a waking or morning song at
                    the dawning of the day. All those classes are in stanzas. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >descort</hi> is not tlιus divided, and consequently it must be set to music
                    right through. Its name is derived from the fact that, its component parts not
                    being equal, there is a kind of “discord” between them. It is generally reserved
                    for themes of love. Other kinds of lyric poems, sometimes with nothing new about
                    them except the name, were developed in the south of France; but those here
                    mentioned are thé more important.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Narrative Poetry.—</hi> Although the strictly lyric poetry of
                    the troubadours forms the most original part of Provençal literature, it must
                    not be supposed that the remainder is of trifling importance. Narrative poetry,
                    especially, received in the south of France a great development, and, thanks to
                    recent discoveries, a considerable body of it has already become known. Several
                    classes must be distinguished :—the <hi rend="italic">chanson</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de geste</hi> legendary or historic, the romance of adventure, and
                    the novel. Northern France remains emphatically the native country of the <hi
                    rend="italic">chanson</hi><hi rend="italic">de geste</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> but, although in the south different social conditions, a more delicate
                    taste, and a higher state of civilization prevented a similar profusion of tales
                    of war and heroic deeds, Provençal literature has some highly important
                    specimens of this class. The first place belongs to <hi rend="italic">Girart de
                    Roussillon,</hi> a poem of ten thousand verses, which relates the struggles of
                    Charles Martel with his powerful vassal the Burgundian Gerard of Roussillon. It
                    is a literary production of rare excellence and of exceptional interest for the
                    history of civilization in the 11th and 12th centuries. <hi rend="italic">Gerard
                    of Roussillon</hi> belongs only within certain limits to the literature of
                    southern France. The recension which we possess appears to have been made on the
                    borders of Limousin and Poitou; but it is clearly no more than a recast of an
                    older poem no longer extant, probably either of French or at least Burgundian
                    origin. To Limousin also seems to belong the poem of <hi rend="italic">Aigar
                    and</hi><hi rend="italic">Maurin</hi> (12th century), of which we have
                    unfortunately only a fragment so short that the subject cannot be clearly made
                    out. Of less heroic character is the poem of <hi rend="italic">Daurel
                    and</hi><hi rend="italic">Beton</hi> (end of the 12th or beginning of the 13th
                    century), connected with the cycle of Charlemagne, but by the romantic character
                    of the events more like a regular romance of adventure. We cannot, however, form
                    a complete judgment in regard to it, as the only MS. in which it has been
                    preserved is defective at the close, and that to an amount there is no means of
                    ascertaining. Midway between legend and history may be classified the Provençal
                    <hi rend="italic">Chanson of Antioch,</hi> a fragment of which, 700 verses in
                    extent, has been recently recovered in Madrid and published in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Archives de l</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">0rient Latin,</hi> vol. ii. To history
                    proper belongs the chanson of the crusade against the Albigensians, which, in
                    its present state, is composed of two poems one tacked to the other: the first,
                    containing the events from the beginning of the crusade till 1213, is the work
                    of a certain William of Tudela, a moderate supporter of the crusaders; the
                    second, from 1213 to 1218, is by a vehement opponent of the enterprise. The
                    language and style of the two parts are no less different than the opinions.
                    Finally, about 1280 a native of Toulouse named Guillaume Anelier composed, in
                    the chanson de geste form, a poem on the war carried on in Navarre by the French
                    in 1276 and 1277. It is an historical work of little literary merit. All these
                    poems are, as chansons de geste ought to be, in stanzas of indefinite length,
                    with a single rhyme. <hi rend="italic">Gerard of Roussillon, Aigar and</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Maurin,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Daurel and</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Beton</hi> are in verses of ten, the others in verses of twelve
                    syllables. The peculiarity of the versification in <hi rend="italic">Gerard</hi>
                    is that the pause in the line occurs after the sixth syllable, and not, as is
                    usual, after the fourth. Like the chanson de geste, the romance of adventure is
                    but slightly represented in the south; but it is to be borne in mind that many
                    works of this class must have perished, as is rendered evident by the mere fact
                    that, with few exceptions, the narrative poems which have come down to us are
                    each known by a single manuscript only. We possess but three Provençal romances
                    of adventure :— <hi rend="italic">Jaufré</hi> (composed in the middle of the
                    13th century and dedicated to a king of Aragon, possibly James I.), <hi
                    rend="italic">Blandin</hi><hi rend="italic">of Cornwall,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Guillem</hi><hi rend="italic">de la Barra.</hi> The first two are
                    connected with the Arthurian cycle: <hi rend="italic">Jaufré</hi> is an elegant
                    and ingenious work; <hi rend="italic">Blandin</hi><hi rend="italic">of
                    Cornwall</hi> the dullest and most insipid one can well imagine. The romance of
                    <hi rend="italic">Guillem de la Barra</hi> tells an unlikely story also found in
                    Boccaccio’s <hi rend="italic">Decameron</hi> (2d Day, viii.). It is rather a
                    poor poem; but as a contribution to literary history it has the advantage of
                    being dated. It was completed in 1318, and is dedicated to a noble of Languedoc
                    called Sicart de Montaut. Connected with the romance of. adventure is the novel
                    (in Provençal <hi rend="italic">novas,</hi> always in the plural), which <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n899/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0899-0876"/> is originally an account of an event “newly”
                    happened. The novel must have been at first in the south what, as we see by the
                    <hi rend="italic">Decameron,</hi> it was in Italy, a society pastime,—the wits
                    in turn relating anecdotes, true or imaginary, which they think likely to amuse
                    their auditors. But before long this kind of production was treated in verse,
                    the form adopted being that of the romances of adventure—octosyllabic verses
                    rhyming in pairs. Some of those novels which have come down to us may be ranked
                    with the most graceful works in Provençal literature; two are from the pen of
                    the Catalan author Raimon Vidal de Besalu. One, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Castia-gilos</hi> (the Chastisement of the Jealous Man), is a treatment, not
                    easily matched for elegance, of a frequently-handled theme—the story of the
                    husband who, in order to entrap his wife, takes the disguise of the lover whom
                    she is expecting and receives with satisfaction blows intended, as he thinks,
                    for him whose part he is playing; the other, <hi rend="italic">The Judgment of
                    Love,</hi> is the recital of a question of the law of love, departing
                    considerably from the subjects usually treated in the novels. Mention may also
                    be made of the novel of <hi rend="italic">The Parrotry</hi> Arnaut de
                    Carcassonne, in which the principal character is a parrot of great) eloquence
                    and ability, who succeeds marvellously in securing the success of the amorous
                    enterprises of his master. Novels came to be extended to the proportions of a
                    long romance. <hi rend="italic">Flamenca,</hi> which belongs to the novel type,
                    has still over eight thousand verses, though the only MS. of it has lost some
                    leaves both at the beginning and at the end. This poem, composed in all
                    probability in 1234, is the story of a lady who by very ingenious devices, not
                    unlike those employed in the <hi rend="italic">Miles</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Gloriosus</hi> of Plautus, succeeds in eluding the vigilance of her jealous
                    husband. No analysis can be given here of a work the action of which is so
                    highly complicated; suffice it to remark that there is no book in mediaeval
                    literature which betokens so much quickness of intellect and is so instructive
                    in regard to the manners and usages of polite society in the 13th century. We
                    know that novels were in great favour in the south of France, although the
                    specimens preserved are not very numerous. Statements made by Francesco de
                    Barberino (early part of 14th century), and recently brought to light, give us a
                    glimpse of several works of this class which have been lost. From the south of
                    France the novel spread into Catalonia, where we find in the 14th century a
                    number of novels in verse very similar to the Provençal ones, and into Italy,
                    where in general the prose form has been adopted.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Didactic and Religious Poetry.—</hi> Compositions intended for
                    instruction, correction, and edification were very numerous in the south of
                    France as well as elsewhere, and, in spite of the enormous losses sustained by
                    Provençal literature, much of this kind still remains. But it is seldom that
                    such works have much originality or literary value. Originality was naturally
                    absent, as the aim of the writers was mainly to bring the teachings contained in
                    Latin works within the reach of lay hearers or readers. Literary value was not
                    of course excluded by the lack of originality, but by an unfortunate chance the
                    greater part of those who sought to instruct or edify, and attempted to
                    substitute moral works for secular productions in favour with the people, were
                    persons of limited ability. It is needless to enumerate all the lives of saints,
                    all the treatises of popular theology and morals, all the books of devotion, all
                    the pious canticles, composed in Provençal during the Middle Ages. Enough to
                    recall the Boetius poem (unfortunately a mere fragment) already mentioned as one
                    of the oldest documents of the language, and really a remarkable work. From the
                    multitude of saints’ lives we may single out that of St Honorat of Lerins by
                    Raimon Feraud (about 1300), which is distinguished by variety and elegance of
                    versification, but is almost entirely a translation from Latin. Among poems
                    strictly didactic one stands out by reason of its great extent (nearly
                    thirty-five thousand verses) and the somewhat original conception of its’
                    scheme—the <hi rend="italic">Breviari</hi><hi rend="italic">d'amor,</hi> a vast
                    encyclopaedia, on a theological basis, composed by the Minorite friar Matfre
                    Ermengaut of Beziers between 1288 and 1300 or thereabout.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Drama.—</hi> Twenty years ago it might have been questioned
                    whether dramatic representation was known in the south of France, but within
                    that time several short dramatic pieces have been published or described; and a
                    considerable number of actual theatrical representations have been found
                    mentioned in the local records. Everything of this kind that we know of belongs
                    to the religious drama, the oldest form in every mediaeval literature. The
                    period at which a purely secular theatre takes its rise in most quarters is the
                    15th century; and by that time there was hardly any Provençal literature left We
                    possess in Provençal mysteries of Saint Agnes, of the Passion, of the Marriage
                    of the Virgin, all belonging to the close of the 13th century or the first half
                    of the 14th. In the 15th century there is a fragment of a mystery of St James.
                    Provence properly so-called, especially the eastern portion of it, seems to have
                    been particularly fond of representations of this sort, to judge by the entries
                    in the local records. At the close of the 15th and the beginning of the 16th
                    century many mysteries were played in that part of Dauphiné which corresponds to
                    the present department of Hautes-Alpes. Five mysteries of this district,
                    composed and played somewhere about 1500 (the mysteries of St Eustace, of</p>
                <p>St Andrew, of St Pons, of Sts Peter and Paul, and of St Anthony of Vienne), have
                    come down to us, and are now (1885) being edited. The influence of the
                    contemporary French sacred drama may to some extent be traced in them.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Prose—</hi> Prose composition in the south of France belongs to
                    a comparatively late stage of literary development; and the same remark applies
                    to the other Romanic countries, particularly to northern France, where prose
                    hardly comes into fashion till the 13th century, the prose of the preceding
                    century being little else than translations of the books of the Bible
                    (especially the Psalter).</p>
                <p>As early as the 12th century we find in the south sermons, whose importance is
                    more linguistic than literary. To the 13th century belong certain lives of the
                    troubadours intended to be prefixed to, and to explain, their poems. They were
                    written before 1250, when the first anthologies of troubadour poetry were
                    compiled; and some of them are the work of the troubadour Hugh of Saint Circq.
                    To the same period must be assigned <hi rend="italic">Las Razos de trobar</hi>
                    of the troubadour Raimon Vidal de Besalù (an elegant little treatise touching on
                    various points of grammar and the poetic art), and also the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Donatz Proensals</hi> of Hugh Faidit, a writer otherwise unknown, who drew up
                    his purely grammatical work at the request of two natives of northern Italy. Of
                    about the same date are two translations of the New Testament, one of which,
                    preserved in MS. at Lyons, seems to have been made for Albigensians. A
                    remarkable work, both in style and thought, is the <hi rend="italic">L·ife of St
                    Douceline,</hi> who lived at the close of the 13th century near Marseilles, and
                    founded an order of Beguines. In the 14th century compositions in prose grew
                    more numerous. Some rare local chronicles may be mentioned, the most interesting
                    being that of Mascaro, which contains the annals of the town of Béziers from
                    1338 to 1390. Theological treatises and pious legends translated from Latin and
                    French also increase innumber. The leading prose work of this period is the
                    treatise on grammar, poetry, and rhetoric known by the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Leys d’Amors.</hi> It was composed in Toulouse, shortly before 1350, by a group
                    of scholars, and was intended to fix the rules of the language with a view to
                    the promotion of a poetical renaissance. For this purpose an academy was founded
                    which awarded prizes in the shape of flowers to the best compositions in verse.
                    We still possess the collection of the pieces crowned by this academy during the
                    14th century, and a large part of the 15th <hi rend="italic">(.Flors del gay
                    saber).</hi> Unfortunately they are rather academic than poetic. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Leys d'Amors,</hi> which was to be the starting point and rule of
                    the new poetry, is the best production of this abortive renaissance. The decay
                    of Provençal literature arrived too soon to allow of a full development of
                    prose. The 14th and 15th centuries were in no respect a prosperous period for
                    literature in the south of France. In the 15 th century people began to write
                    French both in verse and prose; and from that time Provençal literature became a
                    thing of the past.</p>
                <p>Bibliography.—Fauriel, Histoire de la poésie provençale (Paris, 1816, 3 vols.
                    8vo), is quite antiquated. Not only are three-fourths of the works in Provençal
                    poetry ignored, but the very idea of the book is vitiated by the author's system
                    (now abandoned), based on the supposition that in the south of France there was
                    an immense epic literature. The articles on the troubadours in the Histoire
                    littéraire de la France, by Ginguené, E. David, &lt;fcc., must be consulted with
                    extreme caution. F. Diez's Die Poesie der Troubadours (Zwickau, 1827, 8vo; new
                    ed. by Bartsch, 1883) and his Leben und Werke der Troubadours (Zwickau, 1829,
                    8vo; new cd. by Bartsch, 1882) are of great excellence for the time at which
                    they appeared. For the history of Provençal literature in Spain, see Mila y
                    Fontanais, De los trovadores en Espana (Barcelona, 1861, 8vo); for Italy,
                    Cavedoni, Ricerche storiche in tor no ai trovatori provenzali (Modena, 1844,
                    8vo); A. Thomas, Francesco Barberino et la littérature provençale en Italie
                    (Paris, 1883, 8vo); O. Schultz, “Die Lebensverhältnisse der italienischen
                    Trobadors,” in Zeits. für romanische Philologie (1883). For the bibliography
                    consult especially Bartsch, Grundriss zur Geschichte der provenzalischen
                    Literatur (Elberfeld, 1872, 8vo). For texts the reader maybe referred to
                    Baynouard, Choix de poésies originales des Troubadours (1816-21, 6 vols. 8vo),
                    and Lexique roman, ou diet, de la langue des troubadours, of which vol. i.
                    (1838) is entirely taken up with texts; and Rochegude, Parnasse occitanien
                    (Toulouse, 1819, 8vo). All the pieces published by Baynouard and Rochegude have
                    been reprinted without amendment by Mahn, Die Werke der Troubadours in provenz.
                    Sprache (Berlin, 8vo, vol. i. 1846, ii. 1855-64, iii. 1880, iv,, containing an
                    edition of the troubadour Guiraut Riquier, 1884). The same editor's Gedichte der
                    Troubadours (Berlin, 1856-73) is a collection conspicuous for its want of order
                    and of accuracy (see Romania, iii. 303). Among editions of individual
                    troubadours may be mentioned—Peire Vidal's Lieder, by Karl Bartsch (Berlin,
