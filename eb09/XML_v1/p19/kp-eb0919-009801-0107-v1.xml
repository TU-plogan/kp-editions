                <p><label type="entry">PINDAR</label>, the greatest lyric poet of ancient Greece
                    whose work is represented by large remains, was born about 522 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> being thus some thirty-four years younger than
                    Simonides of Ceos. His father’s name was Dai-phantus; his birthplace the village
                    of Cynoscephalae near Thebes in Boeotia. The traditions of his family, which
                    claimed a proud descent, have left their impress on his poetry, and are not
                    without importance for a correct estimate of his relation to his contemporaries.
                    The clan of the Aegeidae—tracing their line from the hero Aegeus —belonged to
                    the “Cadmean” element of Thebes, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> to the elder
                    nobility whose supposed date went back to the days of the founder Cadmus. A
                    branch of the Theban Aegeidae had been settled in Achaean times at Amyclae in
                    the valley of the Eurotas (Pind. <hi rend="italic">Isthm.</hi> vi. 14), and
                    after the Dorian conquest of the Peloponnesus had apparently been adopted by the
                    Spartans into one of the three Dorian tribes. The Spartan Aegeidae helped to
                    colonize the island of Thera <hi rend="italic">(Pyth.</hi> v. 68). Another
                    branch of the race was settled at Cyrene in Africa; and Pindar tells how his
                    Aegid clansmen at Thebes <hi rend="superscript"> u</hi> showed honour <hi
                    rend="italic">” to</hi> Cyrene as often as they kept the festival of the Carneia
                    <hi rend="italic">(Pyth.</hi> v. 75). Pindar is to be conceived, then, as
                    standing within the circle of those families for whom the heroic myths were
                    domestic records. He had a personal link with the memories which everywhere were
                    most cherished by Dorians, no less than with those which appealed to men of
                    “Cadmean” or of Achaean stock. And the wide ramifications of the Aegeidae
                    throughout Hellas rendered it peculiarly fitting that a member of that
                    illustrious clan should celebrate the glories of many cities in verse which was
                    truly Panhellenic.</p>
                <p>Pindar is said to have received his first lessons in fluteplaying from one
                    Scopelinus at Thebes, and afterwards to have studied at Athens under the
                    musicians Apollodorus (or Agathocles) and Lasus of Hermione. In his youth, as
                    the story went, he was defeated in a poetical contest by the Theban Corinna—who,
                    in reference to his use of Theban mythology, is said to have advised him “to sow
                    with the hand, not with the sack.” There is an extant fragment in which Corinna
                    reproves another Theban poetess, Myrto, <hi rend="italic">“for</hi> that she, a
                    woman, contended with Pindar” <hi rend="italic">(on βava φoυσ eβa TiwSapoio τroτ
                    epιv)</hi> —a sentiment, it may be remarked, which does not well accord with the
                    story of Corinna’s own victory. The facts that stand out from these meagre
                    traditions are that Pindar was precocious and laborious. Preparatory labour of a
                    somewhat severe and complex kind was, indeed, indispensable for the Greek lyric
                    poet of that age. Lyric composition demanded studies not only in metre but in
                    music, and in the adaptation of both to the intricate movements of the choral
                    dance <hi rend="italic">(opχησnκη).</hi> Several passages in Pindar’s extant
                    odes glance at the long technical development of Greek lyric poetry before his
                    time, and at the various elements of art which the lyrist was required to temper
                    into a harmonious whole (see, <hi rend="italic">e.g., Ol.</hi> iii. 8, vi. 91,
                    ix. 1, xiv. 15, xiii. 18; <hi rend="italic">Pyth.</hi> xii. 23, &lt;fcc.). The
                    earliest ode which can be dated <hi rend="italic">(Pyth. x.)</hi> belongs to the
                    twentieth year of Pindar’s age (502 B.c.); the latest <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Olymp,</hi> v.) to the seventieth (452 B.c.). He visited the court of Hiero at
                    Syracuse; Theron, the despot of Acragas, also entertained him; and his travels
                    perhaps included Cyrene. Tradition notices the special closeness of his
                    relations with Delphi: “He was greatly honoured by all the Greeks, because he
                    was so beloved of Apollo that he even received a share of the offerings; and at
                    the sacrifices the priest would cry aloud that Pindar come in to the feast of
                    the god.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Πινδάρου <hi

                <p>Among the Greeks of his own and later times, Pindar was pre-eminently
                    distinguished for his piety towards the gods (∈υσ∈∕2∈στατoς, <hi rend="italic"

                    to dance and sing by night in praise of the Mother of the Gods (Cybele) and
                    Pan—deities peculiarly associated with the Phrygian music of the flute, in which
                    other members of Pindar’s family besides the poet himself are said to have
                    excelled. A statue and shrine of Cybele, which he dedicated at Thebes, were the
                    work of the Theban artists, Aristomedes and Socrates. He also dedicated at
                    Thebes a statue to Hermes Agoraios, and another, by Calamis, to Zeus Ammon. The
                    latter god claimed his especial veneration because Cyrene, one of the homes of
                    his Aegid ancestry, stood “where Zeus Ammon hath his seat,” ι.e., near the oasis
                    and temple (∆toς <hi rend="italic">èv</hi><hi rend="italic">*Aμμωvoς θeμeθhots,
                    Pyth.</hi> iv. 16). The author of one of the Greek lives of Pindar says that,
                    “when Pausanias the king of the Lacedaemonians was burning Thebes, some one
                    wrote on Pindar’s house, ‘ Burn not the house of Pindar the poet;’ and thus it
                    alone escaped destruction.” This incident, of which the occasion is not further
                    defined, has been regarded as a later invention.<note anchored="true"

                    similar clemency of Alexander the Great, when he sacked Thebes ope hundred and
                    eight years after the traditional date of Pindar’s death (335 B.c.). He spared
                    only (1) the Cadmeia, or citadel, of Thebes (thenceforth to be occupied by a
                    Macedonian garrison); (2) the temples and holy places; and (3) Pindar’s house.
                    While the inhabitants were sold into slavery, exception was made only of (1)
                    priests and priestesses; (2) persons who had been connected by private <hi
                    rend="italic">ξ,τνία.</hi> with Philip or Alexander, or by public £ma with the
                    Macedonians; (3) Pindar’s descendants. It is probable enough, as Dio Chrysostom
                    suggests (ii. 33, 25), that Alexander was partly moved by personal gratitude to
                    a poet who had celebrated his ancestor Alexander I. of Macedon. But he must have
                    been also, or chiefly, influenced by the sacredness which in the eyes of all
                    Hellenes surrounded Pindar’s memory, not only as that of a great national poet,
                    but also as that of a man who had stood in a specially close relation to the
                    gods, and, above all, to the Delphian Apollo.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It will be remarked that history requires us
                    to modify the statement in Milton’s famous lines:—</p><p>“The great Emathian

                    and tower Went to the ground.”</p><p>Indeed, the point of the incident depends
                    much on the fact that the temples and Pindar’s house were classed together for
                    exemption.</p></note> Upwards of six hundred years after Pindar’s death, the
                    traveller Pausanias saw an iron chair which was preserved among the most
                    precious treasures of the temple in the sanctuary at Delphi. It was the chair,
                    he was told, “in which Pindar used to sit, whenever he came to Delphi, and to
                    chant those of his songs which pertain to Apollo.”</p>
                <p>During the second half of Pindar’s life, Athens was rising to that supremacy in
                    literature and art which was to prove more lasting than her political primacy.
                    Pindar did not live to see the Parthenon, or to witness the mature triumphs of
                    Sophocles; but he knew the sculpture of Calamis, and he may have known the
                    masterpieces of Aeschylus. It is interesting to note the feeling of this great
                    Theban poet, who stands midway between Homeric epos and Athenian drama, towards
                    the Athens of which Thebes was so often the bitterest foe, but with which he
                    himself had so large a measure of spiritψιT kinship. A few words remain from a
                    dithyramb in which he paid a glowing tribute to those “sons of Athens” who “laid
                    the shining foundations of freedom” (τrαtδ∈ς Α0avatωv <hi rend="italic"

                    Pindar for his praise of Athens, and that the Athenians repaid him twice the
                    sum.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Compare Jebb, <hi

                    preserved by Isocrates—less than one hundred years after Pindar’s death—is good
                    warrant for the belief that Pindar had received some exceptional honours from
                    Athens. Pausanias saw a statue of Pindar at Athens, near the temple of Ares (i.
                    8, 4). Besides the fragment just mentioned, several passages in Pindar’s extant
                    odes bespeak his love for Athens. Its name is almost always joined by him with
                    some epithet of praise or ι*everence. In alluding to the great battles of the
                    Persian wars, while he gives the glory of Plataea to the Spartans, he assigns
                    that of Salamis to the Athenians <hi rend="italic">(Pyth.</hi> i. 75). In
                    celebrating the Pythian victory of the Athenian Megacles, he begins thus
                    :—“Fairest of preludes is the renown of Athens for the mighty race of the
                    Alcmaeonidae. What home, or what house, could I call mine by a name that should
                    sound more glorious for Hellas to hear ?” Referring to the fact that an
                    Aeginetan victor in the games had been trained by an Athenian, he says— <hi

                    Pindar compares the poet’s efforts to the athlete’s, we may well believe that he
                    was thinking of his own early training at Athens under Lasus of Hermione.</p>
                <p>Pindar’s versatility as a lyric poet is one of the characteristics remarked by
                    Horace <hi rend="italic">(Carm.</hi> iv. 2), and is proved by the fragments,
                    though the poems which have come down entire represent only one class of

                    commemorating successes in the great games. The lyric types to which the

                    Eleusinian mysteries (ίδώρ <hi rend="italic">κelva)—</hi> has been conjecturally
                    referred to the <hi rend="italic">Θρηvos</hi> which Pindar is said to have

                    grandfather of Pericles. A number of small fragments, which cannot be certainly

                    second and fourth of each Olympiad; and (4) <hi rend="italic"

                    of citing an ode is by the nomin. <hi rend="italic">plur.</hi> followed by the

                    &amp;. The chronological range of the collection (so far as ascertainable) is
                    from 502 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi><hi rend="italic">(Pyth.</hi> x.) to 452
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi><hi rend="italic">(01.</hi> v.). With respect to
                    the native places of the victors, the geographical distribution is as follows
                    :—for the mainland of Greece proper, 13 odes; for Aegina, 11; for Sicily, 15;
                    for the Epizephyrian Locrians (southern Italy), 2 <hi rend="italic">; for</hi>
                    Cyrene (Africa), 3.</p>
                <p>The general characteristics’ of the odes may be briefly considered under the
                    following heads :—(1) language; (2) treatment of theme; (3) sentiment—religious,
                    moral, and political; (4) relation to contemporary art.</p>
                <p>1. The diction of Pindar is distinct in character from that of every other Greek
                    poet, being almost everywhere marked by the greatest imaginative boldness. Thus
                    <hi rend="italic">(a)</hi> metaphor is used even for the expression of common
                    ideas, or the translation of familiar phrases, as when a cloak is called
                    ∈υδιαvov <hi rend="italic">φάρμακον</hi><hi rend="italic">avpâv</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(01.</hi> ix. 104), “a warm remedy for winds.” (δ) Images for the
                    highest excellence are drawn from the furthest limits of travel or navigation,
                    or from the fairest of natural objects; as when the superlative hospitality of a
                    man who kept open house all the year round is described by saying, “far as to
                    Phasis was his voyage in summer days, and in winter to the shores of Nile” <hi
                    rend="italic">(Isthm.</hi> ii. 42); or when Olympia, the “crown <hi
                    rend="italic">” (κopvφa)</hi> or flower (αωτoς) of festivals, is said to be
                    excellent as water, bright as gold, brilliant as the noonday sun <hi
                    rend="italic">(01.</hi> i. <hi rend="italic">ad init.).</hi> This trait might be
                    called <hi rend="italic">the Pindaric imagery of the superlative. (c)</hi>
                    Poetical inversion of ordinary phrase is frequent; as, instead of, “he struck
                    fear into the beasts,” “he gave the beasts to fear” <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Pyth.</hi> v. 56). <hi rend="italic">(d)</hi> The efforts of the poet’s genius
                    are represented under an extraordinary number of similitudes, borrowed from
                    javelin-throwing, chariot driving, leaping, rowing, sailing, ploughing,
                    building, shooting with the bow, sharpening a knife on a whetstone, mixing wine
                    in a bowl, and many more, (e) Homely images, from common life, are not rare; as
                    from accountkeeping, usury, sending merchandise over sea, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >σκυτάλη</hi> or secret despatch, &lt;fcc. And we have such homely proverbs as,
                    “he hath his foot in this shoe,” <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> stands in this
                    case <hi rend="italic">(01.</hi> vi. 8). (∕) The natural order of words in a
                    sentence is often boldly deranged, while, on the other hand, the syntax is
                    seldom difficult, <hi rend="italic">(g)</hi> Words not found except in Pindar
                    are numerous, many of these being compounds which (like <hi rend="italic"
                    >εvapiμβpoτoς, κaτaφvλλopoειv,</hi> &amp;C.) suited the dactylic metres in their
                    Pindaric combinations. Horace was right in speaking of Pindar’s “nova verba,”
                    though they were not confined to the “bold dithyrambs.”</p>
                <p>2. The actual victory which gave occasion for the ode is seldom treated at length
                    or in detail,—which, indeed, only exceptional incidents could justify. Pindar’s
                    method is to take some heroic myth, or group of myths, connected with the
                    victor’s city or family, and, after a brief prelude, to enter on this, returning
                    at the close, as a rule, to the subject of the victor’s merit or good fortune,
                    and interspersing the whole with moral comment. Thus the fourth Pythian is for
                    Arcesilas, king of Cyrene, which was said to have been founded by men of Thera,
                    descendants of one of Jason’s comrades. Using this link, Pindar introduces his
                    splendid narrative of the Argonauts. Many odes, again, contain shorter mythical
                    episodes,—(as the birth of Iamus <hi rend="italic">(01.</hi> vi), or the vision
                    of Bellerophon <hi rend="italic">(01.</hi> xiii),—which form small pictures of
                    masterly finish and beauty. Particular notice is due to the skill with which
                    Pindar often manages the return from a mythical digression to his immediate
                    theme. It is bold and swift, yet is not felt as harshly abrupt—justifying his
                    own phrase at one such turn, <hi rend="italic">καί</hi><hi rend="italic">τιva
                    dιμov ισaμι βρaχυv (Pyth.</hi> iv. 247). It has been thought that, in the
                    parenthesis about the Amazons’ shields <hi rend="italic">(quibus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Mos unde</hi><hi rend="italic">deductus</hi><hi rend="italic">. .

                    rend="italic">Carm.</hi> iv. 4, 17), Horace was imitating a Pindaric transition;
                    if so, he has illustrated his own observation as to the peril of imitating the
                    Theban poet.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">(a)</hi> The religious feeling of Pindar is strongly marked
                    in the odes. “From the gods are all means of human excellence.” He will not
                    believe that the gods, when they dined with Tantalus, ate his son Pelops; rather
                    Poseidon carried off the youth to Olympus. That is, his reason for rejecting a
                    scandalous story about the gods is purely religious, as distinct from moral; it
                    shocks his conception of the divine dignity. With regard to oracles, he
                    inculcates precisely such a view as would have been most acceptable to the
                    Delphic priesthood, viz., that the gods do illumine their prophets, but that
                    human wit can foresee nothing which the gods do not choose to reveal. A mystical
                    doctrine of the soul’s destiny after death appears in some passages (as <hi
                    rend="italic">01.</hi> ii. 66 <hi rend="italic">sq.).</hi> Pindar was familiar
                    with the idea of metempsychosis (cp. <hi rend="italic">ib.</hi> 83), but the
                    attempt to trace Pythagoreanism in some phrases <hi rend="italic">(Pyth.</hi>
                    ii. 34, iii. 74) appears unsafe. The belief in a fully conscious existence for
                    the soul in a future state, determined by the character of the earthly life,
                    entered into the teaching of the Eleusinian and other mysteries. Comparing the
                    fragment of the Θpτ}ι∕os (no. 137, Bergk), we may probably regard the mystic or
                    esoteric element in Pindar’s theology as due to such a source.</p>
                <p>(ό) The moral sentiment pervading Pindar’s odes rests on a constant recognition
                    of the limits imposed by the divine will on human effort, combined with
                    strenuous exhortation that each man should strive to reach the limit allowed
                    in-his own case. Native temperament <hi rend="italic">(φυη)</hi> is the grand
                    source of all human excellence (αpeτι)), while such excellences as can be
                    acquired by <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n110/mode/1up"

                    01.</hi> ix. 100) are of relatively small scope—the sentiment, we may remark, of
                    one whose thoughts were habitually conversant with the native qualities of a
                    poet on the one hand and of an athlete on the other. The elements of υγiειs <hi
                    rend="italic">όλβος</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> “sane happiness,” such as has
                    least reason to dread the jealousy of the gods, —are substance sufficing for
                    daily wants and good repute (ευλογία). He who has these should not “seek to be a
                    god.” “Wealth set with virtues” <hi rend="italic">(πλούτος</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >apeτaις 8c8aι8aλμivoς),</hi> as gold with precious gems, is the most fortunate
                    lot, <hi rend="italic">because</hi> it affords the amplest opportunities for
                    honourable activity. Pindar does not rise above the ethical standard of an age
                    which said, “love thy friend and hate thy foe” (cp. <hi rend="italic">Pyth.</hi>
                    ii. 83; <hi rend="italic">Isthm.</hi> iii. 65). But in one sense he has a moral
                    elevation which is distinctively his own; he is the glowing prophet of generous
                    emulation and of reverent self-control.</p>
                <p>(c) The political sentiments of the Theban poet are suggested by <hi
                    rend="italic">Pyth.</hi> xi. 53; “In polities I find the middle state crowned
                    with more enduring good; therefore praise I not the despot’s portion; those
                    virtues move my zeal which serve the folk.” If in <hi rend="italic">Pyth.</hi>
                    ii. 86 a democracy is described as <hi rend="italic">b</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >λάβρος στρατός,</hi><hi rend="italic">“</hi> the raging crowd,” it is to be
                    noted that the ode is for Hiero of Syracuse, and that the phrase clearly refers
                    to the violence of those democratic revolutions which, in the early part of the
                    5th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> more than once convulsed Sicilian
                    cities. At Thebes, after the Persian wars, a “constitutional oligarchy”
                    (ολιγαρχία <hi rend="italic">Ισόνομος,</hi> Thue. iii. 62) had replaced the
                    narrower and less temperate oligarchy of former days (δυναστεία ου p,∈τα <hi
                    rend="italic">νόμων)</hi>; and in this we may probably recognize the phase of
                    Greek political life most congenial to Pindar. He speaks of a king’s lot as
                    unique in its opportunities <hi rend="italic">(01.</hi> i. 113); he sketches the
                    character of an ideal king <hi rend="italic">(Pyth.</hi> iii. 71); but nothing
                    in his poetry implies liking for the <hi rend="italic">τvpavviς</hi> as a form
                    of government. Towards the Greek princes of Sicily and Cyrene his tone is ever
                    one of manly independence; he speaks as a Greek citizen whose lineage places him
                    on a level with the proudest of the Dorian race, and whose office invests him
                    with an almost sacred dignity. In regard to the politics of Hellas at large,
                    Pindar makes us feel the new sense of leisure for quiet pursuits and civilizing
                    arts which came after the Persian wars. He honours “Tranquillity, the friend of
                    cities” ('Aσυχiα <hi rend="italic">φιλόπολις,</hi><hi rend="italic">01.</hi> iv.
                    16). The epic poet sang of wars; Pindar celebrates the “rivalries of peace.”</p>
                <p>4. Pindar’s genius was boldly original; at the same time he was an exquisite
                    artist. “Mine be it to invent new strains, mine the skill to hold my course in
                    the chariot of the Muses; and may courage go with me, and power of ample grasp”
                    <hi rend="italic">(τόλμα</hi> δε και <hi rend="italic">aμφιλaφης 8vvaμις</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">εσποιτο, ΟΙ.</hi> ix. 80). Here we see the exulting sense of
                    inborn strength; in many other places we perceive the feeling of conscious
                    art—as in the phrase δαιδάλλειν, so apt for his method of inlaying an ode with
                    mythical subjects, or when he compares the opening of a song to the front of a
                    stately building <hi rend="italic">(01.</hi> vi. 3). Pindar’s sympathy with
                    external nature was deeper and keener than is often discernible in the poetry of
                    his age. It appears, for example, in hi§ welcome of the season when “the chamber
                    of the Hours is opened, and delicate plants perceive the fragrant spring” (fr.
                    75); in the passage where Jason invokes “the rushing strength of waves and
                    winds, and the nights, and the paths of the deep” <hi rend="italic">(Pyth.</hi>
                    iv. 194); in the lines on the eclipse of the sun (fr. 107); and in the picture
                    of the eruption, when Etna, “pillar of the sky, nurse of keen snow all the
                    year,” sends forth “pure springs of fire unapproachable” <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Pyth.</hi> i. 20). The poet’s feeling for colour is often noticeable, —as in
                    the beautiful story of the birth of Iamus—when</p>
                <p>Evadne lays aside her silver pitcher and her girdle of scarlet web; the babe is
                    found, “its delicate body steeped in the golden and deep purple rays of pansies”
                    <hi rend="italic">(01.</hi> vi. 55).</p>
                <p>The spirit of art, in every form, is represented for Pindar by <hi rend="italic"
                    >χάρις</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> “the source of all delights to mortals” <hi
                    rend="italic">(01.</hi> i. 30)—or by the personified Charites (Graces). The
                    Charites were often represented as young maidens, decking themselves with early
                    flowers—the rose, in particular, being sacred to them as well as to Aphrodite.
                    In Pindar’s mind, as in the old Greek conception from which the worship of the
                    Charites sprang, the instinct of beautiful art was inseparable from the sense of
                    natural beauty. The period from 500 to 460 B.C., to which most of Pindar’s
                    extant odes belong, marked a stage in the development of Greek sculpture. The
                    schools of Argos, Sicyon, and Aegina were effecting a transition from archaic
                    types to the art which was afterwards matured in the age of Phidias. Olympia·
                    forms the central link between Pindar’s poetry and Greek sculpture. From about
                    560 B.c. onwards, sculpture had been applied to the commemoration of athletes,
                    chiefly at Olympia. In a striking passage <hi rend="italic">(N^em.</hi> V. <hi
                    rend="italic">ad init.)</hi> Pindar recognizes sculpture and poetry as sister
                    arts employed in the commemoration of the athlete, and contrasts the merely
                    local effect of the statue with the wide diffusion of the poem. “No sculptor I,
                    to fashion images that shall stand idly on one pedestal for aye; no, go thou
                    forth from Aegina, sweet song of mine, on every freighted ship, on each light
                    bark.” Many particular subjects were common to Pindar and contemporary
                    sculpture. Thus (1) the sculptures on the east pediment of the temple at Aegina
                    represented Heracles coming to seek the aid of Telamon against Troy—a theme
                    brilliantly treated by Pindar in the fifth Isthmian; (2) Hiero’s victory in the
                    chariot-race was commemorated at Olympia by the joint work of the sculptors
                    Onatas and Calamis; (3) the Gigantomachia, (4) the wedding of Heracles and Hebe,
                    (5) the war of the Centaurs with the Lapithae, and (6) a contest between
                    Heracles and Apollo are instances of mythical material treated alike by the poet
                    and by sculptors of his day. The contemporary improvements in town architecture,
                    introducing spacious and well-paved streets, such as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >σκυρωτή</hi><hi rend="italic">b8oς</hi> at Cyrene <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Pyth.</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> n.</hi> 87), suggest his frequent
                    comparison of the paths of song to broad and stately causeways (τrλατειαι
                    πρόσοδοι—εκατόρπεδοι κελευ0oι, <hi rend="italic">Nem.</hi> vi. 47, V. 22). A
                    song is likened to cunning work which blends gold, ivory, and coral <hi
                    rend="italic">(Nem.</hi> vii. 78). Pindar’s feeling that poetry, though
                    essentially a divine gift, has a technical side <hi rend="italic">(σοφία),</hi>
                    and that on this side it has had an historical development like that of other
                    arts, is forcibly illustrated by his reference to the inventions <hi
                    rend="italic">(σοφίσματα)</hi> for which Corinth had early been famous. He
                    instances (1) the development of the dithyramb, (2) certain improvements in the
                    harnessing and driving of horses, and (3) the addition of the pediment to
                    temples <hi rend="italic">(01.</hi> xiii.).</p>
                <p>In the development of Greek lyric poetry two periods are broadly distinguished.
                    During the first, from about 600 to 500 B.c., lyric poetry is local or tribal—as
                    Alcaeus and Sappho write for Lesbians, Aleman and Stesichorus for Dorians.
                    During the second period, which takes its rise in the sense of Hellenic unity
                    created by the Persian wars, the lyric poet addresses all Greece. Pindar and
                    Simonides are the great representatives of this second period, to which
                    Bacchylides, the nephew of Simonides, also belongs. These, with a few minor
                    poets, are classed by German writers as <hi rend="italic">die</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">universalen</hi><hi rend="italic">Meliker.</hi> The Greeks usually
                    spoke, not of “lyric,” but of “melic” poetry <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> meant
                    to be sung, and not, like the epic, recited); and “universal melic” is lyric
                    poetry addressed to all Greece. But Pindar is more than the chief extant lyrist.
                    Epic, lyric, and dramatic poetry succeeded each other in Greek literature<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n111/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0111-0102"/> by a natural development. Each of them was the
                    spontaneous utterance of the age which brought it forth. In Pindar we can see
                    that phase of the Greek mind which produced Homeric epos passing over into the
                    phase which produced Athenian drama. His spirit is often thoroughly
                    dramatic—witness such scenes as the interview between Jason and Pelias <hi
                    rend="italic">(Pyth.</hi> iv.), the meeting of Apollo and Chiron <hi
                    rend="italic">(Pyth.</hi> ix,), the episode of Castor and Polydeuces <hi
                    rend="italic">(N^em.</hi> X.), the entertainment of Heracles by Telamon <hi
                    rend="italic">(Isthm.</hi> v.). Epic narrative alone was no longer enough for
                    the men who had known that great trilogy of national life, the Persian
                    invasions; they longed to see the heroes moving and to hear them speaking. The
                    poet of Olympia, accustomed to see beautiful forms in vivid action or vivid art,
                    was well fitted to be the lyric interpreter of the new dramatic impulse. Pindar
                    has more of the Homeric spirit than any Greek lyric poet known to us. On the
                    other side, he has a genuine, if less evident, kinship with Aeschylus and
                    Sophocles. Pindar’s work, like Olympia itself, illustrates the spiritual unity
                    of Greek art.</p>
                <p>The fact that certain glosses and lacunae are common to all our MSS. of Pindar
                    make it probable that these MSS. are derived from a common archetype. Now the
                    older scholia on Pindar, which appear to have been compiled mainly from the
                    commentaries of Didymus <hi rend="italic">(circ.</hi> 15 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b,c.),</hi> sometimes presuppose a purer text than ours. But the compiler of
                    these older scholia lived after Herodian <hi rend="smallcaps">(160a,d.).</hi>
                    The archetype of our MSS., then, cannot have been older than the end of the 2d
                    century. Our MSS. fall into two general classes :—(1) the older, representing a
                    text which, though often corrupt, is comparatively free from interpolations; (2)
                    the later, which exhibit the traces of a Byzantine recension, in other words, of
                    lawless conjecture, down to the 14th or 15th century. To the first class belong
                    Parisinus 7, breaking off in <hi rend="italic">Pyth.</hi> v.; Ambrosianus 1,
                    which has only <hi rend="italic">01.</hi> i.-xii.; Mediceus 2; and Vaticanus
                    2,—the two last-named being of the highest value. The <hi rend="italic">editio
                    princeps</hi> is the Aldine, Venice, 1513. A modem study of Pindar may be almost
                    said to have begun with Heyne’s edition (1773). Hermann did much to advance
                    Pindaric criticism. But Augustus Boeckh (1811-22), who was assisted in the
                    commentary by L. Dissen, is justly regarded as the founder of a scientific
                    treatment of the poet. The edition of Theodor Bergk <hi rend="italic">(Poet.
                    Lyr.)</hi> is marked.by considerable boldness of conjecture, as that of Tycho
                    Mommsen (1864) by a sometimes excessive adherence to MSS. A recension by W.
                    Christ has been published in Teubner’s series (1879). The edition of J. W.
                    Donaldson (Cambridge, 1841) has many merits; but that of C. A. Μ. Fennell
                    (Cambridge, 1879-83) is better adapted to the needs of English students. The
                    translation into English prose by Ernest Myers (2d ed., 1883) is excellent.
                    Pindar’s metres have been analysed by J. H. Schmidt in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Die</hi><hi rend="italic">Kunstformen der Griechischen Poesie</hi> (Leipsic,
                    1868-72). For estimates of Pindar see the histories of Greek literature by G.
                    Bernhardy, K. 0. Miiller, Nicolai, and É. Burnouf. (R. C. J.)</p>
