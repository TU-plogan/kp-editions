                <p><label type="entry">ICE</label> is the solid crystalline form which water assumes
                    when exposed to a sufficiently low temperature. It is frequently precipitated
                    from the air as hoarfrost, snow, or hail; and in the glaciers and snows of lofty
                    mountain systems or of regions of high latitude it exists on a gigantic scale,
                    being especially characteristic of the seas and lands around the poles, which
                    consequently have hitherto been practically inaccessible to man. Also in various
                    parts of the world, especially in France and Italy, great quantities of ice form
                    in caves, which, in virtue of their depth below the earth’s surface, their
                    height above the sea-level, or their exposure to suitable winds, or to two or
                    more of these conditions in combination, are unaffected by ordinary climatic
                    changes, so that the mean annual temperature is sufficiently low to ensure the
                    permanency of the ice. The great ice supply for the island of Teneriff'e is
                    obtained from such a cave, which is 100 feet long, 30 feet broad, and from 10 to
                    15 feet high, and which is situated on the Peak some 10,000 feet above the
                    sea-level. According to the Rev. S. Browne <hi rend="italic">(Brit, Ass.
                    Report,</hi> 1864), such cave-ice is generally peculiar in its columnar
                    appearance, and apparently less easy to melt than ordinary surface ice.</p>
                <p>In the mutual transformations of water and ice, many remarkable physical
                    phenomena occur. Thus, during the process of melting a block of ice or of
                    freezing a quantity of water, no change of temperature can take place so long as
                    there is a thorough mixture of water and ice. Consequently, the “freezing-point”
                    or temperature at which water freezes is a temperature so readily determined
                    that it is conveniently employed as one of the standard temperatures in the
                    graduation of ordinary thermometer scales, such as the centigrade, the
                    Fahrenheit, and the Réaumur. The centigrade scale, whose zero corresponds to
                    this freezing-point of water, is the temperature scale that is employed
                    throughout this article. In the act of freezing, water, though its temperature
                    remains unchanged, undergoes a remarkable expansion or increase of bulk, so that
                    ice at 0° C. is less dense than water—a fact demonstrated at once by its power
                    of floating. “Ground-ice” or “anchor-ice,” which forms in certain circumstances
                    at the bottom of streams, is only an apparent exception to this relation between
                    the densities of water in its solid and liquid states, being retained there by
                    the cohesion between it and the stones or rocks which compose the river’s bed.
                    When forcibly released from this contact with the bottom, the ice at once
                    ascends to the surface. Ground-ice may thus be the lowest stratum of the once
                    completely frozen mass of water, adhering to the bottom during the thawing and
                    melting of the ice at the surface; or it may even be formed under favourable
                    conditions below briskly flowing water, probably by the action of eddies, which
                    draw the surface water down through the warmer but denser liquid, and thus cool
                    the stones and rocks at the bottom. As water then expands on freezing, so
                    conversely ice contracts on melting; and the ice-cold water thus formed
                    continues to contract when heated until it has reached its point of maximum
                    density. Joule, from a series of careful experiments, determined the temperature
                    at which water attains its maximum density to be 39 <hi rend="superscript">
                    o,</hi> l Fahr., or very nearly 4° C. Hence water contracts as its temperature
                    rises from 0° C. to 4° C.; but at higher temperatures it behaves like the great
                    majority of other substances, expanding with rise of temperature. At no
                    temperature, however, does water in the liquid state become less dense than ice,
                    as the following table of relative densities shows :—</p>

                <p>Under the influence of heat, ice itself behaves as most solids do, contracting
                    when cooled, expanding when heated.</p>

                <p>According to Pliicker, the coefficient of cubical dilatation at moderately low
                    temperatures is Ό001585. From a series of elaborate experiments, Person deduced
                    ‘505 as the specific heat of ice, or about half that of water; in other words,
                    the heat required to raise 1 lb of water 1° C. will raise 2 ft) of ice through
                    the same range of temperature or 1 ft&gt; of ice through 2° C.</p>
                <p>Though no rise of temperature accompanies the melting of ice, there is yet a
                    definite quantity of heat absorbed, and a corresponding amount of work
                    done—mainly in altering the physical condition of the substance. The heat which
                    disappears is transformed into other and less evident forms of energy,—as, for
                    example, the energy of translatory motion, which is the chief characteristic,
                    according to the recognized molecular theory of matter, of the molecule in the
                    liquid as compared with the molecule in the solid. The heat which is thus
                    absorbed during the melting of unit mass of ice is called the latent heat of
                    water, and its value in ordinary heat-units is 79 ’ 25, according to the
                    determination of Person. Hence as much heat is required to transform 1 ft) of
                    ice at 0° C. into water at the same temperature as would raise in temperature 1
                    ft&gt; of water through a range of 79 <hi rend="superscript"> 0,</hi> 25 C., or
                    79 ’ 25 ft) of water through a range of 1° C. The same amount of heat which is
                    absorbed when ice becomes water is evolved when water becomes ice, so that the
                    melting of ice is accompanied by the abstraction of heat from surrounding
                    objects, that is, by a cooling effect; and the freezing of water by a heating
                    effect. These thermal effects are generally masked by the processes whereby the
                    change of state is effected; but the cooling which accompanies the melting of
                    ice may be observed when pressure is used as the agent for accomplishing the
                    change. That ice can be so melted by increase of pressure was first pointed out
                    by Professor James Thomson (now of Glasgow) in a paper published in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh</hi> for 1849;
                    previous to that time the temperature of melting ice was believed to be
                    absolutely constant under all conditions. Thomson showed that, since water
                    expands on freezing, the laws of thermodynamics require that its freezing-point
                    must be lowered by increase of pressure; and, by an application of Carnot’s
                    principle, he calculated that for every additional atmosphere of pressure the
                    freezing-point of water was lowered by Ό075 of a degree centigrade. This
                    remarkable result was soon after verified, even to its numerical details, by his
                    brother, Sir William Thomson <hi rend="italic">{Proceedings of the Royal Society
                    of Edinburgh,</hi> 1850). The Thomsons and Helmholtz have since then
                    successfully applied this behaviour of ice under pressure to the explanation of
                    many curious properties of the substance. When two blocks of ice at 0° C. are
                    pressed together or even simply laid in contact, they gradually unite along
                    their touching surfaces till they form one block. This regelation, as it is
                    called, is due to the increased pressure at the various points of contact
                    causing the ice there to melt and cool. The water so formed tends to escape,
                    thus relieving the pressure for an instant, refreezing, and returning to the
                    original temperature. This succession of melting and freezing, with their
                    accompanying thermal effects, goes on until the two blocks are cemented into
                    one. Thus it is that a snowball is formed; and in virtue of the same succession
                    of phenomena does the glacier mould itself to its rocky bed and flow down the
                    valley, behaving in many respects like a viscous fluid.</p>
                <p>Ice forms over fresh water if the temperature of the air has been for a
                    sufficient time at or below the freezing-point; but not until the whole mass of
                    water has been cooled down to its point of maximum density, so that the
                    subsequent cooling of the surface can give rise to no convection currents, is
                    the freezing possible. Sea-water, in the most favourable circumstances, does not
                    freeze till its temperature is reduced to about - 2° C.; and the ice, when
                    formed, is found to have rejected four-fifths of the salt which was originally
                    present. In the upper provinces of India, water is made to freeze during cold
                    clear nights by leaving it overnight in porous vessels, or in bottles which are
                    enwrapped in moistened cloth. The water then freezes in virtue of the cold
                    produced by its own evaporation or by the drying of the moistened wrapper. In
                    Bengal the natives resort to a still more elaborate forcing of the conditions.
                    Shallow pits are dug about 2 feet deep and filled three-quarters full with dry
                    straw, on which are set flat porous pans containing the water to be frozen.
                    Exposed overnight to a cool dry gentle wind from the north-west, the water
                    evaporates at the expense of its own heat, and the consequent cooling takes
                    place with sufficient rapidity to overbalance the slow influx of heat from above
                    through the cooled dense air or from below through the badly conducting
                    straw.</p>
                <p>The growing demand for ice for domestic, medicinal, and other purposes has led,
                    not only to the development of a regularly organized ice trade, but also to the
                    invention of machines for the manufacture of ice in countries which do not
                    possess a sufficient home supply. The various types of machines which have been
                    or are in use call for a brief description. Freezing-mixtures, such as the
                    familiar snow and salt or the mixture of sulphate or phosphate of sodium and
                    dilute nitric acid, may be dismissed w ith a word, since they are restricted in
                    use to the production of intense cold for a brief period of time, and are
                    incapable of economic application to the formation of large quantities of
                    ice.</p>
                <p>All ice-machines which have proved of practical utility may be grouped under two
                    great classes :—those which utilize the lowering of temperature that accompanies
                    the rapid expansion of a compressed gas, and those which make use of the like
                    thermal effect that results from the volatilization of some liquid. In machines
                    of the first type, the gas usually employed is atmospheric air, which is first
                    compressed to three or four atmospheres, and kept cool by circulating water or
                    by other suitable means. It is then allowed to expand, and the heat necessarily
                    absorbed during the expansion is drawn either from the water to be frozen or
                    from a solution of brine which does not freeze at the ordinary freezing
                    temperature, and thus becomes, so to speak, a vehicle for the cold. In 1849
                    Gorrie constructed such a machine, which, however, was unsatisfactory in its
                    action, probably because the compressed air was not sufficiently cooled and
                    dried. More efficient in their action were Kirk’s machine (patented in 1863),
                    and Windhausen’s (1870), one of which at the Vienna exhibition produced 30 cwts.
                    of ice per hour, at the cost of Is. per cwt. The mode of action of Windhausen’s
                    is as follows. A piston works to and fro in a cylinder, compressing the air in
                    the one end and allowing it to expand in the other. The compressed and therefore
                    heated air forces its way through a valve to the cooling chambers, from which it
                    is led towards the other end of the cylinder. Here the inlet valve is so
                    arranged that it closes at a certain position of the receding piston, thus
                    permitting what air has entered to expand and cool. At the return stroke this
                    cooled air is forced out through easily opening valves,—part going to cool the
                    chambers into which the heated compressed air enters from the cylinder, and part
                    passing to the refrigerator, from which after serving its purpose it is pushed
                    on by the fresh supply of cooled air to the compressing end of the piston
                    chamber. Such machines, to work economically, require large cylinders,
                    tight-fitting pistons working with little friction, and perfect regulation in
                    the motions of the various parts—conditions so difficult to fulfil that
                    refrigeration by means of compressed air may be regarded as a practical failure.
                    The machines constructed by the Bell-Coleman Mechanical Refrigeration <pb

                    mixture of certain hydrocarbon gases which are obtained from the distillation of
                    carbonaceous shale. The gas is compressed to a pressure of about 8 atmospheres,
                    and, after being cooled by expansion, is carried off and consumed as fuel. These
                    machines are not specially intended for the production of ice; but, as
                    refrigerators, they are successfully employed for preserving meat on board
                    ship.</p>
                <p>Among machines of the second group there is a great variety of construction,
                    because of the great differences which exist in the properties of the liquids
                    used. Thus water, sulphuric ether, bisulphide of carbon, ammonia, methylic
                    ether, sulphurous acid, and other substances have been employed as refrigerating
                    agents. In all cases, it is the so-called latent heat of vaporization that is
                    utilized; and did the efficiency of the method depend only on this, water would
                    undoubtedly be the best material on account of the great latent heat of its
                    vapour. But as important from a practical point of view are the vapour pressures
                    that come into play throughout the range of temperature employed. Thus at 10° C.
                    the pressure of water vapour is so small, only Ό12 of an atmosphere (and at
                    lower temperatures of course it is still smaller), that, to make the evaporation
                    of water an efficient means of refrigeration, the process must be conducted
                    under a very much diminished pressure. As early as 1755, Dr Cullen managed to
                    freeze water by its own evaporation in a vacuum; but this method, though greatly
                    developed by Nairne, Leslie, and Vallance, can be applied to the production of
                    ice in small quantities only.</p>
                <p>The same objection applies, of course, to sulphuric ether, bisulphide of carbon,
                    or any substance which boils under ordinary atmospheric pressure at a
                    temperature above that of the air. Ether boils at 34 <hi rend="superscript">
                    0,</hi> 8 C., and bisulphide of carbon at 46 <hi rend="superscript"> o,</hi> 2
                    C.; and their vapour pressures at 10° C. are respectively ‘377 and *267 of an
                    atmosphere. They thus volatilize much more readily than water, and require a
                    comparatively slight vacuum to render their evaporation sufficiently rapid for
                    refrigerating purposes. In the ether machine, which may be taken as a type, the
                    ether, on being vaporized in the refrigerator under a partial vacuum, is drawn
                    over and compressed to the liquid state in the condenser, which is kept cool by
                    circulating water. From the condenser it is then led back to the refrigerator,
                    to be re-evaporated. Perkins’s machine (1834), Twinings patent of 1850,
                    Harrison’s machine (1857), Siebe’s machine (1862), and Siddeley and Mackay’s
                    apparatus are ether-machines; and all except the first, which is hardly adapted
                    for extensive freezing, surround the refrigerator with brine, which when cooled
                    flows easily around and between the cases containing the water to be frozen. Van
                    der Weyde (1869) substituted naphtha, gasolin, or chimogene for the ether; and
                    in Johnston and Whitelaw’s machine bisulphide of carbon is used somewhat
                    similarly. The great difficulty in machines of the ether type is to prevent
                    leakage, so as to keep the partial vacuum really efficient; and moreover ether,
                    which is in most respects superior to all the other substances employed, has an
                    awkward tendency, under the influence of frequent condensations and
                    rarefactions, to transform itself into less volatile isomers.</p>
                <p>The great characteristic of ice-machines which employ ammonia, methylic ether, or
                    sulphurous acid, as compared with those of the ether type, is that they work at
                    increased instead of diminished pressures, since these substances are gaseous at
                    ordinary temperatures and pressures, and require for their liquefaction either
                    the production of a low temperature or the application of a high pressure. For
                    facility of reference the boiling points and vapour pressures at three different
                    temperatures for these substances are given in the following table.</p>

                <p>The best known of the ammonia machines is Carré’s (1859), the principle and
                    construction of which are remarkably simple. Two strong metal vessels, the
                    boiler and refrigerator, are connected above by a tube. In the boiler a
                    saturated solution of ammonia is raised to 130°-150° C. The ammonia is driven
                    over under high pressure into the refrigerator, round which cold water
                    circulates, and in which the ammonia is condensed to a liquid. The boiler is
                    then placed in cold water, and as its temperature falls the pressure in the
                    apparatus is relieved and the liquid ammonia in the refrigerator vaporizes
                    rapidly, thereby producing intense cold, and redissolves in the boiler. The
                    temperature to which the boiler must be raised at first is determined by the
                    condition that the pressure in the boiler must correspond to the pressure of the
                    ammonia vapour at the temperature of the condenser. Now the pressure of ammonia
                    vapour increases from 8£ atmospheres at 20° C. to 11∣ at 30° C.; and this higher
                    pressure is extremely difficult to keep up in such an apparatus as Carré’s,
                    because of inevitable leakage. In warm countries, accordingly, the
                    ammonia-machine is practically useless because of the high pressures required;
                    andin temperate climates, where natural ice can be stored throughout summer, an
                    ice-machine is hot in suc£ great demand. One great drawback to the efficient
                    working of Carré’s machine is the difficulty of keeping the refrigerating liquid
                    free of water—only 75 per cent, of it being ammonia. To remedy this defect Reece
                    invented his machine (1869). The essential part of this ingenious apparatus is
                    an upright cylinder in which a descending current of strong ammonia solution,
                    drawn originally from the boiler, is met by an ascending current of steam. The
                    ammonia is thus separated from the water, and is driven off into a rectifier,
                    from which, after being freed from any small quantity of water it may have
                    carried along with it, it passes into a condenser where it is kept liquid by its
                    own pressure. It is then allowed to collect in the refrigerator, where at the
                    required moment the pressure is relieved, permitting the ammonia to vaporize and
                    escape to a separate chamber to be redissolved. Brine flowing through a coiled
                    tube within the refrigerator is used as the vehicle for the cold produced; or
                    even mere water may suffice if the object is simply to get a diminished
                    temperature without freezing. Linde’s ice-making machine, some twenty-two of
                    which were in operation at the Düsseldorf Exhibition of 1880, is the latest form
                    of ammonia machine; and its inventor claims for it superiority over all others
                    as an economical refrigerator. The danger of explosion, one of the great
                    disadvantages of ammonia, is obviated by carrying the liquefied gas through
                    narrow iron tubes and by employing only a small quantity of the substance at one
                    time. Blocks of ice are formed between the spokes of a revolving drum, which,
                    cooled internally by the evaporating liquid, dips into a tank of water. Methylic
                    ether is in some respects better than ammonia, having a higher boiling point,
                    and requiring smaller pressures, without the necessity of heating. In Tellier’s
                    machine (described in the <hi rend="italic">Annales de Chimie et de
                    Physique</hi> for 1874), which is specially suitable for use on board ship, the
                    methylic ether evaporates in a closed metallic vessel, the sides of which are in
                    immediate contact with the water to be frozen or chilled.</p>

                    applied by Gamgee to the formation of his glaciarium or artificial skating rink,
                    is in many respects far superior to any other known refrigerator. Thus it is
                    more easily liquefied than ammonia and methylic ether, exerting a vapour
                    pressure of only 4⅜ atmospheres at 30° C.; it has no chemical action upon metals
                    or fats; it is incombustible; it is obtainable at small expense; and it has,
                    besides, good lubricating properties;—in short, it seems to possess all the
                    essentials of an efficient and economical refrigerator. In Pictet’s machine, the
                    liquid sulphurous acid passes under pressure from the condenser to the
                    refrigerator, where on the pressure being relieved it vaporizes, cooling to -7°
                    C. a current of brine which then flows round the tanks containing the water to
                    be frozen. The sulphurous acid gas in the refrigerator is drawn over by an
                    aspirating force-pump and recondensed in the condenser, which is kept cool by an
                    ample supply of cold water. By a special modification of the sulphurous acid
                    machine, Pictet obtained as low a temperature as -73° C.; under this low
                    temperature he then compressed carbonic acid gas to a liquid, by the evaporation
                    of which he produced such intense cold as to enable him to liquefy the so-called
                    permanent gases under a pressure of several hundreds of atmospheres <hi
                    rend="italic">(Dibliothéque Universelle,</hi> 1878). Gamgee uses as his
                    congealing liquid a solution of 4 parts of glycerin in 6 parts of water, which
                    is conveyed in pipes beneath the water-surface to be frozen.</p>
                <p>Machines which are capable of freezing water may in certain circumstances be much
                    more efficiently employed to produce cooling without freezing. For instance, in
                    curinghouses, breweries, sugar refineries, provision stores in hot climates, and
                    in ships engaged in the transport of meat, where it is of importance to have the
                    temperature moderately cool, it is usually by no means necessary to obtain ice.
                    In many such cases, indeed, the production of ice would be a mere waste of
                    labour. In tropical and subtropical climates refrigeration is of high importance
                    from a sanitary point of view; and there seems little doubt that if a simple,
                    economical, and thoroughly efficient means of cooling were discovered, houses
                    would be cooled in warm weather with the same care and regularity with which
                    they are when necessary heated. At present, however, the manufacture of ice and
                    the artificial production of cold are arts still in their infancy, which have a
                    powerful rival in the extensive and increasing ice-trade that has sprung up
                    within the last half century.</p>
                <p>The idea of trading in ice first occurred to a Boston merchant, named Tudor, who
                    in 1805 shipped ice to Martinique. In 1833 American ice began to be imported
                    into Calcutta, where it was sold for 3d. per pound—exactly half the price of the
                    Bengal manufactured ice. In America, which was for long the great ice-exporting
                    country of the world, supplying especially the West Indies, India, and China,
                    the cutting and storing of ice form an important industry during the winter
                    months. When the ice is sufficiently thick, 9 to 12 inches for home consumption,
                    20 inches for exportation, the surface is scraped free of all porous ice, and is
                    marked out into squares of 5 feet each way. Along these lines the ice is grooved
                    to a depth of 3 inches by means of a plough. An instrument like a harrow is
                    drawn over the grooves so as to deepen them; and, after the surface has been
                    divided into smaller squares, the ice is cut up into blocks by means of
                    handsaws. The blocks are then removed to large double-walled storehouses, many
                    of which are capable of containing thousands of tons of ice. It is estimated
                    that, in America, 2,000,000 tons of ice are cut and stored annually by companies
                    supplying New York and the middle States. New York city alone consumes as much
                    as 500,000 tons per annum. A considerable quantity of ice from Wenham Lake near
                    Boston was at one time imported into Britain, but now the whole supply comes
                    from Drobak near Christiania in Norway. The Norwegian ice is remarkably solid
                    and pure, and is superior in its staying power to English ice or to manufactured
                    ice. The total quantity imported into the United Kingdom may be estimated
                    roughly at 150,000 tons per annum, of which the greater part is consumed in
                    London, where it is retailed at from 2s. 6d. to 3s. 6d. per cwt. At present
                    Norway is undoubtedly the great ice-store for the Old World; and quite recently
                    (1880) Norwegian ice has been sold in the United States more cheaply than native
                    ice. The transport on board ship offers practically no difficulty, since, as
                    long as the hold is kept dry and cool, there is very little loss, and in the
                    lading no special care need be taken. For the storing in houses, see <hi
