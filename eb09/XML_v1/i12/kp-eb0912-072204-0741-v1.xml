                <p><label type="entry">INDEPENDENTS</label>, a religious denomination whose
                    distinctive ecclesiastical principle is that the individual congregation or
                    church is a society strictly voluntary and autonomous, standing directly under
                    the authority of Jesus Christ, living in immediate dependence on Him, and <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n742/mode/1up"

                    as a Christian society. Its ideal stands distinguished, on the one hand, from
                    Episcopacy by having no gradations of ministerial or clerical orders, or persons
                    above the individual congregation invested with administrative or judicial
                    authority, and, on the other hand, from Presbytery by having no gradation of
                    courts or representative bodies possessed of legislative and judicial functions.
                    These distinctions imply others. Episcopacy and Presbytery are essentially
                    organized and incorporative systems, building all the societies they comprehend
                    into a political unity, but Independency is essentially voluntary and
                    individualizing, satisfied with a spiritual unity, refusing to permit its
                    various societies to be built into a political organism, lest it should do
                    violence to the rights of conscience, or prevent or even supersede the duty of
                    the exercise by the individual of his own judgment in matters of religion.
                    Episcopacy and Presbytery regard the collective organization as the church, but
                    Independency the individual congregation, investing it with the attributes and
                    prerogatives the other systems reserve for the organized whole. Its members
                    possess equal rights, and are bound by equal obligations. They constitute a
                    state whose citizens are all enfranchised, and are so because citizenship is
                    limited to the qualified, who, having sought it voluntarily, voluntarily retain
                    it. Independency may be said to affirm its ecclesiastical in order that it may
                    realize its religious principle, that religion is purely a matter of the
                    conscience, not to be created, extended, or reformed by any political mechanism
                    or agencies, but by moral means, through men who seek to have it believed and
                    embodied by men for reasons that commend themselves to the conscience, free and
                    unconstrained. It thus holds that the best service the state can render to
                    religion is to leave it free to live and act according to its own nature, in
                    obedience to its own laws, prompted by its own impulses, guided by its own
                    spirit and judgment.</p>
                <p>Independency rose in the reign of Elizabeth, and may be said to have been born of
                    the despair of seeing .religion reformed and vivified on any one of the then
                    followed lines. The peculiar condition of the Anglican Church at this period is
                    well enough known. There were men in it who wished it to be independent of Rome,
                    but to remain as far as possible Catholic while Anglican, and there were men who
                    wished it to be conformed in doctrine and polity to those churches of the
                    Continent that were by pre-eminence the Reformed. These latter were the
                    Puritans, and their endeavour was to reform the church through the state, to
                    persuade or compel the constitutive and sovereign will to make it such as they
                    could conscientiously approve. But it was inevitable in a time of strong
                    religious feeling that some more daring spirits should endeavour to break
                    through the anomalies of the Puritan position. If their consciences demanded,
                    and the civil authority refused, reform, was it either right or dutiful to
                    submit to the civil authority as against the conscience? Was there no other way
                    of reformation than by its consent? Was the Christian man relieved from all
                    responsibility and obligation to obey conscience when the magistrate forbade him
                    to do so? In so forbidding, was not the magistrate stepping out of his own
                    province? Was the church he could so rule as to prevent the realization of the
                    Scriptural ideal a rightly conceived and constituted church? Was it the
                    apostolical way so to work as to plant, to purge, to organize churches only as
                    Caesar gave consent? And could any but the apostolical way be right?</p>
                <p>These were the questions that created Independency. In the writings of the first
                    Independent, Robert Browne (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Brown, Robert),</hi> lies
                    the first crude attempt at an answer. He is possessed with the idea that
                    reformation is necessary, and is to bo accomplished, not by the state, but by
                    the action and cooperation of men who are themselves reformed and renewed. The
                    Puritans have committed two great mistakes: they have imagined that reformation
                    is a thing of polity only, to be carried out by changes in the organism, as it
                    were, or structure of the church, leaving many, perhaps the immense majority, of
                    the individuals who constitute it unreformed; and they have waited and are
                    waiting to have the work done through and by the magistrate. Browne sets himself
                    absolutely against both positions. “The kingdom of God,” he says, “was not to be
                    begun by whole parishes, but rather of the worthiest, be they ever so few.”<note

                    Christian. So he defines a church as “a companie or number of Christians or
                    believers, who, by a willing covenant made with their God, are under the
                    government of God and Christ, and kepe his lawes in one holie communion.”<note

                    sin. But it also made him particularly impatient with what he called the
                    “wickednesse of those preachers which will not reforme themselves and their
                    charge, because they will tarie till the magistrate commaunde and compell

                    the times were not ripe for either the criticism or the realization of Browne’s
                    ideas. They were extravagances to his own day; failure attended him
                    everywhere—due partly, perhaps, to the angularities of the man, and partly to
                    the prematurity of the system; his name was covered with ridicule; and Brownist
                    became the epithet the early Independents most disliked and resented.</p>
                <p>But the problems that nad exercised Browne were too vital to religion to be his
                    alone. They occupied many minds, and of these not a few looked in a similar
                    direction for a solution. Geneva was at once the strength and the weakness of
                    the Puritans ;—their strength, because it gave them their ideal realized; their
                    weakness, because it made them think that the only method of realization was in
                    and through the state. The Puritan leaders were mainly scientific theologians,
                    like Cartwright and Travers, Perkins and Rainolds, men who strenuously adhered
                    alike in doctrine and polity to the principles and methods of their school. But
                    the earliest Independents were men of simpler minds, educated indeed as well as
                    the English universities could educate them, but of less specific and elaborate
                    training. They studied their own times and interpreted their own duties in the
                    light of the New Testament, and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n743/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0743-0724"/> inferred that as the apostles had proceeded they
                    ought to proceed, that the methods proper to the apostolic age were also the
                    methods proper to their own. These methods were individual, not national;
                    churches were founded, religion created and reformed, not by civil authorities
                    or agencies, but by preachers who persuaded men to believe, gathered the
                    believers into communities or brotherhoods, each standing in a fraternal
                    relation to all the rest, none occupying a position of political superiority or
                    dependence. The early Independents believed that in this way only was it
                    possible to reform religion in England, and they acted on their belief,
                    separating themselves from the Anglican Church, forming themselves into
                    communities on what they regarded as the Scriptural model, and working in what
                    was conceived to be the apostolic method. But separation from the church was a
                    capital crime, equal to a denial of the royal supremacy; and so every inveterate
                    separatist became liable to death. And early Independency was not without its
                    martyrs. In the summer of 1583 two men, Thacker and Coppin, were executed at
                    Bury St. Edmunds for refusing to conform to the church, and “dispersinge of
                    Brownes bookes and Harrisons bookes.” They justified their refusal on the ground
                    that “her Majestie was chieffe ruler civilie, but no further.” Two much more
                    remarkable men, who met with a similar fate, were John Greenwood and Henry
                    Barrowe. Both were graduates of Cambridge; Greenwood had been ordained a priest;
                    Barrowe was a barrister, a member of Gray’s Inn. “He made,” as we know on the
                    authority of Lord Bacon,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    a preciseness in the highest degree, the strangeness of which alteration made
                    him very much spoken of.” Both became separatists, and were very active in the
                    numerous conventicles that were then being held in and about London. Their
                    principles were not so extreme as Browne’s, their position being, as it were,
                    intermediate between his and the Puritan. In his notion of the church as a
                    society of the godly or the converted, politically independent alike as regards
                    other churches and the state, they agree with him; in his notion of its rigidly
                    democratic constitution, they differ, inclining more to leave its government in
                    the hands of certain specially chosen men. Their ideal is a sort of Presbyterial
                    Independency. They think of the church as “A companie of Faithfull people;
                    separated from the vnbelievers and heathen of the land: gathered in the name of
                    Christ, whome they truelie worship, and redily obey as their only King, Priest,
                    and Prophet: ioyned together as members of one bodie: ordered and gouerned by
                    such officers and lawes as Christ in His last will and Testament hath thereunto

                    and state the radical point of divergence of the two systems. This was the
                    church idea; Greenwood and Barrowe, in all their prison Conferences, which were
                    many, fall back on this idea :—“Christ’s church always consisteth of a holy free
                    people, separate from the world, rightly called and gathered unto Christ,
                    walking forth in faith and obedience.’’</p></note></p>
                <p>Of course, this conception placed them in direct antagonism to both the Genevan
                    and Anglican ideals and methods. They condemn “Mr Calvine” because “he made no
                    scruple to receave all the whole state, even all the profane ignorant people,
                    into the bozome of the church, to administer the sacramentes vnto them.”<note

                    p. 33. This is Barrowe’s principal work, but he and Greenwood were both prolific
                    and vigorous writers. They had a lengthy controversy with Mr George Gifford, a
                    “Conformable Puritan,” who charged them with being the “Donatists of England.”
                    They and the Puritans were curiously most deeply at feud. Yet it was only
                    natural. The Puritans were anxious to show that they had no kinship with the
                    Brownists, the Brownists were anxious to drive the Puritans to the logical
                    outcome of their position—separation. Barrowe’s first reply to Gifford was the
                    “Plain Refutation, wherein is discovered the Forgery of the whole Ministry; the
                    Confvsion; False Worship; and Anti-Christian Disorder, of these Parish
                    Assemblies called the Church of England” (1591).</p></note> They condemn the
                    Church of England because it comprehends “all the profane and wicked of the
                    land,”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"
                    >Ibid.,</hi> p. 9.</p></note> and maintain that “Christ is onely head of His
                    church, and His lawes may no man alter”; that the prince is no more than a mere
                    member of it; that, if he sin, not to excommunicate him is to neglect “God’s
                    judgmentes, their dutie and the prince’s salvation.” The Anglican Church was
                    thus conceived as founded on a wrong principle, worked in a wrong method, and
                    hindered rather than helped by its dependence on the state. Whitgift asked
                    Barrowe whether, if the prince delayed or refused to reform abuses, the church
                    should proceed without him; and his answer was, “it might and ought, though all
                    the princes of the world should prohibit the same upon pain of death.” Ideas
                    like these logically involved separation as a duty; the ideas they contradicted
                    as logically made it a crime. The age was not without the courage of its
                    convictions; and Barrowe and Greenwood died for theirs, April 6, 1593. Shortly
                    afterwards (May 29) John Penry or Ap Henry, a friend and associate, expiated the
                    same sin in the same way.</p>
                <p>In spite of the severely repressive measures of the Government, the Independents
                    continued to multiply. In the last decade of the 16th century numerous
                    separatist communities were formed,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>In 1593, in a debate on a Bill to explain the statute 23d of

                    Walter Raleigh declared that there were “as many as twenty thousand” Brownists
                    in England. He was anxious that they should be “rooted out of the commonwealth,”
                    but was alarmed lest the law that was needed to do so should turn out to be
                    capable of use against liberal-minded Conformists like himself. See DΕwes, p.

                    north-eastern counties. Their conventicles were often surprised, and in 1596 it
                    was reckoned that as many as twenty-four had died in prison, representing of
                    course but a small proportion of those actually confined. Plainly England had as
                    yet no room for Independency, and the Independents who wished to keep a good
                    conscience were forced to think of seeking a home elsewhere. Certain of their
                    leaders had, indeed, in 1592 organized a church in London, with Francis Johnson
                    as its pastor, and Greenwood as its teacher; but they were so watched and hunted
                    and harassed—fifty-six of its members having been seized at one time and
                    imprisoned—that they resolved, convinced by the fate of Barrowe, Greenwood, and
                    Penry that a peaceable life in England was impossible, to emigrate in a body.
                    Holland was then the common refuge of the distressed for conscience’ sake, the
                    place where the outcasts alike of France and Spain and England found a free and
                    even generous home. The Independents, after trying Campen and Naarden, settled
                    finally at Amsterdam. There they completed their church organization, appointing
                    Francis Johnson pastor and Henry Ainsworth teacher. Johnson was a native of
                    Richmond in Yorkshire, had been a fellow of Christ’s College, Cambridge, had
                    been expelled the university for publicly teaching the Presbyterian polity, and
                    had become pastor of the English merchants’ church at Middleburg. There he had
                    been zealous against the Independents, had helped to seize and destroy an
                    edition of one of Barrowe’s works, but, preserving a copy, had read it and been
                    persuaded to adopt its views. He returned to England, associated himself with
                    the author, and became, as we have seen, the pastor of the first Independent
                    church in England. He was a pragmatic man, self-willed, emphasizing his
                    separatism, easily drifting into controversies and consequent divisions on

                    erudite, one who “had not his better for the Hebrew tongue in the university (of
                    Leyden) nor scarce in Europe,” anxious only to be allowed to search out the
                    meaning of Scripture and teach it to his people. The church under these two men
                    had a somewhat troubled history, and divided at length, part going with Johnson,
                    part with Ainsworth, the cause of the division being as to the office and power
                    of the elder. The former held that the church had power to elect, but not to
                    depose, the elders, who were its real governors, but the latter held that the
                    elders were responsible to the church, which had the power, as to appoint, so
                    also to depose and excommunicate them. Johnson was moving away from
                    Independency, as it is now understood, but Ainsworth towards it. Their church is
                    significant as an attempt to realize the ideal of Barrowe and Greenwood, a
                    provisional or tentative Independency, but no more.</p>
                <p>A much more successful attempt at realizing the Independent ideal was made at
                    Leyden under the leadership of John Robinson (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Robinson,
                    John).</hi> He and his people came from Scrooby, in Nottinghamshire. Their
                    headquarters had been at first at Gainsborough-on-Trent. In 1606 one section of
                    the church under John Smyth—who was to become the most extreme of separatists,
                    discovering that baptism by a corrupt church was none, to rebaptize himself and
                    become founder of the General Baptists— emigrated to Amsterdam; the other
                    organized themselves under Robinson at Scrooby. But peace was impossible; flight
                    became necessary. Soin 1607 and 1608 they succeeded in escaping in detachments
                    to Holland, settling first in Amsterdam, ultimately in Leyden. There the fine
                    qualities of Robinson found a congenial soil, and developed as they could not
                    have done in the less generous air of England. Leyden helped to make English
                    separatism into Independency. What is developed in antagonism is ill developed,
                    full of exaggerations, undue emphases, antitheses so sharply stated as to be
                    almost, even when true, dangerously near the false. A proscribed faith may be
                    strong, but can never be sweet; and the strength that is bitter is not a purely
                    religious strength. So Independency in England in the days of Whitgift and
                    Bancroft was too much hated and hunted to be able to say the best word and do
                    the best thing for itself. But Independency in Leyden,— breathing the free air
                    of the Dutch republic, living in open fellowship with all its institutions,
                    braced by its strong enthusiasm for liberty, its robust religious faith, its
                    brilliant and fruitful intellectual activity, then at its best and brightest in
                    the young university of the city,—was Independency planted where it could do
                    approximate justice to its own ideal. The influence of the changed conditions
                    soon became manifest in its happier spirit. The church at Leyden lost the narrow
                    and ungenerous spirit of separatism, pleaded for the duty of communion with the
                    godly in the Church of England and the other reformed churches. On this point
                    Robinson wrote with eloquence and acted with courage, his spirit growing the
                    larger the longer he lived. While professing “a separation from the English
                    national, provincial, diocesan, and parochial church, and churches, in the whole
                    former state and order thereof,” he yet confessed and declared that he had still
                    “the same faith, hope, spirit, baptism, and Lord” as in the Church of England,
                    that he enjoyed fellowship with her “many thousands” of godly sons, and that
                    occasional “hearing of the word of God as there preached” was both lawful and
                    necessary to him as a Christian man.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    long and bitter controversy with Helwys and other extreme separatists, who held
                    approval of anything or any one connected with the Anglican Church to be
                    altogether a sin; but it in no way modified the rigour of his Independency. His
                    definition of a church is almost identical with Barrowe’s: “A company,
                    consisting though but of two or three, separated from the world, whether
                    unchristian or anti-christian, and gathered into the name of Christ by a
                    covenant made to walk in all the ways of God known unto them, is a church, and
                    so hath the whole power of Christ.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Its independence, its sufficiency as a church alike in what concerned idea and
                    reality, he strenuously maintained. Thus “neither was Peter or Paul more one,
                    whole, entire, and perfect man, consisting of their parts essential and
                    integral, without relation unto other men, than is a particular congregation,
                    rightly instituted and ordered, a whole, entire, and perfect church immediately
                    and independently, in respect of other churches, under Christ”<note

                    so conceived there could be no authoritative person or court, ecclesiastical or

                    and to interfere with it was an unlawful interference with rights it had
                    received from Him. Office did not exalt a man above the brotherhood; the clergy
                    were but Christians, and good only as Christians. To saintship, and not to
                    office, was promised the forgiveness of sins. “The estate of a saint is most
                    happy and blessed, though the person never so much as come near an office; but,
                    on the contrary, an officer, if he be not also and first a saint, is a most

                    was, indeed, an ecclesia, an assembly, called out and called together by the
                    public preaching of the word, but forming in its collective and corporate
                    character a body possessed of supreme authority, of all the attributes, rights,
                    and prerogatives that belong to those who rule. It is evident that a conception
                    of this kind was full of promise. It showed a firm trust in the capabilities of
                    individual Christian men to exercise the rights of citizenship within the
                    kingdom of God. It made it in the highest degree wrong for any ruler or body of
                    rulers to enforce their own belief on the people. And it was as opposed to
                    ecclesiastical as to civil tyranny, whether in its Episcopal or Presbyterial
                    form. Robinson, indeed, was far from seeing or courageously deducing all the
                    consequences implied in his Independency. He was even illogical enough to state,
                    though in a hesitating way, principles radically incompatible with it. He
                    concedes “that godly magistrates are by compulsion to repress public and notable
                    idolatry,” by some penalty “to provoke their subjects universally unto hearing
                    for their instruction and conversion”; but he denies that any king is at liberty
                    to inflict death upon all that refuse to be drawn into covenant with God, or
                    remain wicked and unrepentant.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    knows well enough the utmost coercion can do. “By this course of compulsion many
                    become atheists, hypocrites, and familists, and, being at first constrained to
                    practise against conscience, lose all conscience afterwards.” Liberty is too
                    complex a notion to be easily and in all its bearings grasped; and liberty in
                    religion too great a thing to be suddenly and all at once understood and
                    realized.</p>
                <p>The Leyden church is the parent of Independency alike in England and America. In
                    1616 Henry Jacob, a native of Kent, a graduate of Oxford, one of Johnson’s
                    converts, pastor awhile of a church at Middleburg, then a resident with Robinson
                    at Leyden, returned to England, and founded an Independent church at Southwark.
                    In 1620 a little company led by Elder Brewster and Deacon Carver sailed from
                    Delfthaven, landed in the-midst of a severe and stormy <pb break="no"

                    laid the foundations of the New England States, withall they were to be and to
                    create. Jacob had been all through his exile anxiously looking towards England.
                    In 1609 he had addressed to King James “An Humble Supplication for
                    Toleration,”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">An Humble Supplication for Toleration, and Liberty to enjoy and

                    lieu of Human Constitutions</hi> (1609; no place or printer). In the following
                    year Jacob published a work on <hi rend="italic">The Divine Beginning and
                    Institution of Christ’s true Visible or Ministerial Church</hi>; and in 1612 a

                    certain Points</hi> (published at Middleburg). This latter is remarkable as
                    containing the earliest use, in the ecclesiastical sense, of the word
                    “Independent.” “Where each ordinary congregation giveth their free consent in
                    their own government, there certainly each is an entire and indeρe ιdent
                    body-politic, and endued with power immediately under and f.ora Christ, as every
                    proper Church is, and ought to be,” p. 13. It is interesting to note that the
                    above <hi rend="italic">Supplication</hi> is the earliest plea for toleration in
                    the English language, but a few years later appeared a much more thoroughgoing
                    work, <hi rend="italic">Religious Peace, or a Plea for Liberty of
                    Conscience</hi> (1614). This was by Leonard Busher, a Baptist, and to this body
                    belongs the honour of being the first to develop the liberty implied in
                    Independency. See Busher’s and other tracts on “Liberty of Conscience” in
                    publications of HanserdKnollys Society.</p></note> in which he begs that “each
                    particular church may be allowed to partake in the benefit of the said
                    toleration, may have, enjoy, and put in execution and practice this her right
                    and privilege,” viz., “to elect, ordain, and deprive her own ministers, and to
                    exercise all the other points of lawful ecclesiastical jurisdiction under
                    Christ.” This may be regarded as a clear and explicit statement of the early
                    Independent position, its claim for toleration based on its conception of the
                    Christian church, its plea for liberty of worship based on its principle of
                    individualism and the rights of the individual conscience. With what was here
                    asked it would at any time in the 17th century have been satisfied, but the
                    Anglican policy of Elizabeth, and James, and Charles I. proceeded on this
                    principle, that to allow diversity was to destroy unity, to permit the growth of
                    elements that would prove fatal to the church, involve the denial of the royal
                    authority and the break-up of the state. Yet the very severity of the Anglican
                    policy strengthened Independency. It helped to identify the struggle for liberty
                    of conscience with the struggle for English liberty.</p>
                <p>Up to 1640 little formal progress was made. Churches did not multiply; Laud was
                    too active, and the Star Chamber too vigorous. But the real progress was
                    immense. Statesmen were persuaded that a system which required so harsh a policy
                    could not be right. Religious men who could not conform went to live in lands
                    and under laws where obedience to conscience was possible. There was a double
                    emigration, to the Continent and to New England. In Arnheim, Thomas Goodwin and
                    Philip Nye ministered to a small congregation; in Rotterdam, Hugh Peters and
                    William Ames, the most skilled, scholastic, and disputatious theologian of the
                    early Independents, who came from his professorial chair at Franeker in 1682 to
                    die at Rotterdam a year later. Here, too, when Ames was dead and Peters gone to
                    New England, came Jeremiah Burroughs, William Bridge, and Sidrach Simpson, all
                    of them names that were to be conspicuous and influential in days to come.</p>
                <p>But the emigration to New England was much the more important alike as regards
                    its influence on Independency and English history. It has been calculated that
                    in the period 1620-1640 upwards of 22,000 Puritan emigrants (the figures have
                    been placed as high as 50,000) sailed from English and Dutch ports. The reasons
                    that compelled their departure determined their quality; they were all men of
                    rigorous consciences, who loved their fatherland much, but religion more, not
                    driven from home by mercantile necessities or ambitions, but solely by their
                    determination to be free to worship God. They were, as Milton said,<note

                    bk. ii., <hi rend="italic">Works,</hi> p. 14 (ed. 1834).</p></note> “faithful
                    and freeborn Englishmen and good Christians constrained to forsake their dearest

                    deserts of America could hide and shelter from the fury of the bishops.” Men so
                    moved so to act could hardly be commonplace; and so among them we find
                    characters strong and marked, with equal ability to rule and to obey, as
                    Bradford and Brewster, Winslow and Standish, Winthrop and Dr Samuel Fuller, and
                    men so inflexible in their love of liberty and faith in man as Roger Williamsand
                    young Harry Vane. And as were the people so were their ministers. Of these it is
                    enough to name John Cotton, able both as a divine and as a statesman, potent in
                    England by his expositions and apologies of the “New England way,” potent in
                    America for his organizing and administrative power; Thomas Hooker, also famed
                    as an exponent and apologist of the “New England way,” whose book was commended
                    to theologians at home by Thomas Goodwin, and whose early death was lamented by
                    Cotton in lines which told how</p>

                <p>John Eliot, famous as the “apostle of the Indians,” first of Protestant

                    carried on by his distinguished son, and his still more distinguished grandson,
                    Cotton Mather. The motives and circumstances of the emigrants determined their
                    polity; they went out as churches and settled as church states. They were all
                    Puritans, but not all Independents—indeed, at first only the men from Leyden
                    were, and they were throughout more enlightened and tolerant than the men of the
                    other settlements. Winthrop’s company were noncomformists but not separatists,
                    esteemed it “an honour to call the Church of England, from whence we rise, our
                    dear mother,” emigrated that they might be divided from her corruptions, not

                    backed by the special influence of the Plymouth settlement, were too much for

                    and choice. Only so could they guard their ecclesiastical and their civil
                    liberties. These, indeed, were at first formally as well as really identical. In
                    1631 the general court of the Massachusetts colony resolved, “that no man shall
                    be admitted to the freedom of this body politic, but such as are members of some
                    of the churches within the limits of the same.”<note anchored="true"

                    and shamed the early history of Independency in New England, natural enough when
                    all their circumstances are fairly considered, indefensible when we regard their
                    idea of the relation of the civil power to the conscience and religion, but
                    explicable when their church idea alone is regarded. And this latter was their
                    own standpoint; their acts were more acts of church discipline than those of
                    civil penalty.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, the growth of the New England States and their Independency in
                    religion exercised extraordinary influence in England. It encouraged the
                    Puritans, opened to them a refuge from the Anglican tyranny, showed them an
                    English state where the bishop had ceased to trouble and where their own
                    principles were active and realized. Laud thoroughly comprehended the situation,
                    saw that Independency in the colonies must be struck down if Anglican nolicv was
                    to succeed at home. They were a <pb break="no"

                    downfall and the outbreak of the civil war New England Independency became, on
                    account of its influence on the ecclesiastico-political question, still more
                    potent in English affairs. The Independent party in the Westminster
                    Assembly—which had been called to advise parliament—was small, but influential.
                    Its ministerial members were Thomas Goodwin, a ponderous but learned and
                    conscientious man; Philip Nye, a skilful debater and adroit man of business;
                    Jeremiah Burroughs, a man of sweet manners and gentle disposition, but great
                    prudence and firmness; William Bridge, and Sidrach Simpson. These were all
                    marked by conspicuous moderation of view, but the lay members, like Lord Saye
                    and Sele and Sir Harry Vane, were more advanced, especially on the cardinal
                    question of toleration. The importance of the New England States was at once
                    recognized by the parliamentary Independents, who made an effort to bring over
                    their three most eminent ministers, John Cotton, John Davenport, and Thomas
                    Hooker. The effort failed; but in place of the men books and pamphlets,
                    expository and defensive of the “New England way,” were discharged in quick
                    succession upon the English public. What gave New England its importance was
                    this—it was the first realization on a large scale of the principles of
                    Independency. Here they had been tried under most difficult conditions, and had
                    proved thoroughly successful, capable of maintaining order in the churches,
                    religion in the state, purity of doctrine, and efficiency of discipline. What
                    Geneva had been to the Puritans under Elizabeth New England was now to the
                    Independents—it was their religious ideal realized, their polity commended by an
                    illustrious example. They were no longer, as in the days of John Robinson or
                    Henry Jacob, the apologists of an unpopular and strange theory, hitherto
                    unrealized save on a scale and under cor dirions that made it ridiculous,
                    charged with all the evils that could be proved logically certain to follow from
                    it. On the contrary, they had now behind them the church-state beyond the ocean,
                    and they could proudly tell how men of English blood, who had fled from the
                    Anglican oppression, had tried Independency and prevailed. So there was the
                    amplest controversy on the points at issue, the Scotch divines beaιg specially
                    active on the one side, and American divines, prefaced and introduced and
                    explained by English, on the other. The controversy did something to lessen the
                    distance between Presbyterians and Independents, and did much to strengthen the
                    position of the latter in England. It showed that independence did not mean
                    isolation, that churches that refused to be organized into a political unity
                    still constituted a Christian brotherhood, that societies that were so jealous
                    of their freedom and rights as to deny to every external authority judicial and
                    legislative functions could yet seek and follow fraternal advice, and meet in
                    common councils to advise and be advised. But the Westminister Assembly and the
                    English Paιliament did not approve the “New England way,” and the Independents
                    had to be contented to plead for toleration. This, indeed, became their great
                    demand—the point on which they and the Presbyterians differed radically. Here
                    the Presbyterians were inflexible. Toleration was to them the very man of sin.
                    But to the Independents it was the very condition of continued existence.
                    Without it England would be no better for them under Presbytery than it had been
                    under Episcopacy. As to the nature and degree of this toleration, they were
                    divided into two sections, one moderate, the other more advanced. To the former
                    belonged the ministerial members of the assembly, who wished only a limited
                    toleration. They did not desire all views to be tolerated, but only the views of
                    good men, men of pious, tender consciences, not those of infidels or
                    blasphemers. But the more advanced section courageously advocated absolute
                    toleration, denied that so long as a man was a peaceable citizen the magistrate
                    had any right to interfere with his conscience or conscientious beliefs. To this
                    section belonged Harry Vane, Henry Burton, John Goodwin of Coleman Street,
                    ablest and most restless of controversialists in that controversial age; Roger
                    Williams, now a Baptist, but still an Independent, home from America, bringing
                    with him the MS. of a great book on this very subject; finally, above all, John
                    Milton. These were the advanced guard, and theirs was the section that made
                    Independency so immense a political power in the England of the
                    Commonwealth.</p>
                <p>This is not the place to inquire into the causes of the sudden and extraordinary
                    ascendency of the Independents in the time of the Commonwealth. Enough to say,
                    it was due to causes both political and religious—to what may be termed the
                    transmutation of a great religious into a great political question. The men
                    Independency formed and forced to the front were remarkable men, strong of will,
                    clear of eye, mighty through faith in their principles. And their principles
                    were precisely of the kind suited to the emergency, republican and
                    revolutionary, but steeped in the commanding emotions and enthusiasms of
                    religion. They were principles that ennobled man, that asserted the rights of
                    the individual, that made it an easy matter to deal with the divine rights of
                    kings, or kings too assertive of their rights and forgetful of their duties. So
                    the Independents had the incalculable advantage of always seeing clearly before
                    them, knowing their end and never being in any doubt about the way to it.
                    Besides, their theory of the church fell in with the spirit of the Commonwealth.
                    It made but small distinction between clergy and laity, and the man with the
                    gift of speech could easily exercise it in preaching. So the army when new
                    modelled, formed of men of spirit and conviction, became quite a nursery of
                    Independents, and men like Richard Baxter found that in it there were quite as
                    many ready to edify as wishful to be edified. Religion thus became, not a matter
                    for the clergy, but the possession of the people, not simply the concern of the
                    church, but the business of the whole nation. There was considerable diversity
                    in theological opinion. The moderate men were Calvinists, but among the extreme
                    men were Arminians, like John Goodwin, and men as yet of no recognized school,
                    like John Milton. Independency, in short, meant the equal concern of every man
                    in religion, alike in its deepest mysteries and most practical precepts; and so
                    in a period of religious enthusiasm and ferment it naturally came to the front
                    and took the lead. But the extent of its power under the Commonwealth was the
                    measure of the disfavour that came to it after the Restoration. The
                    Presbyterians had been mainly instrumental in the bringing back of Charles, and
                    so it had been indecent had no attempt been made to comprehend them within the
                    church. But in the case of the Independents there was not even an abortive
                    attempt at comprehension. And they did not ask what they knew they would not
                    receive. They only wished to be tolerated, to be allowed to live, and no more.
                    At first they thought that this might be. Philip Nye had seen the king, and was
                    hopeful. But their illusions were soon dispelled. In 1661 the Corporation Act
                    was passed, which disqualified Nonconformists for municipal offices; in 1662 the
                    Act of Uniformity, which drove upwards of two thousand ministers out of the
                    church, and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n747/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0747-0728"/> silenced all who did not conform; in 1663 the
                    Conventicle Act, which prevented Nonconformist congregations meeting, not
                    allowing in houses more than five persons beyond the family to be present at
                    once. In 1665 the Five Mile Act forbade non-conforming ministers to come within
                    5 miles of any corporate borough; in 1670 the Conventicle Act was made more
                    rigorous; and in 1673 the Test Act made Nonconformists ineligible for offices,
                    civil, naval, or military, under the crown. Charles, indeed, in his weak way,
                    tried to be more generous than his church or parliament, wished to tolerate the
                    Nonconformists that he might the better tolerate the Roman Catholics. Out of
                    this feeling came the Declaration of Indulgence in 1672,—which was,
                    incidentally, the means of proving the strength of dissent, three thousand
                    applications being made for licences to use or erect places of worship; but
                    parliament resisted, and Charles gave way.</p>
                <p>In the dark days that had now come to them, the Independents, it may well be
                    said, lived with patient courage, and learned through their sufferings. They had
                    men among them that adorned their adversity, and made even their sudden
                    obscurity illustrious. John Owen, late vice-chancellor of Oxford, massive,
                    erudite, the ideal of the scholastic theologian, building up with patient skill
                    his loved science and fencing it round with the sort of arguments his age
                    understood; Thomas Goodwin, less varied but more subtle, not so broad but quite
                    as analytic as Owen, dealing with rich delight in the dialectical subtleties
                    that pleased his age; John Howe, with a soul above the narrowness and bitterness
                    of his day, serene in the midst of his troubles, living in sublime contemplation
                    on “the Living Temple,”or the “Vision of God”; Joseph Caryl and William
                    Greenhill, quaint expositors, rich in the lore then used to explain the Old
                    Testament; Theophilus Gale, the equal of Cudworth in his knowledge of the
                    ancient world, full of the great and fruitful idea he has embodied in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Court of the Gentiles,</hi> —these were some of the ejected from
                    church or university, and they may help to show the quality of the men who were
                    now, because of their Independency, outcasts from the Church of England, and for
                    it deprived of their common rights as citizens. Their conduct under James showed
                    that they would not purchase their own privileges at the expense of the public
                    safety, and under William their fidelity to the constitution and liberties of
                    England had its first reward in the Act of Toleration. This was but a small
                    concession, and one that by the Occasional Conformity Act of Anne was almost as
                    good as repealed. But what had been done could not be altogether undone. The
                    coming in of the Hanoverian dynasty brought a more liberal spirit into politics,
                    and history has ever since, with an occasional period of declension, been a
                    progressive movement towards freedom. As one by one its principles and claims
                    have been admitted by the state, England has become a roomier and healthier
                    place for spirits who feel that for religion to be religious it must be
                    free.</p>
                <p>In estimating the work done in England by the Independents, it is necessary to
                    bear in mind the extent to which they have supplemented the deficiencies of the
                    Anglican Church. But for them religion in many places would have almost, perhaps
                    altogether, died out. They have helped to quicken and deepen the religious
                    consciousness and life of the English people. Their preachers, too, have not
                    been without influence, which is the more remarkable as from the time of the Act
                    of Uniformity till a few years ago they were excluded from the national
                    universities. Soon after the passing of the Act of Toleration we find
                    Independent preachers rising to eminence. The Foster who was celebrated in
                    Pope’s couplet—</p>
                <p>“Let modest Foster, if he will, excel</p>
                <p>Ten metropolitans in preaching well— was an Independent, and as vigorous as a
                    thinker as he was eloquent as a preacher, his answer to Tindal anticipating in
                    its leading lines the celebrated argument of Butler in his <hi rend="italic">
                    Analogy. </hi> Isaac Watts is a name that must still be honoured, and Philip
                    Doddridge a name that must be mentioned with respect. Edward Williams did much
                    to revive the study of theology in the end of last century and early years of
                    this, and Dr Pye Smith showed that within dissent scholarship and theological
                    learning were still possible. The last generation had not a few men of
                    distinction. The names of Henry Rogers, Joseph Gilbert, J. Angell James, Dr
                    Winter Hamilton, Dr Ralph Wardlaw, Dr Robert Vaughan, his distinguished son
                    Alfred Vaughan, Dr Halley, the historian of Nonconformity in Lancashire, and
                    Thomas Binney of London are names representative of the kind of men that
                    Independency can still produce.</p>
                <p>But to complete this sketch of the Independents we must add one other element—the
                    work done by their academies and colleges. They have always believed in an
                    educated ministry, and when cast out of the universities one of their very first
                    acts was to found academies. These they had great difficulty in maintaining,
                    because of the operation of the oppressive acts passed in Charles II.’s reign;
                    but in spite of the difficulties they contrived to do so. Theophilus Gale had an
                    academy; so had Samuel Cradock, Thomas Doolittle, Richard Frankland, and others
                    of the ejected ministers. It was possible to keep these only by the most
                    frequent changes of place, so as to elude the vigilance of the authorities. When
                    toleration was granted, the academies were able in the greater quiet they now
                    enjoyed to do better work. One of these may serve as a sample. At Gloucester and
                    then at Tewkesbury was an academy conducted by the Rev. Samuel Jones. Here were
                    educated Thomas Seeker, afterwards archbishop of Canterbury; Joseph Butler,
                    bishop of Durham, and author of the <hi rend="italic">Analogy·,</hi> Samuel
                    Chandler, one of the finest scholars of his day, who remained in poverty the
                    scholar and the Christian Nonconformist still; and Jeremiah Jones. We know, on
                    the authority of an early letter of Secker’s, the method of education followed
                    in Tewkesbury; and certainly, measured by the standard of the day, it was as
                    thorough as the education was ample. Or t of these academies the present
                    Congregational colleges have grown.</p>
                <p>It is unnecessary to attempt any exposition of the principles of Independency.
                    These have been made apparent in the progress of this sketch. It may simply be.
                    said here that the Independents conceive their church order as the primitive and
                    apostolic, and that out of their idea of the constitution and order of the
                    primitive Christian churches their own system has grown. They believe that their
                    conception of the church necessarily involves freedom of conscience, the
                    interference with no man’s belief, the concession of equal rights to all
                    churches or religious societies by the state, and they may well remember with
                    pride that John Locke based his plea for toleration on a conception of the
                    church essentially akin to theirs.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    respect sacerdotal, but is based on the Old Testament idea of the prophet, on
                    the New Testament idea of the preacher—the man who by help or inspiration of God
                    speaks for God to men. And the call to his office comes through the people; the
