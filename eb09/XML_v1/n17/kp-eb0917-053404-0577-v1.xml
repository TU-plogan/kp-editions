                <p><label type="entry">NORD</label>, the most northern of the departments of France,
                    formed out of Flanders, French Hainault, and the district of Cambrais
                    (Cambrésis), lies between 50° and 51° 6' N. lat., and between 2° 5' and 4° 15'
                    E. long., but in such a way that, while it has a length from south-east to
                    north-west of 112 miles, its breadth is nowhere more than 40 miles, and
                    contracts to 4 at the point where it is crossed by the Lys. Bounded N.W. and N.
                    for 21 miles by the North Sea, it has the Belgian provinces of West Flanders and
                    Hainault on the N.E. and E., the departments of Aisne and Somme on the S., and
                    that of Pas-de-Calais on the W. The Flanders portion to the west of the Scheldt
                    is very flat, the hill at Cassel, only 575 feet high, rising like a mountain,
                    and looking north towards Dunkirk over a stretch of 155 square miles of richly
                    fertile lowlands, which about a thousand years ago were still covered by the
                    sea. To the south-east of the Scheldt the country has the character of the
                    neighbouring district of Ardennes, is better wooded, and contains the highest
                    point in the department (875 feet). The greater part of Nord is in the Scheldt
                    basin, but certain portions belong to those of the Sambre (Meuse), the Oise
                    (Seine), and the little coast-streams the Aa and the Yser. The Scheldt, flowing
                    by Cambrai, Bouchain, Valenciennes, and Condé, receives the Scarpe, which
                    touches Douai, Marchiennes, and St Amand. The Lys, which does not join the
                    Scheldt till it has entered Belgium, passes Armentières, and receives the Deule,
                    on which Lille is situated. The Sambre passes Landrecies and Maubeuge. The Aa
                    falls into the port at Gravelines. The climate of Nord is colder than that of
                    France in general, the mean temperature being 49° or 50° Fahr. The rainfall is
                    12 inches at Dunkirk and a little more <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n580/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0580-0535"/> at Lille. In the arrondissement of Avesnes, rain
                    is more abundant, and cold more severe. In population (1,603,259 inhabitants in
                    1881) and in agricultural and industrial importance Nord is second only to the
                    department of the Seine.</p>
                <p>Of the total area (2193 square miles), two-thirds are arable, one-sixth under
                    pasture, and one-eleventh consists of forest. The livestock comprises 93,000
                    horses, asses, and mules, 240,000 cattle, 125,000 sheep, 78,000 pigs, 29,000
                    goats, and 75,000 dogs. The grain crops yield about 19,250,000 bushels, potatoes
                    about half as much. Beetroot, flax, tobacco, chicory, colza, rape-seed, and hops
                    are all of importance. The natural pastures support a good breed of Flemish
                    cows. Stone, marble, clay, and sand are obtained in the department; but its
                    mineral wealth lies rather in its coal-pits, for the most part belonging to the
                    Anzin Company, which employs 20,000 workmen, and raises 3⅛ million tons per
                    annum. Iron mines also are worked in the arrondissement of Avesnes. The best
                    mineral waters are those of St Amand. There are numerous foundries,
                    rolling-mills, steel-works, file-works, agricultural implement factories, and
                    engineering works. More than 240,000 tons of pig-iron and 279,000 tons of
                    malleable iron, cast iron, rails, sheet-iron, and Bessemer steel were produced
                    in 1881. Copper foundries and zinc rolling-mills also exist. Spinning is more
                    extensively prosecuted in Nord than in any other department, Lille and its
                    suburbs being the principal seat of the industry. About 12,000 persons are
                    employed in flax and tow spinning, 8000 in cotton spinning, and 4000 to 5000 in
                    the manufacture of sewing-thread. Roubaix and Tourcoing spin wool, cotton, and
                    silk. Jute spinning employs more than 20,000 bobbins at Dunkirk. In Roubaix
                    alone there are upwards of 300 weaving factories; carpets (Tourcoing and
                    Roubaix), linen (Armentieres), ribbons, damask, muslins, tulles, laces, &amp;c.,
                    are all largely manufactured, and there are also sugar-factories, distilleries,
                    oil-works (scattered throughout the department), 1000 breweries, glass-works,
                    soap-works, dye-works. The exports of the department comprise cortι, fruit,
                    eggs, vegetables, and butter to England, oil-cake, linseed, oils, colza seed.
                    Consuming 4,500,000 tons of coal, it has to supplement its own production by
                    importing from Pas de Calais, Belgium, or England. Most of the foreign trade
                    passes through Dunkirk, a much larger port than Gravelines. Abundant means of
                    transit exist throughout the department. The total length of the navigable
                    rivers and canals is 325 miles, and railways to a total length of 450 miles have
                    been constructed between all the most important localities.</p>
                <p>Nord forms the archiépiscopal diocese of Cambrai, is comprised in the first or
                    Lille region of corps d’armée, and depends on the court of appeal at Douai. It
                    is divided into seven arrondissements (Avesnes, Cambrai, Douai, Dunkirk,
                    Hazebrouck, Lille, and Valenciennes), 61 cantons, and 663 communes. The number
                    of communes of importance especially for their industries is very large—St
                    Arnaud les Eaux (11,184 inhabitants), with mineral waters and an old abbey;
                    Anzin (10,043), near Valenciennes; Armentières (25,089); Bailleul (12,712), with
                    antiquities; Bavai (1863), the ancient <hi rend="italic">Bagacum</hi>; Bergues
                    (5385), with its old fortifications and a splendid belfry of the 16th century;
                    Bouvines (565), with an obelisk in memory of the victory of Philip Augustus in
                    1214; Cassel (4276); Le Cateau Cambrésis (9564); Condé (4621), a fortified town
                    with coal-mines; Cysoing (3160), with a monument of the battle of Fontenoy
                    (1745); Denain (17,202), with coal-pits, iron-works, and a monument of Villars’s
                    victory (1712); Fourmies (15,052), with spinning and weaving of woollen goods;
                    Gravelines (8416); and Landrecies, a garrison town on the Sambre.</p>
