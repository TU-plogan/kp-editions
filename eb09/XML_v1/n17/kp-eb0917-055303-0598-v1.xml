                <p><label type="entry">NORTH, <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi></label> (1732-1792).
                    Frederick North, second earl of Guilford, but better known by his courtesy title
                    of Lord North, was prime minister of England during the important years of the
                    American War. The only son, by his first marriage, of Francis, seventh Lord
                    North (grandson of Lord Keeper North), who was created earl of Guilford in 1752,
                    Frederick was born on 13th April 1732, and after being educated at Eton and
                    Christ Church, Oxford, was sent to make the grand tour of the Continent. On his
                    return he was, though only twenty-two years of age, at once elected M.P. for
                    Banbury, of which town his father was high steward; and he sat for the same town
                    in parliament for nearly forty years. In 1759 he was chosen by the duke of
                    Newcastle to be a lord of the treasury, and continued in the same office under
                    Lord Bute and George Grenville till 1765. He had shown himself such a ready
                    debater that on the fall of the first Rockingham ministry in 1766 he was sworn
                    of the privy council, and made paymaster-general by the duke of Grafton. His
                    reputation for ability grew so high that in December 1767, on the death of the
                    brilliant Charles Townshend, he was made chancellor of the exchequer. His
                    popularity with both the House of Commons and the people continued to increase,
                    for his good temper was neveι ’ ruffled, and his quiet humour perpetually
                    displayed: and, when the retirement of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n599/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0599-0554"/> duke of Grafton was necessitated by the hatred he
                    inspired and the attacks of Junius, no better successor could be found for the
                    premiership than the chancellor of the exchequer. Lord North succeeded the duke
                    in March 1770, and continued in office for twelve of the most eventful years in
                    English history. George III. had at last overthrown the ascendency of the great
                    Whig families, under which he had so long groaned, and determined to govern as
                    well as rule. He knew that he could only govern by obtaining a majority in
                    parliament to carry out his wishes, and this he had at last obtained by a great
                    expenditure of money in buying seats, and by a careful exercise of his
                    patronage. But in addition to a majority he must have a minister who would
                    consent to act as his lieutenant, and such a minister he found in Lord North.
                    How a man of undoubted ability such as Lord North was could allow himself to be
                    thus used as a mere instrument cannot be explained; but the confidential tone of
                    the king’s letters seems to show that there was an unusual intimacy between
                    them, which may account for North’s compliance. The path of the minister in
                    parliament was a hard one; he had to defend measures which he had not designed,
                    and of which he had not approved, and this too in a House of Commons in which
                    all the oratorical ability of Burke and Fox was against him, and when he had
                    only the purchased help of Thurlow and Wedderburne to aid him. The most
                    important events of his ministry were those of the American War of Independence.
                    He cannot be accused of causing it, but one of his first acts was the retention
                    of the tea-duty, and he it was also who introduced the Boston Port Bill in 1774.
                    When the Avar had broken out he earnestly counselled peace, and it was only the
                    earnest solicitations of the king not to leave his sovereign again at the mercy
                    of the Whigs that induced him to defend a war which from 1779 he knew to be both
                    hopeless and impolitic. At last, in March 1782, he insisted on resigning after
                    the news of Cornwallis’s surrender at Yorktown, and no man left office more
                    blithely. He had been well rewarded for his assistance to the king: his children
                    had good sinecures; his half-brother, Brownlow North, was bishop of Winchester;
                    he himself was chancellor of the university of Oxford, lord-lieutenant of the
                    county of Somerset, and had finally been made a knight of the Garter, an honour
                    which has only been conferred on three other members of the House of Commons,
                    Sir R. Walpole, Lord Castlereagh, and Lord Palmerston. Lord North did not remain
                    long out of office, but in April 1783 formed his famous coalition with his old
                    subordinate, Fox, and became secretary of state with him under the nominal
                    premiership of the duke of Portland. He was probably urged to this coalition
                    with his old opponent by a desire to show that he could act independently of the
                    king, and was not a mere royal mouthpiece. The coalition ministry went out of
                    office on Fox’s India Bill in December 1783, and Lord North, who was losing his
                    sight, then finally gave up political ambition. He played, when quite blind, a
                    somewhat important part in the debates on the Regency Bill in 1789, and in the
                    next year succeeded his father as earl of Guilford. He did not long survive his
                    elevation, and died peacefully on 5th August 1792.</p>
                <p>It is impossible to consider Lord North a great statesman, but he was a most
                    good-tempered and humorous member of the House of Commons. In a time of
                    unexampled party feeling he won the esteem and almost the love of his most
                    bitter opponents. Burke finely sums up his character in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Letter to a Noble Lord·. “</hi> He was a man of admirable parts, of general
                    knowledge, of a versatile understanding, fitted for every sort of business; of
                    infinite wit and pleasantry, of a delightful temper, and with a mind most
                    disinterested. But it would be only to degrade mvself,” he continues, “by a weak
                    adulation, and not to honour the memory of a great man, to deny that he wanted
                    something of the vigilance and spirit of command which the times required.”</p>
