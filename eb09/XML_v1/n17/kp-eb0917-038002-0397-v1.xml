                    >Lyne)</hi></label>, a municipal and parliamentary borough of Staffordshire,
                    England, is situated on a small stream, the Lyme brook, and near the Grand Trunk
                    Canal, 16 miles north-north-west of Stafford, and 35 south from Manchester. The
                    parish church of St Giles was, with the exception of the old square tower, which
                    dates from the 12th century, rebuilt (1873-76) from the pläns of Sir Gilbert
                    Scott, in the Decorated style, at a cost of &lt;£15,000. The free grammar
                    school, originally founded in 1602, possesses very large endowments, increased
                    by the amalgamation of various subsequent bequests for educational purposes, and
                    now consists of a high school for boys, a middle school for boys, and Orme’s
                    school for girls. The high school is a fine structure of red brick in the
                    Elizabethan style, erected in 1874 at a cost of £12,000. There are also national
                    and board schools and a school of art. The other principal buildings are the
                    town-hall, recently rebuilt, the covered market (1854), and the militia
                    barracks. The manufacture of hats was at one time the staple trade, but it has
                    now greatly declined. There are silk, cotton, and paper mills; and tanning,
                    brewing, malting, and sugar-refining are also carried on. In the neighbourhood
                    there are large collieries. The population of the parliamentary borough was
                    15,948 in 1871, and in 1881 it was 17,493. The municipal borough, which was
                    slightly increased in extent in 1877, had 17,506 inhabitants in 1881.</p>
                <p>The town, which was of some importance before the Conquest, derives the name
                    Newcastle from the rebuilding of the castle in the reign of Henry I. The
                    addition Lyme was due to the neighbouring extensive forest of Lyme, which
                    stretched'into Cheshire. The town and manor reverted in 1231 to Henry III. In
                    1263 the town and castle were bestowed on Simon de Montfort, on whose death they
                    were forfeited to the crown. The town received its first charter from Henry II.,
                    and this was extended by Henry III. and Elizabeth. It possessed the privilege of
                    returning two members to parliament some time before 1352.</p>
