                <p><label type="entry">NAVIGATION LAWS</label>. These laws are a branch rather of
                    municipal law than of the general maritime law (for which see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Sea Laws).</hi> They are based upon the right of a state to
                    regulate the navigation of its own waters and to protect its own commerce, and
                    may be divided into two classes.</p>
                <p>The first class includes all those laws, once so numerous, designed to secure a
                    commercial monopoly to the state which enacted them. By laws of this kind trade
                    with Goa was formerly confined to Portuguese subjects. In Great Britain the
                    object was attained by the Navigation Acts, the earliest of which were the 5
                    Rich. II. stat. 1, c. 3, 14 Rich. II. c. 6, ordaining that no merchandise should
                    be shipped out of the realm except in British ships on pain of forfeiture. The
                    principal Navigation Act was the 12 Car. II. c. 18 (Scottish, 1661, c. 45). Up
                    to 1854 <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n289/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0289-0278"/> coasting trade was wholly restricted to British
                    ships, and a British ship must have been navigated by a master who was a British
                    subject, and by a crew of whom a certain proportion must have been British
                    subjects. The impolicy of such legislative restrictions, clearly shown by Adam
                    Smith, was at last acknowledged by parliament, and since 1854 the only relics of
                    such restrictions are to be found in the provisions of the 16 &amp; 17 Vict. c.
                    107, § 324, by which, in order to secure reciprocity, prohibitions or
                    restrictions may by order in council be imposed upon the ships of any country in
                    which British ships are liable to similar prohibitions or restrictions. Subject
                    to these exceptions, a foreign ship is in the same position as a British ship
                    with regard to British trade. This right of foreign ships is expressly
                    recognized by the Customs Law Consolidation Act, 1876; by § 141 of that Act
                    foreign ships engaged in the coasting trade are not to be subject to higher
                    rates than British ships. Any advantages which a British ship has, e.y., the
                    right of claiming protection for her flag, the non-attachment to her of a
                    maritime lien for necessaries supplied in a British port, are not directly
                    connected with the policy under which the Navigation Acts have become obsolete.
                    These advantages are not secured to a British ship until she is registered.
                    American law agrees with British in this respect. “The United States have
                    imitated the policy of England and other commercial nations in conferring
                    peculiar privileges upon American-built ships and owned by our own citizens. . .
                    . The object of the Registry Acts is to encourage our own trade, navigation, and
                    shipbuilding by granting peculiar or exclusive privileges of trade to the flag
                    of the United States, and by prohibiting the communication of those immunities
                    to the shipping and mariners of other countries” (Kent, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Comm.,</hi> iii. 139). It may be noticed that an alien is generally incapable
                    of becoming the owner of a ship. This incapacity is specially preserved in the
                    case of British ships by the Naturalization Act, 1870.</p>
                <p>The second class of navigation laws includes those which deal with the navigation
                    of any waters over which a state has any control, and embraces all that is
                    necessary for the due use of such waters, as rules of the road, management of
                    harbours and lighthouses, and licensing and control of pilots. Such laws may
                    deal with (1) the high seas, (2) tidal waters other than the high seas, (3)
                    non-tidal waters.</p>
                <p>1. The claims of various nations to dominion over parts of the high seas have now
                    become matters of merely historical interest. Such claims have been at different
                    times advanced by Great Britain, Holland, Spain, and Portugal, and were once
                    sufficiently important to evoke the <hi rend="italic">Mare Liberum</hi> of
                    Grotius and the <hi rend="italic">Mare Clausum</hi> of Selden. But, though such
                    claims upon the high seas have long been relinquished, rules for the navigation
                    of the high seas may still be promulgated by any Government. In Great Britain
                    such rules have been made by order in council under the powers of the Merchant
                    Shipping Act, 1862; the rules at present in force are those contained in the
                    order of 14th August 1879. To these rules all the states of Europe except
                    Turkey, and in America the United States, Chili, Brazil, and Ecuador, have
                    assented, so that as far as the assenting states are concerned they are of
                    universal validity. Japan and Turkey have assented to them with certain
                    modifications. In the case of a state which has not assented to them, the only
                    rules enforceable are the general rules of the sea, gradually ascertained by
                    individual cases before courts of admiralty.</p>
                <p>2. For the navigation of its tidal waters—so far as they are territorial—a state
                    may legislate without the assent of other states. An example of such legislation
                    is afforded by the Territorial Waters Jurisdiction Act, 1878, a measure passed
                    in consequence of the celebrated case of the Queen <hi rend="italic">v.</hi>
                    Keyn (the “Franconia” case) in 1876. Under the head of territorial waters would
                    fall the “narrow seas” (as the Bristol Channel, Great Belt, or Straits of
                    Messina), bays and harbours, estuaries and arms of the sea, navigable tidal
                    rivers, and the sea for the distance of a marine league from the shore. Such
                    waters being <hi rend="italic">res public#,</hi> though not <hi rend="italic"
                    >res communes</hi> as are the high seas, are <hi rend="italic">prima</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">facie</hi> subject to the jurisdiction of the state. In England
                    the soil under such waters, or at least under all but the last kind, is <hi
                    rend="italic">prima</hi><hi rend="italic">facie</hi> vested in the crown,
                    subject to tho public rights of fishery and anchorage. For the distance of a
                    marine league the crown has certainly jurisdiction for police and revenue
                    purposes. This is a rule of general international law. In England the navigation
                    of most of the principal tidal waters is governed by rules contained in Acts of
                    Parliament and orders in council, the latter for the most part promulgated under
                    the authority given by the Merchant Shipping Act, 1862. Thus the navigation of
                    the Thames is governed by the order of 18th March 1880, of the Mersey by the
                    Mersey Sea Channels Act, 1874, and the order of 5th January 1881, of the Tyne by
                    the order of 12th December 1867, of the Tees by the order of 5th September 1870,
                    of the Humber by the order of 23d December 1881, and of the dockyard ports by
                    the order of 6th March 1868.</p>
                <p>3. Non-tidal waters, even though navigable, are in Great Britain <hi
                    rend="italic">prima</hi><hi rend="italic">facie</hi> private waters, in which
                    the right of navigation does not exist as a public franchise, but can only be
                    acquired by prescription, founded on a presumed grant by an owner. In Roman law
                    and in the Code Napoléon it is otherwise. Navigable rivers in those systems are
                    always <hi rend="italic">publici</hi><hi rend="italic">juris,</hi> whether tidal
                    or non-tidal. Navigation of non-tidal waters in the United Kingdom, whether
                    natural or artificial, is now almost entirely regulated by various Navigation
                    and Conservancy Acts, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the Thames Conservancy Acts,
                    the Shannon, Trent, Lee, &amp;c., Navigation Acts, and the various Canal Acts.
                    It may be noticed that the crown is empowered by the Merchant Shipping Act,
                    1862, to make rules for the navigation of inland waters, even when artificial,
                    on the application of the proprietors. Examples of such rules are the orders in
                    council regulating the Mersey and Irwell navigation and the Bridgewater
                    navigation, 18th May 1870. Such waters being private property, the application
                    for the rules by the proprietors is recited in the order in council.</p>
                <p>The distinction drawn in the United States between navigable and boatable rivers
                    seems to be peculiar to that country, unless indeed it is analogous to the
                    “fleuves et rivières navigables ou flottables” of the Code Napoléon, § 538. It
                    is at least unknown in Great Britain.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Remedies for Obstruction.—</hi> These may be either criminal or
                    civil,—the criminal by indictment or information, the civil by action for
                    damages or for an injunction, in addition to the criminal remedy, where special
                    damage has been sustained. It seems to be a good defence that the obstruction
                    was for the public benefit. This obviously leaves a considerable discretion in
                    the hands of the court.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">International Law.—</hi> The international law as to the
                    navigation of the high seas has been sketched above. As to territorial waters,
                    it is the general though not the universal opinion of jurists that the state to
                    which the territorial waters belong has a right to forbid their navigation by
                    foreigners. The free navigation of rivers has often been the subject of
                    treaties, almost necessarily so where a river is the boundary between two
                    states. In such a case, if a state were to maintain the strict letter of its
                    rights, navigation would be almost impossible, as each state is proprietor down
                    to the middle line of the bed of the river, the <hi rend="italic">medium</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">filum</hi><hi rend="italic">aquae.</hi> By the treaty of Vienna in
                    1815 it was provided that the navigation of all rivers <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n290/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0290-0279"/> separating or traversing the states that were
                    parties thereto should be open for commercial purposes to the vessels of all
                    nations, subject to a uniform system of police and tolls. The treaty of Paris,
                    1856, extended this principle to the Danube. In America the cases of the
                    Mississippi and the St Lawrence are important. By the treaty of Versailles,
                    1783, it was provided that “the navigation of the Mississippi shall for ever
                    remain free and open to the subjects of Great Britain and the citizens of the
                    United States.” But the United States afterwards acquired Louisiana and Florida;
                    and, the stipulation as to British subjects not being renewed in the treaty of
                    Ghent, 1814, the United States maintain that the right of navigating the
                    Mississippi is vested exclusively in their citizens. As to the St Lawrence,
                    after disputes for a long period between Great Britain and the United States,
                    the right of free navigation for purposes of commerce was secured to the United
                    States by the treaty of Washington, 1871. There are some waters, such as the
                    Bosphorus and the Suez Canal, which are subject to peculiar engagements by
                    treaty or agreement. But as a rule it may be said that in time of peace the
                    territorial waters of a state are open to foreigners for commercial purposes,
                    subject to observance of any rules as to police, pilotage, &amp;c., imposed by
                    the state. For instance, a system of compulsory pilotage is in existence in many
                    ports, and a vessel refusing to conform to the pilotage regulations might incur
                    serious liabilities. Most of the general law of England on this subject is
                    contained in Part V. of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1854. Tolls may be imposed by
                    the state upon foreigners. This right is expressly recognized in most commercial
                    treaties. A notable instance was the claim of Denmark to charge what were called
                    the “Sound dues” from all vessels passing Elsinore, though the Sound was not
                    strictly her territorial water. The right was not universally recognized, though
                    it had prescription in its favour, and was invariably paid. In 1857 the dues
                    were abolished, and compensation paid to Denmark for the loss of her alleged
                    right. <hi rend="smallcaps">(j.</hi> w.f)</p>
