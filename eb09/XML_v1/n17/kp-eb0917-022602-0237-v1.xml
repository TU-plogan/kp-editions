                <p><label type="entry">NAPOLEON III</label>. (1808-1873). Louis Napoleon, emperor of
                    the French, was the younger son of Louis, king of Holland (brother of Napoleon
                    I.), and of Hortense, daughter of the empress Josephine by her first husband
                    Beauharnais. He was thus both nephew and step-grandson of Napoleon I. His father
                    and mother were on the worst terms, and rarely lived together. Louis was born at
                    Paris on April 20, 1808, at the house belonging to his mother in the street that
                    is now Rue Lafitte. He was brought up at Paris, and was occasionally taken to
                    the Tuileries and noticed by the emperor, who gave him the cordon of the Legion
                    of Honour. But it is impossible that the child could have remembered much of
                    Napoleon I., who, from the beginning of the Russian campaign in 1812, was
                    constantly away from Paris. When, in 1814, the allies entered the French
                    capital, generosity towards the conquered was the order of the-day. Queen
                    Hortense was courteously treated and visited by the czar Alexander, to whom her

                    during the first restoration of the Bourbons, and were there when Napoleon
                    returned from Elba. A story that when Napoleon was on the point of setting out
                    for Waterloo the young Louis interrupted him in a conference with Marshal Soult,
                    and begged him not to go to the war, is probably mythical. The <pb break="no"

                    effected in so gentle a spirit as the first. The family of the Bonapartes was
                    banished from France. Hortense—who, like the rest of her kindred, had enriched
                    herself out of public property —retired to Switzerland, and purchased the
                    chateau of Arenenberg, overlooking the Lake of Constance. The next fifteen years
                    were passed by the young Louis partly at Arenenberg and partly at Augsburg,
                    which his mother chose as the place of his education. He grew up a gentle,
                    studious, brooding youth, and the influence of his Augsburg schooling remained
                    both in his habits of thought and in his German-like pronunciation, which was
                    noticeable long afterwards. Until 1830 he attracted little attention from those
                    around him, and none at all from the world, for he was as yet only one among
                    several cadets of the Napoleonic house, Napoleon’s own son, the duke of
                    Reichstadt, being still alive. He seems, however, to have had dreams of a great
                    future at an early age; and the instinct that some knowledge of military affairs
                    would be useful to him led him to serve as an artillery volunteer in the Swiss
                    camp of Thun under Colonel Dufour. The revolution of 1830, which dethroned the
                    Bourbons and awoke insurrectionary movements in so many countries, first
                    launched Louis Napoleon upon his eventful career. Along with his elder brother
                    he joined the Italian bands who were in revolt against the rule of the pope in
                    Romagna. This revolt was put down by Austrian soldiers. The elder of the two
                    brothers fell ill and died at Forli; Hortense, setting out to rescue her sons
                    from their danger, found one dead and the other ill with fever, and on the point
                    of falling into the hands of the Austrians at Ancona. After nursing Louis
                    through his illness she succeeded in carrying him away in disguise, and the
                    mother and son, after a most perilous journey, reached France, which they had
                    not seen for sixteen years. They arrived in Paris in April 1831: but the law
                    banishing the Bonapartes was still in force, and the Government of Louis
                    Philippe did not allow them to remain there more than twelve days. They were
                    sent on, like other exiles, to England, and stayed for some weeks in London,
                    from which they returned to Arenenberg. Louis, now twenty-three years old, was
                    beginning to form the political theories which the memory of the first empire
                    and the actual state of affairs in France under Louis Philippe naturally
                    suggested to a thoughtful and ambitious mind. A pamphlet called <hi
                    rend="italic">Political Reveries,</hi> containing the draft of a constitution
                    for France, and an <hi rend="italic">Essay on Switzerland, Political and
                    Military,</hi> were written by him in 1832-33. The first of these contains in a
                    crude and superficial form the ideas elaborated by the author in his later
                    works; the second gained for him the complimentary rank of captain of artillery
                    from the authorities of Bern. Louis remained quiet for some years in
                    Switzerland, but the death of the duke of Reichstadt in 1832 had made him
                    presumptive head of the house of Bonaparte,—his uncle Joseph, the actual head,
                    having no sons; and, in company with some adventurous friends, he formed the
                    design of overthrowing Louis Philippe’s Government by presenting himself to the
                    army. On the 28th October 1836 he came to Strasburg, and, after passing the next
                    day in consultations with Colonel Vaudrey and a few officers who were in the
                    plot, appeared at the quarters of the 4th artillery regiment, which Vaudrey
                    commanded. This regiment welcomed him, and Louis then went on to the infantry
                    barracks, where, however, the enterprise ended disastrously. He was arrested and
                    imprisoned, and, after a short interval, sent to America by Louis Philippe
                    without trial. He had not long been in the United States when he received a
                    letter from his mother stating that she was about to undergo a dangerous
                    operation. He returned to Switzerland in time to see her before her death
                    (October 5, 1837), denying, probably with truth, that he had made any promise to
                    Louis Philippe to remain absent from Europe. A pamphlet on the Strasburg affair,
                    which was now published at his instigation by one of his companions, Lieutenant
                    Laity, led the French ministry to demand his expulsion from Switzerland. The
                    Swiss Government declining to expel him, and, difficulties with France becoming
                    imminent, Louis voluntarily withdrew from the country and went to England. He
                    lived there for the next two years, renting a house in Carlton Terrace, leading
                    the life of a man of fashion, and associating with persons of prominence in
                    society and on the turf. Among the gaieties of the time in which he took a part
                    was Lord Eglinton’s famous tournament. His real interests, however, were of a
                    more serious character, and in the autumn of 1839 he published the treatise <hi
                    rend="italic">Des Idées Napoléoniennes,</hi> a vigorous but sophistical account
                    of Napoleon’s work as an administrator and organizer, and of his foreign policy.
                    He idealized the emperor, contrasting his internal government with that of his
                    successors in a series of questions addressed to the existing rulers of France,
                    and he exhibited his wars of conquest as struggles forced upon him by the
                    English and other Governments in consequence of his efforts to spread
                    civilization, and to unite the peoples of Europe in a federal tie. This work was
                    intended by its author to prepare the way for a new attempt against Louis
                    Philippe; and in August 1840, while the body of Napoleon was being brought back
                    from St Helena, he made his second descent upon France. Above fifty persons
                    assisted him on this occasion, the best-known being Count Montholon, a companion
                    of Napoleon I. in his exile. A ship was chartered, and the conspirators landed
                    at Boulogne, carrying with them a tame eagle. The enterprise had not even the
                    gleam of success which attended the expedition to Strasburg. No one joined them,
                    and within an hour or two those of the party who were not shot or drowned in
                    attempting to escape were lodged in prison. Louis was now brought to trial
                    before the Chamber of Peers, where he was defended by Berryer. He was condemned
                    to perpetual imprisonment, and the castle of Ham, on the Somme, was chosen as
                    the place of his captivity. For the next six years Louis remained in
                    confinement. He had the qualities which enable a man to bear imprisonment
                    well,—patience,· calmness, a low vitality and sluggish temperament, and the
                    power of absorbing himself in work. The fortitude with which, during these six
                    dreary years, he pursued the occupations which he had marked out for himself,
                    and retained, with intervals of depression, the belief in his own future, had
                    certainly something of nobility in it. Happiness,” he wrote, “lies much more in
                    the imagination than in the real world; and as I carry my imaginary world with
                    me, composed of memories and hopes, I feel as strong in solitude as in the
                    crowd.” In later life he described the prison of Ham as the university where he
                    had taken his honours; and it was no doubt within this prison that he made
                    himself, so far as literary study and discipline ever made him, a statesman. He
                    published at intervals during his confinement, besides numerous occasional
                    papers, an essay on the sugar question, in which he advocated a policy of
                    protection; a treatise on the <hi rend="italic">Extinction of Pauperism,</hi> in
                    which he proposed the colonization of waste lands, and the establishment of
                    communities organized on a somewhat socialistic basis; a scheme for cutting
                    through the isthmus of Panama; and historical fragments on the English
                    Revolution of 1688. He was working also at a <hi rend="italic">History of
                    Artillery,</hi> which was never finished. At the end of six years, after asking
                    in vain for permission to visit his father, who was dying, Louis effected his
                    escape, disguising himself with the aid of his faithful friend and
                    fellow-prisoner, <pb break="no"

                    gates of the castle with a plank over his shoulder (May 25, 1846). He went again
                    to London, and it is characteristic of the life of exile and imprisonment which
                    he had hitherto passed that he heard for the first time a French tragedy
                    performed when Rachel played in London in July 1846. He was now again in the
                    fashionable world, and he appears to have been compelled to raise very large
                    sums of money from money-lenders. The house in which he lived was No. 10 King
                    Street, St James’s. In February 1848 Louis Philippe lost his throne. Louis
                    Napoleon at once set off for Paris, offering his services to the provisional
                    Government. He was, however, requested to withdraw from France, and did so. In
                    April 1848, during the Chartist disturbances, he was serving in London as a
                    special constable. But his name was kept before the public in France; he was put
                    up for election to the assembly, and was elected at Paris and in three
                    departments. As a Bonapartist movement was now evidently beginning, the
                    executive commission demanded authority to arrest Prince Louis as an avowed
                    pretender. This, however, was refused by the assembly, and it was voted that he
                    should take his seat. Louis, however, had the astuteness to remain in the
                    background until the workmen’s insurrection of June was over, declaring himself
                    unwilling to be the cause of any disturbance. The insurrection was put down by
                    Cavaignac; reaction set in, and Louis now appeared upon the scene as the
                    candidate of order and the representative of authority. His first appearance in
                    the assembly was on September 26, 1848; and in December he was elected president
                    of the republic by above 5,000,000 votes, Cavaignac, who was second on the list,
                    receiving a million and a half, and Lamartine a few thousands. On assuming
                    office he swore in the presence of God to remain faithful to the republic, and
                    to fulfil the duties imposed on him by the constitution. From this time the
                    political history of Louis Napoleon is the history of France (see article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">France).</hi> The principal foreign affair of his presidency
                    was the expedition to Rome, in which, for the sake of anticipating the action of
                    Austria, French troops put down the Roman republic by force, and restored the
                    pope to his sovereignty. Abroad this gained for Louis Napoleon the bitter
                    hostility of Italian patriots, who remembered him as a companion in insurrection
                    against the pope in 1831; and it was one of the many inconsistencies of his
                    position that he was at once a friend of Italian freedom in his heart and yet,
                    as the “man of order” and the “saviour of society” in France, dependent to a
                    great extent upon the support of the priesthood. On the 2d of December 1851 he
                    executed the <hi rend="italic">coup d'état,</hi> which made an end of
                    constitutional government. Approved at first by an enormous majority of the
                    French people, and even by English public men of the type of Palmerston, this
                    act is now almost universally recognized as a disastrous crime. The sham
                    constitution which was promulgated by the president immediately afterwards
                    lasted less than twelve months. In the following November a plebiscite was taken
                    upon the question whether the imperial dignity should be re-established in the
                    person of Louis Napoleon, and an affirmative answer was given by nearly
                    8,000,000 voters, against a dissentient minority of 250,000. The empire was
                    inaugurated on the anniversary of the <hi rend="italic">coup</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">d'état,</hi> and for eighteen years Louis Napoleon was sovereign
                    of France. The first ten years of his reign were successful, and in some
                    respects brilliant. His marriage with Eugenie de Montijo, countess of Téba
                    (January 30, 1853), placed beside him a figure which long charmed Paris and its
                    visitors. Adhering to the alliance with England which, since 1830, had served
                    France well against the three eastern courts, Napoleon III. entered into war
                    against Russia. He had always represented the restoration of Poland to be one of
                    the tasks left by his uncle to France; and, had his army encountered fewer
                    difficulties in the Crimea, or had the German powers shown any inclination to
                    take part in the struggle against Russia, he would probably have made some
                    serious attempt to restore at least the duchy of Warsaw. But he was no soldier
                    himself; the war proved a serious and embarrassing matter, and in the end
                    Napoleon was far more anxious to make peace than his English ally. The second
                    nationality which associated itself with Napoleonic history, and which had been
                    crushed by the treaties of 1815, was the Italian. Napoleon III. had warning that
                    the cause of Italy could not be safely abandoned. In January 1858 Orsini
                    attempted to take his life. Whether or not the act of Orsini and the letters
                    which he wrote from prison had the effect of quickening the emperor’s
                    determination to do something for Italy may be disputed; but the time had now
                    come, and in the interviews which took place between Napoleon and Cavour at
                    Plombières in the autumn of 1858 the alliance between France and Sardinia
                    against Austria was arranged. In the spring of 1859 French armies entered
                    northern Italy, and the emperor himself took command. On the 4th of June he
                    witnessed the battle of Magenta, and on the next morning entered Milan in
                    company with Victor Emmanuel. During the battle of Solferino on June 24th, he
                    gave directions from the tower of the church of Castiglione. He met the emperor
                    of Austria at Villafranca on July 11 th, and there agreed to those preliminaries
                    of peace which so deeply disappointed the hopes that had been excited by his own
                    words,—“Italy free from the Alps to the Adriatic.” Venice was left to Austria;
                    Lombardy west of the Mincio alone was liberated; and the subsequent union of the
                    peninsula under the house of Savoy was no work of Napoleon III., whose own plan
                    was to form an Italian federation under the presidency of the pope, and in
                    virtual dependence upon France. Nevertheless the expulsion of Austria from
                    Lombardy was in itself so great a blow that the later effects, though not
                    foreseen by Napoleon, naturally resulted from it; and he has a better title to
                    the gratitude of the Italians than they have generally acknowledged. The
                    feelings with which Napoleon was regarded in Italy before and after the meeting
                    of Villafranca are well exhibited in Mrs Browning’s two poems, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Napoleon in Italy</hi> and <hi rend="italic">An August Voice.</hi> The
                    annexation of Nice and Savoy to France excited great uneasiness in the British
                    Government, but the treaty of commerce between France and England, which was
                    signed in January 1860, gave the emperor a popularity in England which he
                    retained even after his fall. With the termination of the Italian war and the
                    inauguration of a policy of free trade the rule of Napoleon III. had reached its
                    best. His ill-judged interference in the affairs of Mexico ended disastrously;
                    the part played by France in reference to the Danish War of 1864 was weak and
                    inconsequent; and when the great struggle between Prussia and Austria was
                    impending Napoleon appears to have been duped by Count Bismarck, and to have
                    expected to gain Rhenish territory without taking up arms. Meanwhile the
                    splendour of the court, the continuous improvements in Paris, the rapid growth
                    of wealth throughout France, the subservience of officials, deputies, and
                    journalists, had veiled the decline of administrative energy and the progress of
                    corruption and mismanagement. At length, after the establishment of a great
                    North-German power in 1866, the prestige of the emperor unmistakably sank. He
                    had to loosen the reins of government at home; and yet the grant of any degree
                    of liberty appeared to jeopardize his own existence. Failing in health, in
                    confidence, in reputation, he was hurried into the war of 1870 by the clerical
                    party at court, and by advisers who saw no help <pb break="no"

                    then retired into Metz, which he left on the 15th, the day between the battles
                    of Courcelles and Mars-la-Tour. The empress insisted on the relieving movement
                    which was then undertaken by Macmahon, and the emperor, going with the army, was
                    made prisoner with 90,000 men at Sedan on September 2d. He was sent to the
                    castle of Wilhelmshöhe, near Cassel, from which he subsequently retired to
                    England. He lived with the empress at Chislehurst, and died there on January 9,

                <p>Napoleon III. was a thinker and man of letters rather than a statesman. Presuming
                    on the accident of birth to seize absolute power and to direct the affairs of a
                    great nation, he proved himself totally incapable as an administrator, and
                    allowed office, political and military, to fall into the most unfit hands. Far
                    superior himself, as a man of ideas, to his conqueror the king of Prussia, he
                    never chose and never possessed a minister or a general who could be compared
                    with those selected by his rival. In private life he was kindly and amiable, and
                    the worst acts of his reign were rather those of the adventurers who surrounded
                    him than his own. (C. A. F.)</p>
