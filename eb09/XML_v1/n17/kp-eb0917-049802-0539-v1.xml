                <p><label type="entry">NIGHTINGALE</label> (Anglo-Saxon, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nfktegak,</hi> literally “singer of the night ”), the bird justly celebrated
                    beyond all others by European writers for the admirable vocal powers which,
                    during some weeks after its return from its winter-quarters in the south, it
                    exercises at all hours of the day and night. The song itself is indescribable,
                    though several attempts, from the time of Aristophanes to the present, have been
                    made to express in syllables the sound of its many notes; and its effects on
                    those that hear it depend so much on their personal disposition as to be as
                    varied as are its tones. To some they suggest melancholy; and many poets have
                    descanted on the bird (which they nearly always make of the feminine gender)
                    leaning its breast against a thorn and pouring forth its melody in anguish. It
                    is accordingly to be observed that the cock alone sings, and that there is no
                    reason to suppose that the cause and intent of his song, unsurpassed though it
                    be, differ in any respect from those of other birds’ songs (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Birds,</hi> vol. iii. p. 770). Sadness, therefore, is certainly
                    the last impelling sentiment that can be properly assigned in this case. In
                    great contrast to the Nightingale’s preeminent voice is the inconspicuous
                    coloration of its plumage, which is alike in both sexes, and is of a
                    reddish-brown above and dull greyish-white beneath, the breast being rather
                    darker, and the rufous tail shewing the only bright tint. The range of this bird
                    in Europe has already been so fully described <hi rend="smallcaps">(Birds,</hi>
                    vol. iii. p. 756, 757) as to render a further account of it needless. The
                    Nightingale reaches its English home about the middle of April,<note

                    some days before the females; and, often stopping on their way, letting their
                    song be heard in places they do not habitually frequent, pass to their proper
                    breeding-quarters. At this time they run very great danger from birdcatchers,
                    for their capture is effected with facility, and it is painful to add that of
                    those then caught nine-tenths are said to die within a month. Fortunately for
                    the species, it receives great protection from the practice of game-preserving,
                    which guards from intrusion so many of the localities it affects, and there is
                    probably no country in which the Nightingale breeds more abundantly and in
                    greater security than in England. - On the cocks being joined by their partners,
                    the work for which the long and hazardous journey of both has been undertaken is
                    speedily begun, and before long the nest is completed. This is of a rather
                    uncommon kind, being placed on or near the ground, the outworks <pb break="no"

                    leaves ingeniously applied together so that the plane of each is mostly
                    vertical. In the midst of the mass is wrought a deep cup-like hollow, neatly
                    lined with fibrous roots, but the whole is so loosely constructed, and depends
                    for lateral support so much on the stems of the plants, among which it is
                    generally built, that a very slight touch disturbs its beautiful arrangement.
                    Herein from four to six eggs of a deep olive colour are duly laid, and the young
                    hatched. If the latter be taken when nearly fit to fly from the nest, they can
                    with proper care be reared by hand, and this is the only justifiable mode of
                    proceeding for those who wish to keep this fine songster in confinement, as, if
                    the birds survive their first moult, they may live for some years in a cage, and
                    the cocks will in due time exercise their full vocal powers. The nestling
                    plumage of the Nightingale differs much from that of the adult, the feathers
                    above being tipped with a buff spot, just as in the young of the Redbreast,
                    Hedge-Sparrow, and Redstart, thereby shewing the natural affinity of all these
                    forms. Towards the end of summer the Nightingale disappears, and but little has
                    been observed of it in its winter-retreats, which are presumably in the interior
                    of Africa. One of the few records of it at that season proves that it visits the
                    Gold Coast <hi rend="italic">(Ibis,</hi> 1872, p. 291).</p>
                <p>The Nightingale is the <hi rend="italic">Motacilla luscinia</hi> in part of
                    Linnaeus, and the <hi rend="italic">Daulias luscinia</hi> of some modern
                    ornithologists. In the east of Europe a second species occurs which was not
                    discriminated by Linnaeus, though long known to German bird-fanciers as the <hi
                    rend="italic">Sprosser.</hi> This, the <hi rend="italic">Sylvia philomela</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">Daulias</hi><hi rend="italic">philomela</hi> of many
                    scientific writers, is a somewhat larger bird, which fact, and the presence of
                    some faint spots on its breast, have caused it to receive the English name of
                    Thrush-Nightingale. Its westward range appears to be limited to the valley of
                    the Rhine, and the statement that it has occurred in England is erroneous. Its
                    song is louder than that of the true Nightingale, but not so sweet in tone or so
                    varied in note. The name Nightingale has been vaguely applied to several other
                    birds. The so-called “Virginian Nightingale” is a species of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Grosbeak</hi> (vol. xi. p. 205), and the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Redwing</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi> strangely enough, has been often
                    spoken of as the “Swedish Nightingale.”</p>
                <p>The Nightingale holds a place in classical mythology. Procne and Philomela were
                    the daughters of Pandion, king of Attica, who in return for warlike aid rendered
                    him by Tereus, king of Daulis in Thrace, gave him the first-named in marriage.
                    Tereus, however, being enamoured of her sister, feigned that his wife was dead,
                    and induced Philomela to take her place. On her discovering the truth, he cut
                    out her tongue to hinder her from revealing his deceit; but she depicted her sad
                    story on a robe which she sent to Procne; and the two sisters then contrived a
                    horrible revenge for the infidelity of Tereus, by killing and serving to him at
                    table his son Itys. Thereupon the gods interposed, changing Tereus into a
                    Hoopoe, Procne into a Swallow, and Philomela into a Nightingale, while Itys was
                    restored to life as a Pheasant, and Pandion (who had died of grief at his
                    daughters’ dishonour) as a bird-of-prey (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Osprey).</hi>
                    The fable has several variants. Ovid’s version may be seen in the 6th Book of
                    his <hi rend="italic">Metamorphoses</hi> (lines 412-676). (A. N.)</p>
