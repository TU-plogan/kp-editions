                <p><label type="entry">NICKEL</label>, a chemical term, designating a metallic
                    element which was discovered by Cronsted in 1751. In 1754 he succeeded in
                    isolating it (in an impure state), and found it to be a “halbmetall”
                    (semi-metal). Afterwards finding it to be present largely in
                    “kupfer-nickel,”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Said to
                    be originally a term of contempt—“goblin copper,” meaning a tricky ore, which
                    promises copper but does not yield it.</p></note> he borrowed from that mineral
                    the name for his new element.</p>
                <p>Nickel (Ni) is one of the less abundant of elements. It is contained in the sun’s
                    atmosphere and in all meteoric iron. Of nickel minerals the following are of
                    metallurgic importance:—nickel-blende, NS; arsenical nickel glance, Ni(As. S)
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>; niccolo-cobaltic pyrites, (Ni, Co, Fe) <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi> S <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>; garnierite, 5(Ni, Mg)O
                    . 4SiO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + ∣H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O. Almost
                    invariably part of the nickel is replaced by cobalt, and not unfrequently part
                    of the arsenic by antimony, or occasionally bismuth. Nickel ores are in general
                    complex mixtures of one or more of these minerals, with sometimes very large
                    proportions of copper, iron, and other foreign metallic ores and gangue. The
                    metallurgy of nickel accordingly is a complex subject which cannot be fully
                    treated here.</p>
                <p>As an example of a sulphureous ore may be quoted that niccolo-cupreous pyrites
                    which is being worked at Dillenburg in Nassau. The process employed is closely

                    rend="smallcaps">Metallurgy</hi> (vol. xvi. p. 61). The fully refined mat
                    (“Concentrations-Stein ”) consists of 35 per cent, of nickel, 43 of copper, 2 of
                    iron, and 20 of sulphur. The article <hi rend="smallcaps">Metallurgy</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">{ut sup.},</hi> under arsenides, describes a process which, when
                    applied to arseniferous cobalt and nickel ores, yields the cobalt as smalt, the
                    nickel as part of a “speis” (an alloy of arsenides). The same process serves
                    occasionally for (so to say) collecting small proportions of nickel diffused
                    throughout oxidized ores, the arsenic requisite being introduced in the form of
                    native arsenide of iron.</p>
                <p>If an arseniferous ore contains copper, the process sometimes is modified by
                    addition of iron pyrites or some other sulphureous material, and so conducted
                    that, in addition to a nickelous speis, a cupreous mat is produced. The speis
                    and mat do not mix, but form separate layers, the mat, as the lighter of the
                    two, going to the top.</p>
                <p>All sulphureous, arsenical, or poor oxidized nickel ores are being wrought by
                    methods analogous to the above, in so far at least as they all aim, in the first
                    instance, at the production of a speis or mat from which the metal has to be
                    extracted by subsequent operations. Direct methods are being used only in
                    conjunction with one kind of ore, namely, that rich oxidized nickel ore which
                    was discovered in New Caledonia about 1875, and has since been imported into
                    Europe in large and yearly increasing quantities. It occurs in veins within
                    serpentine, and consists of garnierite mixed with more or less of oxide of iron,
                    chrome-iron ore, and a little black oxide of cobalt. It is valuable chiefly
                    through its absolute freedom from arsenic and sulphides. Most of the ore goes to
                    France, where it is worked chiefly by two firms. Christofle at St Denis treats
                    the ore with hydrochloric acid, and from the solution recovers the metal by
                    methods analogous to those customarily employed in connexion with speis and
                    mats. Garnier, at the Septêmes Works near Marseilles, makes straight for the
                    metal. The powdered ore, after mechanical purification (by such methods as are
                    explained in <hi rend="smallcaps">Metallurgy,</hi> vol. xvi. p. 59), is mixed
                    with charcoal and fluor-spar (or other flux) and worked into a paste with
                    coal-tar, which is then shaped into bricks or walnut-sized stones. The ore thus
                    prepared is then manipulated pretty much in the same way as an iron ore is for
                    the production of pig-iron. The furnaces used are about 13 feet high, and worked
                    with cold wind. Garnier in this manner produces three kinds of metal (1) an
                    almost pure carbide of nickel, which needs only be decarbonized to be converted
                    into pure metal; (2) an alloy of the carbides of nickel and iron; and (3), from
                    mixtures of nickel and iron ore, a nickeliferous pig-iron which, <pb break="no"

                    kind of wrought iron, harder and less liable to oxidation than the ordinary
                    metal.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Extraction of Metal from Mats and Sρeises.—</hi> The first step
                    as a rule is a roasting process, which, in the case of a speis, yields an
                    arseniferous mixture of oxides; a mat, in general, passes into a mixture of
                    oxide, sulphate, and unchanged sulphide. Either roasted material is easily
                    disintegrated by being treated with aqueous muriatic or sulphuric acid, with
                    formation of a solution of nickel-salt, contaminated, in general, with arsenic,
                    antimony, bismuth, copper, iron, cobalt, and zinc, which must be removed by
                    suitable analytical methods. But, as we have no space to consider this problem
                    in its general form, we will assume antimony, bismuth, and zinc to be absent.
                    If, in this case, the iron predominates sufficiently over the arsenic, these two
                    can both be removed at one stroke by evaporating the solution to dryness and
                    calcining the residue at the lowest sufficient temperature; the iron-salt only
                    is reduced to an insoluble basic salt (of Fe <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi>), which includes all the arsenic, so that by
                    redissolving in water and passing the liquor through a filter press we obtain a
                    solution which, by theory, is free of iron and arsenic. Practically, however, a
                    trace of iron remains, and must be removed by precipitation with carbonate of
                    lime in the cold and filtration. A repetition of the same process at about 60°
                    C. eliminates the copper, so that only the cobalt is left, which, however, is no
                    impurity metallurgically, and consequently may be suffered to remain, but, if
                    present in sufficient quantity, must be recovered for its own sake. This is
                    effected by addition of bleaching powder and gentle heating. If care be taken to
                    let a little of the cobalt escape, the rest goes down as black peroxide, Co <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, sufficiently pure for
                    its ordinary applications. From the filtered nickel solution the metal is
                    precipitated, by addition of milk-of-lime, as a green hydrated oxide, which is
                    collected and washed in a filter press. The precipitate, being inconveniently
                    gelatinous and bulky, is next rendered compact by a gentle calcination, and, if
                    it is, as usual, contaminated with sulphate of lime, is freed from this impurity
                    by judicious washing with highly dilute muriatic acid or otherwise. The purified
                    oxide then, either by mere pressure or with the help of starch or other
                    plastifying material, is shaped into little cubes of about one centimetre’s
                    side, embedded in charcoal dust within graphite or fire-clay crucibles and
                    heated in a fire. A dull red heat suffices for the mere reduction of the oxide
                    to metal; but a strong red heat is applied in order to cause the nickel cubes to
                    sinter together and become fast and compact. No degree of red heat will fuse
                    them unless they are contaminated with copper. There is no need to explain how,
                    with cupriferous leys, the process has to be modified to lead ultimately to a
                    fused regulus of coppernickel available for the preparation of german silver.
                    From a copper-free liquor, provided only it contains its iron all as ferric
                    salt, a pure nickel precipitate can be obtained at once by addition of oxalic
                    acid. The (green) oxalate of nickel precipitate need only be washed, dried, and
                    ignited to be converted into a pure (but partially oxidized) metal. This process
                    has actually been applied, at least experimentally, in the working of the New
                    Caledonian ore, with this modification, however, that the oxalic acid was
                    recovered by boiling the oxalate of nickel with carbonate of potash, and
                    precipitating the acid by milk-of-lime from the alkaline solution.</p>
                <p>Ordinary cube-nickel contains from 94 to 99 per cent, of real nickel. The purest
                    commercial metal is that extracted from the New Caledonian ore; it often
                    contains only a fraction of a per cent, of impurities. The present writer has no
                    information regarding the mechanical characters of such highly-refined New
                    Caledonian metal. The best commercial cube-nickel (although it may contain less
                    than 1 per cent, of impurities) is always utterly devoid of plasticity; it
                    breaks under the hammer, although the pure metal, as was shown as early as 1804
                    by Richter, and confirmed by Deville in 1856, is highly ductile and tenacious.
                    To obtain the pure metal, the best laboratory method is to prepare pure oxalate
                    and heat it intensely in a close crucible made of quicklime, when it is obtained
                    as an almost silver-white regulus, which has all the ductility and malleability
                    of the best wrought iron combined with one and a half times the breaking strain
                    and greater hardness. It is attracted by the magnet. Its specific gravity is 8 ’
                    279 for ingot, and 8 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 666 (Richter) for the forged
                    metal. It can be welded at a red heat like wrought iron, which it exceeds in
                    relative infusibility. It does not tarnish even on long exposure to the air.
                    Sulphuretted hydrogen does not blacken it. Liquid water, even in the presence of
                    air, has no action upon it. Aqueous non-oxidizing acids act upon it as they do
                    on iron, but more slowly. Nitric acid and aqua regia dissolve it as nitrate
                    Ni(NO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>) <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> and chloride
                    NiCl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> respectively. When heated strongly in air it
                    is gradually oxidized; it decomposes steam, slowly, at a red heat. In brief, it
                    unites in itself all the virtues of iron with some of the characteristics of the
                    noble metals, and yet its application in the mechanical arts was never thought
                    of until Fleitmann in 187D made a most remarkable observation. Finding that even
                    the purest nickel which he could produce on a manufacturing scale was brittle,
                    he attributed this defect not to the traces of metallic impurities still present
                    in it but to occluded carbonic oxide, and tried to remove this by addition of
                    magnesium to the molten metal. He succeeded beyond expectation: one-eighth of a
                    per cent, of magnesium added to the metal (in an atmosphere of carbonic acid)
                    before pouring imparted to it all the plasticity of the pure metal.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It is perhaps well to repeat
                    a warning given by Fleitmann, that the introduction of the magnesium, if not
                    very cautiously done in the absence of air, leads to violent
                    explosions.</p></note> Fleitmann also found that the thus purified nickel could
                    be permanently welded on wrought iron, and that a combination plate thus
                    produced could be rolled out into the thinnest sheet without breach of
                    continuity. Since that time his firm (Fleitmann &amp; Witte of Iserlohn) have
                    made a business of the manufacture of cooking utensils and other useful articles
                    out of such nickel-plated iron. Physiological experiments on a dog, instituted
                    at the instance of the firm, showed that the metal is innocuous. Cobalt, as
                    Fleitmann found, behaves in every respect like nickel, and even exceeds it in
                    whiteness and brilliancy.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>It is only fair to state that as early as the Universal Exhibition of Vienna
                    in 1873 the American Wharton exhibited vessels of pure forged nickel, prepared
                    from the spongy metal by strong compression under a steam hammer at a red
                    heat.</p></note> The writer has for more than a year been in the habit of using
                    a nickel basin (supplied by Messrs Johnson &amp; Matthey of London) for
                    operations with caustic-alkali lye, and finds it to work admirably—better, in
                    fact, than a silver one.</p>

                    more generally, exhibit a green colour. Sulphuretted hydrogen does not

                    ammonium, from neutral or alkaline solutions, precipitates a black sulphide
                    which, like sulphide of cobalt, when once produced is almost insoluble in dilute

                    of ammonium and free ammonia, forming a dark coffee-brown solution. Unlike

                    nickel is easily distinguished and separated from all other metals except
                    cobalt. To test a nickel solution for cobalt, add excess of nitrite of potassium
                    and acidify with acetic acid. Cobalt, if present, comes down gradually as
