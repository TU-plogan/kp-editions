                <p><label type="entry">NICOLE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Pierre</hi></label> (1625-1695),
                    one of the most distinguished of the Port-Royalists, a scholar of great
                    excellence, and, according to Bayle (who had no particular reason for praising
                    him), “one of the best writers in Europe,” was born at Chartres in 1625. Like
                    his friend Pascal he was a precocious boy, though his precocity showed itself in
                    classics and in miscellaneous reading, not in mathematics, and it was when he
                    was transferred from his native town to Paris to finish his education that the
                    rising school of Port Royal fixed its attention upon him. At an early age he was
                    made a master in the Port Royal school, where his special department was
                    classical instruction, though he is said to have taken no small part in the
                    famous <hi rend="italic">Art de</hi><hi rend="italic">Penser</hi> or Port Royal
                    logic. He shared in the history of the school, and with the exception of Arnauld
                    and Pascal may be said to have been its most accomplished member. Not a little
                    of the materials of the <hi rend="italic">Provinciales</hi> is said to be due to
                    him, and at the completion of Pascal’s great work he translated it into Latin.
                    One of the most virtuous men in France, he was a favourite of the notorious
                    duchess of Longueville for politico-theological reasons, and he was the
                    immediate master of Racine. This latter circumstance brought about an incident
                    thoroughly discreditable to the dramatist. Nicole was the author of certain <hi
                    rend="italic">Lettres sur les Visionnaires</hi> or <hi rend="italic">à un
                    Visionnaire,</hi> as they are most frequently cited. The actual title of the
                    collected work is <hi rend="italic">Les Imaginaires et les Visionnaires</hi>
                    (1667). In these he had attacked Desmarets de Saint Sorlin, and with the
                    excessive puritanism which characterized his sect had reflected on fiction and
                    the drama generally. Racine, without a shadow of personal provocation, replied
                    in two letters of great asperity, of which the first was actually published, and
                    the second only delayed (it was published after its author’s death) owing to the
                    judicious counsel of Boileau. But Nicole made no reply, and indeed public
                    opinion condemned Racine without hesitation. Nicole, who, owing to the
                    theological disputes in which he was concerned, had never fully taken orders,
                    and who had been compelled at one time to leave France, devoted himself in his
                    later years chiefly to moral philosophy. The first volume of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Essais</hi><hi rend="italic">de Morale</hi> appeared in 1671, and
                    the rest of his life was chiefly occupied on this book, though he wrote many
                    others. He was warmly admired by many of the best judges among his
                    contemporaries, Madame de Sévigné deserving especial mention, and numerous
                    selections of his ethical works have appeared in recent times. Modern opinion
                    hardly recognizes in Nicole the right to hold the place close to Pascal which
                    his own time accorded to him. His style is clear, simple, and correct, but a
                    little flat and monotonous; his thought sensible, just, and charitable, but
                    somewhat destitute of depth, subtlety, and originality. He was certainly one of
                    the best men of his time, but as certainly not one of the greatest; and his
                    reputation was due first to his scholarship, secondly to his moderation. He died
                    of apoplexy, November 16, 1695, and had latterly somewhat separated himself from
                    the Jansenists. Numerous stories are told of his personal timidity and
                    unreadiness in oral argument. It does not appear that his works (by far the most
                    important of which is the already-mentioned <hi rend="italic">Essais</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de Morale,</hi> Paris, 1671, sç.) were ever collected.</p>
