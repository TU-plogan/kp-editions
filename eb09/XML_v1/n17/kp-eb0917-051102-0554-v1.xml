                    bends round towards the Tigris and flows through the middle of the town, so as
                    to leave the south-east of the city more open to attack than any other part. The
                    principal ruin mounds within the walls are that of Kuyιinjik, north of the
                    Khausar, and that of the prophet Jonah (Nebi Υύ-nus) south of that stream. The
                    latter is the traditional site of Jonah’s preaching, and is crowned by an
                    ancient and famous Mohammedan shrine. The systematic exploration of these ruins
                    is mainly due to Layard (1845- 46), whose work has been continued by subsequent
                    diggers. These researches leave no doubt as to the correctness of the local
                    tradition. Not only have magnificent remains of Assyrian architecture and
                    sculpture been laid bare, but the accompanying cuneiform inscriptions throw much
                    light on the history of the city and its buildings. The mound of Kuyùnjik covers
                    palaces of Sennacherib and Assurbanipal,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    of Sennacherib and one of Esarhaddon. Of other remains, the most striking is the
                    gateway near the centre of the north wall, consisting of two halls, 70 feet by
                    23, the entrance to which towards the town was flanked by colossal man-headed
                    bulls and winged human figures. For the structure and art of the palaces see

                <p>Nineveh proper was only one of a group of cities and royal residences whose ruins
                    still mark the plain between the Tigris, the Great Zâb, and the Kliâzir. The
                    chief of these are at Khorsab&lt;id or Khurustâbâd, five hours by caravan
                    north-east of Mosul, on a tributary of the Khausar, and at Nimrùd, on the left
                    bank of the Tigris, eight caravan hours (18 miles) south-east from Kuyhnjik∙ The
                    former site was mainly explored by the Frenchmen Botta and Place. The city was
                    almost square, each face of the wall a little more than a mile in length. The
                    vast T-shaped palace of Sargon (722-705 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> whose
                    name the town bore (Dur-Sarrukin), stood near the northern angle. Its main
                    frontage was nearly a quarter of a mile long; it had thirty-one courts and more
                    than two hundred apartments.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>There is some evidence that Syriac tradition connected these
                    ruins with the name of Sargon; though our authority Yâkùt, in giving the alleged
                    old name of Khurustâbâd, has corrupted Sarglnin into Sar'ün. by writing £ for A
                    = 3. Another Syriac tradition connects Khurustâbâd with Resen, finding the name
                    Resen in the neighbouring Râs al-'Ain (Rësh 'Aina). See Hoffmann, <hi

                <p>The ruins of Nimrud, identical with the ruin Athιir of Arabic geographers (Yi⅛ht,
                    <hi rend="italic">s.vv.</hi> “Athùr,” “Salâmiya”), and first excavated by
                    Layard, represent the ancient city of Kalhu, the Biblical Calah. The enclosure,
                    protected on the west by the old bed of the Tigris, is, according to Layard’s
                    measurements, a quadrangle of 2331 yards by 2095 at the widest part, and was
                    surrounded by walls with towers and moats. The chief architectural remains
                    belong to a group of palaces and temples which occupied the south-west quarter
                    of the city. The principal palace (north-west palace) was built by
                    Assur-nasir-pal (885-860 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> and beside it he
                    raised a temple with a great tower (falsely called the tomb of Sardanapalus)
                    built in narrowing stages. The so-called central palace is that of his son
                    Shalmaneser II.; the unfinished south-west palace was the work of Esarhaddon. Of
                    the so-called south-east palace the chief part is really a temple of Nebo; a
                    statue of the god from this temple is in the British Museum.</p>
                <p>The main points in the history of these three great cities which are held to be
                    established by monumental evidence are these. The ancient capital of Assyria was
                    Assur (KaΓa Sherkat) on the Tigris, 5θ miles south of Mosul. Assur-nasir-pal
                    transferred the residence to Calah, a city which he tells us upon an inscription
                    had been originally founded by Shalmaneser I. (c. 1300 B.c.), but had
                    subsequently fallen into decay. Calah seems to have been the chief seat of the
                    kings till Sargon the captor of Samaria founded his residence at Khorsabad; the
                    glory of Nineveh proper begins with Sennacherib, but the city existed earlier,
                    for his inscribed bricks represent him only as rebuilder of the walls. It is
                    even averred that kings of the 19th and 15th centuries <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> built temples at Nineveh, but the remoter dates of Assyrian history
                    must be received with caution.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The legend of Ninus and Semiramis in classical authors
                    appears to be of late origin and quite uuhistorical. Ninus is merely the eponym
                    hero of Nineveh.</p></note> From the time of Sennacherib down to the fall of the
                    capital and empire—an event the date of which is still uncertain, the ancient
                    accounts varying between 626 and 608 B.c.—Nineveh proper, that is, the city on
                    the Tigris and Khausar, appears to have been the chief seat of empire. But when
                    the book of Jonah speaks of Nineveh as a city of three days’ journey, or when
                    Ctesias in Diodorus ii. 3 describes its circuit as 480 stadia, it is plain that
                    these conceptions imply an extension of the name to the whole group of cities
                    between the Tigris and the Zâb. In this connexion the words of Gen. X. 11 <hi
                    rend="italic">sq.</hi> are remarkable; for, on the most natural view, the clause
                    “this is the great city” applies not to Resen alone but to the four cities of
                    Nineveh, Rehoboth Ir, Calah, and Resen. Rehoboth Ir and Resen are still
                    untraced; the Syriac tradition which connects the latter with Rêsh 'Ainâ, that
                    is, with Khorsâbad, does not agree with the text, which says expressly that
                    Resen was between Nineveh and Calah, and indeed the verses in Genesis appear to
                    be older than the foundation of the city of Sargon. The description would suit
                    the mound of Salâmiya a little above Nimrud, but in fact the whole district is
                    studded with ruins.</p>
