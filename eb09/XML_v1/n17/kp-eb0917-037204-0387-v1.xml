                <p><label type="entry">NEW BRITAIN <hi rend="smallcaps">(Birara) and NEW
                    IRELAND</hi></label>, two Polynesian islands, about 340 miles by 23, and 240 by
                    22 respectively, are separated from the south-east extremity of New Guinea by a
                    strait, first ascertained to be such by Dampier, 52 miles wide (see Plate VI.).
                    They form together a sort of horse-shoe, divided in the middle by St George’s
                    Channel, some 20 miles wide, which in 1878 was half choked, temporarily, by
                    pumice from a neighbouring volcano. In this channel lies the Duke of York group,
                    fourteen small, well-wooded, fertile islands, with steep cliffs and narrow
                    fringing reefs. A Wesleyan mission and some German and other traders are settled
                    here and on the adjacent part of New Britain. The coasts of New Britain are in
                    some parts precipitous; in others the mountains lie farther inland, and the
                    coast is flat and bordered by fringing reefs. The west coast of New Ireland is
                    generally precipitous, and crowned by a table-land which falls away towards the
                    east. The north coasts of New Britain and the adjacent islands are studded with
                    active volcanoes rising to 4000 feet, and at both ends of the island these are
                    on a very grand scale. The scenery and vegetation are varied and luxuriant, with
                    abundant wood and water. In New Ireland images, apparently representing deceased
                    relations, like the karwars of New Guinea, are made of a rock indistinguishable
                    from pure chalk, which is said to exist nowhere else in the Pacific. These are
                    deposited in buildings set apart for them. There are also peculiar wooden masks,
                    worn at stated inter-tribal meetings and dances, and composite wooden images in
                    which the human figure, male or female, is surrounded by those of the snake,
                    fish, owl, tern, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The people of New Britain, especially towards the west, resemble those of eastern
                    New Guinea, height about 5 feet 6 inches, with matted curly hair; the women
                    appear stunted and oppressed. They are a finer race than those farther east in
                    Duke of York and New Ireland, who, excepting an evidently Polynesian colony on
                    the south coast of New Ireland, rather resemble the Solomon Islanders. Both are
                    thorough cannibals. Their weapons are clubs (stone-headed in New Britain),
                    spears, tomahawks, and slings. They perform complicated surgical operations with
                    an obsidian knife or a shark’s tooth. They construct ingenious fishing weirs.
                    The villages are clean and well-kept, the houses varying from miserable huts 8
                    by 5 feet without furniture to neat well-built semicircular houses, the roof
                    extending to the ground behind, with front of wicker work, leaving a space for
                    the door. The common dead are buried or exposed to sharks on the reefs; bodies'
                    of chiefs are exposed in the fork of a tree. Girls for some' time before puberty
                    are confined in cages of pandanus leaves about 4 feet diameter, possibly to
                    fatten them, an old Polynesian custom. Justice is executed, and tabus, feasts,
                    taxes, &amp;c., arranged, by a mysterious disguised figure, the “duk-duk.” Only
                    the chief and those who have been initiated on payment of a heavy fee know who
                    or what he is. Women and children are forbidden to look on him. The custom,
                    perhaps, points to a time when there was a priesthood, aiding the chief to rule
                    the people. The population is divided into two exogamous classes. The children
                    belong to the class of the mother, and when the father dies go to her village
                    for support, the land and fruit trees in each district being divided between the
                    two classes. Compare the Polynesian custom “tamaha” (the Fijian “vasu”), which
                    gives certain privileges to a sister’s children. There are several dialects, the
                    construction resembling Fijian, as in the pronominal suffixes in singular,
                    triad, and plural; the numerals, however, are Polynesian in character.</p>
