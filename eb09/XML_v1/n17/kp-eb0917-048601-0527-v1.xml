                    generally called by his friends the Great Layman or the Great Friend of God, was
                    the founder of a singular widespread association of pious people who, in the age
                    of monastic fraternities, lived in special religious fellowship in a fashion
                    altogether different from the common usage of the time. They did not renounce
                    their property, they took no vows of celibacy or of obedience, but they met
                    together for pious conversation, they corresponded with each other, they had
                    common ideas about conversion, holy living, and Christian faith and duty. They
                    were the Quietists of the 14th century, and called themselves the “Friends of
                    God.”</p>
                <p>Nicholas was the son of a rich merchant of Basel, and was born in that town about
                    the year 1308. Left his own master at the age of twenty-four, by the death of
                    his parents, and possessed of considerable wealth, he went out into the world to
                    enjoy life and seek adventures. He became engaged, burgher as he was, to a
                    maiden of noble rank. The night before his betrothal, as he was praying, he had
                    a vision which resulted in his breaking off his marriage, leaving home and
                    friends, and devoting himself to an ascetic life. After some years spent in
                    solitude, severe bodily mortifications, and deep soul struggle, Nicholas gained
                    the religious peace he sought, and from this time devoted himself to turning men
                    around him from sin to God. He did not enter any religious order; he remained,
                    what he loved to call himself, a layman; he neither preached nor heard
                    confessions, but by means of a singular gift of personal influence he drew round
                    him disciples from all classes of society. His followers did not form themselves
                    into a sect or into an order. Some of them were priests, monks, and nuns, but
                    some of them lived in the world, were nobles, knights, rich merchants, and their
                    wives. Their religious opinions were what are commonly called mystical; and
                    indeed all the more notable mystics of the 14th century were under the influence
                    of Nicholas and belonged to the Friends of God. They did not break loose from
                    the outward order of the church; they observed, though with no great
                    scrupulosity, sacraments, fasts, and. festivals; but they looked on all such
                    things as unimportant compared with that absolute resignation to the divine will
                    in all things which was their leading principle.</p>
                <p>The most striking event in the life of Nicholas is his meeting, in 1346, with
                    Tauler, the Dominican preacher of Strasburg, which had the result of entirely
                    changing the character of Tauler’s religious views and of his preaching.</p>
                <p>In the society of the Friends of God there came to be a small inner circle of
                    thirteen, who attached themselves to Nicholas, lived in community, and were sent
                    by him on long journeys to maintain communication among the brethren in the
                    different countries of Europe. In 1380, two years after the beginning of the
                    “Great Schism,” these thirteen friends met together for the last time, coming
                    from Italy, Hungary, and different parts of Germany. The state of the church at
                    the time seemed to fill them with despair. Nicholas had long, by the many secret
                    means he had at his command, exercised a great though invisible influence on
                    church appointments and ecclesiastical affairs, but now he seemed to feel it
                    hopeless to strive any longer against the increasing wickedness of the times,
                    and he broke up the society he had formed, releasing his followers from their
                    obedience, and went with two friends into Austria. Ten years later one Martin of
                    Mainz, a follower of Nicholas, was burnt as a heretic, and in the act of
                    accusation there are allusions to Nicholas which show that he was still living.
                    But, as he must have been then nearly eighty-five years of age, it cannot have
                    been much later, though the actual date is unknown, when, with two companions,
                    he was burnt as a heretic at Vienna, the chief crime of which he was accused
                    being that “he audaciously affirmed that he was in Christ and Christ in
                    him.”</p>
                <p>Our information about Nicholas comes to us chiefly through Rulmann Merswin, a
                    banker of Strasburg, who with his wife belonged to the Friends of God. Merswin
                    collected many leters and documents relating to the society, and bequeathed them
                    to a convent of the Knights of St John which he founded in Strasburg. They lay
                    hid for centuries, while the memory of Nicholas perished; even his name was
                    forgotten, and mediaeval students were aware only of a mysterious presence who
                    was sometimes referred to as “the Great Friend of God.” At last Professor C.
                    Schmidt discovered the documents in the library of the university, and was able
                    to identify Nicholas with Tauler’s mysterious visitor and with the Great
                    Layman.</p>
