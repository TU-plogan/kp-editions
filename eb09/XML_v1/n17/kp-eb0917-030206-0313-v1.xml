                    of Jesus, for we find no mention of it outside of the New Testament till
                    Eusebius and Jerome identify it with a “village” which undoubtedly occupied the
                    place of the modern Nasira. In Jerome’s time it was already visited by pilgrims,
                    but as yet we hear nothing of relics or places associated with special incidents
                    in the life of Jesus. The population was mainly Jewish,—exclusively so, we are
                    told by Epiphanius, down to the time of Constantine,—and the Jews, after their
                    manner in modern as in ancient times, seem to have been the inventors of various
                    marvellous relics and identifications which were palmed off upon Christian
                    pilgrims in the 6th century. Such at least is the natural inference from what
                    Antoninus Martyr tells of these wonderfully friendly and communicative Hebrews.
                    A century later Arculphus describes two great churches corresponding to the
                    modern Greek church over the Virgin’s Well and the Latin church of the
                    Franciscan monastery over the Grotto of the Annunciation. The place has since
                    passed through various vicissitudes; it was most flourishing in the time of the
                    crusaders, who transferred to it the bishopric of Scythopolis. The Ottomans at
                    length expelled the Christians; but the Franciscans established themselves under
                    the protection of Fakhr al-Din in 1620. The town has now a Greek, a Latin, and a
                    Moslem quarter, as well as a Protestant mission and orphanage. The population is
                    variously estimated at from 6000 to 10,000.</p>
                <p>The Virgin’s Well, just outside the town, must have been frequented by the women
                    of ancient as of modern Nazareth; all the other traditional sites are highly
                    dubious. But this hardly affects the interest attaching to the town, for the
                    character of Nazareth must at all times have depended on its position and
                    surroundings. It was a little country town of peasants and handicraftsmen,
                    nestling in olive groves and green meadows, separated and yet not distant from
                    the busy life of the greater Galilaean cities, surrounded on all sides by the
                    pleasantest landscapes of Canaan. The hill above the town commands one of the
                    finest views in Galilee, from Hermon to Mount Carmel.</p>
