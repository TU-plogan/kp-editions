                    Elizabeth</hi></label> (1808-1877), afterwards Lady Stirling-Maxwell, ranks high
                    among the women of letters of the 19 th century. She was born in 1808. One of
                    the three beautiful granddaughters of Sheridan, daughters of his son Thomas,
                    “three Graces” of London society in the reign of George IV., she showed literary
                    ambition and faculty before she was out of her teens. Her first publication,
                    made at the age of seventeen, was a merry satire, <hi rend="italic">The Dandies’
                    Rout,</hi> illustrated by herself, full of girlish high spirits and wit. The
                    preference shown for mournful and tender themes in her subsequent writings is in
                    strange contrast with this opening <hi rend="italic">jeu d’esprit.</hi> Her
                    first essay in serious verse was made in 1829 with <hi rend="italic">The Sorrows
                    of Rosalie,</hi> the next in 1831 with <hi rend="italic">The Undying One,</hi> a
                    version of the legend of the Wandering Jew. Fluent melody of versification,
                    richness and felicity of language, great tenderness of sentiment, and rhetorical
                    luxuriance of illustration showed that she had inherited no small portion of her
                    grandfather’s genius, and brought her at once into fame. Her portrait appeared
                    in <hi rend="italic">Fraser’s Magazine</hi> in 1831 as that of “the leader of
                    the female band.” Curiously enough, the author of the accompanying notice
                    describes her as “happy in all the appliances of wealth and fame,” and asks, “Of
                    a life like hers what can be told ?” at the very time when, according to her own
                    subsequent account, she was “learning the law respecting women, piecemeal, by
                    suffering from every one of its defects of protection.” She had made an
                    unfortunate marriage in 1827 with the Hon. George Norton, brother of Lord
                    Grantley; then, after three years of protests on her part and good promises on
                    his, she had taken the decisive step of leaving his house for her sister’s, had
                    “condoned” on further good promises, and had returned, to find matters worse.
                    The husband’s unmanly persecutions culminated in 1836 in an action brought
                    against Lord Melbourne for seduction of his wife, which the jury decided against
                    Mr Norton’s claims without leaving the box. Mrs Norton made her own unhappy
                    experience a plea for addressing to the queen in 1855 an eloquent letter on the
                    law concerning divorce, and her writings had considerable influence in ripening
                    opinion for recent changes in the legal status of married women. During the
                    reign of William IV., Mrs Norton was at the height of her literary reputation,
                    contributing many criticisms, sketches, tales, and songs to various periodicals
                    and annuals, and using pencil as well as pen. She was not a mere writer of
                    elegant trifles; she was one of the priestesses of the “reforming” spirit; she
                    appeared at her best in such works as <hi rend="italic">A Voice from the
                    Factories</hi> (1836), a most eloquent and rousing condemnation of child labour.
                    In a similar vein of warm sympathy with the unfortunate, she addressed a poem in
                    1845 to the prince of Wales, exhorting this <hi rend="italic">Child of the
                    Islands</hi> to use his power for social reforms. <hi rend="italic">Aunt Carry’s
                    Ballads,</hi> dedicated to her nephews and nieces, are written with playful
                    tenderness and grace of the most charming kind. Later in life she produced three
                    novels, <hi rend="italic">Stuart of Dunleath</hi> (1851), <hi rend="italic">Lost
                    and Saved</hi> (1863), and <hi rend="italic">Old Sir Douglas</hi> (1868). All
                    three are written with great power and freshness of style, enthusiastic facility
                    in the exposure of social impostures and in the exhibition of ideals of generous
                    conduct. Her heroines are too painfully tried by calamitous misunderstandings
                    and injuries, especially Eleanor Raymond, the heroine of the first, whose long
                    series of misfortunes finds hardly any relief from childhood till death. This
                    may have been due to the writer’s moral purpose, originating in her own bitter
                    experience, of championing the wrongs of her sex; but it is a singular fact,
                    pointing to temperament as the cause, that Johnson made the same complaint about
                    the novel of her great-grandmother, Frances Sheridan. Mrs Norton’s last poem was
                    the <hi rend="italic">Lady of La Garaye</hi> (1861), her last publication the
                    half humorous, half heroic story of <hi rend="italic">The Rose of Jericho</hi>
                    in 1870. She died on the 14th of June 1877. Mr Norton died in 1875; and Mrs.
                    Norton in the last year of her life was married to Sir W. Stirling-Maxwell.</p>
