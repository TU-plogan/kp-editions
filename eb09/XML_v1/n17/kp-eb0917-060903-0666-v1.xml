                <p><label type="entry">NOY, <hi rend="smallcaps">William</hi></label> (1577-1634),
                    attorney-general, was born, it is believed, on the family estate of Pendrea in
                    Buryan, Cornwall, in 1577, his father belonging to a family whose pedigree is
                    included in the visitation of Cornwall in 1620. He matriculated at Exeter
                    College, Oxford, 27th April 1593, and looked back upon his academical life with
                    such affection that, twenty years later, when the privileges of that institution
                    were invaded by Lord Petre, he pleaded its cause gratuitously and successfully.
                    His legal career began at Lincoln’s Inn, and throughout life he was a diligent
                    student of the grounds and precedents on which English law is based. From 1603
                    until his death he was elected, with one exception, to each parliament, sitting
                    invariably for a constituency of his native county. For several years his
                    sympathies were in antagonism to the wishes of the court, so that his historical
                    knowledge was freely laid at the service of the opposition. Every commission
                    that was appointed numbered Noy among its members, and even those who were
                    opposed to him in politics acknowledged his learning. A few years before his
                    death he was drawn over to the side of the court, and in October 1631 he was
                    created attorney-general, but was never knighted. It was through his advice that
                    the impost of ship-money was levied, and popular feeling vented its rage against
                    him for its disastrous revival. Noy had long been a martyr to disease of the
                    stone, and his death occurred, under circumstances of great agony, 9th August
                    1634; two days later he was buried at New Brentford church. Though he was of a
                    reserved, almost morose disposition, and after his change of principles had
                    little regard for the feelings of his old friends, many acts of kindness which
                    he showed can be gleaned from the literature of his time. His principal works,
                    <hi rend="italic">On the grounds and maxims of the laws of this kingdom</hi>
                    (1641) and <hi rend="italic">The</hi><hi rend="italic">compleat</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">lawyer</hi> (1661), went through many editions. Further
                    particulars concerning him and his children may be found collected in Davies
                    Gilbert’s <hi rend="italic">Cornwall,</hi> iii. 143-60, and in the <hi
