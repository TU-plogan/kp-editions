                <p><label type="entry">NOVOTCHERKASSK</label>, capital of the province of the Don
                    Cossacks, is situated 737 miles south-south-east from Moscow, and 40 miles from
                    the sea of Azoff. It was founded in 1805, when the inhabitants of the Tcherkassk
                    <hi rend="italic">stanitsa</hi> (now Old Tcherkassk) were compelled to leave
                    their abodes on the banks of the Don on account of the frequent inundations.
                    They were settled on a hill, 300 feet above the low plain, at the junction of
                    the Don with the Aksai, and it was the intention of the authorities to create
                    there, around the chief town of the Don Cossacks, a large agricultural colony;
                    but the want of drinking water proved a great obstacle, and it was decided to
                    transfer Novotcherkassk to another site, when Nicholas I., after a visit in
                    1837, ordered that it should remain where it was. In 1863 a water-supply was
                    obtained by the construction of an aqueduct 18 miles long, with a steam-engine
                    pumping 325,000 gallons per day. In the following year the town was brought into
                    railway communication with Voronesh and Rostoff, from which last it is 32 miles
                    distant. It is finely situated, and an extensive view over the low prairies of
                    the Don is obtained from the top of the hill. The town has a public garden, a
                    theatre, a clubhouse, and is adorned by the palace and gardens of the ataman of
                    the Cossacks, and by a monument to Platoflf. The educational institutions
                    include a gymnasium for boys, and another for girls, besides several lower
                    schools. Since the introduction of a water-supply and the construction of a
                    branch railway line to the Grushevskiya coal-mines, Novotcherkassk has been
                    developing rapidly; wide suburbs extend to the south-west, and the right bank of
                    the Aksai is dotted with the villas of the Cossack officials. Manufactures,
                    however, make but slow progress; there are only a few candleworks, brick-works,
                    distilleries, tobacco-works, and manufactories of champagne, with an aggregate
                    production in 1879 of 240,000 roubles (out of a total for all the province of
                    1,909,000 roubles). An active trade is carried on in corn, wine, and timber
                    (exports), and manufactures and grocery wares (imports). There are two fairs of
                    some local importance. The population of the town is 34,000.</p>
