                <p><label type="entry">NAILS</label>. A nail is a headed pin or spike of metal,
                    commonly of iron. The primary and principal use of nails is in wood work
                    (joinery and carpentery), but they are also employed in upholstery, shoemaking,
                    saddlery, slating, sheet-metal working, horse-shoeing, and numerous other
                    trades. The consumption in all civilized communities is enormous, but it is
                    exceptionally great where timber houses and wooden erections generally prevail,
                    as in the United States of America, and in many British colonies. Size, form of
                    head, nature of point, and special uses all give names to different classes of
                    nails. Thus we have the names tacks, sprigs, and brads for very small nails;
                    rose, clasp, and clout, according to the form of head; and flat points or sharp
                    points according to the taper of the spike. Arranged according to the manner in
                    which they are manufactured, nails may fall into four principal classes: —(1)
                    ordinary or hand-wrought nails; (2) machine-wrought and cut nails; (3) wire or
                    French nails; and (4) cast nails. The nailer handicraft was at one time a great
                    industry in the country around Birmingham, and to this day in conjunction with
                    chain-making it constitutes an important though declining trade. It is
                    essentially a family industry, carried on in the meanest of workshops, with a
                    very few simple blacksmith’s tools and appliances. The nails are forged from
                    nail-rods heated in a small <pb break="no"

                    length cut off on a chisel attached to the anvil, and the head formed by
                    dropping the spike into a hole in a “bolster” of steel, from which enough of the
                    spike is left projecting to form the head, which is variously flattened out. The
                    head, in the case of clasp nails, is formed with two strokes of the hammer,
                    while rose nails require four blows. The heads of the larger-sized nails are
                    made with the aid of an “oliver” or mechanical hammer, and for ornamental or
                    stamped heads “swages” or dies are employed. The conditions of life and labour
                    among the hand nailers in England are exceedingly unsatisfactory: married women
                    and young children of both sexes are set to work long hours in small filthy
                    sheds attached to their dwellings, and their employment is controlled by
                    middlemen or nail-masters, who supply them with the nail-rods and pay for work
                    done, sometimes in money and sometimes in kind on the truck system. The
                    handicraft is, however, an expiring industry, as machine-wrought and cut nails
                    are rapidly supplanting most corresponding kinds of handmade nails. Horse nails
                    alone continue to be made in large measure by hand labour (at St Ninians near
                    Stirling, as well as in the Birmingham district). These are made from the finest
                    Swedish charcoal iron, hammered out to a fine sharp point. They must be tough
                    and homogeneous throughout, so that there may be no danger of their breaking
                    over and leaving portions sunk in the hoof. The credit of perfecting machinery
                    for the making of nails belongs to American inventors, and by numerous stages
                    the nail-making machines have arrived at a high degree of efficiency. Of late
                    years mild steel, such as the plates employed for shipbuilding, has been largely
                    used for machine-made nails. Without much detail it would be impossible to
                    convey an idea of how the machine, fed with heated (to black heat only) strips
                    of metal having a breadth and thickness sufficient for the nail to be made,
                    shears off by means of its slicer the “nail blank,” which, falling down, is
                    firmly clutched at the neck till a heading die moving with sufficient force
                    strikes against its upper end and forms the head, and the nail now completed is
                    liberated, passing out through an inclined shoot. In the case of large nails the
                    taper of the shank and point is secured by the sectional form to which the
                    strips are rolled; brads, sprigs, and small nails, on the other hand, are cut
                    from uniform strips in an angular direction from head to point, the strip being
                    turned over after each blank is cut so that the points and heads are taken from
                    opposite sides alternately, and a uniform taper on two opposite sides of the
                    nail, from head to point, is secured. The machines turn out nails with wonderful
                    rapidity, varying with the size of the nails produced from about 100 to 1000 per
                    minute. Wire or French nails are made from round wire, which is unwound,
                    straightened, cut into lengths, and headed by a machine the same in principle as
                    the pin-making apparatus (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Pins),</hi> but the pointing
                    is accomplished by the pressure of dies in the same manner as the head is
                    formed. Cast nails, which are cast in sand moulds by the ordinary process, are
                    used principally for horticultural purposes, and the hob-nails or tackets of
                    shoemakers are also cast.</p>
