                <p><label type="entry">NORFOLK ISLAND</label>, with the much smaller Nepean Island
                    and Phillip Island, lies about 29° 3' S. lat. and 167° 58' E. long, 400 miles
                    north-north-west of New Zealand, on a submarine tableland extending 18 miles to
                    the north, and 25 miles to the south, with an average breadth of 18 miles.
                    Measuring about 6 miles in length from north-west to south-east, Norfolk Island
                    has an area of 8607 acres, or 13∣ square miles. The breakers of the Pacific
                    beating on its high cliff-bound coast render it difficult or even impossible to
                    land except at two places, and even there not without danger. With a general
                    elevation of 400 feet above the sea the surface of the island rises in the
                    northwest into Mount Pitt, whose double summit is 1050 feet in height. The soil,
                    of decomposed basalt, is well watered and wonderfully fertile. A rich undulating
                    pasture-land clothed with clumps of trees and copses gives a park-like
                    appearance to the general aspect of the country. The Norfolk Island pine <hi
                    rend="italic">{Eutassa</hi><hi rend="italic">excelsa),</hi> a magnificent tree,
                    with a height at times of 200 feet and a girth of 30, forms a fine avenue
                    between Sydney and St Barnabas, though of the forest that clothed the slopes of
                    Mount Pitt only a few of the larger trees are left. A small species of palm is
                    known as the Norfolk Island cabbage. The underwood is largely composed of lemon
                    trees; and guavas, bananas, peaches, and pine-apples are to be had in abundance.
                    Sweet potatoes are the staple crop, but common potatoes, maize, yams, and even
                    barley and oats are cultivated. The climate is genial and healthy, the
                    thermometer rarely sinking below 65°. In 1862 the population was 268; in 1871,
                    481; and in 1880, 663. The descendants of the Pitcairn Islanders, who form
                    two-thirds of the inhabitants, have their chief settlement on the south side, on
                    Sydney Bay, where the buildings of the old penal establishment were placed at
                    their disposal. A thousand acres on the west side of the island are held by the
                    mission station of St <pb break="no"
