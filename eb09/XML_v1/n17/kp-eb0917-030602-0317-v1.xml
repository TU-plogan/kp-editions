                    between 40° and 43° N. lat.; the Missouri flows along its eastern side, the most
                    easterly point being 95° 25' W. long., and the boundary line separating it from
                    Wyoming on the west is 104° W. long. It is bounded on the S. by Colorado and
                    Kansas, on the E. by Missouri and Iowa, on the N. by Dakota, and on the W. by
                    Wyoming and Colorado. The width of the State from north to south is 208∣ miles,
                    the length from east to west 413 miles, and the area 76,647 square miles, or
                    49,054,080 acres.</p>
                <p>The greater part of Nebraska is a plateau. The lowest point is at the mouth of
                    the Nemaha, in the south-eastern part of the State, where the elevation is 880
                    feet; the highest spot is Scott’s Bluffs, in the extreme western part of the
                    State (6000 feet). The eastern half of the State has an average elevation of
                    1400 feet; and the whole State averages 2312 feet above the sea.</p>
                <p>There are no mountains, but in the northern and western parts there are some
                    ridges and a few lofty hills. Generally the slopes are gentle, but occasionally
                    precipitous, and in rare cases there are canons with perpendicular sides. The
                    lands of three-fourths of the State are gently rolling. The surface owes its
                    present form mainly to erosion. Between all the forms of upland surface the
                    transition is gradual. The bottom lands and valleys are the most conspicuous
                    modifying features of the surface. They are huge shallow troughs, varying in
                    breadth from a quarter of a mile on the smaller streams to 23 miles on the
                    Platte and the Missouri. Their numerous terraces, like broad steps, gradually
                    lead to the bordering uplands, which in turn are varied in height and form.
                    Occasionally it is hard to determine where the bottom ends and the bordering
                    bluffs begin, but generally both forms are clearly outlined. The innumerable
                    tributaries that creep quietly into the main bottoms greatly complicate and
                    beautify the forms of landscape. The number of these valleys is very great, the
                    Republican alone having more than four hundred tributaries. Not less than 25 per
                    cent, of the entire surface of the State is composed of well-watered valleys.
                    The few destitute of water are regaining the streamlets of former times through
                    the climatic changes brought on by the settlement of the State. Most of these
                    bottom lands, though composed of the richest vegetable mould and alluvium
                    modified by loess materials, are perfectly dry, and rarely subject to overflow.
                    A clear conception of the topography can only be obtained by crossing the State
                    at right angles to the courses of the valleys. The rolling lands bordering the
                    valleys gradually disappear as the divide is approached which separates one
                    drainage system from the next. Here the land swells out into a gently undulating
                    plain that varies in extent from 1 to 30 miles. Some of these higher uplands
                    have a great number of shallow basin-like depressions where soil and grasses
                    closely resemble those of the bottom lands. They are the sites of small lakes
                    that recently existed here, and some of them still retain this character, being
                    filled with fresh water from 1 to 15 feet in depth. South of the valley of the
                    Niobrara, and commencing in 100° W. long., are the noted sand-hills. They vary
                    in height from a few yards to several hundred feet. Almost every form of wind
                    sculpturing is found, but the conical predominates. Though formerly naked, these
                    hills have recently become covered with grasses which are fixing the sands, and
                    preserving <pb break="no"

                    Creek. The water-power of the State is enormous. Though the streams meander
                    through broad bottoms, places can be found every few miles where the fall is
                    from 3 to 10 feet to the mile.</p>
                <p>Nebraska is the meeting-place of two rather distinct floras— that of dry regions
                    from the west, and their relatives from the moister east. Even many native Rocky
                    Mountain plants have crept down to the plains of Nebraska. Of plants indigenous
                    to the State 2000 species have been collected; among these, 1671 species are
                    flowering plants. The <hi rend="italic">Compositae</hi> are represented by the
                    largest number of species, there being 244 within the State. The sedges are
                    represented by 151 species, though there are comparatively few individuals. The
                    grasses are the leading vegetable forms in the number of individuals, though as
                    yet only 147 species have been detected. Originally the short buffalo grass <hi
                    rend="italic">(Buchloe dactyloides)</hi> was everywhere abundant, but it has
                    almost entirely disappeared from the eastern half of the State and from large
                    sections in its western portions, the taller blue-joint <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Andropogon furcatus,</hi> &amp;c. ) grasses taking its place. Nothing can
                    surpass the beauty of the prairies during the summer season when covered with
                    rank grasses and myriad flowers. Of forest trees 71 species are native. The
                    leading variety in the number of individuals and forests is the cotton-wood <hi
                    rend="italic">(Populus monilifera),</hi> which grows luxuriantly on river
                    bottoms and many uplands. The ash-leaved maple, soft maple, elms, various
                    species of ash, lindens, and willows are in various parts of the State about
                    equal in abundance. The most valuable tree is the noble black walnut, which is
                    extremely hardy and grows luxuriantly. The red cedar is abundant in some
                    sections, and grows well everywhere. Two species of spruce and two of pine are
                    found on tributaries of the Niobrara and Loup, and in the extreme western part
                    of the State. Shrubs are represented by 91 species. Wild fruits abound, among
                    which plums and grapes are most conspicuous, the former represented by three
                    species and an endless number of varieties. The grapes are limited to timber
                    belts, where they sometimes grow so luxuriantly as to make an almost
                    impenetrable thicket of vines. The smaller wild fruits are widely distributed
                    over the State.</p>
                <p>Before the advent of the white man Nebraska was a paradise for wild animals,—the
                    buffalo, elk, deer, antelope, beaver, wolves, lynx, foxes, &amp;c. The buffalo
                    has been banished, but the rest are still found in the sparsely settled sections
                    of the State. The bird fauna is well developed, being rich in genera (156); the
                    species number at least 261. Many species of fish, molluscs, and a few reptiles
                    are present in the streams. During a few years, and notably in 1874, 1876, and
                    1877, the migrating locust <hi rend="italic">(Caloptenus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >spretus),</hi> whose native habitat is beyond Nebraska, did considerable
                    damage. It does not appear on the average more than once in a decade, and owing
                    to the continually increasing area brought under cultivation the damage from its
                    visitations is continually growing less. Comparatively little damage has yet
                    been experienced from other insect pests.</p>
                <p>No Archaean rocks are found <hi rend="italic">in situ</hi> in the State. The
                    Palaeozoic system is represented only by rocks of Carboniferous age, which are
                    found in south-eastern Nebraska, and cover an area of about 2500 square miles.
                    These represent only the Upper Carboniferous, and are mainly yellowish micaceous
                    sandstone, drab, greenish, lead-coloured, ash-coloured, and brownish clays, and
                    indurated, hard, greyish and yellowish limestones. No thick beds of coal have
                    yet been discovered. The lower coal horizon is about 800 feet below the surface
                    along the Missouri as far south as Richardson county, where the upper strata
                    indicate a possible lower level geologically than is exposed elsewhere in the
                    State. Thin beds of coal, from 6 to 18 inches thick, are found near the surface
                    in Cass, Otoe, Nemaha, Johnson, Pawnee, and Richardson counties; in the last
                    occurs the best coal yet found in the State.</p>
                <p>At Aspinwall and on the State boundary it is 24 inches thick in places. In the
                    south-western part of the county a bed occurs from 20 to 28 inches thick, from
                    which at least half a million bushels have been taken within two years to supply
                    local demands. This bed has been traced from east to west about 20 miles, and
                    from north to south 4 miles. The coal is of good quality. On the west side of
                    the Carboniferous formation, and commencing at the mouth of Salt Creek, is a
                    narrow strip of Permian rocks which on the Kansas line is about 15 miles broad.
                    The rocks are mainly variously-coloured magnesian limestone, full of geode
                    cavities, the entire thickness ranging from 20 to 100 feet. The Jura Trias is
                    entirely wanting in eastern Nebraska. Resting conformably on the Permian are the
                    various strata of the basal-members of the Cretaceous system. Variegated clays
                    are overlaid by reddish brown conglomerates and sandstones which form the Dakota
                    group, whose thickness ranges from 20 to 300 feet. Above this group occur
                    blackish and ash-coloured shales; then a yellowish limestone; then a layer of
                    whitish limestone full of shells called the <hi rend="italic">Inoceramus</hi>
                    bed; and then on top towards north-eastern Nebraska a great thickness of impure
                    chalk rock varying in hue from greyish white to a blueish pink and yellow. These
                    beds constitute the Colorado group, or the Fort Benton and Niobrara groups of
                    Meek and Hayden, and vary in thickness from 100 to 500 feet. Next above occur
                    the shales containing selenite that constitute the Fort Pierre Cretaceous, which
                    are only found in Nebraska in Holt county and on the upper Republican river. At
                    the close of the Fort Pierre epoch Nebraska was again a dry land surface, and
                    remained so through the Fox Hills (Upper Cretaceous) epoch. In extreme
                    south-western Nebraska a small area is covered in isolated spots by the shales
                    and sandstones of the Laramie, or transition group between the Cretaceous and
                    Tertiary. No Eocene beds exist in Nebraska. Miocene beds exist in the
                    north-western part of the State, but during this period the remainder of
                    Nebraska continued to be a land surface which supported a gigantic forest
                    vegetation and an abιrndant mammalian animal life. The deposits in the Miocene
                    section are mainly indurated grits, silicates of lime, sandstones,
                    conglomerates, and tabular limestones. Towards the close of the Miocene a
                    further subsidence of the region of the plains inaugurated the Pliocene epoch.
                    The great lake now extended as far east as Columbus, covering at least
                    three-fifths of the State and an immense tract outside of its present
                    boundaries. The Pliocene beds are made up of sandstones, conglomerates, marls,
                    and variously-coloured clays. Between the Niobrara and the Loup rivers there are
                    in many places immense quantities of loosely compacted sands, which some
                    geologists, from the abundance of the fossils, have called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Equus</hi> beds. On the Republican river curious beds of flour-like geyserite
                    occur. During Pliocene times this was a great geyser region whose activity
                    commenced in the Cretaceous and continued through the Tertiary into the
                    Quaternary. This flour-like material equals for polishing purposes the best
                    tripoli. The thickness of the Pliocene beds in Nebraska ranges from 10 to 700
                    feet. There is evidence of increasing cold in the upper deposits of the epoch:
                    warm-temperate were gradually displaced by cold-temperate vegetable forms. The
                    lake itself was drained before the end of the Pliocene.</p>
                <p>The memorials of the Glacial epoch are here undoubted. Along the lower Platte,
                    and on the Missouri wherever hard limestone constitutes the surface rocks, they
                    are worn smooth and crossed by glacial scratches in a direction averaging 17°
                    east of south. On the surface rock occur—(1) blue clay from 1 to 30 feet thick;
                    (2) modified drift, gravel, and clay from 1 to 9 feet thick; (3) gravel and
                    boulders 1 to 6 feet thick; (4) occasionally black soil containing large
                    quantities of silicified wood; (5) gravel, sand, and drift boulders; (6)
                    calcareous sand; (7) loess from 2 to 200 feet thick; (8) black surface soil from
                    1 to 30 feet thick. On the return of mild conditions at the close of “the Great
                    Ice Age” a freshwater lake covered much of Nebraska and the adjoining region on
                    the east and south-east. The sediments brought down by the Missouri in the
                    course of ages filled it up. Thus originated the loess deposits which are the
                    source of the great agricultural wealth of the State. The rising of the land or
                    the removal of barriers effected the drainage of the loess lake. Through the old
                    lake bed the present rivers commenced to cut channels which at first filled the
                    whole of their present valleys. That the loess was a subaqueous deposit is
                    evident from the vast number of freshwater shells entombed in it. It is composed
                    of 81 per cent, of èxtremely fine siliceous matter, over 3 per cent, of ferric
                    oxide, 10 per cent, of the carbonates and phosphates of lime, and a small amount
                    of carbonates of magnesia, soda, and potash, clay, and organic matter. It forms
                    one of the best soils in the world, and can never be exhausted until the hills
                    and valleys of which it is composed are worn away. The loess and alluvium of the
                    river valleys have a larger amount of organic matter combined with them,
                    especially at the top, where the black soil is frequently from 5 to 30 feet
                    thick, than is found on the uplands, where it ranges from 2 to 5 feet. The
                    source of this black soil is the swampy condition that prevailed here towards
                    the close of the loess age. The rivers often stood long at the same <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n321/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0321-0308"/> level before tlιe upward movement was resumed,
                    and thus the many terraces were formed that characterize the valleys.</p>
                <p>That, as explained above, the soils of the State are among the best in the world,
                    chemical analysis and experience alike confirm. Experience has not yet settled
                    the question whether the alluvium of the valleys or the loess of the uplands is
                    the more valuable. Grasses and corn (maize) are the principal products. Corn,
                    especially, is a rarely failing crop. The root crops that grow in temperate
                    latitudes thrive amazingly. Eastern Nebraska is eminently adapted to the growth
                    of apples, which here attain a size, colour, and flavour rarely equalled
                    elsewhere. Grapes, plums, and cherries do equally well. Peaches, though not so
                    sure as the former, are successfully grown south of the Platte. The strawberry
                    nowhere reaches a better size or more luscious flavour than here. Other small
                    fruits do almost equally well. The spontaneous growth of nutritious grasses, the
                    ease with which cultivated varieties are grown, and the enormous yield of corn
                    render the State peculiarly adapted for the raising of cattle, horses, sheep,
                    and hogs. The stock industry is growing rapidly, and is at present doing most to
                    enrich the people. No industry promises better results, however, than the
                    planting of new forests, to which many people are devoting themselves with the
                    most gratifying success.</p>
                <p>The assessed valuation of the State in 1882 (being only one-third of the real
                    value) was $98,537,475. The cereals produced in 1882 were—wheat, 16,405,500
                    bushels; maize, 82,995,146; oats, 13,437,950; barley, 1,919,880. The following
                    amount of stock was reported (a few counties not being returned):—cattle,
                    815,933; sheep, 376,257; hogs, 821,049; horses, 232,942; mules, 31,314. Tree
                    culturels reported thus:—fruit trees, 2,038,111; grape vines, 305,389; forest
                    trees, 40,502,584. Many of the lesser products of the State are not included in
                    this statement.</p>
                <p>By the completion of the Union Pacific Railroad in 1869 a highway was made to the
                    Pacific across Nebraska. The Burlington and Missouri River Railroad, begun in
                    the same year, was completed to its junction with the Union Pacific at Kearney
                    in 1872. It extended its mainline during 1882 through the Republican valley to
                    Denver, Colorado. In connexion with both these main lines there are important
                    branches; and in 1883 2000 miles of railway had been constructed in the State.
                    Before the Union Pacific was made, freighting across the plains was a large and
                    profitable business. Omaha was conspicuous for its energy in securing this
                    traffic, and grew to be the first city in Nebraska, and has ever since led the
                    State in commerce and in manufacturing enterprises.</p>
                <p>A basis for a free school system was laid by Congress in the Act constituting
                    Nebraska a Territory, by which two sections of land (1280 acres) in each
                    township were set aside for this purpose. The State constitution of 1875
                    provided that all fines, penalties, and licence moneys arising under the general
                    laws of the State should be transferred to the school fund, and that the
                    legislature should provide for the free instruction in the common schools of the
                    State of all persons between the ages of five and twenty-one years. The census
                    of 1880 shows that only 2 ’ 5 per cent, of the population of Nebraska over ten
                    years of age are unable to read—a smaller proportion of illiteracy than that of
                    any State in the Union, with one exception (Iowa, 2 ’ 4 per cent.).</p>
                <p>A State normal school was established at Peru in 1867, and a State school for the
                    deaf and dumb in Omaha in the same year. The State institution for the blind was
                    established in Nebraska City in 1875; a regular course of study, extending from
                    eight to ten years, is provided. A State university and agricultural college was
                    established in 1869 at Lincoln, a building being erected at a cost of $150,000,
                    and opened in September 1871, when the population of the State was only 133,000.
                    It provides classical, scientific, and literary courses of instruction.
                    Provision has just been made to open a medical department with a three years’
                    course in October 1883. The higher State institutions of learning, as well as
                    the common schools, are open to both sexes, and free. The Insane Hospital was
                    opened at Lincoln in December 1870; the present building, exclusive of the wings
                    approaching completion, cost $165,000. The State penitentiary, established at
                    Lincoln in 1870, •was erected at a cost of $312,000?</p>
                <p>The population of the State in 1880 was 452,402 (249,241 males, 203,161 females).
                    In 1870 it was 122,993; in 1860, 28,846. Of the population in 1880, 95,790 were
                    born in Nebraska, 259,198 in other States of the Union, and 97,414 in other
                    lands—the largest number of immigrants being from Canada, Bohemia, Scandinavia,
                    and Germany. In 1860 the population per square mile was 0 ‘4; in 1870, 1'6; in
                    1880, 5 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 9. The population has been increasing so
                    rapidly since 1880 that the lowest estimates do not make it less than 675,000 by
                    the end of 1883.</p>
                <p>The following are the chief towns and their populations in 1880: —Omaha, 30,518;
                    Lincoln (the State capital), 13,083; Nebraska City, 4183; Plattsmouth, 4175;
                    Beatrice, 3386; Grand Island, 3550; and Hastings, 2817. All these towns have
                    greatly increased, and some of them, like Hastings, have doubled their
                    populations since 1880.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History. —</hi> Nebraska was probably first visited by
                    Europeans in 1541, in July of which year the Spanish general and explorer
                    Coronado penetrated from New Mexico to a country which he called Quivira, and
                    described as lying about the 40th parallel, and abounding in buffalo, which
                    corresponds with the region of the Platte. It was then occupied by powerful
                    Indian tribes, whose chief ruler was Tatarax. It was subsequently revisited by
                    Padilla, a Franciscan friar who had accompanied Coronado, and who here lost his
                    life. No more records of visits to this region are chronicled for two hundred
                    years. About the middle of the 18th century French missionaries from Canada came
                    to the Missouri, and still later a few traders found their way here. It
                    constituted a portion of the Louisiana territory which was purchased by
                    Jefferson from France in 1803. At that time Indian tribes still occupied the
                    whole region. At some earlier period a more civilized race lived here who made
                    pottery and skilful carvings, built houses and fortifications, and reared mounds
                    which often contain the ashes of their dead. When Nebraska came into possession
                    of the United States the Sioux Indians were most numerous. The Pawnees, Otoes,
                    and Omahas were next in numbers and in importance. These powerful tribes have
                    all become reduced in numbers by disease, constant wars, and privations. The
                    Sioux, who early gained the ascendency over the other tribes, resided in
                    north-eastern Nebraska. The eastern part of the South Platte region was occupied
                    by the Otoes, and the western part by the Pawnees, between which tribes there
                    were constant boundary disputes.</p>
                <p>The first settlement by whites was made in 1847 at Bellevue on the Missouri, 9
                    miles south of Omaha. Here a trading post of the American Fur Company was
                    conducted by Colonel Peter A. Sarpy, a Frenchman distinguished by his knowledge
                    of the Indians, his courage, and his enterprise. The Mormon emigration, begun in
                    1847, traversed several paths, one of which lay through Nebraska, which thus
                    first became generally known throughout the country. During the overland traffic
                    to California that commenced in 1849, dépôts of supply were established at
                    Bellevue, Plattsmouth, Nebraska City, and in the interior at Fort Kearney.</p>
                <p>The Act constituting Nebraska a distinct Territory, and opening its lands to
                    settlement, was approved May 30, 1854. Its area then embraced 351,558 square
                    miles, extending from the 40th parallel to British America on the north, its
                    eastern line connecting the Missouri river on the south-east with the Red River
                    on the north, and its western line being the summit of the Rocky Mountains. In
                    1861 Nebraska was shorn of its extended territory by the cutting off of portions
                    of it to form Dakota and Colorado Territories. In 1863 it was still further
                    reduced by the formation of Idaho Territory. These curtailments left Nebraska a
                    purely prairie State. During the first five years after the organization of the
                    Territory the settlements rapidly increased along the Missouri. Great numbers
                    who rushed to Pike’s Peak in 1859 when the gold excitement was at its height, on
                    their return, disappointed and disgusted, stopped and opened farms in the State.
                    This had the effect of starting settlements in the interior. The bottom lands of
                    the Missouri and its tributaries had first been occupied, and it was supposed
                    that the uplands were of inferior fertility. Now, however, these so-called
                    “bluff lands,” composed of loess materials, began to be cultivated, cautiously
                    at first, until experiment proved them to be of the choicest character. Pioneers
                    then began to push out from the rivers, at first only a few miles, but finally
                    wherever lands could be obtained, without regard to the presence or absence of
                    bottom lands. In 1863 the Union Pacific Railroad and in 1864 the Burlington and
                    Missouri River Railroad began to sell portions of their lands in Nebraska,
                    received from the general Government; and this became a most potent factor in
                    turning a tide of emigration into the State.</p>
                <p>At the breaking out of the civil war in 1861 the population of the Territory
                    comprised less than 30,000. Yet Nebraska furnished to the Union army during the
                    war 3307 officers and men, including two companies of scouts, partly composed of
                    Indians.</p>
                <p>In 1866 the legislature prepared a constitution for a State government, which a
                    vote of the people confirmed by a small majority, though the opponents of the
                    measure claimed that it was obtained by fraud. The first legislature under the
                    State constitution met July 4th, 1866. The bill to admit Nebraska as a State was
                    passed over the president’s veto, and proclaimed on March 1st, 1867.</p>
                <p>The first capital of Nebraska was at Bellevue. It was removed to Omaha in 1855,
                    where it remained until Nebraska became a State, when it was taken to Lancaster,
                    a town of half a dozen houses, whose name was then changed to Lincoln,—now
                    (1883) grown to be a city of 16,000 inhabitants. The present State constitution
                    was framed in 1875, and was ratified in the same year by the people. The first
                    legislature under the new constitution met in January 1877. The house of
                    representatives consists of eighty-four, and the senate of thirty members; and
                    the legislature meets biennially. (S. A.)</p>
