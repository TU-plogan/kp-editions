                    was more thoroughly investigated by Railton and by De Vrij. It is formed by the
                    action of concentrated nitric acid, in the presence of strong sulphuric acid,
                    upon glycerin at a low temperature, and may be readily prepared upon a small
                    scale by dropping the glycerin into the mixed acids, the mixture being kept
                    artificially cooled, and afterwards poured into a large volume of water. The
                    nitroglycerin then separates as a heavy liquid (sp. gr. D6), generally pale
                    yellow, but quite colourless when pure. It is inodorous, and has a sweet pungent
                    aromatic flavour; if it be touched with the tongue or even brought into contact
                    with the skin severe headache ensues, but this effect does not recur after a
                    while with those who habitually handle it, nor is their health premanently
                    injured by working with it. Nitroglycerin is applied medicinally, in very minute
                    doses, in cases of heart disease, but if taken even in small quantities it
                    operates as a violent irritant poison. If a thin layer be spread upon a hard
                    surface and struck sharply with a hammer it explodes violently; under favourable
                    conditions it is more sensitive to explosion by a blow than even mercuric
                    fulminate. It freezes (or crystallizes, in six-sided prisms) at about 40° F.,
                    and slowly liquefies again at 50°. When frozen it is less sensitive to
                    explosion; in the United States, where nitroglycerin is extensively used, as
                    such, in mining operations, it is transported in the frozen state for greater
                    safety. Under some circumstances, however, the readiness with which
                    nitroglycerin and its preparations freeze is a source of danger; they have
                    generally to be thawed, by applying heat, before use in cold weather or after
                    they have been frozen for some time, and disastrous explosions have resulted
                    from this being carelessly done. Nitroglycerin is very slightly soluble in
                    water, but is readily taken up by many solvents, especially by methyl-alcohol or
                    woodspirit. This solution being non-explosive, in the early days of application
                    of nitroglycerin it was transported in that form; but if the spirit became
                    weakened by evaporation, an explosive layer of nitroglycerin containing some
                    spirit would separate, and, in cool weather, nitroglycerin would crystallize out
                    of the solution. The dangers attending the use of nitroglycerin were therefore
                    not much diminished by the use of the solvent.</p>
                <p>Unless very carefully freed from acid and from unstable impurities, nitroglycerin
                    will decompose more or less rapidly, especially in warm climates, and the heat

                    explosions. But, when manufactured and purified according to the system
                    originated and developed by Nobel, the liquid is possessed of great
                    stability.</p>
                <p>The first attempts to utilize the explosive power of nitroglycerin were made by
                    Nobel in 1863; they were only partially successful until the plan, first applied
                    by General Pictot in 1854, of developing the force of gunpowder in the most
                    rapid manner and to the maximum extent, through the agency of an initiative
                    detonation (see “Detonation,” art. <hi rend="smallcaps">Explosives,</hi> vol.
                    viii.), was applied by Nobel to the explosion of nitroglycerin. Even then,
                    however, the liquid nature of the substance, though advantageous in one or two
                    directions, constituted a serious obstacle to its safe transport and storage and
                    to its efficient employment; it was therefore not until Nobel hit upon the
                    expedient of producing plastic solid preparations by mixing the liquid with
                    solid substances, in a fine state of division, capable of absorbing and
                    retaining considerable quantities of it, that the future of nitroglycerin as one
                    of the most effective and convenient blasting agents was secured. Charcoal was
                    the first absorbent used; eventually the siliceous (infusorial) earth known as
                    “kieselguhr” was selected by Nobel as the best material for producing <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Dynamite</hi><hi rend="italic">{q.v.</hi>), as it absorbs,
                    after calcination, from three to four times its weight of nitroglycerin, and
                    does not part with it easily when the mixture is submitted to pressure or
                    frequent alterations of temperature. For work requiring the greatest sharpness
                    and violence of action, the so-called No. 1 dynamite, consisting of about 75
                    parts of nitroglycerin and 25 parts of kieselguhr, is by far the most
                    extensively used; other inert absorbents have been used at times, and numerous
                    other less violent forms of dynamite <hi rend="italic">{Dynamitis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">à</hi><hi rend="italic">base action)</hi> are prepared by
                    impregnating mixtures of oxidizable substances and oxidizing agents <hi
                    rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> of nitrates and charcoal or carbonaceous bodies) with
                    smaller proportions of nitroglycerin, or by using imperfectly nitrified
                    wood-fibre, or other forms of cellulose, as the absorbent. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lithofr</hi><hi rend="italic">acteur,</hi><hi rend="italic">dualin, glyoxilin,
                    potentite, atlas-dynamite, lignin-dynamite,</hi> are examples. The last-named
                    was employed by the Fenians in the attempted outrages in Glasgow and London in
                    1883. The only inert absorbent of nitroglycerin which compares in efficiency
                    with kieselguhr is <hi rend="italic">magnesia alba,</hi> which is extensively
                    used for making dynamite in California. The application of
                    nitroglycerin-preparations to industrial purposes, especially for mining,
                    tunnelling, and blasting work in which great cleaving and shattering effects are
                    desired, has developed very rapidly since 1867. Thus, in that year 11 tons were
                    produced at the various works with which Nobel is associated; in 1870 the yield
                    had increased to 424 tons, in 1877 to 5500 tons, and in 1882 to 9500 tons, while
                    considerable quantities are now manufactured independently of Nobel.</p>
                <p>The most recent and most perfect form in which nitroglycerin is now used is
                    called <hi rend="italic">blasting gelatin.</hi> This material, also invented by
                    Nobel, is composed of the liquid and of a small proportion of so-called
                    nitro-cotton, which consists chiefly of those products of the action of nitric
                    acid on cellulose which are intermediate between collodion-cotton and gun-cotton
                    (trinitro-cellulose, &amp;c.). If the liquid is gently heated together with 5 to
                    7 per cent, of the finely-divided nitro-cotton, and the mixture kept stirred,
                    the two gelatinize together, producing a translucent, plastic, and tenacious
                    mass, which becomes hard when cooled to the freezing point of nitroglycerin, and
                    may be kept in water for any length of time without an appreciable separation of
                    nitroglycerin. When properly prepared, blasting gelatin is less sensitive to
                    detonation than dynamite; and, while its action as an explosive is somewhat more
                    gradual, it is considerably superior to dynamite in explosive power, and even
                    slightly more powerful than pure nitroglycerin, the reason being that the latter
                    contains somewhat more oxygen than is required for the complete oxidation of the
                    carbon and hydrogen, and that this excess is utilized in supplying the
                    deficiency of oxygen existing in the feebly explosive nitro-cotton. Blasting
                    gelatin is rapidly replacing dynamite in some of its applications, and is
                    already extensively manufactured in different countries. (F. A. A. )</p>
