                <p><label type="entry">NEER, <hi rend="smallcaps">Van dee</hi></label>. Aernout and
                    Eglon van der Neer, father and son, were painters whose lives almost filled the
                    whole of the 17th century.</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Aeenoγγt van dee Neee,</hi> commonly called Aart or
                    Artus, was the contemporary of Albert Cuyp and Hobbema, and so far like the
                    latter that he lived and died in comparative obscurity. Houbraken, who knew
                    something of Eglon, was without information as regards his father. He merely
                    noted that Aernout had been steward to a Dutch nobleman, and an amateur painter,
                    before he settled at Amsterdam and acquired skill with his brush. According to
                    common chronology Aernout was born in 1619 and died in 1691; but neither of
                    these statements is supported by any proofs. The earliest pictures in which
                    Aernout coupled his monogram of A. V. and D. N. interlaced with a date are a
                    winter landscape in the collection of Lord Overstone and a sunset in the museum
                    of Gotha. Both pieces were finished, if we grant the genuineness of the
                    inscriptions, in 1643, the year of Eglon’s birth at Amsterdam. In 1652 Aernout,
                    still faithful to his old haunts, witnessed the fire which consumed the old
                    town-hall of Amsterdam.</p>
                <p>He made this accident a subject for two or three pictures in the galleries of
                    Berlin and Copenhagen, probably on commission from merchants of the city of his
                    choice. But, though Amsterdam appears to have been constantly Van der Neer’s
                    domicile, he was not so sedentary in his habits as to neglect the rest of
                    Holland. His pictures tell that he was well acquainted with the canals and woods
                    about Haarlem and Leyden, and proofs are at hand to show that he was familiar
                    with the reaches of the Maes and Rhine. Dort, the home of Albert Cuyp, is
                    sometimes found in his pictures, and substantial evidence exists that there were
                    relations of friendship and neighbourhood between the two men. At some period of
                    their lives they laid their hands to the same canvases, on each of which they
                    left their joint mark. On some it was the signature of the name, on others the
                    more indelible signature of style. The partnership may not have been of long
                    duration. It was unequal, and illustrated in a few landscapes only, but these,
                    as well as contemporary works of Cuyp alone, reflect sufficient light on Van der
                    Neer’s career. There are landscapes in the collections of the dukes of Bedford
                    and Westminster, as well as in that of Colonel Neeld, in which Cuyp has
                    represented either the frozen Maes with fishermen packing herrings, or the moon
                    reflecting its light on the river’s placid waters. These are models after which
                    Van der Neer appears to have worked. His specialties were moonlights and sunsets
                    on canals and estuaries, or winter landscapes with skaters and ball players. The
                    same feeling and similar subjects are found in Cuyp and Van der Neer, before and
                    after their partnership. But Cuyp was the leading genius. Van der Neer got
                    assistance from him; Cuyp expected none from Van der Neer. He carefully
                    enlivened his friend’s pictures, when asked to do so, with figures and cattle.
                    It is in pictures jointly produced by both that we discover Van der Neer’s
                    presence at Dort. We are near Dort in that landscape sunset of the Louvre, in
                    which Cuyp evidently painted the foreground and cows. In the National Gallery
                    Cuyp signs his name on the pail of a milkmaid, whose figure and red skirt he has
                    painted with light effectiveness near the edge of Van der Neer’s landscape. We
                    recognize the partners in a sunset which was exhibited at Manchester when owned
                    by Mr Francis Edwards. Again, a couple of fishermen with a dog, and a sportsman
                    creeping up to surprise some ducks, are Cuyp’s in a capital Van der Neer at the
                    Staedel in Frankfort.</p>
                <p>Van der Neer has been known to paint a smithy, with figures alternately lighted
                    by the sun and the blacksmith’s fire (Oppenheim collection at Cologne), but
                    habitually his subjects were the rivers and water-courses of his native country
                    either at sunset or after dark. Sometimes the moon sheds its light on tall trees
                    and gables and windmills. His peculiar skill is shown in realizing transparence
                    which allows objects—even distant—to appear in the darkness with varieties of
                    warm brown and steel greys. He cleverly manages reflexions in water, and
                    balances the light on one side of a canal with dark masses of shadow on the
                    other. His greatest subtlety is displayed in combining the lurid glare of fires
                    with the cooler serenity of moonlight. Bürger says he inspired Van der Poel with
                    such a love of midnight fires that this unfortunate artist was induced to burn
                    incalculable numbers of cities and hamlets. Another of his fancies is to paint
                    frozen water, and his daylight icescapes with golfers, sleighers, and fishermen
                    are as numerous as his moonlights. But he always avoids the impression of
                    frostiness, which is one of his great gifts. His pictures are not scarce. They
                    are less valuable in the market than those of Cuyp or Hobbema; but, possessing a
                    charm peculiarly their own, they are much sought after by collectors. According
                    to the latest documentary evidence discovered in Holland, <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0327-0314"/> Aernout van der Neer was living at Amsterdam when
                    he purchased the freedom of the city of Gouda in 1685. He is said to have
                    resided at Rotterdam in 1691. But in 1692 he married a second wife at Gouda; and
                    so the date usually assigned to his death receives correction. Out of about one
                    hundred and fifty pictures accessible to the public, the choicest selection is
                    in the Hermitage at St Petersburg. In England the largest collector is Sir
                    Richard Wallace. But there are good specimens in numerous English galleries
                    besides.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="smallcaps">Eglon van</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">der</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Neer,</hi> born at Amsterdam in 1643, died at Düsseldorf on the
                    3d of May 1703. He was first taught by his father, and then took lessons from
                    Jacob Vanloo, whose chief business then consisted in painting figures in the
                    landscapes of Wynants and Hobbema. When Vanloo went to Paris in 1663 to join the
                    school from which Boucher afterwards came, he was accompanied or followed by
                    Eglon. But, leaving the French capital about 1666, he settled at Rotterdam,
                    where he dwelt for many years. Later on he took up his residence at Brussels,
                    and finally came to Diisseldorf, where he entered the service of the
                    elector-palatine Johann Wilhelm von der Pfalz. In each of the places where he
                    stopped Eglon married, and having had three wives became the father of
                    twenty-five children. A modern French critic has observed that the burden of so
                    large a family was as nothing to Eglon’s misfortune in having taught the arts to
                    Van der Werff.</p>
                <p>Eglon van der Neer has painted landscapes imitating those of his father, of
                    Berchem and Adam Elsheimer. He frequently put the figures into the town views of
                    Jan van der Heyden in competition with Berchem and Adrian van de Velde. His best
                    works are portraits, in which he occasionally came near Terburg or Metsu in
                    delicacy of touch, De Hooch in effectiveness of lighting, or Mieris in polish of
                    surface. One of his earliest pieces in which the influence of Terburg is
                    apparent is the Lady with the Book, of 1665, which was sold with the Bredel
                    collection in 1875. A young woman in white and red satin at Rotterdam, of 1669,
                    recalls Mieris, whose style also reappears in Eglon’s Cleopatra at Buckingham
                    Palace. Two landscapes with Tobit and the Angel, dated 1685 and 1694, in the
                    museums of Berlin and Amsterdam, illustrate his fashion of setting Scripture
                    scenes in Dutch backgrounds. The most important of his sacred compositions is
                    the Esther and Ahasuerus, of 1696, in the Uffizi at Florence. But he varied his
                    practice also with arrangements of hunting and hawking parties, pastures and
                    fords, and cavalry skirmishes. The latest of his panels is a mountain landscape
                    of 1702 in the gallery of Augsburg. (j. <hi rend="smallcaps">a.</hi> c.)</p>
