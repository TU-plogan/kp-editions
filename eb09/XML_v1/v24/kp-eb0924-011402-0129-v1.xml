                    of Switzerland, ranking as nineteenth in the Confederation, takes its name
                    either from the German <hi rend="italic">Wald</hi> (a wood) or, more probably,

                    tribes. It is of very irregular shape, as it owes its existence solely to
                    historical causes. Roughly speaking, it includes the whole north shore of the
                    Lake of Geneva. It stretches on the south-east as far as St Maurice and takes in
                    Château d’Oex, while to the north-west the Jura and the Lake of Neuchâtel are
                    its boundaries. The district of Avenches (entirely surrounded by the canton of

                    Payerne are also within its boundaries. The total area is 1244∙3 square miles,
                    larger than that of any other Swiss canton except Graubünden (Grisons), Bern,
                    and Valais. Of this total 1053∙6 square miles are classed as productive, forests
                    occupying 282 and vines 24∙8 square miles. This is a larger extent under vines
                    than in any other canton save Tessin (Ticino), and more than one-fifth of the
                    total winegrowing districts in the whole Confederation. Of the unproductive
                    portion lakes occupy 164∙1 and glaciers 4∙3 square miles, while towns and
                    buildings cover <hi rend="italic">5∙7.</hi> The highest point is the Diablerets
                    (10,667 feet) in the southeast corner. The population in 1880 amounted to
                    238,730 (an increase of 7030 since 1870), a larger number than in any other
                    canton except Bern and Zurich. Of these 212,164 are French-speaking, 21,692
                    German-speaking (many persons from the German-speaking cantons coming thither to
                    learn French), and 2518 Italian-speaking. In religion 219,427 are Protestants
                    (Calvinists), divided between the “national church” (19∙20) and the “free
                    church” (1∙20). The capital is Lausanne (30,179 inhabitants, or with the
                    surrounding districts 37,427), which since 1874 has been the seat of the federal
                    tribunal. It is the largest town in the Confederation after Zurich, Basel,
                    Geneva, and Bern. Other important places are Vevay (7820 inhabitants) and
                    Yverdon (5968).</p>
                <p>Agriculture is the main occupation of the people; the land is much subdivided and
                    very highly cultivated. The vineyards employ 20,000 persons. About one-third of
                    the wine produced is exported, the best-known varieties being Yvorne (white) and
                    Cortaillod (red). There is not much industry, except that of the watchmakers in
                    the Jura; and the commerce is comparatively unimportant. Many foreigners reside
                    in the canton, particularly on the shores of the Lake of Geneva, from Lausanne
                    to Villeneuve (as formerly Gibbon, Voltaire, and Rousseau). Montreux is a
                    favourite winter residence, and its growth may be judged of from the fact that
                    its inhabitants increased from 3211 in 1849 to 4379 in 1860, 6659 in 1870, and
                    8017 in 1880, the increase being specially marked since the opening of the
                    railway in 1861. The railways are 168 miles in length, besides a “ligne
                    régionale” on the high road from Lausanne to Échallens, and the cable railways
                    from Lausanne to Ouchy and from Territet to Glion. In educational matters the
                    canton holds a high place. The academy of Lausanne dates from 1537; and there
                    are a very large number of schools and educational establishments at Morges,
                    Lausanne, Vevay, and elsewhere. Pestalozzi’s celebrated institution flourished
                    at Yverdon from 1805 to 1825. Among the remarkable historical spots in the
                    canton are Avenches (the chief Roman settlement in Helvetia), Granson (scene of
                    the famous battle in 1476 against Charles the Bold), and the castle of Chillon
                    (where Bonnivard, the prior of St Victor at Geneva, was imprisoned from 1531 to
                    1536 for defending the freedom of Geneva against the duke of Savoy).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The early history of the main part of the
                    territories comprised in the present canton is identical with that of south-west
                    Switzerland generally. The Romans conquered (58 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi>
                    the Celtic Helvetii, and so thoroughly colonized the land that it has remained a
                    Romance-speaking district, despite conquests by the Burgundians (5th century)
                    and Franks (532) and the incursions of the Saracens (10th century). It formed
                    part of the empire of Charlemagne, and of the kingdom of Transjurane Burgundy
                    (888-1032), the memory of “good queen Bertha,” wife of King Rudolph II., being
                    still held in high honour. On the extinction of the house of Zäringen (1218) the
                    counts of Savoy gradually won the larger part of it, especially in the days of
                    Peter II., “le petit Charlemagne” (died 1268). The bishop of Lausanne (to which
                    place the see had been transferred from Aventicum by Marius the Chronicler at
                    the end of the 6th century), however, still maintained the temporal power given
                    to him in 1011 by the king of Burgundy, and in 1270 became a prince of the
                    empire. (We must be careful to distinguish between the present canton of Vaud
                    and the old mediaeval Pays de Vaud: the districts forming the present canton
                    very nearly correspond to the Pays Romand. ) In the 15th century Bern began to
                    acquire lands to the south from the dukes of Savoy, and it was out of those
                    conquests that the canton was formed in 1798. In 1475 she seized Aigle, in 1475-
                    76 (in concert with Freiburg) Echallens and Granson as well as Orbe (the latter
                    held of the duchy of Burgundy). Vaud had been occupied by Bern for a time
                    (1475-76), but the final conquest did not take place till 1536, when both
                    Savoyard Vaud and the bishopric of Lausanne were overrun and annexed by Bern
                    (formally ceded in 1564), who added to them (1555) Chateau d’Oex, as her share
                    of the domains of the debt-laden count of Gruyères in the division of the spoil
                    she made with Freiburg. In 1565 the liberties of Vaud were, by a special treaty,
                    placed under the guarantee of France. Bern in 1526 sent Farel, a preacher from
                    Dauphiné, to carry out the Reformation at Aigle, and after 1536 the new religion
                    was imposed by force of arms and the bishop’s residence moved to Freiburg
                    (permanently from 1663). Thus the whole land became Protestant, save the
                    district of Echallens. Vaud was ruled very harshly by bailiffs from Bern. In
                    1588 a plot of some nobles to hand it over to Savoy was crushed, and in 1723 the
                    enthusiastic idealist Davel lost his life in an attempt to raise it to the rank
                    of a canton. Political feeling was therefore much excited by the outbreak of the
                    French Revolution, and a Vaudois, F. C. de la Harpe, an exile and a patriot,
                    persuaded the Directory in Paris to march on Vaud in virtue of the rights
                    conferred by the treaty of 1565. The French troops were received
                    enthusiastically, and the “Le-manic republic” was proclaimed (January 1798),
                    succeeded by the short-lived Rhodanic republic, till in March 1798 the canton of
                    Leman was formed as a district of the Helvetic republic. This corresponded
                    precisely with the present canton minus Avenches and Payerne, which were
                    restored to it in 1803. The new canton was thus made up of the Bernese conquests
                    of 1475, 1475-76, 1536, and 1555. The constitutions of 1803 and 1815 favoured
                    the towns and wealthy men, so that an agitation went on for a radical change,
                    which was effected in the constitution of 1831. Originally acting as a mediator,
                    Vaud finally joined the anti-Jesuit movement (especially after the Radicals came
                    into power in 1845), opposed the Sonderbund, and accepted the new federal
                    constitution of 1848, of which Druey of Vaud was one of the two drafters. From
                    1839 to 1846 the canton was distracted by religious struggles, owing to the
                    attempt of the Radicals to turn the church into a simple department of state, a
                    struggle which ended in the splitting off of the “free church.” The cantonal
                    feeling in Vaud is very strong, and was the main cause of the failure of the
                    project of revising the federal constitution in 1872, though that of 1874 was
                    accepted. In 1879 Vaud was one of the three cantons which voted (though in vain)
                    against a grant in aid of the St Gotthard Railway. In 1882 the Radicals obtained
                    a great majority, and in 1885 the constitution of 1861 was revised. The
                    Government consists of a great council (one member to every 300 electors) for
                    legislative and a council of state of 7 members (chosen by the great council)
                    for executive purposes. 6000 citizens can compel consideration of any project by
                    the legislature (“initiative,” first in 1845), and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >referendum</hi> exists in its “facultative” form, if demanded by 6000 citizens,
                    and also in case of expenditure of over a million francs. Capital punishment was
                    abolished in 1874. The canton has lately been passing through serious financial
                    difficulties. In 1862 the south-west frontier was slightly altered in
                    consequence of a dispute with France as to the valley of Dappes.</p>
