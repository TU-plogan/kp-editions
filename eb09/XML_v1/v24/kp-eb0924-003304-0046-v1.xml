                    in the beautiful “huerta” of Valencia, on the right bank of the Guadalaviar or
                    Turia, 3 miles above its mouth, and 304 miles by rail east-south-east from
                    Madrid. Until 1871 it was enclosed by a wall, built in 1356 by Pedro IV.; two

                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0047-0034"/> picturesque gateways with machicolated towers
                    still remain. The river, reduced, except in time of flood, to a scanty stream by
                    the demands made upon it for purposes of irrigation, is crossed by five bridges,
                    of which the longest has thirteen arches. The streets are for the most part
                    narrow, crooked, and somewhat gloomy, but in the more modern quarters there are
                    some broad and handsome thoroughfares. The cathedral (La Seo), begun in 1262,
                    was afterwards (1459) lengthened in its original Gothic style, but in such a way
                    as to spoil its proportions, and in the 18th century it was further injured by
                    Pseudo-Classic additions. It possesses some fine examples of the sculpture and
                    metalwork of the 15th century, as well as of the Valencian school of painting.
                    The campanile (El Miguelete), an isolated octagonal Gothic tower, 162 feet in
                    height, commands an extensive view of the town and surrounding country. Near the
                    cathedral is the episcopal palace; its large and valuable library, rich in
                    medals and other antiquities, suffered greatly during the French occupation in
                    1812. Besides the cathedral, Valencia has fourteen parish churches and numerous
                    other ecclesiastical buildings, none of them of great architectural beauty or
                    interest; the church of St Nicholas (of Moorish origin) has, however, good
                    specimens of Juanes as well as frescos by Dinis Vidal; and Ribalta can be
                    studied in the chapel of the Colegio de Corpus or del Patriarcha. The university
                    buildings, dating from the 16th century, are large but uninteresting; the
                    library (about 42,000 volumes) suffered severely in 1812, and, like the other
                    appointments of the university, falls considerably short of modern requirements.
                    There is a collection of pictures (about 1000) in the city gallery, but only a
                    few,—almost entirely of the local school,—are of any importance. Among other
                    public buildings may be mentioned the court-house, a Doric edifice, dating from
                    the time of Ferdinand the Catholic, and having curious frescos (1592) in its
                    “chamber of deputies”; the custom-house (1758), now a cigar manufactory,
                    employing some 3500 women; and the silk exchange, a large and elegant Gothic
                    hall (1482). The citadel, on the northeast of the town, was built by Charles V.
                    as a protection against Barbarossa, the sea-rover; in the south-west of the town
                    is the former College of Saint Augustine, now used as a model prison, adjoining
                    which is a large hospital. Outside the walls are a botanic garden, a large
                    bull-ring, and various shady promenades, including the beautiful “Glorieta,”
                    and, on the north side of the river, the alameda, leading to the port of El
                    Grao. The principal manufacture is silk, and the town is also celebrated for its
                    coloured tiles or “azulejos.” Linen and woollen fabrics, hats, leather, paper,
                    cigars, glass, and pottery are also manufactured, and there are foundries and
                    printing-works. Corn, rice, silk, saffron, oranges, raisins, almonds, figs, and
                    other fruits are extensively exported, and iron, hardware, timber, and colonial
                    produce are imported. The port is at El Grao (Villanueva del Grao; population
                    4433 in 1877), 3 miles distant, where a commodious harbour with a minimum depth
                    of 20 feet has been constructed. The works were begun in 1792. The population of
                    Valencia in 1877 was 143,856, and in 1888 about 170,000 (estimated).</p>
                <p>The earliest historical mention of Valencia <hi rend="italic">{Valentia)</hi> is
                    by Livy (<hi rend="italic">Epit.,</hi> lv. ), according to whom Junius Brutus
                    settled the soldiers of Viriathus here (136 B.C.). It sided with Sertorius (<hi
                    rend="italic">c</hi>. 77 B.C.), and was accordingly severely punished by Pompey,
                    but must have recovered speedily, being mentioned by Pliny (iii. 4) as a colony
                    in the region of the Edetani, and spoken of by Mela as an important place. It
                    was taken from the Goths by the Moors in 714, and from the Moors by the Cid (see
                    vol. V. p. 774) in 1094, from whom it is sometimes called Valencia del Cid. The
                    Moors recovered possession in 1101, but were compelled finally to relinquish it
                    in 1238, when Jayme I. of Aragon (“El Conquistador”) added it to his dominions.
                    In the 16th and 17th centuries it became the seat of a considerable school of
                    painting, of which Juanes (1506-79) may be regarded as the founder, and to which
                    belonged also Francisco de Ribalta (1550-1628), Juan de Ribalta (1597-1628),
                    José Ribera (1588-1656), Pedro Orrente (1560-1644), and J. G. Espinosa
                    (1600-1680). In the beginning of the 17th century Valencia and its surrounding
                    district suffered greatly from the expulsion of the Moors, its most industrious
                    and enterprising cultivators. In the War of Succession Valencia sided
                    emphatically with the house of Austria, for which it was punished by being
                    deprived of many of its ancient privileges. In 1808 an abortive attempt to
                    capture it was made by the French; they succeeded, however, in 1812, and held it
                    till June 1813.</p>
