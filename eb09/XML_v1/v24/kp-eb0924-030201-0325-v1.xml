                    government of north-eastern Russia, with Vologda on the N., Perm on the E., Ufa
                    and Kazan on the S., and Nijni Novgorod and Kostroma on the W., has an area of
                    59,124 square miles. It has on its northern boundary the flat water-parting
                    which separates the basins of the Northern Dwina and Volga, and its surface is
                    an undulating plateau of from 800 to 1400 feet above sealevel, deeply grooved by
                    rivers and assuming a hilly aspect on their banks, broken up as they are by
                    ravines. Permian sandstones, marls, and limestones cover it; over these is
                    boulder clay, with extensive forests and marshes. The Kama rises in the
                    north-east, and, after making a wide sweep through Perm, flows along its
                    south-eastern boundary, while the whole of the government is watered by the
                    Vyatka and its numerous tributaries. Both the Kama and the Vyatka are navigable,
                    as also are several of their tributaries; the Izha and Votka, which flow into
                    the latter, have important iron-works on their banks. As many as 1,700,000 cwts.
                    of corn, iron, hides, leather, tallow, timber, and wooden wares were loaded in
                    1883 at the landingplaces of Vyatka, while the traffic on the Kama is still more
                    important. There are no railways, but the province is traversed by the great
                    highway to Siberia, and two other roads by which goods from the south are
                    transported to <pb break="no"

                    with everywhere, especially in the north; three-quarters of the area are under
                    forests. The climate is very severe, the average yearly temperature being 36° F.

                <p>The population (2,859,000 in 1883, as against 2,170,221 in 1861), though sparse
                    on the average, is somewhat dense in the better-situated valleys. The bulk
                    consists of Great Russians (81 per cent.), but there are also considerable
                    remains of the aboriginal Votiaks (250,000), Tcheremisses (about 150,000),
                    Tartars, Tepters, Permians, and even Bashkirs. Mohammedans number about 100,000,
                    and pagans (Tcheremisses and Votiaks) about 11,000. The Votiaks (Otiaks), a
                    Finnish stem of the Permian group, call themselves Ot, Ut, or Ud, and the
                    Tartars call them Ar, so that it is supposed that they may be akin to the Ars of
                    the Yenisei. They are middle-sized, with fair hair and eyes, often red-haired;
                    and the general structure of the face and skuli is Finnish. By their dialect
                    they belong to the same branch as the Permians. They are excellent
                    agriculturists, very laborious, and excel in bee-keeping.</p>
                <p>The soil is fertile, especially in the valleys of the south; rye, barley, oats,
                    buckwheat, and to some extent wheat are grown. The crops of 1885 were—rye,
                    4,006,000 quarters; oats, 3,957,000; barley, 734,000; wheat, 98,000; potatoes,
                    231,000 quarters. Com is exported to the Kama or to the north, as also are flax
                    and hemp. There is no want of natural meadows in the south, and cattle-rearing
                    prospers. The Vyatka horses, a fine breed, though rather small, are well known
                    throughout Russia. There were in 1883 706,600 horses, 925,100 cattle, and
                    1,446,400 sheep. Attempts are being made to introduce finer breeds of cows and
                    sheep.</p>
                <p>Industries are developing steadily, there having been in 1884 684 establishments,
                    which employed 9700 workmen, and showed a yearly return of £1,510,000. They
                    include distilleries (£885,600), iron-works, chemical works, tanneries, soap and
                    glass works, and cotton and paper mills. <hi rend="smallcaps">Votkinsk</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(q.v.)</hi> has a considerable yearly production of agricultural
                    machinery and steam-engines. The crown manufactory of guns at Izhevsk works up
                    yearly 10,000 cwts. of steel. Domestic trades give occupation to more than
                    40,000 persons, and their returns in 1884 reached £706,800. The manufacture of
                    wooden vessels, window frames, doors, furniture, sledges, and carts supplies a
                    considerable export trade to the steppe provinces of the lower Volga. Domestic
                    weaving produces, it is estimated, about 5,400,000 yards of linen every year.
                    Many peasants have nevertheless to leave their homes in search of work, either
                    as “burlaki” for shipping and dragging boats or as porters; hunting and
                    bird-catching still have some importance in the forest tracts.</p>
                <p>Trade is considerable,—iron, copper, tar, pitch, glass, leather, paper, timber,
                    and wooden wares, as also corn, hides, flax, linseed, honey, and other raw
                    produce being exported to Nijni Novgorod, Orenburg, and Siberia; while groceries
                    and various manufactured goods are imported.</p>
                <p>Vyatka is one of those few governments of Russia where the <hi rend="italic"
                    >zemstvo,</hi> consisting to a great extent of representatives of the peasantry,
                    has succeeded in creating a series of educational institutions without incurring
                    the displeasure of the Government. It distinguishes itself very favourably by
                    its schools, libraries, surgeons, and hospitals in villages, and by its
                    elaborate house-to-house statistical descriptions of several districts, and
                    statistical publications. There were in 1884 641 primary and 22 secondary
                    schools.</p>
                <p>Vyatka is divided into eleven districts—those of <hi rend="smallcaps">Vyatka</hi>
                    (24,480 inhabitants in 1885); Elabuga (9750); Głazoff (1945); Kotelnitch (4490);
                    Małmyzh (3400); Nolinsk (3990); Orloff (3380); Sarapul (12,370); Slobodskoi

                    rend="italic">(q.v.)</hi> has 15,480 inhabitants, and Izhevsk has 21,500.</p>
