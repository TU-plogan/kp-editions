                <p><label type="entry">VALENCIENNES</label>, a town of France and a first-class
                    fortress, in the department of Nord, is 157 miles northnorth-east of Paris on
                    the railway to Brussels, at the point where the river Rhonelle joins the
                    Scheldt. The latter here divides into two branches, one of which flows through
                    the town, while the other, canalized, fills the trenches of the citadel and
                    skirts the fortifications. Valenciennes is the centre of a rich coal-field,
                    which has called into existence numerous foundries, forges, rolling-mills,
                    wire-works, and machine shops. There is also an extensive beetroot cultivation,
                    with attendant sugar-works and distilleries. Cambrics and lawns are manufactured
                    and calico-printing is carried on, though little of the famous lace is now made.
                    There are a court of first instance, a chamber of commerce, a conseil de
                    prud’hommes, a chamber of agriculture, and a sugar exchange. The town-hall,
                    rebuilt after the old plan in 1867-68, and surmounted by a square campanile,
                    contains examples of the three Watteaus, Van Dyck, Velazquez, Rubens (the
                    Stoning of St Stephen), as well as numerous productions of the native school of
                    fine arts (founded in 1782). There are also collections of medals and seals and
                    a fine specimen of old Valenciennes tapestry. The library, formed at the
                    Revolution from the libraries of the religious houses of Valenciennes, St Amand,
                    and the neighbourhood, contains 25,000 printed volumes and 980 MSS., the latter
                    including valuable works in early Romance. Valenciennes also contains several
                    interesting private collections, and has associations for the promotion of
                    agriculture, science, art, music, &amp;c. The church of Notre Dame du Cordon, of
                    the 13th-century style, was consecrated in 1864. The church of St Géry has a
                    graceful modern tower; but only a few pillars remain of the old building of
                    1225. The crooked and ill-paved streets contain some houses of the 15th and 16th
                    centuries. Statues of Watteau and Froissart adorn the town. Of the six gates
                    three have some architectural pretensions. The population in 1881 was 23,291
                    (commune 27,607) and in 1886 22,919 (commune 27,575).</p>
                <p>Valenciennes, so named because founded or restored by the emperor Valentinian I.,
                    was a residence of Clovis, and it was hither that Charlemagne summoned his first
                    assembly of states in 771. The Normans were repulsed from its fortifications in
                    881. Valenciennes by turns belonged to Hainault and was independent, till taken
                    by Baldwin of Flanders in 1003. It espoused the cause of Jean d’Avesnes in 1353,
                    and was unsuccessfully besieged by the Flemings. In the 16th century
                    Valenciennes became the stronghold of Protestantism in Hainault, but was
                    conquered by the Spaniards, who committed all sorts of excesses. In 1656 the
                    Spaniards under Condé made a successful defence against the French under
                    Turenne; but in 1677 Louis XIV. took the town after an eight days’ siege, and
                    Vauban constructed the citadel. Valenciennes has since always belonged to
                    France. In 1793, after forty-three days’ bombardment, the garrison, reduced to
                    3000 men, surrendered to the allied forces numbering some 140,000 or 150,000
                    men, with 400 cannon. In 1815 it defended itself successfully. Among the natives
                    of Valenciennes may be mentioned Isabella of Hainault, wife of Philip Augustus
                    of France, Baldwin IX. of Flanders (emperor of Constantinople), Jeanne of
                    Flanders, Henry VII. of Luxemburg (emperor of Germany), Froissart, the painters
                    Watteau (3), Pater, and Abel de Pujol, the sculptors De Crauck, Durez, Saly,
                    Carpeaux, and Lemaire, the soldiers Jacques de Lalaing and Charles de Lannoy
                    (viceroy of Naples), and the navigator Lemaire.</p>
