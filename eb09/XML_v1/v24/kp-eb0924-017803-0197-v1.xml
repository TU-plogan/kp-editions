                <p><label type="entry">VERTEBRATA</label>, the name of a great branch or phylum of
                    the Animal Kingdom which comprises those animals having bony “vertebrae ”, or
                    pieces of bone jointed so as to form a spinal column. The first recognition of
                    the group is due to Lamarck (1797), who united the four highest classes of
                    Linnaeus’s system as “animaux à vertèbres,” whilst distinguishing the rest of
                    the animal world as “animaux sans vertèbres.” The same union of the four
                    Linnaean classes had been previously made by Batsch in 1788, who, however,
                    proposed for the great division thus constituted the name “Knochenthiere.” The
                    significance of Lamarck’s classification was materially altered, and the
                    foundation laid of our present attempts to represent by our classifications the
                    pedigree of the animal kingdom, when Cuvier propounded his doctrine of “types,”
                    and recognized the <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata</hi> as one of four great types
                    or plans of structure to be distinguished in the animal world (<hi rend="italic"
                    >I</hi>).<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>These numerals
                    refer to the bibliography at the end of the article.</p></note></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata</hi> of Lamarck and Cuvier included beasts,
                    birds, reptiles, and fishes, and until recently the group was considered as one
                    of the most sharply limited in the animal kingdom. The progress of anatomical
                    studies very soon rendered it clear that all <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata</hi>
                    did not possess bony vertebrae; for, besides the commoner sharks and skates,
                    with their purely cartilaginous skeletons, naturalists became acquainted with
                    the structure of fishes, such as the sturgeons and the lampreys, which possess
                    no vertebrae at all, but merely a continuous elastic rod (the notochord) in the
                    place of the jointed spinal column. The muscles and their skeletal septa were
                    seen in these fishes to be arranged in a series of segments attached to the
                    sides of this continuous rod; and hence the structural character of bony
                    vertebrae, as distinguishing the <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata,</hi> gave place
                    to the character of segmental arrangement of the muscles of the body-wall, such
                    muscles being supported by a skeletal axis which might be itself unsegmented
                    (notochord), or replaced by segmental cartilaginous or bony vertebrae. The
                    studies of embryologists furnished a sound foundation for this conception by
                    demonstrating that in the embryos of <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata</hi> with true
                    vertebrae these structures are preceded by an unsegmented continuous notochord.
                    The inquiry into the structural characteristics of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vertebrata</hi> led further to the recognition of several additional points of
                    structure, the combination of which was present only in the group which had been
                    recognized by Lamarck on superficial grounds. It was found that all <hi
                    rend="italic">Vertebrata</hi> possess laterally-placed passages leading from the
                    pharynx to the exterior, serving in the aquatic forms as the exits for water
                    taken in by the mouth, and provided with vascular branchial processes, whilst in
                    the embryos of the higher air-breathing classes they appear only as temporary
                    structures. It was further established that the great mass of nervous tissue
                    lying dorsally above the spinal column, and known as the cerebro-spinal
                    nerve-centre or brain and spinal cord, is in all cases a tube, and originates as
                    part of the dorsal surface of the embryo, which becomes depressed in the form of
                    a long groove and finally closed in by the adhesion of its opposite edges, thus
                    forming a tube or canal. The three structures,—notochord, gill-slits, and
                    tubular dorsal nerve-cord,—were more than twenty years ago recognized as
                    characterizing, together with the metameric segmentation of the musculature of
                    the body-wall, all <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata</hi> at some one or other period
                    of their existence.</p>
                <p>The establishment by Darwin of the doctrine of organic evolution in 1859 led
                    naturalists consciously to make the attempt to determine the genetic affinities
                    and the probable ancestry of the various groups of animals, and enabled them to
                    recognize in the classifications by “type”, and other such conceptions of
                    earlier systematists, the unconscious striving after genealogical representation
                    of the relationships of organic beings. The question naturally arose in regard
                    to the <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata,</hi> as in regard to other great divisions
                    of the animal kingdom, What were the characters of the earliest forms, the
                    ancestors of those now living? Then came the further questions as to whether any
                    surviving <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata</hi> closely resemble the ancestral form,
                    and whether any animals are still in existence which retain the general
                    characters of those primeval forms which were the common ancestors at once of
                    Vertebrates and of other large and equally well-marked phyla or branches of the
                    animal kingdom, such as the Molluscs, the , &amp;c. This fascinating subject of
                    inquiry received its most important impulse from the embryological
                    investigations of the Russian naturalist Kowalewsky, and has been for nearly a
                    quarter of a century the fertile source of speculation and its indispensable
                    accompaniments, new observation and research. Kowalewsky published in 1866 an
                    account of the embryology of the lowest and simplest of then recognized
                    Vertebrates, the lancelet <hi rend="italic">(Amphioxus lanceolatus),</hi> in
                    which he attempted to trace, cell for cell from the fertilized egg-cell, the
                    origin of the characteristic <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n198/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0198-0179"/> Vertebrate organs of this animal (<hi
                    rend="italic">2</hi>). This work alone would not have acquired historic
                    importance, although it is the starting-point of what may be called strict
                    cellular embryology, as compared with the less severely histological works of
                    previous students. But it was accompanied by an account (<hi rend="italic"
                    >3</hi>) of the development of <hi rend="italic">Ascidia mamillata,</hi> one of
                    the so-called Tunicate Molluscs, in which it was demonstrated by Kowalewsky, not
                    only that this supposed Mollusc possesses when first hatched from its
                    egg-envelope a notochord, pharyngeal gill-slits, and a tubular dorsal nerve-cord
                    and brain, but that these three characteristically Vertebrate features of
                    organization originate from the same cell-layers of the embryo, and in
                    essentially the same way as in <hi rend="italic">Amphioxus,</hi> whilst the
                    cell-layers themselves originate from the egg-cell in the two animals by
                    precisely similar movements of cell division and invagination (see figs. 1 and
                    2). Kowalewsky’s discoveries established once for all that the Ascidian tadpole
                    is identical in three very special and distinct features of structure with the
                    frog’s tadpole. No classification which pretended to set forth the genetic
                    affinities of animals could henceforth separate the Ascidian from the <hi
                    rend="italic">Vertebrata,</hi> and with it the Ascidian brought the whole series
                    of <hi rend="italic">Tunicata.</hi></p>
                <p>The admission of <hi rend="italic">Tunicata</hi> as a group of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vertebrata</hi> was proposed by the present writer as long ago as 1877 (<hi
                    rend="italic">4</hi>); but it required the intermediate proposition by Balfour
                    of a group <hi rend="italic">Chordata,</hi> to comprise the two divisions <hi
                    rend="italic">Tunicata</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata,</hi> in order to
                    render the final admission of <hi rend="italic">Tunicata</hi> to their proper
                    association with the <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata</hi> of Cuvier palatable to
                    systematists. As an objection to the simple inclusion of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tunicata</hi> in the great phylum <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata</hi> it has been
                    urged that <hi rend="italic">Tunicata</hi> do not possess vertebrae,—a
                    proposition which is equally true of <hi rend="italic">Amphioxus</hi> and of
                    some Fishes. Shifting the objection, some writers have maintained that the
                    vertebration of the <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata</hi> may be understood as
                    having reference to the segmentation of the muscles of the body-wall, which is
                    exhibited by all Cuvier’s <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata</hi> without exception,
                    inclusive of <hi rend="italic">Amphioxus,</hi> though not by <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tunicata.</hi> To this it may be replied that the Ascidian tadpole, and more
                    clearly the free-swimming Tunicate <hi rend="italic">Appendicularia</hi> (see
                    fig. 9), do exhibit a segmentation of the muscles of the hinder part of the
                    body-wall similar to and identical with that of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Amphioxus,</hi> whilst no such strict application of a name in its original
                    descriptive sense is desirable in systematic nomenclature. All <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gastropoda</hi> (it has been pointed out) are not gastropodous; all <hi
                    rend="italic">Arthropoda</hi> are not arthropodous; and many <hi rend="italic"
                    >Echinoderma</hi> are not echinodermous. It is, in the present writer’s opinion,
                    better to retain an historic and familiar name for the great branch of the
                    animal pedigree to which it has become necessary to admit forms whose affinities
                    therewith were at one time unsuspected rather than to sacrifice historical
                    significance to a futile striving after etymological accuracy.</p>
                <p>The admission of <hi rend="italic">Tunicata</hi> to association with Cuvier’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Vertebrata</hi> has been followed by a further innovation. The
                    remarkable marine worm <hi rend="italic">Balanoglossus—</hi> originally
                    described by Della Chiaje at the end of the 18th century— was shown in 1866 by
                    Kowalewsky (<hi rend="italic">5)</hi> to possess a series of pharyngeal
                    gill-slits similar to those of <hi rend="italic">Tunicata</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Amphioxus.</hi> Later researches by Bateson (ό) have demonstrated
                    that <hi rend="italic">Balanoglossus</hi> develops in embryonic life a short
                    notochord, whilst its nerve-cord is, in part at least, tubular, and similar in
                    position and relations to the median <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n199/mode/1up"

                    nerve-tube of <hi rend="italic">Tunicata</hi> and the other <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vertebrata</hi> is formed. Hence it seems impossible to exclude <hi
                    rend="italic">Balanoglossus</hi> from a place in the phylum <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vertebrata.</hi> The possession of pharyngeal gill-slits alone might not
                    justify the association; but, when this is combined with the presence of the
                    notochord, though rudimentary and with a special condition and position of the
                    main nerve-centre, it becomes impossible to ignore <hi rend="italic"
                    >Balanoglossus</hi> in our conception of the Vertebrate phylum. The recent
                    discoveries of Harmer (<hi rend="italic">7</hi>) with regard to <hi
                    rend="italic">Cephalodiscus</hi> will hereafter render it necessary to associate
                    that form, and in all probability <hi rend="italic">Rhabdopleura</hi> also, with
                    <hi rend="italic">Balanoglossus</hi> in the Vertebrate phylum. The further
                    consequences of such an association in regard especially to the affinities of
                    <hi rend="italic">Polyzoa</hi> and of <hi rend="italic">Gephyraea</hi> open up a
                    large field of speculation and of consequent embryological and anatomical
                    research.</p>
                <p>The Cuvierian <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata, Amphioxus, Tunicata,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Balanoglossus</hi> being thus indisputably connected by a
                    remarkable combination of structural points, which admit of no explanation
                    consistent with the principles of evolutional morphology except that of the
                    genetic relationship of the forms thus enumerated, we are at once confronted by
                    those questions as to the ancestral history of <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata</hi>
                    which have been already mentioned above as stimulated by Kowalewsky’s
                    discoveries. Undoubtedly <hi rend="italic">Amphioxus</hi> is lower and simpler
                    in structure than any Fish, <hi rend="italic">Tunicata</hi> as low as or lower
                    than <hi rend="italic">Amphioxus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Balanoglossus,</hi>
                    in some respects, more archaic than either <hi rend="italic">Amphioxus</hi> or
                    the Ascidian tadpole. The first tendency arising from the discovery of the
                    affinities of these simpler forms with the Cuvierian <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vertebrata</hi> was to see in them the representatives of the ancestors of all
                    <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata. Amphioxus</hi> has been pointed to by authorities
                    in morphology as the living presentation of our common Vertebrate ancestor; a
                    similar position corresponding to an earlier stage of development has been
                    admitted by no less an authority than Darwin for the Ascidian. It appears,
                    nevertheless, that all such simple solutions of the problem of Vertebrate
                    ancestry are without warrant. They arise from a very common tendency of the
                    mind, against which the naturalist has to guard himself,—a tendency which finds
                    expression in the very widespread notion that the existing anthropoid apes, and
                    more especially the gorilla, must be looked upon as the ancestors of mankind, if
                    once the doctrine of the descent of man from ape-like forefathers is admitted. A
                    little reflexion suffices to show that any given living form, such as the
                    gorilla, cannot possibly be the ancestral form from which man was derived, since
                    <hi rend="italic">ex hypothesi</hi> that ancestral form underwent modification
                    and development, and in so doing ceased to exist. The same considerations apply
                    to the question of the ancestry of <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata.</hi> Probably
                    no existing low form of Vertebrate <hi rend="italic">closely</hi> represents the
                    ancestral form by the modification of which higher forms have been developed. We
                    have no justification for assuming that such low forms do more than present to
                    us a collateral branch of the family, and that collateral branch must, in all
                    probability, have experienced its own special series of modifications of
                    structure. Not only this, but we have no sufficient ground for assuming that,
                    even in respect of the simplicity of their structure, any given animal forms at
                    present existing exhibit a mere survival of a corresponding degree of simplicity
                    in their remote ancestors. Such an assumption was almost universally made, until
                    a more correct view was pressed on the attention of naturalists by Dr Anton
                    Dohrn, the founder of the zoological station of Naples (<hi rend="italic"
                    >8</hi>). So far from its being the case that simplicity of organization
                    necessarily implies the continuous hereditary transmission of a low stage of
                    structural development from remote ancestors, there are numerous instances in
                    which it is certain that the existing simplicity of structure is due to a
                    process of degeneration, and that an existing form of simple structure is thus
                    descended from ancestors of far higher complexity of organization than itself.
                    Such are various parasitic worms and <hi rend="italic">Crustacea.</hi> The
                    evidence in favour of the occurrence of progressive simplification of structure
                    or degeneration, in place of progressive elaboration, depends (1) upon the
                    comparison of the adult structure of the degenerate organism with that of its
                    nearest allies, by which it is often rendered clear that the <hi rend="italic"
                    >ensemble</hi> of the organization of the simpler organism cannot be explained
                    on the hypothesis that it represents an ancestral or archaic condition common to
                    it and its more elaborate congeners, and (2) on the direct evidence of
                    individual development or life-history. The latter evidence is conclusive, when
                    we find, as in the case of Cirrhipede Crustaceans and of Ascidian Tunicates,
                    that the embryo on its way to the adult condition passes through-stages of
                    development presenting a higher degree of organization than that ultimately
                    reached, so that, as in the Cirrhipede larva and the Ascidian tadpole, the young
                    form resembles allied organisms of a higher stage of development, and
                    subsequently degenerates from the point of progressive elaboration to which it
                    had attained, and becomes greatly simplified in the final stage of its growth.
                    Conclusive as such evidence is, there is no law of development which
                    necessitates its preservation. If it be an advantage to the organism, the full
                    force of heredity has play, and what are called the “recapitulative phases” of
                    ancestral development are passed through by the individual in the course of
                    development from the egg. But with remorseless thoroughness all such hereditary
                    tendencies may be removed when such removal is an advantage to the organism, and
                    the development from the egg <hi rend="italic">may</hi> proceed directly to the
                    adult degenerate form. Such is the case with many <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tunicata,</hi> the young of which never exhibit notochord and tadpole form;
                    indeed, were it not for the preservation of a few exceptional cases, like that
                    of the Ascidian section of the group, we should have no direct evidence of the
                    degeneration of <hi rend="italic">Tunicata</hi> from tadpole-like ancestry.</p>
                <p>The general result of the considerations which have been urged with regard to
                    degeneration is this, that it is <hi rend="italic">prima facie</hi> as
                    legitimate an hypothesis, that any existing animal has developed by progressive
                    simplification from more elaborate ancestors, as it is that such an animal has
                    developed by a continuous and unbroken progress in elaboration from simpler
                    ancestors; and we are specially called upon to apply the hypothesis of
                    degeneration where the animal under consideration is likely from its mode of
                    life to have undergone that process. Such modes of life, tending to
                    degeneration, are parasitism, sessile or adherent habit, burrowing in the
                    sea-bottom, and diffuse feeding. The animal which pursues living prey, and
                    contends with other organisms for the dominion of the regions of earth and water
                    that are flooded with light and richly supplied with oxygen gas, is the animal
                    which represents the outcome of a longer or shorter period of progressive
                    elaboration. It is worth while noting in parenthesis that in all cases the
                    “whirligig of time” has probably brought its revenges, and that the ancestry of
                    a form evolved through a long period of progressive elaboration was at an
                    antecedent period subject to simplification and degeneration, whilst in the past
                    records of the present exemplars of the latter process there must certainly have
                    been long stretches of continuous elaboration.</p>
                <p>Applying these considerations to the construction of the genealogical tree of <hi
                    rend="italic">Vertebrata,</hi> we find that the task is by no means simplified.
                    We cannot with the earliest evolutionists adopt a scale or ladder-like series,
                    placing the <pb break="no"

                    rend="italic">; nor</hi> can we be satisfied with a tree-like arrangement, in
                    which the forms at the ends of the branches are always more elaborate than those
                    nearer the trunk. Our genealogical tree will more strictly conform to that of a
                    parvenu human family, if we take worldly prosperity in the latter case as
                    corresponding to elaboration of structure in the former. The strict family
                    genealogist will include in the successive ramifications of the tree the five
                    sons of the founder of the family, one of whom remained an agricultural
                    labourer, whilst two became brewers and two emigrated. The cousins in the next
                    generation will be set forth in place, the sons of one brewer becoming paupers,
                    whilst those of the other advance to the position of Government employes, and
                    one to the peerage. Thus in successive branchings of the family history there
                    may be alternate progress and degeneration. And so it must be in the
                    genealogical trees constructed by the naturalist: the fact that a branch is
                    later in origin will not imply that it is higher in elaboration than those below
                    it, and accordingly we must not expect to draw our tree so as to be able to
                    trace all simpler forms to lower off-sets of the tree.</p>
                <p>The structural features of those animals which must be admitted to the Vertebrate
                    phylum in consequence of possessing notochord, pharyngeal gill-slits, and dorsal
                    nerveplate, tubular or unrolled, are such as enable us very readily to group
                    them in four great divisions, which appear to be equally distinct from one
                    another. As to what may be the genetic relations to one another of these four
                    groups we will inquire subsequently; for the present we term these groups
                    “branches.” They are as follows :—</p>

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata</hi> thus limited may be defined as Ccelomate
                    <hi rend="italic">Enterozoa (Metazoa)</hi> with well-developed coelom. In all,
                    with the exception of the more degenerate members of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Urochorda,</hi> an elastic skeletal rod—the notochord—is developed dorsally by
                    an outgrowth of cells forming the wall of the primitive archenteron; the
                    notochord may or may not persist in adult life. Pharyngeal gill-slits, which may
                    or may not persist in adult life, are developed in all Vertebrates. In all,
                    except in certain <hi rend="italic">Urochorda,</hi> the chief nerve-centre has
                    the form of a dorsal, median, elongate tract, derived from the epiblast, which
                    becomes sunk below the surface and invaginated so as to form a tube. In all
                    there is a tendency to metameric repetition of parts, which may find its
                    expression in a strongly-marked segmentation of the musculature of the body-wall
                    and its skeleton, or may be recognizable only in a limited degree, as exhibited
                    by the successive gill-slits or successive gonads.</p>
                <p>We shall now examine the distinctive features of each of these large groups, and
                    form an estimate of their relations to one another, and of their probable
                    ancestry, this being the task to which we must limit ourselves in the brief
                    space here afforded.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The Craniata.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Craniata</hi> are <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata</hi> in
                    which the tubular cerebro-spinal nerve-mass is swollen anteriorly to form a
                    brain, consisting primarily of three successive vesicles, in connexion with the
                    anterior of which the special nerves of the olfactory organs and of the eyes
                    originate. The notochord, whilst extending posteriorly to the extremity of the
                    body, does not reach quite so far forward anteriorly as the termination of the
                    nerve-tube. A cartilaginous cranium or brain-case develops round the anterior
                    extremity of the nerve-cord, and rises up laterally so as to enclose and protect
                    the brain (hence <hi rend="italic">Craniata).</hi> Cartilage is developed in
                    other parts of the body as a skeletal substance, though it may be subsequently
                    replaced in the cranium, as elsewhere, by bone. The longitudinal muscles of the
                    body-wall are divided by transverse fibrous septa into a series of segments,
                    varying in the adult from ten to one hundred or more in number. Cartilaginous
                    neural arches, corresponding in number and position to the fibrous septa, and
                    resting on the notochord, are developed so as to protect the nerve-cord.
                    Cartilaginous bars also pass outwards, with a direction at first horizontal and
                    then ventral, from the sides of the notochord into the intermuscular fibrous
                    septa. Very generally, but not always, a tubular cartilaginous sheath forms
                    round the notochord; this sheath with rare exceptions becomes segmented to form
                    a series of vertebral bodies, which lie in the planes of the fibrous
                    intersegmental septa, and, increasing in thickness by encroaching upon the
                    substance of the notochord, finally obliterate it almost entirely.</p>
                <p>The pharyngeal slits follow closely upon the mouth, and in existing <hi
                    rend="italic">Craniata</hi> never number more than eight pairs (see fig. 3).
                    They are separated from one another and their apertures strengthened by a series
                    of cartilaginous hoops, the first of which, that between the mouth and the first
                    gill-slit, forms the primitive upper and lower jaw in all but the small and
                    degenerate group <hi rend="italic">Cyclostoma.</hi> The gill-slits when
                    functional are generally protected by an opercular fold of the body-wall, which
                    overhangs them and corresponds to the epipleural fold of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Amphioxus,</hi> the collar of <hi rend="italic">Balanoglossus,</hi> and
                    doubtfully to the wall of the atrial chamber of <hi rend="italic"

                    of the body (between the pharyngeal region and the anus) acquired in ancestral

                    lateral fin (see fig. 4). At the same time a continuous median fin, corre
                    sponding to the dorsal, caudal, and anal fins of existing Fishes, was developed.
                    In both lateral and median fins a cartilaginous skeleton was developed,
                    consisting of a basal longitudinal bar, supporting a number of rods like the
                    teeth of a comb. The primitive form of fin skeleton is retained in the median
                    fins of some sharks; the primitive lateral fin has in all cases either <pb

                    >(Cyclostoma)</hi> (as has their anterior extension, the operculum, in many
                    cases) or it has become, together with its skeletal elements, concentrated in
                    two regions—forming the pectoral and the pelvic paired appendages or limbs, with
                    their respective girdles.</p>
                <p>The cerebro-spinal nerve-centre and the disposition of the nerves issuing from it
                    present a remarkable complexity, and at the same time uniformity, of structure
                    in all <hi rend="italic">Craniata</hi> (see fig. 5). The foremost of the three
                    primary cerebral vesicles gives rise to paired anterior outgrowths, the
                    prosencephala, to a median dorsal outgrowth, the stalk of the pineal eye
                    (rudimentary in all existing <hi rend="italic">Craniata),</hi> and to a median
                    ventral outgrowth, which is met by an invagination of the epidermis of the oral
                    cavity forming the pituitary body, further, to a pair of lateral outgrowths,
                    which become the right and left optic nerves and retinae respectively. The
                    modifications of the hindmost of the three primary vesicles are also extremely
                    definite and persistent throughout the group: its anterior dorsal surface
                    enlarges and becomes the cerebellum (the metencephalon), whilst the cavity of
                    its hinder part (the medulla oblongata or the epencephalon) becomes
                    comparatively wide, and is covered dorsally by a thin membrane only, in which
                    nervous tissue does not take a part. The intermediate primary cerebral vesicle
                    (the mesencephalon) does not give rise to outgrowths.</p>
                <p>In all <hi rend="italic">Craniata</hi> nerves are given off from the
                    cerebro-spinal cord or tube with great regularity, one right and left in each
                    successive myomere or segment of the body-wall. Each nerve has two roots, a
                    dorsal (sensory) and a ventral (motor). A commissure between each successive
                    pair of deep or intestinal branches of the spinal nerves forms the so-called
                    sympathetic nerve-cords, one on each side of the vertebral column. Nerves
                    similar to the spinal nerves, but not identical with them, are given off from
                    the brain, and perforate the cranial box right and left. In all <hi
                    rend="italic">Craniata</hi> there are ten pairs of nerves which originate thus,
                    and in the higher forms two more pairs (elsewhere spinal) are included amongst
                    those which thus perforate the cranium (spinal accessory and hypoglossal). The
                    order and character of the cranial nerves are the same in all <hi rend="italic"
                    >Craniata.</hi> The first (olfactory) and the second (optic) are unlike spinal
                    nerves in both distribution and origin. As we pass backwards along the series,
                    the cranial nerves are found to resemble more and more the ordinary spinal
                    nerves. Hence it has been inferred that the cranial region consisted at one time
                    of a number of distinct myomeres (as many as nine), which have become fused and
                    modified to form the typical craniate “head.” The oculo-motor or 3d nerve
                    indicates the first of these segments, the trochlear or 4th nerve the second,
                    the abducens or 6th the third, the facial and auditory (7th and 8th) the fourth,
                    the glosso-pharyngeal or 9th the fifth, and the vagus or 10th, with certain of
                    its branches supposed to have been originally distinct nerves, the sixth,
                    seventh, eighth, and ninth. It is probable that in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Craniata</hi> the metamerism of the gill-slits does not correspond to the
                    metamerism of the body-wall. The mouth and each successive gill-slit are related
                    to a bifurcate branch of a cranial nerve (furcal nerve) in lower <hi
                    rend="italic">Craniata</hi> (see fig. 3); these furcal nerves do not correspond,
                    so far as we can at present judge, with cranial myomeres.</p>
                <p>The lateral pair of eyes (as opposed to the rudimentary pineal or parietal eye)
                    present a striking uniformity of origin and structure throughout <hi
                    rend="italic">Craniata.</hi> Not only are they uniformly developed from three
                    elements, viz., the retinal cup which grows out from the anterior of the primary
                    cerebral vesicles, the epidermal lens which grows inwards from the surface of
                    the skin, and the connective tissue between these two, but we find that the
                    muscles attached to the eyeball are identical throughout the series: that is,
                    the superior, inferior, and internal rectus, and the inferior oblique muscles
                    represent the first cranial myomere, the superior oblique represent the second,
                    and the external rectus represent the third cranial myomere.</p>
                <p>The olfactory sacs are paired in all except <hi rend="italic">Cyclostoma,</hi> in
                    which they are represented by a single sac which may or may not be archaic in
                    its azygos character. The auditory sacs are paired organs which develop as
                    invaginations from the surface,—the orifice of invagination closing up,—at the
                    hinder part of the cranial region. They present a gradually increasing
                    complexity of form as we pass from aquatic to terrestrial forms, but are
                    identical in essential structure throughout.</p>
                <p>All <hi rend="italic">Craniata,</hi> except some Fishes, possess a muscular
                    process on the floor of the oral cavity which may carry teeth, or act as a
                    licking organ, or assist in suction. This is the tongue.</p>
                <p>All <hi rend="italic">Craniata,</hi> with degradational exceptions, possess an
                    outgrowth, single or paired, of the post-pharyngeal region of the alimentary
                    canal, which is filled with gas. In many Fishes this becomes shut off from the
                    gut; in others it remains in communication with the gut by an open duct. In
                    Fishes it functions as a hydrostatic apparatus. In terrestrial <hi rend="italic"
                    >Craniata</hi> it is subservient to the gas-exchange of the blood and becomes
                    the lungs.</p>
                <p>All <hi rend="italic">Craniata</hi> have a large and compact liver; and a
                    pancreas is also uniformly present, except in <hi rend="italic">Cyclostoma,</hi>
                    some bony Fishes, and the lower <hi rend="italic">Amphibia.</hi></p>
                <p>All <hi rend="italic">Craniata</hi> have a thick-walled muscular heart, which
                    appears first as an “atrium,” receiving the great veins, attached to a
                    “ventricle” by which the blood received from the atrium is propelled through a
                    number of arteries, right and left, corresponding in number to the pharyngeal
                    gill-slits between which they pass. A praeatrial chamber (the sinus) and an
                    extra-ventricular chamber (the conus) are added to the primitive chambers; but
                    the most important modifications arise in consequence of the development of
                    pulmonary respiration and the gradual separation of the cavities of the heart by
                    median septa into a double series, a right and a left. The plan of the great
                    arteries in all <hi rend="italic">Craniata</hi> is in origin the same, and is
                    determined by the primitive existence of a branchial circulation in the
                    gill-slits, which is obliterated in higher forms. Similarly the plan of the
                    great veins is identical, the primitive posterior vertebral veins of lower <hi
                    rend="italic">Craniata,</hi> though persistent in higher members of the group,
                    having their function gradually usurped by the excessive development of the
                    renal vein, and of renal-portal and ultimately of iliac veins.</p>
                <p>All <hi rend="italic">Craniata</hi> have a lymphatic system or series of channels
                    by which the exudation from the capillary blood-vessels is returned to the
                    vascular system. It includes in its space-system the coelom and a variety of
                    irregular and canalicular spaces in the connective tissues. Masses of spongy
                    tissue (adenoid tissue, lymphatic glands) exist, through which the lymph
                    filters, and there acquires corpuscular elements as well as chemical
                    elaboration. At various points in various <hi rend="italic">Craniata</hi>
                    pulsating or simple communications are established between the lymphatic system
                    and the veins. A special and characteristic communication is established in the
                    spleen, an organ which is found in all <hi rend="italic">Craniata,</hi> either
                    as a single mass or as scattered masses of spongy tissue in which blood-vessels
                    and lymphatics unite.</p>
                <p>The renal organs of <hi rend="italic">Craniata</hi> are primitively a series of
                    nephridia corresponding in number to the myotomes of the mid-region of the body
                    in which they exist. They are connected in the simplest <hi rend="italic"
                    >Craniata</hi> by a right and a left archinephric duct, which appear to be in
                    origin lateral grooves of the epidermal surface. This primitive renal system has
                    been modified in some lower forms <hi rend="italic">(Cyclostoma</hi> and
                    Teleostean Fishes) by the atrophy of its anterior portion. But in all other <hi
                    rend="italic">Craniata</hi> it acquires relations to the gonads or ovary and
                    testes, so that an anterior portion of the archinephros and a corresponding
                    longitudinal tract of the duct become separated to serve as oviduct, a middle
                    portion to serve as sperm-duct, while a posterior portion retains exclusively or
                    shares with the middle portion the function of urinary excretion. The male and
                    female gonads are, with the rarest exceptions, developed in distinct
                    individuals, though the rudiments of the suppressed gonad may in some cases <hi
                    rend="italic">(Amphibia)</hi> be traceable in either sex.</p>
                <p>The group of Craniate <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata</hi> thus anatomically
                    described, whilst retaining the essential unity indicated, presents an immense
                    variety of modifications. The chief modifications are distinctly traceable to
                    and accounted for by mechanical and physiological adaptation to a terrestrial
                    and air-breathing life, as opposed to the earlier aquatic and branchial
                    condition. The existing forms of <hi rend="italic">Craniata</hi> have been
                    arrested at several points, in the progress towards the most extreme adaptation
                    to terrestrial conditions, which is presented by those forms that can not only
                    breath air and live on dry ground but fly habitually in the air. The organs most
                    obviously affected by this progressive adaptation are the skin, the skeleton,
                    especially of the limbs, the pharyngeal gills, and the air-bladder. This fact
                    will appear most clearly in the subjoined classification of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Craniata;</hi> for space does not permit us to pursue further the history of
                    these modifications.</p>

                <p>If we now briefly consider what must have been the common ancestral form from
                    which these <hi rend="italic">Craniata</hi> have proceeded, making use of such
                    internal evidence as their structure affords, we find that we get no further
                    back than such an animal as would fit the description given above, with the
                    exception that we should be warranted in substituting in the ancestor a pair of
                    continuous lateral fins, with comb-like cartilaginous skeleton, in place of the
                    two pairs of fins, or their total defect, seen in living <hi rend="italic"
                    >Craniata.</hi> We get no clear suggestion from the study of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Craniata</hi> themselves as to the meaning of the curious shape of the brain
                    and its outgrowths (though the pineal outgrowth has recently been explained as
                    an eye), nor as to the original genesis of the notochord. We should, however, be
                    justified in representing that region which now corresponds to the hinder part
                    of the skull and brain as more fully developed and segmented, so as to give a
                    series of separate myotomes and perhaps separate nerves corresponding to the
                    several furcal branches of the vagus; and we may very well suppose that the
                    number of pharyngeal gill-slits was larger in the ancestral than in any living
                    form, though it seems improbable that in any true Craniate did each gill-slit
                    correspond to a distinct muscular segment.</p>
                <p>An attempt to go further than this has been made by Dr Anton Dohm by the method
                    of hypothesis and subsequent corroborative inquiry into facts of minute
                    structure and embryological history. Making use of the principle of
                    degeneration, Dohm started with the legitimate hypothesis that the branches of
                    <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata</hi> other than <hi rend="italic">Craniata—</hi>
                    viz., <hi rend="italic">Cephalochorda, Urochorda,</hi> and (though at the time
                    he commenced his work their structure was not fully understood) <hi
                    rend="italic">Hemichorda—</hi> were not to be regarded as permanent records of
                    steps in the evolution of <hi rend="italic">Craniata,</hi> but rather as greatly
                    degenerate offshoots from the ancestors of that group, which could throw but
                    little light on the character of their non - degenerate ancestors. A second
                    fundamental assumption which led Dohm to his position was that the segmentation
                    of the Craniates’ body-wall is a primitive and essential feature in their
                    structure, and becomes more and more fully expressed instead of less developed
                    the further we go back in their ancestry. Dohrn, in fact, assumes that what is
                    called metameric segmentation is a phenomenon of structure which has occurred
                    once only in the history of animal form, and that all segmented animals are
                    genetically related and descended from a common segmented ancestor. Assuming
                    this, he pointed to the existing Chaetopod Worms as most nearly representing at
                    the present day the common ancestor of segmented animals. They have, as he
                    pointed out, a high organization, little inferior to that of the lowest <hi
                    rend="italic">Craniata</hi>; they possess a well - developed coelom,
                    blood-vessels with red blood, a segmental series of nephridia (modified in some
                    as gonaducts), segmental branchiae, and lateral locomotive organs; not a few
                    develop cartilage as a skeletal support; and many show a concentration and
                    fusion of segments to form a complex head, which resembles, so far, that of <hi
                    rend="italic">Craniata.</hi> The ventral in place of the dorsal position of the
                    nerve-cord led Dohm to accept De Blainville’s conception that the dorsal and
                    ventral surfaces are reversed in <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata,</hi> as compared
                    with Annelids, Crustaceans, and Insects, so that the Vertebrate is compared to
                    an Insect walking with its ventral surface upward. This led further to the
                    notion that the mouth of the Chaetopod or Annelid, which penetrates the
                    nerve-cord, or rather passes between its two divaricated lateral constituents in
                    those animals, has in <hi rend="italic">Craniata</hi> disappeared, its place
                    being taken by a new mouth derived from the modification of a pair of
                    gill-slits. The remnant of the old mouth, which should, if the comparison
                    instituted holds good, lie in <hi rend="italic">Craniata</hi> somewhere on the
                    dorsal surface of the cranial region, was sought by Dohm in some of the peculiar
                    and hitherto unexplained median structures of the brain: at one time the fourth
                    ventricle with its deficient roof was suggested as thus to be explained, whilst
                    subsequently the curious median structures,—the pineal and pituitary
                    bodies,—were called in as possibly thus significant.</p>
                <p>Without pursuing further the elaboration of Dohrn’s views, it must be at once
                    noted that, whilst the legitimacy of the assumption of degeneration must be
                    admitted, the second assumption, viz., that metameric segmentation is a
                    character bringing all forms showing it into a special genetic continuity,
                    cannot be accepted.</p>
                <p>The property of repeating units of structure, so as to build up a complex of many
                    similar parts united to form one individual, is a very general one in organic
                    forms, and is exhibited in various conditions by both animals and plants. Its
                    simplest expression is found in cell-structure and the binary division of cells.
                    It shows itself as affecting larger masses of structure in the arborescent
                    colonies of <hi rend="italic">Coelentera,</hi> in the radial or antimeric
                    composition of Echinoderms and of Compound Ascidians, and in the linear or
                    metameric segmentation of Worms, Arthropods, and Vertebrates. There is abundant
                    evidence that this property is a general one, which may assert itself at any
                    period in the history of a group of animals, and does not imply special unity of
                    origin in forms which exhibit it. As pointed out in the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Hydrozoa,</hi> merogenesis —the name applicable to this
                    phenomenon generally—may take an extreme and complete character, leading to the
                    separation and independence of the units of structure produced; in that case it
                    may be termed eumerogenesis. Or the process may be very partial, occurring only
                    during a period of embryonic growth, and subsequently ceasing, so that later
                    growth obscures or obliterates it altogether (dysmerogenesis). There is no
                    ground for assuming that either one of these extremes is fundamental or
                    original. Any mechanical or nutritional condition may lead to merogenesis in an
                    organism in which the tissues have a certain reproductive capacity, or have not
                    acquired final differentiation; and it will depend upon the balance of
                    advantage, determined by natural selection, whether the segmentation (supposing
                    the merogenesis to take the linear form) results in the separation of
                    segment-buds, or in the formation of an annulate body, or leaves traces of its
                    occurrence only in certain tissues and organs. The Cestoid Worms present within
                    the range of a single group almost every grade of eumerogenesis and
                    dysmerogenesis <hi rend="italic">(Caryophyllaeus, Ligula, Taenia).</hi> In the
                    otherwise amero-genetic <hi rend="italic">Mollusca,</hi> Chiton and the pearly
                    Nautilus show dysmerogenesis in certain organs, whilst the Planarian Worms
                    frequently exhibit eumerogenesis in their bud-segmentation (to be compared with
                    that of the Annelid <hi rend="italic">Ctenodrilus</hi> described by Zeppelin, 9)
                    and the elongated Nemertines only slight traces of dysmerogenesis.</p>
                <p>If we deny Dohrn’s assumption with reference to segmentation, we are no longer
                    led in the direction of the Annelids (Chaetopods) in our search for the ancestry
                    of the Craniate <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata.</hi></p>
                <p>The fact that the notochord is the forerunner of the segmented vertebral column,
                    and is itself never segmental, instead of being a difficulty, acquires directive
                    significance. The fact that the nerve tube is dorsal, and not ventral, no longer
                    requires the large assumption that animals have reversed their habitual
                    carriage, but suggests that the Craniates’ ancestor had a dorsal median nerve,
                    which has increased in size and importance so as to become the nerve-tube of
                    existing forms.</p>
                <p>The explanation of the curious structure of the brain will have to be found
                    otherwise than in the assumption of a perforating pharynx,—an assumption which
                    the recent discovery of the true nature of the pineal body has rendered
                    untenable in the latest form advocated by its ingenious author, whose
                    speculations, nevertheless, deserve the fullest recognition as having stimulated
                    inquiry and guided observation.</p>
                <p>Balfour (<hi rend="italic">10</hi>) in 1878 refused to adopt Dohrn’s views, and
                    considered it probable that the dorsal position of the nerve-cord in <hi
                    rend="italic">Vertebrata</hi> could be accounted for, without any assumption of
                    a substitution of a pair of gill-slits for the original mouth, by assuming that
                    primitively the nerve-cord consisted of two lateral cords, as seen at the
                    present time in the Nemertine Worms, and that these cords have coalesced <hi

                    <hi rend="italic">ventrally</hi> to form the Annelid’s ventral nerve-chain.</p>
                <p>The comparison of the Vertebrates’ nervous system with that of the Nemertines had
                    already been made by the present writer, as cited by Hubrecht (<hi rend="italic"
                    >11</hi>) in connexion with the latter’s discovery of a complete sub-epidermal
                    nerve-tunic in those worms. Hubrecht has more recently on two occasions <hi
                    rend="italic">(12</hi> and <hi rend="italic">13</hi>) developed an interesting
                    and important comparison of Nemertine and Vertebrate structure. He has in the
                    first place suggested that the notochord of <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata</hi> is
                    nothing more than a modified survival of the proboscidean sheath of the
                    Nemertines, whilst the oral invagination of the epidermis, in connexion with the
                    hypophysis cerebri of the Vertebrate, may be a last remnant of the proboscis
                    itself. More conclusively he has drawn attention to the median dorsal nerve of
                    Nemertines as corresponding to the Vertebrate cerebro-spinal nervecord, whilst
                    the great lateral nerve-cords of Nemertines, and the lateral ganglia in which
                    they expand anteriorly, are compared to the lateral ganglia of the cephalic
                    region of Craniate <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata</hi> and the nerve of the
                    lateral line (see fig. 6). The comparison is strengthened by the existence of a
                    metameric series of transverse nerves in the Nemertine, which correspond in
                    respect of their metamerism and their connexion with a dorsal median trunk, with
                    the spinal nerves of <hi rend="italic">Craniata.</hi> Hubrecht is careful to
                    insist that he does not regard the Nemertines as representing the direct
                    ancestry of <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata</hi>; but he points out that from the
                    primitive condition of an elongate animal, with a plexiform nerve-tunic, it is
                    readily conceivable that a form was developed in which the nervous tissue was
                    concentrated in three cords,—a median dorsal and two lateral,— and from such a
                    form we can derive the Craniates’ condition by excessive development of the
                    median tract and relatively small development of the lateral cords, whilst the
                    Nemertines’ condition would be attained by the converse process. The tubular
                    condition of the cerebro-spinal nerve-cord of <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata,</hi>
                    it may here be remarked, is now very generally regarded as being in its origin a
                    purely developmental feature. It was primitively separated from the epidermis by
                    delamination and in-sinking, and the mode of formation by invagination of a
                    canal has been substituted in accordance with a general embryological law of
                    growth, which is that bulky structures originating beneath a surface from the
                    cells forming that surface take up their position in embryonic growth by
                    invagination of the parent surface. The tubular form, having thus started, seems
                    to have been utilized during one phase of Vertebrate evolution for the
                    respiration of the nervous tissue, by the introduction through an anterior
                    unclosed pore of a current of water, which escaped by the neuranal canal (as in
                    larval <hi rend="italic">Amphioxus).</hi></p>
                <p>There is a wide gap between any form presenting an approach to a Nemertine Worm
                    and the most simple Craniate Vertebrate which can be imagined still provided
                    with the organization characteristic of all <hi rend="italic">Craniata.</hi> To
                    pass from such a Worm-like animal to a Craniate, we have to account for and
                    introduce, amongst other new developments, (1) a greatly increased metamerism,
                    showing itself in the segmentation of the muscles of the body-wall and in the
                    repetition of the nephridia; (2) the characteristic sense organs; (3) the
                    lateral and median longitudinal folds or continuous fins; (4) the cartilaginous
                    rods and bars of the skeleton; (5) the gill-slits, even if we admit the
                    notochord to be represented by the proboscidean sheath.</p>
                <p>It remains to inquire whether the structure of the other <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vertebrata</hi> throws light on this long hypothetical passage from the simple
                    Worm phase to the elaborate Craniate, or suggests any other ancestry.</p>

                    are <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata</hi> in which there is no anterior dilatation
                    of the nerve-tube to form a brain (see fig. 6) and no specialized skeletal
                    brain-case. The notochord extends from one extremity of the elongate body to the
                    other as a tapering unconstricted rod, passing anteriorly some distance in front
                    of the nerve-cord. The longitudinal muscles of the body-wall are divided by
                    transverse fibrous septa into a series of segments (sixty-two in <hi
                    rend="italic">Amphioxus lanceolatus),</hi> the more anterior of which are in
                    front of the mouth and not in any way fused to form a head or cranial structure.
                    Dense connective tissue (differing but little from cartilage) forms an
                    unsegmented sheath to the notochord and an unbroken neural canal above it, in
                    which the nerve-cord lies. The same tissue forms a series of metamerically
                    repeated fin rays, which support the base of a median fin extending along the
                    entire dorsal surface. The fin is continued ventrally from the caudal extremity
                    as far forward as the anus, but without fin rays. Two lateral up-growths of the
                    body-wall (the epipleura) extend one on either side from the head as far back as
                    the anus. Each of these is divided into three regions,—(1) an anterior, which
                    forms the praeoral hood; (2) a median, which forms the wall of the great
                    branchial chamber, the two folds meeting one another and coalescing in the
                    ventral mid-line, excepting where they leave a posterior median aperture, the
                    atriopore; and (3) the post-atrioporal praeanal ventral fin (extending between
                    atriopore and anus), which is formed by the complete coalescence of the two
                    folds behind the atriopore.</p>

                <p>The originally double character of this part of the ventral fin is indicated by
                    the double series of metameric fin rays which support it. It is probable that
                    these “epipleural” folds of <hi rend="italic">Amphioxus</hi> correspond to the
                    opercular folds and lateral fins of <hi rend="italic">Craniata.</hi> No
                    cartilaginous fin rays are developed in the atrio-pleural (opercular) region of
                    the epipleura; but a longitudinal unsegmented bar of cartilaginous consistency
                    strengthens its side and bounds a lymphholding canal <hi rend="italic">(x</hi>
                    in fig. 8).</p>
                <p>The gill-slits in <hi rend="italic">Amphioxus</hi> are very numerous (one hundred
                    or more), and have no numerical relation to the metameres of the muscular
                    body-wall, though the first few which appear in the embryo correspond at the
                    time to successive myomeres, —a relation which they subsequently lose. The sides
                    of the gill-slits are supported by chitinous (?) bars, and each slit is divided
                    into two equal portions by a longitudinal tongue or bar, which grows out from
                    the dorsal margin of the slit soon after its first formation. The number of
                    gill-slits increases continually throughout the life of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Amphioxus</hi> by the formation of new ones at the posterior border of the
                    pharynx, whilst the myomeres do not increase in number after early embryonic
                    life.</p>
                <p>The nerves given off from the dorsal nerve-cord of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Amphioxus</hi> are of two kinds, —dorsal and ventral. The dorsal nerves
                    correspond in number and position to the myomeres, right and left, except in the
                    most anterior region of the body, where two larger pairs of dorsal nerves are
                    given off from near the extremity of the nervecord, and pass forward, supplying
                    the region which lies in front of the termination of the musculature. The
                    ventral nerves are minute, and are given off numerously, right and left, from
                    the nerve-tube throughout its length. The dorsal and ventral nerves of a single
                    myomere appear to correspond, respectively, to the dorsal and ventral roots of a
                    spinal nerve of a Craniate.</p>
                <p>There is a single olfactory pit in <hi rend="italic">Amphioxus,</hi> which rests
                    upon the left side of the anterior termination of the nerve-cord (see fig. 7,
                    4). Within the cavity of the nerve-cord at the same point a patch of brown
                    pigment is present (eye-spot). There are no representatives of the lateral eyes
                    of <hi rend="italic">Craniata</hi> and no otocysts.</p>
                <p>There is no representative of the Craniates' swim-bladder in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Amphioxus.</hi> A single wide diverticulum of the alimentary canal represents
                    the liver of <hi rend="italic">Craniata</hi>; the pancreas is unrepresented.</p>
                <p>The vascular system is singularly incomplete: large trunks exist, but few
                    branches and no heart, whilst the blood itself is colourless, and communicates
                    (as in <hi rend="italic">Craniata</hi> by the lymphatic “hearts”) with the
                    coelomic fluid at various points. A contractile ventral trunk runs along the
                    lower face of the slit pharynx, and sends vessels right and left up the
                    successive bars; these vessels unite above, as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Craniata,</hi> to form a double " dorsal aorta,” which posteriorly becomes a
                    single vessel. A portal system of veins can be traced in connexion with the
                    hepatic caecum.</p>
                <p>No system of lymphatic vessels, nor lymphatic “glands,” nor a spleen exist; but
                    the coelom, and certain other spaces in the connective tissue, contain
                    coagulable lymph, and correspond to the lymph spaces of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Craniata.</hi></p>
                <p>There is no series of nephridia, nor a renal organ formed by the coalescence of
                    nephridia, nor are gonaducts present. The “brown funnels,” a pair of
                    funnel-shaped tubes discovered by Lankester (<hi rend="italic">14</hi>), place
                    the coelomic space of the opercular (epipleural) downgrowths of the body-wall in
                    communication with the space which these folds enclose. They appear to be
                    identical with the “collarpores” of <hi rend="italic">Balanoglossus,</hi> and it
                    is doubtful whether they represent nephridia.</p>
                <p>In the larval <hi rend="italic">Amphioxus</hi> there is developed from the left
                    anterior coelomic pouch a glandular tube and a sense-organ, which are
                    represented in the adult by the structures marked/ in fig. 8, B. This tube is
                    probably the same thing as the subneural gland of Ascidians and as the
                    proboscidean gland and pore of <hi rend="italic">Balanoglossus.</hi> Quite
                    distinct from the foregoing is a nephridial tube lying on the left side behind
                    the mouth of the larval <hi rend="italic">Amphioxus.</hi> All are probably of
                    the nature of nephridia. In the adult <hi rend="italic">Amphioxus</hi> the
                    nephridial tube is in an atrophied condition, though large and active in a <hi
                    rend="italic">late</hi> larval stage, when the olfactory pit opens into the
                    neural canal. Hatschek <hi rend="italic">(15</hi>) describes this condition in
                    “<hi rend="italic">ausgebildete"</hi> but not in <hi rend="italic">adult</hi>
                    examples.</p>
                <p>The gonads are distinct ovaries and testes; they are developed in distinct male
                    and female individuals in corresponding positions, viz., in that part of the
                    coelom which is carried downwards in the descending right and left outgrowth
                    (epipleura, opercula) of the body-wall, which encloses the atrial or branchial
                    chamber. The gonads are twenty-six pairs in number, corresponding to the 10-36
                    myomeres. They are devoid of ducts, and discharge their products by dehiscence
                    into the atrial chamber, whence they pass to the exterior, either by the
                    atriopore or by entering the pharynx through its slits, when they are ejected by
                    the mouth.</p>
                <p>In many respects <hi rend="italic">Amphioxus,</hi> the only representative of <hi

                    in shallow water, whilst its general build is that of a swimming animal) and the
                    nature of its food (diatoms, &amp;c., carried into the pharynx by ciliary
                    currents) in themselves suggest such a history. The vascular system is elaborate
                    in plan yet incomplete in detail, suggesting an atrophy of its finer branches,
                    which is consistent with the small size of <hi rend="italic">Amphioxus</hi> and
                    the general principle that a complex vascular system can only be developed in an
                    animal which has attained to a certain bulk. The absence of well-developed sense
                    organs and of “cephalization” in an animal which has attained to such
                    elaboration of structure as is shown by the pharynx and atrial chamber, and
                    which has such well-developed muscles to the body-wall, is an inconsistency best
                    explicable by degeneration; so, too, the existence of the elaborate series of
                    fin rays, which are out of proportion to the mechanical requirements of so small
                    a form.</p>
                <p>Degenerate though <hi rend="italic">Amphioxus</hi> must be, the ancestor from
                    which it started on its retrogressive course was probably a long way behind any
                    living Craniate. There is no reason to suppose that this ancestor had a cranium,
                    or that the muscular segments and segmental nerves in its cephalic region were
                    fused and welded. <hi rend="italic">Amphioxus</hi> has probably lost, as
                    compared with that ancestor, lateral eyes and otocysts, nephridia, and, above
                    all, size. The epipleural folds which now form oral hood, branchial opercula,
                    and coalesced ventral fin were probably originally less developed lateral
                    ridges, protecting the gill-slits anteriorly and posteriorly, serving by their
                    undulations to assist in locomotion, whilst the median fin and its rays were
                    large and functional.</p>
                <p>One of the most curious features in the structure of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Amphioxus</hi> is its asymmetry. The anus is on the animal’s right side, the
                    nasal pit upon its left; the myomeres on the two sides of the notochord do not
                    coincide; and the right and left dorsal spinal nerves do not arise <hi
                    rend="italic">vis-à-vis</hi> to one another. There is no conclusive reason for
                    regarding this as an ancestral feature, although the early larval form is as
                    curiously asymmetrical as the adult. <hi rend="italic">Amphioxus</hi> habitually
                    rests upon the sand, lying upon one side of the body, and it is possible that
                    the distortion is related to this habit, as in the case of the Pleuronectid
                    Fishes.</p>
                <p>However we may estimate <hi rend="italic">Amphioxus,</hi> we are not led by it,
                    though its muscular metamerism is so well marked, a single step in the direction
                    of the Annelids, neither are we led directly, it is true, in the direction of
                    <hi rend="italic">Nemertina</hi> in connexion with those points, as to
                    relationship of notochord with proboscis sheath and nerve-cord with median
                    dorsal nerve, insisted on by Hubrecht. But it will be seen below that, by the
                    agreement of <hi rend="italic">Amphioxus</hi> with <hi rend="italic"
                    >Balanoglossus</hi> in the structure of the perforations of the pharynx, in the
                    possession of collar pores, and in the praeoral glandular body, we do arrive at
                    an important connexion with Nemertine-like forms.</p>

                    atriopore. The gill-slits in these larval forms are few in number (one or two
                    pairs), but in many of the aberrant <hi rend="italic">Urochorda</hi> (by far the
                    majority of the group) they become excessively numerous and complicated in
                    structure, and are supported by a chitinous (?) framework, as in <hi
                    rend="italic">Cephalochorda.</hi> It has been suggested that the fenestrated
                    structure of the pharyngeal wall in <hi rend="italic">Tunicata</hi> does not
                    represent a series of gill-slits, but a single pair of slits subdivided. This
                    suggestion is worthy of further consideration.</p>
                <p>The cerebro-spinal nerve-cord is tubular and presents itself as a dilated
                    cerebral vesicle in front of the notochord, and as a narrower part running along
                    the whole length of the notochord.</p>
                <p>Sense organs are present—a single eye with pigment and lens, a single otocyst,
                    and an olfactory pit (<hi rend="italic">Larvalia).</hi> The mouth is dorsal in
                    position in the Ascidian tadpole, but subterminal in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Larvalia.</hi> The pharynx is wide, and is followed by a narrow oesophagus,
                    stomach, and intestine, which does not open ventrally but turns upwards to the
                    anus. The <hi rend="italic">Larvalia</hi> have a rudimentary heart and no
                    vascular system,—a fact connected with their diminu tive size. For the same
                    reason no vascular system develops in the Ascidian tadpole until it has ceased
                    to be locomotive and has entered upon its later development; but in the larger
                    adult <hi rend="italic">Urochorda</hi> a contractile heart and a well-developed
                    vascular system are present.</p>
                <p>No undeniable nephridia are present in <hi rend="italic">Larvalia</hi> nor in the
                    larval Ascidian, and no structure comparable to the collar pores of <hi

                    rend="italic">Amphioxus</hi> is known in them.</p>
                <p>The subneural gland, however, a glandular tube opening anteriorly near the mouth
                    of the pharynx, appears to be identical with the praeoral larval gland of <hi
                    rend="italic">Amphioxus</hi> and the proboscis pore and gland of <hi
                    rend="italic">Balanoglossus.</hi> It is probably to be regarded as a nephridium,
                    and has been compared by Julin and Van Beneden to the pituitary body of <hi
                    rend="italic">Craniata,</hi> with which it corresponds in position and
                    development.</p>
                <p>The gonads of <hi rend="italic">Larvalia</hi> are developed in irregular masses
                    on the walls of the coelom, ovaries and testes in the same individual.</p>
                <p>As above indicated, there is a small section of <hi rend="italic">Urochorda</hi>
                    which retain in adult life the tadpole-like form and the essential Vertebrate
                    organs which are exhibited by the larvae only of other <hi rend="italic"

                    or even so low as, that at which <hi rend="italic">Amphioxus</hi> branched off.
                    The differentiation of trunk and tail by the limitation of the notochord
                    anteriorly is a nearer approach to Craniate structure than that shown by <hi

                    worm-like form, elongate and somewhat flattened from above downwards. In front
                    of the mouth is a long cylindrical proboscis, and behind it a collar, the free
                    margin of which is turned backwards, and corresponds to the opercular epipleural
                    folds of <hi rend="italic">Cephalochorda</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Craniata.</hi> This agreement is supported by the existence of a pair of collar
                    pores opening into the coelom of the collar, as the “brown funnels” of <hi
                    rend="italic">Amphioxus</hi> open into the epipleural coelom of that animal. A
                    proboscis pore, opening on the left side into the praeoral coelom of the
                    proboscis (paired in <hi rend="italic">B. kupfferi),</hi> is exactly
                    representative of the similarly placed pore which in the young <hi rend="italic"
                    >Amphioxus</hi> (according to Hatschek, <hi rend="italic">15</hi>) leads into
                    the tubular organ derived from the left coelomic chamber of the praeoral lobe of
                    that animal. The whole surface of the body is ciliated, as in Nemertines and
                    Echinoderms, and as in no other Vertebrates. Following the collar is a
                    perforated region of the body,—gill-slits opening from the outer surface into
                    the pharynx. In the young form there is for a time, as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ap-pendiculariae</hi> and the Ascidian tadpole, only one pair of gill-slits,
                    but they subsequently increase in number as the animal grows in length. They
                    resemble in form and structure those of <hi rend="italic">Amphioxus.</hi> The
                    notochord (<hi rend="italic">h</hi> in fig. 10) arises at the anterior end of
                    the hypoblast in the young, and grows forward, forming a support for the base of
                    the proboscis. It is limited to this very small region. The cerebro-spinal
                    nerve-cord originates by a delamination of a solid cord of epiblast in the
                    mid-dorsal line of the middle third of the body; then by invagination of its two
                    ends it extends as a tube both anteriorly and posteriorly. A general network of
                    nervefibres (and cells ?) exists beneath the epidermis all over the body. The
                    blood-system is peculiar, consisting of an anterior heart and a dorsal and
                    ventral vessel; these are united by a plexus of subcutaneous vessels. The
                    musculature of the body-wall is not broken into successive myomeres; but, on the
                    other hand, the gonads (ovaries or testes) are sac-like, and, as in <hi
                    rend="italic">Amphioxus,</hi> are repeated in a series throughout a great length
                    of the body. In the pharyngeal region the gonad sacs agree in number with the
                    gill-slits. There are no nephridia (unless proboscis pore and collar pores are
                    to be so regarded); but the connective-tissue cells of the body-cavity are
                    active as excreting agents, as in Echinoderms and in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Urochorda,</hi> and a large glandular organ in the proboscis attached to the
                    end of the notochord appears to have to do with this function. Not the least
                    remarkable fact about <hi rend="italic">Hemichorda</hi> is the nature of their
                    larvae. No other <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata</hi> present larval forms which
                    indicate the nature of the early ancestral history in what we may call
                    prae-chordal times; however interesting the Ascidian larva, or the young <hi
                    rend="italic">Amphioxus,</hi> and the embryo dog-fish, they do not take us out
                    of the Vertebrate area. Some species of <hi rend="italic">Balanoglossus (? B.
                    minutus),</hi> however, pass through a banded ciliate larval condition, which
                    was known as <hi rend="italic">Tornaria,</hi> and was considered to be an
                    Echinoderm larva allied to <hi rend="italic">Bipinnaria,</hi> before its
                    relation to <hi rend="italic">Balanoglossus</hi> was discovered. It is not
                    possible to view the <hi rend="italic">Tornaria</hi> larva of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Balanoglossus</hi> as otherwise than identical with Echinoderm larvae, and it
                    results that <hi rend="italic">Balanoglossus</hi> and the Echinoderms have
                    remote genetic affinities of a special kind.</p>

                <p>It seems that in <hi rend="italic">Balanoglossus</hi> we at last find a form
                    which, though no doubt specialized for its burrowing sand-life, and possibly to
                    some extent degenerate, yet has not to any large extent fallen from an ancestral
                    eminence. The ciliated epidermis, the long Worm-like form, and the complete
                    absence of segmentation of the body-muscles lead us to forms like the
                    Nemertines. The great proboscis of <hi rend="italic">Balanoglossus</hi> may well
                    be compared to the invaginable organ similarly placed in the Nemertines. The
                    collar is the first commencement of a structure destined to assume great
                    importance in <hi rend="italic">Cephalo-chorda</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Craniata,</hi> and perhaps protective of a single gillslit in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Balanoglossus</hi> before the number of those apertures had been extended.
                    Borrowing, as we may, the nephridia from the Nemertines, and the lateral in
                    addition to the dorsal nerve, we find that <hi rend="italic">Balanoglossus</hi>
                    gives the most hopeful hypothetical solution of the pedigree of Vertebrates.
                    Space has not permitted us to go so fully into <hi rend="italic">pros</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">eons</hi> as the speculative nature of the subject requires;
                    but we give the final conclusion to which our consideration of the structure of
                    the four great branches of the <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata</hi> leads in the
