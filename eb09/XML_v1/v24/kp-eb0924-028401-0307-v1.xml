                    (1745-1827), was born at Como on February 18, 1745. In 1774 he was appointed
                    professor of physics in the gymnasium of Como, and in 1777 he left his native
                    town for the first time to travel through Switzerland, where he formed an
                    intimate friendship with De Saussure. In 1779 a chair of physics was founded in
                    Pavia, and Volta was chosen to occupy it. In 1782 he undertook a journey through
                    France, Germany, Holland, and England, and became acquainted with nearly all the
                    scientific celebrities of that day. In 1791 he received the Copley medal of the
                    Royal Society. In 1801 Napoleon called him to Paris, to show his experiments on
                    contact electricity, and a medal was struck in his honour. He was made a senator
                    of the kingdom of Lombardy. In 1815 the emperor of Austria made him director of
                    the philosophical faculty of Padua. In 1819 he retired, and settled down again
                    in his native town. He died on March 5, 1827.</p>
                <p>The first published paper of Volta (<hi rend="italic">De Vi Attractiva Ignis
                    Electrici)</hi> dates from 1769; it contains no new facts, but deserves our
                    attention as showing us the knowledge with which Volta set cut on his journey of
                    discoveries, and the theoretical speculations which seem to have given him the
                    first impulse to experimental work. Franklin, who was then justly considered the
                    great authority on these matters, had endeavoured to explain electrical
                    phenomena by the mutual repulsion of the particles of an electrical substance
                    and the attraction between that electrical substance and ordinary matter. Volta
                    tried to simplify the theory by assuming an action only between the electrical
                    substance and matter, and he tells us that he explained his views in a letter to
                    the Abbé Nollet when he was nineteen years old. The way in which he endeavoured
                    to account for the phenomena of attraction and repulsion and the phenomena of
                    the Leyden jar have no interest for us to-day, but that part of his paper in
                    which he showed the application of his theory to the generation of electricity
                    is of historical importance, for in it we can trace the germ of many future
                    discoveries. He imagines all bodies in the natural state to contain electricity
                    in such proportion that they are in electrical equilibrium. He believes that his
                    experimental results obtained by rubbing metals with each other show this. But
                    when bodies are brought into close contact, as, for instance, in friction,
                    adopting the views of Boscovich, according to which attraction and repulsion
                    alternate at small distances, he considers that the attractions of electricity
                    and matter may alter and a new electrical equilibrium will establish itself. He
                    asks the question whether during the progress of chemical action, such as
                    solution, mixture of fluids, combustion, in which the particles of matter change
                    their position, there is no disturbance of electrical equilibrium. He expresses
                    his conviction that this is the case, and explains the experimental difficulties
                    which prevent a proof, but expresses a hope that he will succeed in obtaining
                    signs of electrical action during chemical operations. He shows how atmospheric
                    electricity might bc accounted for in accordance with these views.</p>
                <p>The principal point of interest in his second paper (<hi rend="italic">Novus ae
                    Simplicissimus Electricorum Tentaminum Apparatus)</hi> is the attempt to explain
                    electrical insulation by a repulsion between the insulating matter and
                    electricity. The influence of Boscovich in this attempt to explain everything by
                    forces and centres of force is here apparent. Theory thus seems to have given
                    Volta the first impulse to his electrical inquiries; but as he went on with his
                    experimental work the firm establishment of facts took the first place in his
                    mind, and after the first two papers we find hardly anything speculative in his
                    writings.</p>
                <p>On June 10, 1775, Volta announced tho construction of the electrophorus in a
                    letter to Priestley, asking him, as the historian of electricity, how far the
                    discovery was new. The remainder of the year seems to have been taken up with
                    improvements in the mechanical construction of the apparatus. A letter to De
                    Saussure in 1778 treats of the electrostatic capacity of conductors. Although we
                    now know that Cavendish had treated the same subject in a much more complete
                    way, the researches of Cavendish have only recently been published, and Volta’s
                    experiments are a great advance on anything that had been published at the time.
                    The construction of the condenser, and its applications to the study of
                    electrical phenomena, were first published in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philosophical Transactions</hi> (1782). By means of the delicate apparatus at
                    his disposal he returned to the ideas announced in his first paper, and tried to
                    discover signs of electricity during the processes of evaporation and
                    ebullition, and during changes of temperature; after repeated failure he at last
                    believed himself to have succeeded in obtaining electrical effects during the
                    evaporation of water. The first successful experiments were made in Paris in the
                    presence of Lavoisier and Laplace.</p>
                <p>We know now that evaporation by itself does not cause a difference in electric
                    potential, and that Volta’s effect was due to friction of the vapour generated
                    against the sides of the vessel; but this has only been established quite
                    recently.</p>
                <p>The results on electrical effects due to evaporation led Volta to the closer
                    investigation of the phenomena of atmospheric electricity, a subject which seems
                    always to have had a special attraction for him. Between 1788 and 1790 he wrote
                    nine letters on <hi rend="italic">Meteorologia Elettrica</hi> addressed to
                    Lichtenberg. The first two letters treat of electrical measurements. For the
                    pith ball electroscope he substitutes the straw electrometer, in which the angle
                    of divergence of two electrified straws is measured. Different electrometers of
                    various sensitiveness are carefully graduated and compared with each other. Nor
                    is this all: Volta has never as yet received the credit of having constructed
                    the first absolute electrometer, and for having compared his other instruments
                    with it, so that it would be possible now to refer all his measurements to
                    absolute units. His electrometer consisted of a balance, one pane of which was a
                    flat round disk. Below this disk was placed a larger parallel plate, conducted
                    away to earth, and stops were arranged so that the disk could not approach the
                    plate nearer than 2 inches. In the unelectrified state the balance was in a
                    state of equilibrium. When the disk is electrified it is attracted towards the
                    plate but kept at its proper distance by the stops; weights are then added in
                    the other plate of the balance until the disk is torn away from the stops.</p>
                <p>The remaining letters addressed to Lichtenberg contain observations on
                    atmospheric electricity and on the action of points and flames in discharging
                    electricity. The reader cannot help feeling how very little more we now know
                    about these matters than Volta did.</p>
                <p>It was probably in 1790 that Galvani first made the observations which have
                    rendered him celebrated. He was struck by the muscular contractions of a frog
                    which had recently been killed and skinned, and was lying on a table near an
                    electrical machine, which was accidentally set to work. In order to see whether
                    he could obtain similar contraction from atmospheric electricity, he suspended
                    the thigh of a frog by means of a hook from an iron railing, and found the
                    contraction whenever the muscle touched the railing. He tried to account for the
                    observation by assuming that the nerves and muscles of the animal body formed a
                    kind of Leyden jar, which was discharged whenever an external circuit brought
                    them into electrical contact. Volta at first agreed to this explanation, but his
                    own experiments soon led him to change his opinion. It is very instructive to
                    read the various letters and essays in which Volta describes his observations
                    and his reasoning which gradually led him up to the construction of the
                    electrical pile. His whole experimental training as well as the speculations of
                    his early youth seemed to force him on in the right path, and in this work, as
                    indeed in his whole career, none of the discoveries seems due to chance. The
                    muscle of the frog soon appeared to him to be nothing but a very delicate
                    electrometer, and he made use of it as such. The conductors he divided into two
                    classes. Conductors of the first kind, to which carbon and the metals belong, he
                    showed to become electrified by contact, but in such a way that equilibrium is
                    established in each circuit, so that no current of electricity can be produced
                    by any arrangement containing conductors of this class only. Conductors of the
                    second kind are what we should now call electrolytes. An electric current is
                    produced whenever a circuit is arranged between two conductors of the first kind
                    and one of the second kind. It is impossible here to enter into the history of
                    this now celebrated contact theory, but, although opinions may differ on the
                    interpretation of some of the experiments, there is not much in Volta’s writings
                    on this subject which could be called incorrect even at the present day. Volta’s
                    electric pile was first described in a letter to Sir J. Banks, then president of
                    the Royal Society. The letter is dated March 20, 1800, and it was read before
                    the Society on June 26 of the same year. The pile consisted of a number of disks
                    of tin and an equal number of disks of silver or copper. The zinc and tin plates
                    are in contact, and each pair is separated by some porous matter which is kept
                    moist. He describes a number of experimental results obtained with this pile,
                    and finally shows that all the effects produced are the same as those which can
                    be obtained from electrical machines, and that therefore “galvanism” and
                    “electricity” are identical. Volta lived to see the remarkable development of
                    his science at the hands of Sir Humphry Davy, Oersted, and Ampère, but he was no
                    mathematician, and the subject grew beyond his powers. He recognized this with
                    that frank honesty which is apparent in all his writings, and during the last
                    twenty-five years of his life he published nothing on electrical subjects.</p>
                <p>A complete history of Volta’s writings ought to take in much which must be
                    omitted here. His investigations on gas analysis, and his very interesting paper
                    on the expansion of gases by heat, deserve, however, to be mentioned. He showed
                    the causes which had led different experimenters to such inconsistent results,
                    and established independently what is now known as the law of Charles. (A. S.*)
