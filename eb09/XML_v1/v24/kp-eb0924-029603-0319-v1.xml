                    1230-1298), archbishop of Genoa, is said to have been born at the little village
                    of Varaggio, near Savona, about the year 1230. He entered the order of St
                    Dominic in 1244, and is said to have preached with great success in many parts
                    of Italy, as well as to have taught in the schools of his own fraternity. From
                    the office of prior in 1267 he was raised to be provincial of all Lombardy. This
                    post he held till 1286, when he was removed at the meeting of the order ip
                    Paris. He also represented his own province at the councils of Lucca (1288) and
                    Ferrara (1290). On the last occasion he was one of the four delegates charged
                    with signifying Nicholas IV.’s desire for the deposition of Munio de Zamora, who
                    had been master of the order from 1285, and was deprived of his office by a
                    papal bull dated April 12, 1291. In 1288 Nicholas empowered him to absolve the
                    people of Genoa for their offence in aiding the Sicilians against Charles II.
                    Early in 1292 the same pope, himself a Franciscan, summoned James to Rome,
                    intending to consecrate him archbishop of Genoa with his own hands. James
                    reached Rome on Palm Sunday (March 30), but only to find his patron ill of a
                    deadly sickness, from which he died on Good Friday (April 4). The cardinals,
                    however, “propter honorem Communis Januae,” determined to carry out this
                    consecration on the Sunday after Easter, and thus, to quote his own words, “he
                    returned with joy to his own city, and was reverently received by the people.”
                    If we may trust Echard, he was a model bishop, and especially distinguished
                    himself by his efforts to appease the civil discords of Genoa. His death seems
                    to have taken place in June 1298. He was buried in the Dominican church at
                    Genoa. A story, mentioned by Echard as unworthy of credit, makes Boniface VIII.,
                    on the first day of Lent, cast the ashes in the archbishop’s eyes instead of on
                    his head, with the words, “Remember <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n320/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0320-0297"/> that thou art a Ghibelline, and with thy fellow
                    Ghibellines wilt return to naught.”</p>
                <p>Jacobus de Voragine has left us a list of his own works. Speaking of himself in
                    his <hi rend="italic">Chronicon Januense,</hi> he says, “While he was in his
                    order, and after he had been made archbishop, he wrote many works. For he
                    compiled the legends of the saints (<hi rend="italic">Legendae Sanctorum)</hi>
                    in one volume, adding many things from the <hi rend="italic">Historia Tripartita
                    et Scholastica,</hi> and from the chronicles of many writers.” The other
                    writings he claims are two volumes of “Sermons concerning all the Saints”<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Printed without name or
                    place, 1484.</p></note> whose yearly feasts the church celebrates. Of these
                    volumes, he adds, one is very diffuse, but the other short and concise. Then
                    follow <hi rend="italic">Sermones de Omnibus Evangeliis Domi-nicalibus</hi> for
                    every Sunday in the year; <hi rend="italic">Sermones de Omnibus Evangeliis,
                    i.e.,</hi> a book of discourses on all the Gospels, from Ash Wednesday to the
                    Tuesday after Easter; and a treatise called <hi rend="italic">“Marialis,</hi>
                    qui totus est de B. Maria compositus,” consisting of about 160 discourses on the
                    attributes, titles, &amp;c., of the Virgin Mary. In the same work the archbishop
                    claims to have written his <hi rend="italic">Chronicon Januense</hi> in the
                    second year of his pontificate (1293), but it extends to 1296 or 1297. To this
                    list Echard adds several other works, such as a defence of the Dominicans,
                    printed at Venice in 1504, and a <hi rend="italic">Summa Virtutum et Vitiorum
                    Guillelmi Peraldi,</hi> a Dominican who died about 1250. James is also said to
                    have translated the Old and New Testaments into his own tongue. “But,” adds
                    Echard, “if he did so, the version lies so closely hid that there is no
                    recollection of it.”</p>
                <p>His two chief works are the <hi rend="italic">Chronicon Januense</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Golden Legend</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Lombardica Hystoria.</hi>
                    The former is partly printed in Muratori (<hi rend="italic">Scriptores Rer.
                    Ital.,</hi> ix. 6). It is divided into twelve parts. The first four deal with
                    the mythical history of Genoa from the time of its founder, Janus the first king
                    of Italy, and its enlarger, a second Janus, “citizen of Troy,” till its
                    conversion to Christianity “about twenty-five years after the passion of
                    Christ.” Part v. professes to treat of the beginning, the growth, and the
                    perfection of the city; but of the first period the writer candidly confesses he
                    knows nothing except by hearsay. The second period includes the Genoese
                    crusading exploits in the East, and extends to their victory over the Pisans (c.
                    1130), while the third reaches down to the days of the author’s archbishopric.
                    The sixth part deals with the constitution of the city, the seventh and eighth
                    with the duties of rulers and citizens, the ninth with those of domestic life.
                    The tenth gives the ecclesiastical history of Genoa from the time of its first
                    known bishop, St Valentine, “whom we believe to have lived about 530 A.D.,” till
                    1133, when the city was raised to archiepiscopal rank. The eleventh contains the
                    lives of all the bishops in order, and includes the chief events during their
                    pontificates; while the twelfth deals in the same way with the archbishops, not
                    forgetting the writer himself.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The adjective “golden” has been transferred from this to
                    other works of the author.</p></note></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Golden Legend,</hi> one of the most popular religious works
                    of the Middle Ages, is a collection of the legendary lives of the greater saints
                    of the mediaeval church. The preface divides the ecclesiastical year into four
                    periods corresponding to the various epochs of the world’s history, a time of
                    deviation, of renovation, of reconciliation, and of pilgrimage. The book itself,
                    however, falls into five sections:—(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) from Advent to
                    Christmas (cc. 1-5); (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) from Christmas to Septuagesima
                    (6-30); (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) from Septuagesima to Easter (31-53); (<hi
                    rend="italic">d)</hi> from Easter Day to the octave of Pentecost (54-76); (<hi
                    rend="italic">e</hi>) from the octave of Pentecost to Advent (77-180). The
                    saints’ lives are full of puerile legend, and in not a few cases contain
                    accounts of 13th-century miracles wrought at special places, particularly with
                    reference to the Dominicans. The author is very particular in giving the
                    derivation of proper names, and indeed generally supplies a copious choice of
                    alternatives. He is nearly always careful to assign a yearly date to the saints
                    he treats of, but seldom, if ever, mentions their feast days. As he reaches the
                    great seasons of the year he inserts treatises dealing with their significance
                    and interpretation. These we have for Advent, Christmas, Good Friday, Easter,
                    Whitsunday, &amp;c. The last chapter but one (181) “De Sancto Pelagio Papa,”
                    contains a kind of history of the world from the middle of the 6th century;
                    while the last (182) is a somewhat allegorical disquisition, “De Dedicatione
                    Ecclesiae.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The</hi> Gοlden Legend <hi rend="italic">was translated into
                    French by Jean Belet de Vigny in the 14th century. It was also one of the
                    earliest books to issue from the press. A Latin edition is assigned to about
                    1469; and a dated one was published at Lyons in 1473. Many other Latin editions
                    were printed before the end of tlιe century. A French translation by Master John
                    Bataillier is dated 1476; Jean de Vigny’s appeared at Paris, 1488; an Italian
                    one by Nic. Manerbi (? Venice, 1475); a Bohemian one at Pilsen, 1475-9, and at
                    Prague. 1495; Caxton's English versions, 1483, 1487, and 1493; and a German one
                    in 1489. Several 15th-century editions of the</hi> Sermons <hi rend="italic">are
                    also known, and the</hi> Mariale <hi rend="italic">was printed at Venice in 1497
                    and at Paris in 1503.</hi></p>
