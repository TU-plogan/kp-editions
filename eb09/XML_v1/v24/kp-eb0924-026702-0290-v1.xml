                <p><label type="entry">VIZAGAPATAM</label>, a British district of India, in Madras
                    presidency, lying between 17° 14' 30'' and 18° 58' N. lat. and 82° 19' and 83°
                    59' E. long., with an area of 3477 square miles. Including the Jáipur and
                    Vizianagram zamindaries, which are under British administration, the area is
                    17,380 square miles. Vizagapatam is bounded on the N. by Ganjam district, on the
                    E. by Ganjam and the sea, on the S. by the sea and Godávari district, and on the
                    W. by the Central Provinces. It is a beautiful, picturesque, and hilly country,
                    forming part of the large extent of shore known as the Orissa coast, but for the
                    most part it is unhealthy. The surface of the country is generally undulating,
                    rising towards the interior, and crossed by streams, which are dry except during
                    the rainy season. The main portion is occupied by the Eastern Gháts. The slopes
                    of these mountains are clothed with luxuriant vegetation, amid which rise many
                    tall forest trees, while the bamboo grows profusely in the valleys. The drainage
                    on the east is carried by numerous streams direct to the sea, and that to the
                    west flows into the Godávari through the Indravati or through the Sabari and
                    Sillar rivers. To the west of the range is situated the greater portion of the
                    extensive zamindari of Jáipur, which is for the most part very hilly and jungly.
                    The north and north-west of the district is also mountainous. In the extreme
                    north a remarkable mass of hills, called the Nimgiris, rise to a height of 4972
                    feet, and these are separated by valleys of not more than 1200 feet from the
                    neighbouring ranges of Gháts. The plain along the Bay of Bengal is exceedingly
                    rich and fertile. It is described as a vast sheet of cultivation, green with
                    rice fields and gardens of sugar-cane and tobacco. There are great varieties of

                    prevailing winds being south-easterly. The average annual rainfall at

                    the staple product of the country, and sugar. The cultivation of indigo is also

                    district in 1885-86 was £201,699, of which the land yielded £139,200. There are
                    few industries, the principal being cotton cloths and the beautiful fancy wares
                    of Vizagapatam towns. On the dissolution of the Mughal empire Vizagapatam
                    occupied a portion of the territory known as the Northern Circars, which were
                    ceded to the East India Company by treaty in 1768. On the introduction of the
                    permanent settlement in 1802 it was formed into a separate collectorate, and
                    since then several changes have been made in its administration.</p>
