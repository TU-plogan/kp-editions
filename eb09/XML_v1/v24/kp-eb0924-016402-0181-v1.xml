                <p><label type="entry">VERDUN</label>, a town of France, chef-lieu of an
                    arrondissement in the department of Meuse, an episcopal see, and a first-class
                    fortress, is situated on the Meuse, 174 miles east-north-east of Paris by the
                    railway to Metz, at the junction of the line from Lérouville to Sedan by the
                    Meuse. The enceinte is pierced by four gates; that to the north-east consists of
                    two crenellated towers, and is an interesting specimen of the military
                    architecture of the 15th century. On the left bank of the river is the citadel,
                    on the site of the old abbey of St Vannes (10th century), the remaining
                    buildings of which are used as barracks. On all sides the approaches to the
                    place are guarded by an important line of defensive works, including five
                    redoubts and six forts. From afar can be seen the square towers of the
                    cathedral, the exterior of which still recalls the original building of the 11th
                    century. It was burnt in 1047, and reconsecrated in 1147 by Pope Eugenius III.
                    Some interesting buttresses of the 12th century and a crypt of the 11th are
                    worthy of notice. The three naves of the interior have Gothic vaults, separated
                    by modem arches. The town-hall (17th century) contains a library (22,500
                    volumes) and a museum of art, archaeology, and natural history. One of the
                    public squares has a statue of General Chevert, a native of Verdun. The town is
                    famous for its confectionery, sugar-plums, and liqueurs. In 1881 the population
                    was 15,682 (commune 16,053), and in 1886 17,282 (commune 17,755).</p>
                <p>Verdun (<hi rend="italic">Verodunum),</hi> an important town at the time of the
                    Roman conquest, was made a part of Belgica Prima. It was destroyed during the
                    period of the barbarian invasions, and did not recover till towards the end of
                    the 5th century. Clovis seized the town in 502, and it afterwards belonged to
                    the kingdom of Austrasia. In 843 the famous treaty was signed here by the sons
                    of Louis the Pious (see <hi rend="smallcaps">France,</hi> vol. ix. p. 534, and
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Germany,</hi> vol. x. p. 480). In the 10th century Verdun
                    was definitively conquered by Germany and put under the temporal authority of
                    its bishops. In the 11th century the burghers of the now free and imperial town
                    began a struggle with their bishops, which ended in their obtaining certain
                    rights in the 12th century. In 1553 Henry II. of France took possession of
                    Verdun, which finally became French by the treaty of Westphalia. In 1792, after
