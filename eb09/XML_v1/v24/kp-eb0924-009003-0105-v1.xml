                <p><label type="entry">VARLEY, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label> (1778-1842),
                    water-colour painter, was born at Hackney, London, on 17th August 1778. His
                    father, a man of scientific attainments and tutor in the family of Lord
                    Stanhope, discouraged his leanings towards art, and placed him under a
                    silversmith. But on his parent’s death Varley escaped from this uncongenial
                    employment, and, after working with a portrait painter, engaged himself at the
                    age of sixteen to an architectural draughtsman, who took him on a provincial
                    tour to sketch the principal buildings in the towns they visited. His spare
                    hours were employed in sketching from nature, and in the evenings he was
                    permitted, like Turner and Girtin, to study in the house of Dr Munro. In 1798 he
                    exhibited his first work, a View of Peterborough Cathedral, in the Royal
                    Academy. In 1799 he visited North Wales, and in its wild mountain scenery found
                    the subjects best suited to his brush. He returned to the same district in 1800,
                    and again in 1802, and the impressions then received powerfully influenced the
                    whole course of his art. In 1804 he became a foundation member of the
                    Water-Colour Society, and contributed over forty works to its first exhibition.
                    He had married in the previous year; and, in order to provide for the wants of
                    an increasing family, he was obliged to produce for the dealers much work of a
                    slight and commonplace character. He also taught drawing, and some of his
                    pupils, such as John Linnell and William Hunt, afterwards became celebrated. He
                    was a firm believer in astrology, skilful in casting horoscopes; and some
                    curious instances were related of the truth of his predictions. It was at his
                    house that his friend William Blake sketched his celebrated Visionary Heads.
                    Varley died at London on 17th November 1842.</p>
                <p>Varley’s landscapes are graceful and solemn in feeling, and simple and broad in
                    treatment, being worked with a full brush and pure fresh transparent tints,
                    usually without any admixture of bodycolour. Though his works are rather
                    mannered and conventional, they are well considered and excellent in
                    composition. Some of his earlier water-colours, including his Views of the
                    Thames, were painted upon the spot, and possess greater individuality than his
                    later productions, which are mainly compositions of mountain and lake scenery,
                    produced without direct reference to nature. Among his literary works are <hi

                    Colour and Sketching from Nature,</hi> 1830; <hi rend="italic">A Practical
