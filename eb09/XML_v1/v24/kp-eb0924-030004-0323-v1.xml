                <p><label type="entry">VOW</label>, a solemn undertaking to do something which is
                    held to be acceptable to the Deity. In the antique re ligions mere prayer,
                    without some material expression of homage, was not held to be a complete or
                    normal act of worship <hi rend="italic">(cf.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Sacrifice).</hi> Supplications, therefore, were generally presented to the
                    Deity in connexion with a sacrifice, or, if the moment of need was one at which
                    a ritual offering could not well be presented, the prayer for help was naturally
                    accompanied by a promise to present a gift at a future time. Thus prayer
                    together with a vow is a sort of imperfect act of worship, which has to be
                    completed by the discharge of the vow at the sanctuary. So in Greek the same
                    word <hi rend="italic">εύχή</hi> is equally applicable to the prayer which
                    opened a service of sacrifice and to a vow taken at the commencement of an
                    enterprise or in other time of need. So too the Latin <hi rend="italic"
                    >votum</hi> means both “vow” and “desire.” In the Old Testament, in like manner,
                    it is generally a sacrifice or gift at the sanctuary which is promised in vows,
                    and the word “vow” <hi rend="italic">(néder)</hi> means also “a votive
                    sacrifice,” as distinguished from obligatory sacrifices (piacular offerings and
                    stated festal sacrifices; 1 Sam. i. 21).</p>
                <p>The vows of which we read in the Old Testament and in classical authors are
                    generally conditional on the fulfilment of the petition with which they are
                    coupled. Such vows are made on occasions of special need, or difficulty (Ps.
                    lxvi. 13 <hi rend="italic">sq.·,</hi> Pliny, <hi rend="italic">H. N.,</hi> viii.
                    21 [57], “turn praecipuus votorum locus est cum spei nullus est”), as before a
                    perilous enterprise (Gen. xxviii. 20; Judg. xi. 30). The payment offered may be
                    a victim for the altar, or any other gift which the ritual of the religion
                    acknowledges as acceptable. But, as vows are generally made on extraordinary
                    occasions, the thing promised will often be exceptional in kind or magnitude.
                    The vow of Jephthah (Judg. xi.) is a case in point, and also illustrates by an
                    extreme example the principle that a vow once taken must be fulfilled at any
                    cost. This principle was so far modified in later times, in Israel, that
                    exceptional vows were by law redeemed at a valuation (Lev. xxvii.). Hannah’s
                    vow, devoting her unborn son to the service of the sanctuary (1 Sam. i. 11),
                    would have fallen under this law. Moreover, the law provided that the vow of an
                    unmarried daughter or of a wife might be disallowed by the father or husband
                    respectively (Numb. xxx.). On the other hand, a widow or a divorced woman was
                    free to make what vow she pleased. These provisions are important evidence of
                    the legal position of woman in Hebrew society, and also, <hi rend="italic">ex
                    silentio,</hi> as implying that Hebrew sons (at least after infancy) were not
                    subject to <hi rend="italic">patria potestas</hi> of the Roman kind.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n324/mode/1up"

                <p>Of ordinary vows a common type in antiquity was a promise made in peril by sea,
                    sickness, or other straits, to suspend in a temple a picture or other symbol of
                    the danger against which the Divine aid was implored. This usage passed into
                    Christianity and survives in Catholic countries, where votive pictures and
                    models of eyes, hands, &amp;c., cured in answer to prayer, are still seen in
                    churches. At the council of Lestines (743 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> the
                    use of such models was condemned as a pagan practice.</p>
                <p>In point of obligation, vows were analogous to oaths (Numb. XXX. 2); their
                    sanction was not human but Divine (Deut. xxiii. 21). Thus slackness or fraud in
                    the fulfilment of vows is the mark of an age of declining faith (Mal. i. 14;
                    Hárith, <hi rend="italic">Moall.,</hi> 1. 69 Arnold; Lucian, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Jupiter Trag.,</hi> c. 15; <hi rend="italic">cf.</hi> Eccles. v. 4). Among the
                    Arabs the speedy fulfilment of vows was favoured by a rule of abstinence from
                    certain enjoyments and conveniences <hi rend="italic">(ihrām),</hi> which custom
                    imposed till the vow was fulfilled. This appears to have been the ancient
                    practice of other Semitic nations also; among the Hebrews it survives in the
                    Nazarite vow (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Nazarite),</hi> and probably also in the
                    <hi rend="italic">esār</hi> or <hi rend="italic">issār</hi> (interdict), which
                    is mentioned along with vows in Numb. xxx., and is described in verse 13 as “an
                    oath of abstinence to afflict the soul,”—words which seem to show that fasting
                    is specially contemplated. As there is no ascetic tendency in Hebrew religion,
                    in which fasting and similar observances have not positive religious value, but
                    are only expressions of penitent supplication, it seems reasonable to interpret
                    the oath of abstinence by the aid of the examples in Psalm cxxxii. 2 <hi
                    rend="italic">sq.,</hi> Acts xxiii. 12 <hi rend="italic">(cf.</hi> also 1 Sam.
                    xiv. 24 <hi rend="italic">sq.),</hi> and to understand it, like the Arabian <hi
                    rend="italic">ihram,</hi> as an obligation of abstinence till a positive vow was
                    fulfilled. The detail in the Psalm, “I will not enter my house or rest in my bed
                    till,” &amp;c., has its parallel in Arabia and in Syrian heathenism (Sûr. ii.
                    185—where to enter the house from behind is an evasion of the rule; Lucian, <hi
                    rend="italic">Dea Syr.,</hi> § 55; <hi rend="italic">cf.</hi> Wellhausen, <hi
                    rend="italic">Skizzen,</hi> iii. 117). It is to be observed that in Arabia,
                    where there was little or no development of obligatory ritual sacrifices,
                    offerings were usually votive, and vows were often simple and not conditional
                    promises; so too in Deut. xxiii. 23, Lev. vii. 16, vows are closely associated
                    with free-will offerings. A purpose of sacrifice formed at a distance from a
                    sanctuary naturally found expression in a vow. Occasions of sacrifice are not
                    frequent in nomad life and it may be conjectured that the earliest vows were
                    simply deferred sacrifices, without the element of bargaining with the Divinity
                    which is prominent in later times. The simple vow presupposes that the sanctuary
                    or the customary day of sacrifice is remote; the conditional vow, on the other
                    hand, may often be made at the sanctuary itself, where the Godhead is nearest to
                    man (Gen. xxviii. 20; 1 Sam. i. 11; <hi rend="italic">Iliad,</hi> vii. 93).</p>
                <p>In Christian times vows to present a material gift <hi rend="italic">(vota
                    realia)</hi> have been less important than vows to adopt a certain course of
                    life <hi rend="italic">(vota personalia),</hi> a change which naturally followed
                    from the modification of the idea of sacrifice in Christianity (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Sacrifice).</hi> The personal vows recognized by the Catholic
                    church are of various kinds, covering all manner of actions religiously
                    meritorious <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> pilgrimage or crusading); but the most
                    prominent have been vows of abstinence (fasting, chastity), to which the growth
                    of asceticism gave a positive value. Most important of all is the monastic vow
                    of poverty, chastity, and obedience (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Monachism).</hi>
                    The presupposition of all such vows is that there is a higher life of godliness,
                    which cannot be attained to by Christians at large, and which all are not bound
                    to attempt, although there is merit in consecrating oneself to it. From this
                    point of view it came about in process of time that vows of self-consecration
                    were viewed as necessarily perpetual. To fall back from a purpose of higher life
                    was not at all the same thing as never to have formed such a purpose. Hence, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the vow of chastity, which Cyprian still regards as
                    terminable by marriage in the case of virgins who have not strength to persevere
                    in continence, was declared to be of perpetual obligation as early as the
                    council of Ancyra (314 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.).</hi> On the other hand, the
                    church was careful to guard against the rash assumption of vows, by requiring
                    certain formalities in the act, and by the institution of the noviciate, as a
                    period of probation. The power of the pope to dispense from vows, which appears
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Decretals,</hi> was of later growth. Protestantism,
                    denying the superior merit of the ascetic life, rejects all perpetual vows, and
                    indeed shows little favour to vows of any kind. (w. R. S.)</p>
