                <p><label type="entry">METAL-WORK</label>. Among the many stages in the development
                    of primeval man, none can have been of greater moment in his struggle for
                    existence than the discovery of the metals, and the means of working them. The
                    names generally given to the three prehistoric periods of man’s life on the
                    earth—the Stone, the Bronze, and the Iron age—imply the vast importance of the
                    progressive steps from the flint knife to the bronze celt, and lastly to the
                    keen-edged elastic iron weapon or tool. The length of time during which each of
                    these ages lasted must of course have been different in every country and race
                    in the world. The Digger Indians of South California have even now not
                    progressed beyond the Stone Age; while some of the tribes of Central Africa are
                    acquainted with the use of copper and bronze, though they are unable to smelt or
                    work iron.</p>
                <p>The metals chiefly &lt;ιsed have been gold, silver, copper and tin (the last two
                    generally mixed, forming an alloy called bronze), iron, and lead. The
                    peculiarities of these various metals have naturally marked out each of them for
                    special uses and methods of treatment. The durability and the extraordinary
                    ductility and pliancy of gold, its power of being subdivided, drawn out, or
                    flattened into wire or leaf of almost infinite fineness, have led to its being
                    used for works where great minuteness and delicacy of execution were required;
                    while its beauty and rarity have, for the most part, limited its use to objects
                    of adornment and luxury, as distinct from those of utility. In a lesser degree
                    most of the qualities of gold are shared by silver, and consequently the
                    treatment of these two metals has always been very similar, though the greater
                    abundance of the latter metal has allowed it to be used on a larger scale and
                    for a greater variety of purposes.</p>
                <p>Bronze is an alloy of copper and tin in varying proportions, the proportion of
                    tin being from 8 to 20 per cent. The great fluidity of bronze when melted, the
                    slightness of its contraction on solidifying, together with its density and
                    hardness, make it especially suitable for casting, and allow of its taking the
                    impress of the mould with extreme sharpness and delicacy. In the form of plate
                    it can be tempered and annealed till its elasticity and toughness are much
                    increased, and it can then be formed into almost any shape under the hammer and
                    punch. By other methods of treatment, known to the ancient Egyptians, Greeks,
                    and others, but now forgotten, it could be hardened and formed into knife and
                    razor edges of the utmost keenness. In many specimens of ancient bronze small
                    quantities of silver, lead, and zinc have been found, but their presence is
                    probably accidental.</p>
                <p>In modern times, after the discovery of zinc, an alloy of copper and zinc called
                    brass has been much used, chiefly for the sake of its cheapness as compared with
                    bronze. In beauty, durability, and delicacy of surface it is very inferior to
                    bronze, and, though of some commercial importance, has been of but little use in
                    the production of works of art.</p>
                <p>To some extent copper was used in an almost pure state during mediaeval times,
                    especially from the 12th to the 15th century, mainly for objects of
                    ecclesiastical use, such as pyxes, monstrances, reliquaries, and croziers,
                    partly on account of its softness under the tool, and also because it was
                    slightly easier to apply enamel and gilding to pure copper than to bronze (see
                    fig. 1). In the mediaeval period it was used to some extent in the shape of thin
                    sheeting for roofs, as at St Mark’s, Venice; while during the 16th and 17th
                    centuries it was largely employed for ornamental domestic vessels of various
                    sorts.</p>

                    ><p>Some recent analyses of the iron of prehistoric weapons have brought to
                    light the interesting fact that many of these earliest specimens of iron
                    manufacture contain a considerable percentage of nickel. This special alloy does
                    not occur in any known iron ores, but is invariably found in meteoric iron. It
                    thus appears that iron was manufactured from meteorolites which had fallen to
                    the earth in an almost pure metallic state, possibly long before prehistoric man
                    had learnt how to dig for and smelt iron in any of the forms of ore which are
                    found on this planet.</p></note><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The abundance in which
                    iron is found in so many places, its great strength, its remarkable ductility
                    and malleability in a red-hot state, and the ease with which two heated surfaces
                    of iron can be welded together under the hammer combine to make it specially
                    suitable for works on a large scale where strength with lightness are
                    required—things such as screens, window-grills, ornamental hinges, and the
                    like.</p>
                <p>In its hot plastic state iron can be formed and modelled under the hammer to
                    almost any degree of refinement, while its great strength allows it to be beaten
                    out into leaves and ornaments of almost paper-like thinness and delicacy. With
                    repeated hammering, drawing out, and annealing, it gains much in strength and
                    toughness, and the addition of a very minute quantity of carbon converts <pb

                    hardness. The large employment of cast iron is comparatively modern, in England
                    at least only dating from the 16th century; it is not, however, incapable of
                    artistic treatment if due regard be paid to the necessities of casting, and if
                    no attempt is made to imitate the fine-drawn lightness to which wrought iron so
                    readily lends itself. At the best, however, it is not generally suited for the
                    finest work, as the great contraction of iron in passing from the fluid to the
                    solid state renders the cast somewhat blunt and spiritless.</p>
                <p>Among the Assyrians, Egyptians, and Greeks the use of iron, either cast or
                    wrought, was very limited, bronze being the favourite metal for almost all
                    purposes. The difficulty of smelting the ore was probably one reason for this,
                    as well as the now forgotten skill which enabled bronze to be tempered to a
                    steel-like edge. It had, however, its value, of which a proof occurs in Homer
                    <hi rend="italic">(II.</hi> xxiii.), where a mass of iron is mentioned as being
                    one of the prizes at the funeral games of Patroclus.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Methods of Manipulation in MetalWork.</hi> —Gold, silver, and
                    bronze may be treated in various ways, the chief of which are (1) casting in a
                    mould, and (2) treatment by hammering and punching (French, <hi rend="italic"
                    >repousse).</hi></p>
                <p>The first of these, casting, is chiefly adapted for bronze, or in the case of the
                    more precious metals only if they are used on a very small scale. The reason of
                    this is that a repoussé relief is of much thinner substance than if the same
                    design were cast, even by the most skilful metal-worker, and so a large surface
                    may be produced with a very small expenditure of valuable metal.</p>
                <p>Casting is probably the most primitive method of metal-work.</p>
                <p>This has passed through three stages, the first being represented by solid
                    castings, such as are most celts and other implements of the prehistoric time;
                    the mould was formed of clay, sand, or stone, and the fluid metal was poured in
                    till the hollow was full. The next stage was, in the case of bronze, to
                    introduce an iron core, probably to save needless expenditure of the more
                    valuable metal. The British Museum possesses an interesting Etruscan or Archaic
                    Italian example of this primitive device. It is a bronze statuette from Sessa on
                    the Volturno, about 2 feet high, of a female standing, robed in a closefitting
                    chiton. The presence of the iron core has been made visible by the splitting of
                    the figure, owing to the unequal contraction of the two metals. The forearms,
                    which are extended, have been cast separately and soldered or brazed on to the
                    elbows.</p>
                <p>The third and last stage in the progress of the art of casting was the employment
                    of a core, generally of clay, round which the metal was cast in a mere skin,
                    only thick enough for strength, without waste of metal. The Greeks and Romans
                    attained to the greatest possible skill in this process. Their exact method is
                    not certainly known, but it appears probable that they were acquainted with the
                    process now called <hi rend="italic">à cire</hi><hi rend="italic">perdue—</hi>
                    the same as that employed by the great Italian artists in bronze, and still
                    unimproved upon even at the present day. Cellini, the great Florentine artist of
                    the 16th century, has described it fully in his <hi rend="italic">Trattato della
                    Scultura.</hi> If a statue was to be cast, the figure was first roughly modelled
                    in clay—only rather smaller in all its dimensions than the future bronze; all
                    oyer this a skin of wax was laid, and worked by the sculptor with modelling
                    tools to the required form and finish. A mixture of pounded brick, clay, and
                    ashes was then ground finely in water to the consistence of cream, and
                    successive coats of this mixture were then applied with a brush, till a second
                    skin was formed all over the wax, fitting closely into every line and depression
                    of the modelling. Soft clay was then carefully laid on to strengthen the mould,
                    in considerable thickness, till the whole statue appeared like a shapeless mass
                    of clay, round which iron hoops were bound to hold it all together. The whole
                    was then thoroughly dried, and placed in a hot oven, which baked the clay, both
                    of the core and the outside mould, and melted the wax, which was allowed to run
                    out from small holes made for the purpose. Thus a hollow was left, corresponding
                    to the skin of wax between the core and the mould, the relative positions of
                    which were preserved by various small rods of bronze, which had previously been
                    driven through from the outer mould to the rough core. The mould was now ready,
                    and melted bronze was poured in till the whole space between the core and the
                    outer mould was full. After slowly cooling, the outer mould was broken away from
                    outside the statue, and the inner core as much as possible broken up and raked
                    out through a hole in the foot or some other part of the statue. The projecting
                    rods of bronze were then cut away, and the whole finished by rubbing down and
                    polishing over any roughnesses or defective places. The most skilful sculptors,
                    however, had but little of this after-touching to do, the final modelling and
                    even polish which they had put upon the wax being faithfully reproduced in the
                    bronze casting.</p>
                <p>The further enrichment of the object by enamels and inlay of other metals was
                    practised at a very early period by Assyrian, Egyptian, and Greek metal-workers,
                    as well as by the artists of Persia and mediaeval Europe.</p>
                <p>The second chief process, that of hammered work (Greek, <hi rend="italic"
                    >sphyrelata</hi>; French, <hi rend="italic">repousse),</hi> was probably adopted
                    for bronze-work on a large scale, before the art of forming large castings was
                    discovered. In the most primitive method thin plates of bronze were hammered
                    over a wooden core, rudely cut into the required shape, the core serving the
                    double purpose of giving shape to and strengthening the thin metal.</p>
                <p>A further development in the art of hammered work consisted in laying the metal
                    plate on a soft and elastic bed of cement made of pitch and pounded brick. The
                    design was then beaten into relief from the back with hammers and punches, the
                    pitch bed yielding to the protuberances which were thus formed, and serving to
                    prevent<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n82/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0082-0073"/> the punch from breaking the metal into holes. The
                    pitch was then melted away from the front of the embossed relief, and applied in
                    a similar way to the back, so that the modelling could be completed on the face
                    of the relief, the final touches being given by the graver. This process was
                    chiefly applied by mediaeval artists to the precious metals, but by the
                    Assyrians, Greeks, and other early nations it was largely used for bronze.</p>
                <p>The great gates of Shalmaneser II., 859-824 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> from
                    Balawat, now in the British Museum, are a remarkable example of this sort of
                    work on a large scale, though the treatment of the reliefs is minute and
                    delicate. The “Siris bronzes,” in the same museum, are a most astonishing
                    example of the skill attained by Greek artists in this repoussé work (see
                    Brönsted’s <hi rend="italic">Bronzes of</hi><hi rend="italic">Siris,</hi> 1836).
                    They are a pair of shoulder-pieces from a suit of bronze armour, and each has in
                    very high relief a combat between a Greek warrior and an Amazon. No work of art
                    in metal has probably ever surpassed these little figures for beauty, vigour,
                    and expression, while the skill with which the artist has beaten these high
                    reliefs out of a flat plate of metal appears almost miraculous. The heads of the
                    figures are nearly detached from the ground, their substance is little thicker
                    than paper, and yet in no place has the metal been broken through by the punch.
                    They are probably of the school of Praxiteles, and date from the 4th century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> (see fig. 2).</p>
                <p>Copper and tin have been but little used separately. Copper in its pure State may
                    be worked by the same methods as bronze, but it is inferior to it in hardness,
                    strength, and beauty of surface. Tin is too weak and brittle a metal to be
                    employed alone for any but small objects. Some considerable number of tin
                    drinking-cups and bowls of the Celtic period have been found in Cornwall in the
                    neighbourhood of the celebrated tin and copper mines, which appear to have been
                    worked from a very early period. The existence of these mines was known to the
                    Phoenicians, who carried on a considerable trade in metals with the south-west
                    corner of England and the Scilly Isles —probably the Cassiterides of Pliny and
                    other classical writers.</p>
                <p>The use of lead has been more extended. In sheets it forms the best of all
                    coverings for roofs and even spires. In the Roman and mediaeval periods it was
                    largely used for coffins, which were often richly ornamented with cast work in
                    relief. Though fusible at a very low temperature, and very soft, it has great
                    power of resisting decay from damp or exposure. Its most important use in an
                    artistic form has been in the shape of baptismal fonts, chiefly between the 11th
                    and the 14 th centuries. The superior beauty of colour and durability of old
                    specimens of lead is owing to the natural presence of a small proportion of
                    silver. Modern smelters carefully extract this silver from the lead ore, thereby
                    greatly impairing the durability and beauty of the metal.</p>
                <p>As in almost all the arts, the ancient Egyptians excelled in their metal-work,
                    especially in the use of bronze and the precious metals. These were worked by
                    casting and hammering, and ornamented by inlay, gilding, and enamels with the
                    greatest possible skill.</p>
                <p>From Egypt perhaps was derived the early skill of the Hebrews. Further
                    instruction in the art of metal-working came probably to the Jews from the
                    neighbouring country of Tyre. The description of the great gold lions of
                    Solomon’s throne, and the laver of cast bronze supported on figures of oxen,
                    shows that the artificers of that time had overcome the difficulties of
                    metal-working and founding on a large scale. The Assyrians were perhaps the most
                    remarkable of all ancient nations for the colossal size and splendour of their
                    works in metal; whole circuit walls of great cities, such as Ecbatana, are said
                    to have been covered with metal plates, gilt or silvered.</p>
                <p>Herodotus, Athenaeus, and other Greek and Roman writers have recorded the
                    enormous number of colossal statues and other works of art for which Babylon and
                    Nineveh were so famed. The numerous objects of bronze and other metals brought
                    to light by the excavations of the last forty years in the Tigris and Euphrates
                    valleys, though mostly on a small scale, bear witness to the great skill and
                    artistic power of the people who produced them; while the recent discovery of
                    some bronze statuettes, shown by inscriptions on them to be not later than 2200
                    B.C., proves how early was the development of this branch of art among the
                    people of Assyria.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The MetalWork of Greece.—</hi> The poems of Homer are full of
                    descriptions of elaborate works in bronze, iron, gold, and silver, which, even
                    when full allowance is made for poetic fancy, show clearly enough a very
                    advanced amount of skill in the working and ornamenting of these metals among
                    the Greeks of his time. His description of the shield of Achilles, made of
                    bronze, enriched with bands of figure reliefs in gold, silver, and tin, could
                    hardly have been written by a man who had not some personal acquaintance with
                    works in metal of a very elaborate kind. Again, the accuracy of his descriptions
                    of brazen houses— such as that of Alcinous, <hi rend="italic">Od.</hi> vii.
                    81—is borne witness to by Pausanias’s mention of the bronze temple of Athena
                    Xαλκιoικoς in Sparta, and the bronze chamber dedicated to Myron in 648 B.c., as
                    well as by the discovery of the stains and bronze nails, which show that the

                    two chief methods of working bronze, gold, and silver, it is probable that the
                    hammer process was first practised, at least for statues, among the Greeks, who
                    themselves attributed the invention of the art of hollow casting to Theodorus
                    and Rhoecus, both Samian sculptors, about the middle of the 6th century B.c.
                    Pausanias specially mentions that one of the oldest statues he had ever seen was
                    a large figure of Zeus in Sparta, made of hammered bronze plates riveted
                    together. With increased skill in large castings, and the discovery of the use
                    of cores, by which the fluid bronze was poured into a mere skin-like cavity,
                    hammered or repoussé work (Greek, <hi rend="italic">sphyr</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >elata)</hi> was only used for small objects where lightness was desirable, or
                    for the precious metals in order to avoid large expenditure of metal. The
                    colossal statues of ivory and gold by Phidias were the most notable examples of
                    this use of gold, especially his statue of Athena in the Parthenon, and the one
                    of Zeus at Olympia. The nude parts, such as face and hands, were of ivory, while
                    the armour and drapery were of beaten gold. The comparatively small weight of
                    gold used by Phidias is very remarkable when the great size of the statues is
                    considered.</p>
                <p>A graphic representation of the workshop of a Greek sculptor in bronze is given
                    on a fictile vase now in the Berlin Museum (see Gerhard’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Trinkschalen,</hi> plates xii., xiii.). One man is raking out the fire in a
                    high furnace, while another behind is blowing the bellows. Two others are
                    smoothing the surface of a statue with scraping tools, formed like a strigil. A
                    fourth is beating the arm of an unfinished figure, the head of which lies at the
                    workman’s feet. Perhaps the most important of early Greek works in cast bronze,
                    both from its size and great historical interest, is the bronze pillar (now in
                    the Hippodrome at Constantinople) which was erected to commemorate the victory
                    of the allied Greek states over the Persians at Plataea in 479 B.c. (see
                    Newton’s <hi rend="italic">Travels in the Levant).</hi> It is in the form of
                    three serpents twisted together, and before the heads were broken off was at
                    least 20 feet high. It is cast hollow, all in one piece, and has the names of
                    the allied states engraved on the lower part of the coils. Its size and the
                    beauty of its surface show great technical skill in the founder’s art. On it
                    once stood the gold tripod dedicated to Apollo as a tenth of the spoils. It is
                    described both by Herodotus and Pausanias.</p>
                <p>Marble was comparatively but little used by the earlier Greek sculptors, and even
                    Myron, a rather older man than Phidias, seems to have executed nearly all his
                    most important statues in metal.</p>
                <p>Additional richness was given to Greek bronze-work by gold or silver inlay on
                    lips, eyes, and borders of the dress; one remarkable statuette in the British
                    Museum has eyes inlaid with diamonds, and fret-work inlay in silver on the
                    border of the chiton.</p>
                <p>The mirrors of the Greeks are among the most important specimens of their
                    artistic metal-work. These are bronze disks, one side polished to serve as a
                    reflector, and the back ornamented with engraved outline drawings, often of
                    great beauty (see Gerhard, <hi rend="italic">Etruskische</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Spiegel,</hi> 1843-67).</p>
                <p>The Greek workman, in fact, was incapable of making an ugly thing. Whatever the
                    metal or whatever the object formed, whether armour, personal ornaments, or
                    domestic vessels, the form was always specially adapted to its use, the ornament
                    natural and graceful, so that the commonest water-jar was a delight alike to him
                    who made it and those who used it.</p>
                <p>In metal-work, as in other arts, the Romans were pupils and imitators of the
                    Greeks. Owing to the growth of that spirit of luxury which in time caused the
                    extinction of the Roman empire, a considerable demand arose for magnificent
                    articles of gold and silver plate. The finest specimens of these that still
                    exist are the very beautiful set of silver plate found buried near Hildesheim in
                    1869, now in the Berlin Museum. They consist of drinking vessels, bowls, vases,
                    ladles, and other objects of silver, parcel-gilt, and exquisitely decorated with
                    figures in relief, both cast and repoussé. There are electrotypes of these in
                    the South Kensington Museum.</p>
                <p>When the seat of the empire was changed from Rome to Byzantium, the latter city
                    became the chief centre for the production of artistic metal-work. From
                    Byzantium the special skill in this art was transmitted in the 9th and 10th
                    centuries to the Rhenish provinces of Germany and to Italy, and thence to the
                    whole of Western Europe; in this way the 18th-century smith who wrought the
                    Hampton Court iron gates was the heir to the mechanical skill of the ancient
                    metal-workers of Phoenicia and Greece.</p>
                <p>In that period of extreme degradation into which all the higher arts fell after
                    the destruction of the Roman empire, though true feeling for beauty and
                    knowledge of the subtleties of the human form remained for centuries almost
                    dormant, yet at Byzantium at least there still survived great technical skill
                    and power in the production of all sorts of metal-work. In the age of Justinian
                    (first half of the 6th century) the great church of St Sophia at Constantinople
                    was adorned with an almost incredible amount of wealth and splendour in the form
                    of screens, altars, candlesticks, and other ecclesiastical furniture made of
                    massive gold and silver.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Metal-Work in Italy.—</hi> It was therefore to Byzantium that
                    Italy turned for metal-workers, and especially for goldsmiths, when, in the 6th
                    to the 8th centuries, the basilica of St Peter’s in Rome was enriched with
                    masses of gold and silver for decorations and fittings, the gifts of many donors
                    from Belisarius to Leo III., the mere catalogue of which reads like a tale from
                    the <hi rend="italic">Arabian Nights.</hi> The gorgeous Paia d’Oro, still in St
                    Mark’s at Venice, a gold retable covered with delicate reliefs and enriched with
                    enamels and jewels, was the work of Byzantine artists during the 11th century.
                    This work was in progress for more than a hundred years, and was set in its
                    place in 1106 A.D., though still unfinished (see Bellomo, <hi rend="italic">Paia
                    d</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Oro di S. Marco,</hi> 1847).</p>
                <p>It was, however, especially for the production of bronze doors for churches,
                    ornamented with panels of cast work in high relief, that Italy obtained the
                    services of Byzantine workmen (see Garrucci, <hi rend="italic">Arte
                    Cristiana,</hi> 1872-82). One artist named Staurachios produced many works of
                    this class, some of which still exist, such as the bronze doors of the cathedral
                    at Amalfi, dated 1066 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> Probably by the same
                    artist, though his name was spelled differently, were the bronze d∞rs of San
                    Paolo fuori le Mura, Rome, careful drawings of which exist, though the originals
                    were destroyed in the fire of 1824. Other important examples exist at Ravello
                    (1197), Salerno (1099), Amalfi (1062), Atrani (1087); and doors at Monreale in
                    Sicily and at Trani, signed by an artist named Barisanos (end of the 12th
                    century); the reliefs on these last are remarkable for expression and dignity,
                    in spite of their early rudeness of modelling and ignorance of the human
                    figure.</p>
                <p>Most of these works in bronze were enriched with fine lines inlaid in silver, and
                    in some cases with a kind of niello or enamel. The technical skill of these
                    Byzantine metal-workers was soon acquired by native Italian artists, who
                    produced many important works in bronze similar in style and execution to those
                    of the Byzantine Greeks. Such, for example, are the bronze doors of San Zenone
                    at Verona (unlike the others, of repoussé not cast work); those of the Duomo of
                    Pisa, cast iu 1180 by Bonannus, and of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n84/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0084-0075"/> Duomo of Troia, the last made in the beginning of
                    the 12th century by Oderisius of Benevento. Another artist named Roger of Amalfi
                    worked in the same way; and in the year 1219 the brothers Hubertus and Petrus of
                    Piacenza cast the bronze door for one of the side chapels in San Giovanni in
                    Laterano. One of the most important early specimens of metal-work is the gold
                    and silver altar of Sant’ Ambrogio in Milan. In character of work and design it
                    resembles the Venice Paia d’Oro, but is still earlier in date, being a gift to
                    the church from Archbishop Angilbert II. in 835 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi>
                    (see Du Sommerard, and D’Agincourt, <hi rend="italic">Moyen Âge).</hi> It is
                    signed <hi rend="smallcaps">wolvinivs magister</hi> PHABER; nothing is known of
                    the artist, but he probably belonged to the semi-Byzantine school of the Rhine
                    provinces; according to Dr Rock he was an Anglo-Saxon goldsmith. It is a very
                    sumptuous work, the front of the altar being entirely of gold, with repoussé
                    reliefs and cloisonnée enamels; the back and ends are of silver, with gold
                    ornaments. On the front are figures of Christ and the twelves apostles; the ends
                    and back have reliefs illustrating the life of St Ambrose.</p>
                <p>The most important existing work of art in metal of the 13th century is the great
                    candelabrum now in Milan cathedral. It is of gilt bronze, more than 14 feet
                    high; it has seven branches for candles, and its upright stem is supported on
                    four winged dragons. For delicate and spirited execution, together with refined
                    gracefulness of design, it is unsurpassed by any similar work of art. Every one
                    of the numerous little figures with which it is adorned is worthy of study for
                    the beauty and expression of the face, and the dignified arrangement of the
                    drapery (see fig. 3).</p>
                <p>The semi-conventional open scroll-work of branches and fruit which wind around
                    and frame each figure or group is devised with the most perfect taste and
                    richness of fancy, while each minute part of this great piece of metal-work is
                    finished with all the care that could have been bestowed on the smallest article
                    of gold jewellery. Though something in the grotesque dragons of the base recalls
                    the Byzantine school, yet the beauty of the figures and the keen feeling for
                    graceful curves and folds in the drapery point to a native Italian as being the
                    artist who produced this wonderful work of art. There is a cast in the South
                    Kensington Museum.</p>
                <p>During the 13th and 14th centuries in Italy the widespread influence of Niccolo
                    Pisano and his school encouraged the sculptor to use marble rather than bronze
                    for his work. At this period wrought iron came into general use in the form of
                    screens for .chapels and tombs, and grills for windows. These are mostly of
                    great beauty, and show remarkable skill in the use of the hammer, as well as
                    power in adapting the design to the requirements of the material. Among the
                    finest examples of this sort of work are the screens, round the tombs of the
                    Scala family at Verona, 1350-75,—a sort of net-work of light cusped quatrefoils,
                    each filled up with a small ladder (scala) in allusion to the name of the
                    family. The most elaborate specimen of this wrought work is the screen to the
                    Rinuccini chapel in Santa Croce, Florence, of 1371, in which moulded pillars and
                    window-like tracery have been wrought and modelled by the hammer with
                    extraordinary skill (see Wyatt, <hi rend="italic">Metal-</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Work of Middle Ages).</hi> Of about the same date are the almost equally
                    magnificent screens in Sta Trinita, Florence, and at Siena across the chapel in
                    the Palazzo Pubblico. The main part of most of these screens is filled in with
                    quatre-foils, and at the top is an open frieze formed of plate iron pierced,
                    repoussé, and enriched with engraving.</p>
                <p>In the 14th century great quantities of objects for ecclesiastical use were
                    produced in Italy, some on a large scale, and mostly the works of the best
                    artists of the time.</p>
                <p>The silver altar of the Florence baptistery is one of the chief of these; it was
                    begun in the first half of the 14th century, and not completed till after 1477
                    (see <hi rend="italic">G</hi><hi rend="italic">az. des Beaux Arts,</hi> Jan.
                    1883). A whole series of the greatest artists in metal laboured on it in
                    succession, among whom were Orcagna, Ghiberti, Verrocchio, Ant. Pollajuolo, and
                    many others. It has elaborate reliefs in repoussé work, cast canopies, and
                    minute statuettes, with the further enrichment of translucent coloured enamels.
                    The silver altar and retable of Pistoia cathedral (see fig. 4), and the great
                    shrine at Orvieto, are works of the same class, and of equal importance.</p>
                <p>Whole volumes might be devoted to the magnificent works in bronze produced by the
                    Florentine artists of this century, works such as the baptistery gates by
                    Ghiberti, and the statues of Verrocchio, Donatello, and many others, but these
                    come rather under the head of sculpture.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n85/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0085-0076"/>
                <p>Some very magnificent bronze screens were produced at this time, especially that
                    in Prato cathedral by Simone, brother of Donatello, in 1444-61, and the screen
                    and bronze ornaments of the tomb of Piero and Giovanni dei Medici in San
                    Lorenzo, Florence, by Verrocchio, in 1472.</p>
                <p>At the latter part of the 15th century and the beginning of the 16th the
                    Pollajuoli, Ricci, and other artists devoted much labour and artistic skill to
                    the production of candlesticks and smaller objects of bronze, such as
                    door-knockers, many of which are works of the greatest beauty. The candlesticks
                    in the Certosa near Pavia, and in the cathedrals of Venice and Padua, are the
                    finest examples of these.</p>
                <p>Niccolô Grossi, who worked in wrought iron under the patronage of Lorenzo dei
                    Medici, produced some wonderful specimens of metal-work, such as the
                    candlesticks, lanterns, and rings fixed at intervals round the outside of the
                    great palaces (see fig. 5). The Strozzi palace in Florence and the Palazzo del
                    Magnifico at Siena have fine specimens of these,—the former of wrought iron, the
                    latter in cast bronze.</p>
                <p>At Venice fine work in metal, such as salvers and vases, was being produced, of
                    almost Oriental design, and in some cases the work of resident Arab artificers.
                    In the 16th century Benvenuto Cellini was supreme for skill in the production of
                    enamelled jewellery, plate, and even larger works of sculpture (see Pion’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Ben. Cellini,</hi> 1882), and John of Bologna in the latter part
                    of the same century inherited to some extent the skill and artistic power of the
                    great 15th-century artists. Since that time Italy, like other countries, has
                    produced little metal-work of real value.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Spain.—</hi> From a very early period the metal-workers of
                    Spain have been distinguished for their skill, especially in the use of the
                    precious metals. A very remarkable set of specimens of goldsmith’s work of the
                    7th century are the eleven votive crowns, two crosses, and other objects found
                    in 1858 at Guarrazar, and now preserved at Madrid and in Paris in the Cluny
                    Museum (see Du Sommerard, <hi rend="italic">Musée</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    Cluny,</hi> 1852). Magnificent works in silver, such as shrines, altar crosses,
                    and church vessels of all kinds, were produced in Spain from the 14th to the
                    16th century,— especially a number of sumptuous tabernacles <hi rend="italic"
                    >(custodia)</hi> for the host, magnificent examples of which still exist in the
                    cathedrals of Toledo and Seville. The bronze and wrought iron screens— <hi

                    almost every important church in Spain are very fine examples of metalwork. They
                    generally have moulded rails or ballusters, and rich friezes of pierced and
                    repoussé work, the whole being often thickly plated with silver. The common use
                    of metal for pulpits is a peculiarity of Spain; they are sometimes of bronze, as
                    the pairs in Burgos and Toledo cathedrals, or in wrought iron, like those at
                    Zamora and in the church of San Gil, Burgos. The great candelabrum or <hi
                    rend="italic">tenebrarium</hi> in Seville cathedral is the finest specimen of
                    16th-century metal-work in Spain; it was mainly the work of Bart. Morel in 1562.
                    It is of cast bronze enriched with delicate scroll-work foliage, and with
                    numbers of well-modelled statuettes, the general effect being very rich and
                    graceful. Especially in the art of metalwork Spain was much influenced in the
                    15th and 16th centuries by both Italy and Germany, so that numberless Spanish
                    objects produced at that time owe little or nothing to native designers. At an
                    earlier period Arab and Moorish influence is no less apparent.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">England.—</hi> In Saxon times the English metal-workers,
                    especially of the precious metals, possessed great skill, and appear to have
                    produced shrines, altar-frontals, retables, and other ecclesiastical furniture
                    of considerable size and magnificence.</p>
                <p>Dunstan, archbishop of Canterbury (925-988), like Bernward, bishop of Hildesheim
                    a few years later, and St Eloi of France three centuries earlier, was himself a
                    skilful worker in all kinds of metal. The description of the gold and silver
                    retable given to the high altar of Ely by Abbot Theodwin in the 11th century,
                    shows it to have been a large and elaborate piece of work decorated with many
                    reliefs and figures in the round. In 1241 Henry III. gave the order for the
                    great gold shrine to contain the bones of Edward the Confessor (see W. Burges in
                    <hi rend="italic">Gleanings from Westminster).</hi> It was the work of members
                    of the Otho family, among whom the goldsmith’s and coiner’s crafts appear to
                    have been long hereditary. Countless other important works in the precious
                    metals adorned every abbey and cathedral church in the kingdom.</p>
                <p>In the 13th century the English workers in wrought iron were especially skilful.
                    The grill over the tomb of Queen Eleanor at Westminster, by Thomas de Leghton,
                    made about 1294, is a remarkable example of skill in welding and modelling with
                    the hammer (see fig. 6).</p>
                <p>The rich and graceful iron hinges, made often for small and out-of-the-way
                    country churches, are a large and important class in the list of English wrought
                    iron-work. Those on the refectory door of Merton College, Oxford, are a
                    beautiful and well-preserved example dating from the 14th century.</p>
                <p>More mechanical in execution, though still very rich in effect, is that sort of
                    iron tracery work produced by cutting out patterns in plate, and superimposing
                    one plate over the other, so as to give richness of effect by the shadows
                    produced by these varying planes. The screen by Henry V.’s tomb at Westminster
                    is a good early specimen of this kind of work.</p>
                <p>The screen to Bishop West’s chapel at Ely, and that round Edward IV.’s tomb at
                    Windsor, both made towards the end of the 15th century, are the most magnificent

                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0086-0077"/> English examples of wrought iron, in which every
                    art and feat of skill known to the smith has been brought into play to give
                    variety and richness to the work.</p>
                <p>Much wrought-iron work of great beauty was produced at the beginning of the 18th
                    century, especially under the superintendence of Sir Christopher Wren (see
                    Ebbetts, <hi rend="italic">Iron Work of 17th and</hi> 18^Λ <hi rend="italic"
                    >Centuries,</hi> 1880). Large flowing leaves of acanthus and other plants were
                    beaten out with wonderful spirit and beauty of curve. The gates from Hampton
                    Court are the finest examples of this class of work (see fig. 7).</p>
                <p>From an early period bronze and latten (a variety of brass) were much used in
                    England for the smaller objects both of ecclesiastical and domestic use, but
                    except for tombs and lecterns were but little used on a large scale till the
                    16th century. The full-length recumbent effigies of Henry III. and Queen Eleanor
                    at Westminster, cast in bronze by the “cire perdue” process, and thickly gilt,
                    are equal, if not superior, in artistic beauty to any sculptor’s work of the
                    same period (end of the 13th century) that was produced in Italy or elsewhere.
                    These effigies are the work of an Englishman named William Torel (see <hi
                    rend="italic">Westminster Gleanings).</hi> The gates to Henry VII.’s chapel, and
                    the screen round his tomb at Westminster (see fig. 8), are very elaborate and
                    beautiful examples of “latten” work, showing the greatest technical skill in the
                    founder’s art. In latten also were produced the numerous monumental brasses of
                    which about two thousand still exist in England. Though a few were made in the
                    13 th century, yet it was not till the 14th that they came into general use.
                    They are made of cast plates of brass, with the design worked upon them with the
                    chisel and graver. All those, however, to be seen in English churches are not of
                    native work—great quantities of them being Flemish imports (see Cotman, Waller,
                    and Boutell on Monumental Brasses).</p>
                <p>In addition to its chief use as a roof covering, lead was sometimes used in
                    England for making fonts, generally tub-shaped, with figures cast in relief.
                    Many examples exist: <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> atTidenham, Gloucestershire;
                    Warborough and Dorchester, Oxon: Chirton, Wilts; and other places.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Germany.</hi> —Unlike England, Germany in the 10th and 11th
                    centuries produced large and elaborate works in cast bronze, especially doors
                    for churches, much resembling the contemporary doors made in Italy under
                    Byzantine influence. Bernward, bishop of Hildesheim, 992-1022, was especially
                    skilled in this work, and was much influenced in design by a visit to Rome in
                    the suite of Otho III. The bronze column with winding reliefs now at Hildesheim
                    was the result of his study of Trajan’s column, and the bronze door which he
                    made for his own cathedral shows classical influence, especially in the
                    composition of the drapery of the figures in the panels.</p>
                <p>The bronze doors of Augsburg (1047-72) are similar in style. The bronze tomb of
                    Rudolph of Swabia in Mersburg cathedral (1080) is another fine work of the same
                    school. The production of works in gold and silver was also carried on
                    vigorously in Germany. The shrine of the three kings at Cologne is the finest
                    surviving example.</p>
                <p>At a later time Augsburg and Nuremberg were the chief centres for the production
                    of artistic works in the various metals. Herman Vischer, in the 15th century,
                    and his son and grandsons were very remarkable as bronze founders. The font at
                    Wittenberg, decorated with reliefs of the apostles, was the work of the elder
                    Vischer, while Peter and his son produced, among other important works, the
                    shrine of St Sebald at Nuremberg, a work of great finish and of astonishing
                    richness of fancy in its design (see Doebner, <hi rend="italic">Christliches
                    Kunstblatt,</hi> 1866, Nos. 10-12). The tomb of Maximilian I., and the statues
                    round it, at Innsbruck, begun in 1521, are perhaps the most meritorious German
                    work of this class in the 16th century, and show considerable Italian
                    influence.</p>

                <p>In wrought iron the German smiths, especially during the 15th century, greatly
                    excelled. Almost peculiar to Germany is the use of wrought iron for
                    grave-crosses and sepulchral monuments, of which the Nuremberg and other
                    cemeteries contain fine examples. Many elaborate well-canopies were made in
                    wrought iron, and gave full play to the fancy and invention of the smith. The
                    celebrated 15th-century example over the well at Antwerp, attributed to Quintin
                    Massys, is the finest of these.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">France.—</hi> From the time of the Romans the city of Limoges
                    has been celebrated for all sorts of metal-work, and especially for brass
                    enriched with enamel. In the 13th and 14th centuries many life-size sepulchral
                    effigies were made of beaten copper or bronze, and ornamented by
                    various-coloured “champlevé” enamels. The beauty of these effigies led to their
                    being imported into England; most are now destroyed, but a fine specimen still
                    exists at Westminster on the tomb of William de Valence (1296). In ornamental
                    iron-work for doors the French smiths were pre-eminent for the richness of
                    design and skilful treatment of their metal. No examples probably surpass those
                    on the west doors of Notre Dame in Paris—now unhappily much falsified by
                    restoration. The crockets and finials on the flèches of Amiens and Rheims are
                    beautiful specimens of a highly ornamental treatment of cast lead, for which
                    France was especially celebrated. In most respects, however, the development of
                    the various kinds of metalworking went through much the same stages as in
                    England.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Persia and Damascus.—</hi> The metal-workers of the East,
                    especially in brass and steel, were renowned for their skill even in the time of
                    Theophilus, the monkish writer on the subject in the 13th century. But it was
                    during the reign of Shah Abbas I. (d. 1628) that the greatest amount of skill
                    both in design and execution was reached by the Persian workmen. Delicate
                    pierced vessels of gilt brass, enriched by tooling and inlay of gold and silver,
                    were among the chief specialties of the Persians (see fig. 9).</p>
                <p>A process called by Europeans “damascening” (from Damascus, the chief seat of the
                    export) was used to produce very delicate and rich surface ornament. A pattern
                    was incised with a graver in iron or steel, and then gold wire was beaten into
                    the sunk lines, the whole surface being then smoothed and polished. In the time
                    of Cellini this process was copied in Italy, and largely used, especially for
                    the decoration of weapons and armour. The repoussé process both for brass and
                    silver was much used by Oriental workers, and even now fine works of this class
                    are produced in the East, old designs still being adhered to.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Recent Metal-Work.—</hi> In modern Europe generally the arts of
                    metal-working both as regards design and technical skill are not in a
                    flourishing condition. The great bronze lions of the Nelson monument in London
                    are a sad example of the present low state of the founder’s art. Coarse
                    sand-casting in England now takes the place of the delicate “cireperdue”
                    process.</p>
                <p>Some attempts have lately been made in Germany to revive the art of good
                    wrought-iron work. The Prussian gates, bought at a high price for the South

                    value as a warning to show what wrought iron ought not to be. Some English
                    recent specimens of hammered work are more hopeful, and show that one or two
                    smiths are working in the right direction.</p>
