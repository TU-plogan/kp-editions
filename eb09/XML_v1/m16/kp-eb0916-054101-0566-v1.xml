                <p><label type="entry">MODENA</label>, one of the principal cities of Northern
                    Italy, formerly the capital of a duchy, and still the chief town of a province
                    and the seat of an archbishop, is situated in the open country in the south side
                    of the valley of the Po, between the Secchia to the west and the Panaro to the
                    cast. By rail it is 31 miles E.S.E. of Parma, 24 W.N.W. of Bologna, and 37 S. of
                    Mantua. The observatory stands 135 feet above the level of the sea, in 44° 38'
                    52" N. lat. and 10° 55' 42" E. long. Dismantled since 1816, and now largely
                    converted into promenades, the fortifications still give the city an irregular
                    pentagonal contour, modified at the north-west corner by the addition of a
                    citadel also pentagonal. Within this circuit there are various open areas— the
                    spacious Piazza d’Armi in front of the citadel, the public gardens in the
                    north-east of the city, the Piazza Grande in front of the cathedral, and the
                    Piazza Beale to the south of the palace. The Aemilian Way crosses obliquely
                    right through the heart of the city, from the Bologna Gate in the east to that
                    of Sant’ Agostino in the west. Commenced by the countess Matilda in 1099, after
                    the designs of Lanfranc, and consecrated in 1184, the cathedral (St Geminian’s)
                    is a low but handsome building, with a lofty crypt, three eastern apses, and a
                    façade still preserving some curious sculptures of the 12th and 15th centuries.
                    The bell-tower, named La öhirlandina from the bronze garland surrounding the
                    weathercock, is lined with white marble, and is 315 feet high; in the basement
                    maybe seen the wooden bucket captured by the Modenese from the Bolognese in the
                    affray at Zappolino (1325), and rendered famous by Tassoni’s <hi rend="italic"

                    palace, begun by Duke Francis I. in 1635 from the designs of Avanzini, and
                    finished by Francis Ferdinand V., is an extensive marble building, and now

                    their way to Dresden. The valuable <hi rend="italic">Museo Lapidario</hi> in a

                    in 1683 by Francis II., is mainly a medical and legal school, but has also a
                    faculty of physical and mathematical science. It has about twenty-five
                    professors, and from 200 to 250 students; a library of 20,000 volumes, an
                    observatory, botanical gardens, an ethnographical museum, &lt;kc. The old

                    restored by Francis in 1814, and now forms the flourishing Royal Academy of

                    besides in the city an Italian Society of Science founded by Anton Mario Lorgna,
                    an academy of fine arts, a military college (1859), an important agricultural
                    college, and a lyceum and gymnasium, both named after Muratori. In industrial
                    enterprise the Modenese show but little activity, silk and linen goods and
                    iron-wares being almost the only products of any note. Commerce is stimulated by
                    a good position in the railway system, and by a canal which opens a water-way by
                    the Panaro and the Po to the Adriatic. The population of the city was 32,248 in
                    1861, and 30,854 in 1871; that of the commune 55,512 in 1861, and 58,058 in

                    to the Mediterranean, and was bounded N. by Lombardy and the Papal States, E. by
                    the Papal States and Tuscany, S. by Tuscany, Sardinia, and the Mediterranean,
                    and W. by Sardinia and the duchy of Parma. Its greatest length, from
                    Porto-Vecchio, on its northern frontier towards Mantua, to the outlet of the
                    Parmignola torrent, on the Sardinian frontier, was 84 J miles; and its greatest
                    width, from the pass of Calama, on the Papal and Tuscan frontier, to the right
                    bank of the Enza, on the frontier of Parma, λvas 37 nules. The area was 2371
                    square miles, of which three-fifths were mountainous. In 1855 the population was
                    C06,159. The duchy had six provinces—Modena, Reggio, Guastalla, Frignano,
                    Garfagnana, Massa-Carrara.</p>
                <p>Modena is the ancient Mutina, which was annexed by the Romans along with the rest
                    of the territory of the Boii. In 183 B.c. Mutina became the seat of a Roman
                    colony. During the civil wars Marcus Brutus held out within its walls against
                    Pompeius in 78 B.c., and in 44 B,c. the place was defended by D. Brutus against
                    Μ. Antony. 'Die 4th century found Mutina in a state of decay; the ravages of
                    Attila and the troubles of the Lombard period left it a ruined city in a wasted
                    land. In the 8th century its exiles founded, at a distance of 4 miles to the
                    north-west, a new city, Città Geminiana (still represented by the village of
                    Cittanova); but about the close of the 9th century Modena was restored and
                    refortified by its bishop, Laedoinus. When it began to build its cathedral (1099
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> the city was part of the possessions of the
                    countess Matilda of Tuscany; but when, in 1184, the edifice was consecrated by
                    Lucius III., it was a free community. In the wars between Frederick II. and
                    Gregory IX. it sided with the emperor, though ultimately the papal party was
                    strong enough to introduce confusion into its policy. In 1288 Obizzo d’Este was
                    recognized as lord of the city; after the death of his successor, Azzo VIII.
                    (1308), it resumed its communal independence; but by 1336 the Este family was
                    again in power. Constituted a duchy in 1452 in favour of Borso d’Este, and
                    enlarged and strengthened by Hercules II., it became the ducal residence on the
                    incorporation of Ferrara with the States of the Church (1598). Francis I.
                    (1629-1658) erected the citadel and commenced the palace, which was largely
                    embellished by Francis II. Rinaldo <hi rend="italic">(ob.</hi> 1737) was twice
                    driven from his city by French invasion. To Francis III. (1698-1780) the city
                    was indebted for many of its public buildings. Hercules III. (1727-1803) saw his
                    states transformed by the French into the Cispadine Republic, and, having
                    refused the principality of Breisgau and Ortenau, offered him in compensation by
                    the treaty of Campo Formio, died an exile at Treviso. His only daughter, Maria
                    Beatrice, married Ferdinand of Austria (son of Maria Theresa), and in 1814 their
                    eldest son, Ferdinand, received back the <hi rend="italic">Stati</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Estensi.</hi> His rule was subservient to Austria, reactionary,
                    and despotic. On the outbreak of the French Revolution of 1830,Francis IV.seemed
                    for a time disposed to encourage the corresponding movement in Modena; but no
                    sooner had the Austrian army put an end to the insurrection in Central Italy
                    than he returned to his previous policy. Francis Ferdinand V., who succeeded in
                    1846, followed in the main his father’s example. Obliged to leave the city in
                    1848, he was restored by the Austrians in 1849; ten years later, on 20th August
                    1859, the representatives of the Modenese, under the direction of Carlo Farini,
                    declared their territory part of the kingdom of Italy, and their decision was
                    confirmed by the plebiscite of 1860.</p>
