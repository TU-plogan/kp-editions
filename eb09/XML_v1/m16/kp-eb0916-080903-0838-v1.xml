                    family, and was born at Madrid in 1737. He was educated at the Jesuit college in
                    Calatayud, and afterwards studied law at the university of Valladolid. He then
                    received an appointment in the service of Queen Elizabeth, the widow of Philip
                    V., which enabled him to see much of the society <pb break="no"

                    and ultimately he became the leading spirit of the club of literary men which
                    frequented the Fonda de San Sebastian -and included Ayala, Cadahalso, Iriarte,
                    Conti, and others. In 1772 he left the court, and was called to the bar; four
                    years afterwards he succeeded Ayala in the chair of poetry in the Imperial
                    College. He died on 11th May 1780.</p>
                <p>Moratin became at an early period of his life a convert to the •opinions of those
                    who (such as Montiano and others) were attempting to drive the native romantic
                    drama from the Spanish stage, and his first literary efforts were devoted to the
                    cause of theatrical reform. In 1762 he published three small pamphlets entitled
                    <hi rend="italic">Dcsengano al Teatro Espanol</hi> (The Truth told about the
                    Spanish Stage), in which he severely criticized the old drama generally, and
                    particularly the still flourishing “auto sacramental.” They were so far
                    successful that the exhibition of ’ ‘ autos sacramentales” was prohibited by
                    royal edict three years afterwards (June 1765). In 1762 he also published a play
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">La Petimetra</hi> (the Petite-Maîtresse, or Female
                    Fribble), the earliest original Spanish comedy formed avowedly on French models.
                    It was preceded by a dissertation in which Lope de Vega and Calderon are very
                    unfavourably criticized. Neither the <hi rend="italic">Petimetra,</hi> however,
                    nor the <hi rend="italic">Lucretia,</hi> an original tragedy still more strictly
                    in accordance with the conventions of the French stage, ever obtained the honour
                    of a public representation. Two subsequent tragedies, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hormesinda</hi> (1770) and <hi rend="italic">Guzman el Bueno</hi> (1777), were
                    exhibited with partial success. In 1764 Moratin published a collection of short
                    pieces, chiefly lyrical, under the title of <hi rend="italic">El</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Poeta,</hi> and in 1765 a short didactic poem on the chase <hi
                    rend="italic">(Diana o Arte de la Caza).</hi> His “epic canto” on the
                    •destruction of his ships by Cortes <hi rend="italic">(Las Naves de Cortes
                    Dcstnιidas),</hi> written, but without success, for a prize offered by the
                    Academy in 1777, was not published until after his death (1785). It is justly
                    characterized by Ticknor as “the noblest poem of its class produced in Spain
                    during the 18th century ;” it must be remembered, however, that the historical
                    epic in Spain is chiefly remarkable for its mass. A volume of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Obras</hi><hi rend="italic">Postumas,</hi> with a life, was published at
                    Barcelona in 1821, and reprinted at London in 1825. See also <hi rend="italic"
