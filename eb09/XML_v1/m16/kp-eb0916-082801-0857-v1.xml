                    (1549-1623), Seigneur du Plessis-Marly, very generally known as Mornay Du
                    Plessis or Du Plessis-Mornay, one of the most distinguished members of the
                    Protestant party in France, was born at Buhy in Normandy on 5th November 1549.
                    As a younger son he was destined for the church, and with this view was sent to
                    the Collège de Lisieux in Paris, but in his eleventh year, along with the rest
                    of his family, he abandoned Roman Catholicism, continuing, however, with zeal
                    and success his studies not only in classical and general literature but also in
                    theology. In the autumn of 1567, on the outbreak of the second religious war, he
                    joined the army of Condé, but was prevented from taking an active part in the
                    campaign by a fall from his horse, which broke his leg. In the following year he
                    went abroad, and, after spending the winter at Heidelberg, travelled extensively
                    in Italy, Germany, the Low Countries, and England, learning the languages and
                    acquiring the friendship of many of the distinguished men of all these
                    countries. In <pb break="no"

                    enter upon a diplomatic career (his earliest extant “mémoire,” laid by Coligny
                    before Charles IX., had reference to the duty of France to support the Low
                    Countries in their struggle for independence) when the St Bartholomew massacre,
                    from which he escaped with difficulty, compelled him to take refuge across the
                    Channel, There he rendered valuable services to William of Orange, and also to
                    the duke of Alençon-Anjou, as a semi-official political agent. Returning to
                    France at the instance of La Noue towards the end of 1573, he took part with
                    various success in numerous military enterprises, and was made prisoner at
                    Dormans in 1575 (10th October), but not having been recognized he got off for a
                    small ransom. Shortly afterwards he married Charlotte Arbaleste at Sedan, and at
                    her request wrote as a bridal present the <hi rend="italic">Discours de

                    Henry of Navarre made him a member of his council and sent him on a diplomatic
                    mission to England, and during this visit, which lasted more than a year, he
                    found time among his other pressing occupations to prepare for the press his <hi

                    (1578), which at once became popular. From July 1578 till his return to France
                    in 1582 he was chiefly in the Low Countries, engaged in public business, and
                    during this interval he wrote and published a considerable work in apologetical
                    theology <hi rend="italic">{Traité de la vérité</hi><hi rend="italic">de la

                    Henry of Navarre was brought within sight of the throne of France, the period of
                    Mornay’s greatest political activity began; his importance in the Huguenot
                    counsels was further increased in 1588 by the death of the prince of Condé, to
                    whose influence he practically succeeded. In April 1589 he was rewarded for the
                    reconciliation of the two Henries with the governorship of Saumur, and he took
                    active part in many of the military operations that followed the assassination
                    of Henry III. in the following August. He was present at the siege of Dieppe,
                    fought by the side of Henry IV. at Ivry, and was one of the besiegers of Rouen
                    in 1591-92, until sent on a mission to the court of Elizabeth. A crisis in his
                    political career was marked by Henry’s abjuration of Protestantism in July 1593,
                    which gradually led to Mornay’s withdrawal from the court. In this year it was
                    that he founded the Protestant academy or university of Saumur, which had a
                    distinguished history until its suppression by Louis XIV. in 1683. In 1598 he
                    published a work on which he had long been engaged, entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Vinstitution, usage,</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi

                    Cardinal Du Perron had alleged that of the (thousands of) citations in this
                    controversial work he could point out five hundred that were falsified or
                    misunderstood, he challenged his assailant to a public discussion. This was at
                    last arranged for by the good offices of the king, and took place at
                    Fontainebleau on 4th May 1600. Only nine passages were discussed, but in each
                    case the decision, one is not surprised in the circumstances to learn, went
                    against the Protestant. Mornay, from whom every indication of the particular
                    passages to be impugned had been persistently withheld, was forced by
                    supervening illness to withdraw. Only once again did he appear at court, in
                    1607. He continued, however, to give his party the benefit of his counsel and
                    active support to the end of his long and busy life. His last work, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Mystère d’iniquité, c’est à dire, l’histoire de la Papauté,</hi>
                    appeared in 1611. In 1618 he was chosen a deputy to represent the French
                    Protestants at the synod of Dort. Prohibited by Louis XIII. from personally
                    attending, he nevertheless contributed materially to the deliberations of that
                    assembly by written communications. In 1621 he was deprived of his governorship;
                    and his death took place at La Forêt-sur-Sèvre on 11th November 1623.</p>
