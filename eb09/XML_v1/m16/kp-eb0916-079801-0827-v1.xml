                    (1725-1799), a learned mathematician, was the son of a merchant, and was born at
                    Lyons in 1725. He attended the college of the Jesuits in his native city, and
                    was early distinguished for his tenacious memory and his aptitude for
                    mathematics. At the age of sixteen he removed to Toulouse to prosecute the study
                    of law; and after taking the usual degrees he repaired to Paris. There his
                    conversational powers, his solid information, and his acquirements as a linguist
                    soon introduced him to the notice of the learned. In the society of D’Alembert
                    and Lalande his taste for mathematical studies was confirmed and stimulated.
                    After publishing two anonymous treatises on the <hi rend="italic">Quadrature of
                    the Circle</hi> and on the <hi rend="italic">Duplication of the Cube,</hi> he
                    gave to the world in 1758 the first part of his great work, <hi rend="italic"
                    >The History of Mathematics.</hi> Not long after this his merits were recognized
                    by the Government, and he was promoted to several important offices. He was
                    appointed intendant-secretary at Grenoble in 1758, secretary to the expedition
                    for colonizing Cayenne in 1764, and “premier commis des bâtiments” and
                    censorroyal for mathematical books in 1765. During the next twenty-five years
                    his time was divided between his official duties and the study of his favourite
                    science. The Revolution then ensuing deprived him of his income, and left him in
                    great destitution. The offer in 1795 of a mathematical chair in one of the
                    schools of Paris was declined on account of his infirm health, and he was still
                    in straitened circumstances in 1798 when he published a second edition of the
                    first part of his <hi rend="italic">History.</hi> He also enlarged Ozanam’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Mathematical Recreations,</hi> afterwards published in English by
                    Dr Hutton (4 vols., Lond., 1803). About four months before his death (December
                    1799) a pension of 2400 francs was conferred upon him. His <hi rend="italic"
                    >History of Mathematics</hi> was completed by Lalande, and published at Paris in
                    1799-1802 (4 vols. 4to).</p>
                <p>Montucla’s work was the first history of mathematics worthy of the name. It is
                    characterized alike by elegance of style and by breadth of treatment. Montucla
                    rarely fails in candour, and never in breadth of sympathy; he lived at a time
                    when it would have been pardonable to treat mathematics “as a French science,”
                    yet he cannot with justice be accused of Chauvinism. The study of the history of
                    mathematics has greatly revived of late years, especially in Germany, and
                    numerous monographs on special departments have appeared, in which, as was to be
                    expected, many defects and some positive errors in Montucla’s work have been
                    pointed out, but, taken as a whole, it stands as yet unsuperseded, unrivalled,
                    fit, as to its admirable style and enduring quality, to be compared with
                    Gibbon’s <hi rend="italic">Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.</hi></p>
