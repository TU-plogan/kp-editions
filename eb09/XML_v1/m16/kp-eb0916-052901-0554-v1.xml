                    (1786-1855), born at Alresford, Hampshire, on the 16th of December 1786, retains
                    an honourable place in English literature as the authoress of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Our Village,</hi> a series of sketches of village scenes and characters
                    unsurpassed in their kind, and after half a century of imitations as fresh as if
                    they had been written yesterday. Washington Irving was Miss Mitford’s literary
                    model, but her work is thoroughly original and spontaneous, the free outflow of
                    a singularly charming character. The shortest account of her life would be
                    incomplete without a reference to the scapegrace father who was the centre of
                    her affections, and the “only begetter” of all that is most delightful and
                    characteristic in her writing. Dr Mitford first spent his wife’s fortune in a
                    few years; then he spent also in a few years the greater part of £20,000 which
                    his daughter drew (in 1797, at the age of ten) as a prize in a lottery; then he
                    lived, for most years of his life, on a small remnant of his fortune and the
                    proceeds of his daughter’s literary industry. In the little village of Three
                    Mile Cross, near Reading, in a small cottage which Miss Mitford says was “a fine
                    lesson in condensation,” the doctor was the stay, support, and admiration of all
                    the loafers in the neighbourhood, while his daughter, who had called herself his
                    mamma, and treated him as her little boy from the time when she was herself a
                    little girl, found an unfailing charm in his “friskings,” and was the loving
                    slave of all his good-humoured exactions. The father kept fresh in his daughter
                    the keen delight in incongruities, the lively sympathy with self-willed vigorous
                    individuality, and the womanly tolerance of its excess which inspire so many of
                    her sketches of character. The woman who lived in close attendance on such an
                    “awful dad,” refused all holiday invitations because he could not live without
                    her, and worked incessantly for him, except when she broke off her work to read
                    him the sporting newspapers, evidently wrote from the heart in her bright
                    portraits of such characters as the Talking Lady, the Talking Gentleman, Joel
                    Brent, Jack Rapley, Tom Cordery, Lizzy, Lucy, and Harriet. Her writing has all
                    the charm of perfectly unaffected spontaneous humour, combined with quick wit
                    and exquisite literary skill. She died January 10, 1855.</p>
                <p>Miss Mitford’s youthful ambition was to be “the greatest English poetess,” and
                    her first publications were poems in the manner of Coleridge and Scott <hi
                    rend="italic">(Miscellaneous Verses,</hi> 1810, of sufficient mark to be
                    reviewed by Scott in the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly; Christine,</hi> a metrical
                    tale, 1811; <hi rend="italic">Blanche,</hi> 1813). Later on she essayed writing
                    plays <hi rend="italic">(Julian,</hi> 1823; <hi rend="italic">The Foscari,</hi>
                    1826; <hi rend="italic">Dramatic Scenes,</hi> 1827; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rienzi,</hi> 1828; <hi rend="italic">Charles the First,</hi> 1828). But the
                    prose to which she was driven by domestic necessities has rarer qualities than
                    her verse. The first series of <hi rend="italic">Our Village</hi> sketches
                    appeared in 1824, a second in 1826, a third in 1828, a fourth in 1830, a fifth
                    iu 1832, and <hi rend="italic">Belford Regis,</hi> a novel in which the
                    neighbourhood and society of Reading were idealized, in 1835. Her <hi
                    rend="italic">Recollections of a Literary Life</hi> (1853) is a series of <hi
                    rend="italic">causeries</hi> about her favourite books. Five volumes of her <hi
                    rend="italic">Life and Letters</hi> were published in 1870 and 1872, showing her
                    to have been a delightful letter-writer; two volumes of letteι <hi
