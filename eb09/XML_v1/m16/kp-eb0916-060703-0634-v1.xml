                    (1806-1879), a philosopher whose greatest claims to scientific distinction are
                    as yet, though indubitable^ only partially admitted, was the son of a well-to-do
                    druggist in Coblentz, and was born 4th November 1806. Being a delicate child, he
                    received much of his early education at home, in great part in his father’s
                    laboratory. To this may be traced much of the skill he showed in devising
                    instruments and methods of analysis which are still in common use in chemical
                    and pharmaceutical laboratories. At the age of 21 he studied chemistry under
                    Gmelin, and, after five years spent in Heidelberg, Berlin, and Bonn, returned
                    with the degree of Ph.D. to join his father’s establishment. On the death of his
                    father in 1840 he succeeded to the business, retiring from it for scientific
                    leisure in 1857. Serious pecuniary losses led him at the age of 57 to become a
                    privat-docent in Bonn, where he was soon after appointed, by the direct
                    influence of the emperor, extraordinary professor of pharmacy. In private and
                    domestic life he was a man of singularly winning manners, intensely fond of
                    music and poetry, for the latter of which he showed wonderful memory. But his
                    uncompromising spirit—perhaps we might even in some cases say his
                    wrongheadedness—in matters of scientific and theological authority had raised
                    such a host of enemies that even royal influence could not secure his further
                    advancement. Although he stood at the very head of the scientific pharmacists of
                    Germany, his name was deliberately omitted from the list of the commission
                    entrusted with the preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Pharmacopoeia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Germanica.</hi> Yet in that work many of his ideas and processes
                    were incorporated by the very men who had previously denounced them. He died in
                    October 1879.</p>
                <p>Mohr’s best-known work is his <hi rend="italic">Lehrbuch der
                    chemisch-analytischen</hi><hi rend="italic">Titrirmethode</hi> (1855), which has
                    already run through many editions, and which was specially commended by Liebig.
                    His improvements in methods of chemical analysis occupy a long series of papers
                    extending over some fifty years. He also published a number of physical papers
                    on subjects such as Hail, St. Elmo’s Fire, Ground-ice, &amp;c., and a curious
                    notice of the earliest mention of Ozone. He shows that Homer, on four different
                    occasions, mentions the sulphurous smell produced by lightning, and employs the
                    very word from which the name of Ozone was long afterwards coined. In 1866
                    appeared his <hi rend="italic">Geschichte der Erde,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >cine</hi><hi rend="italic">Geologie auf neuer Grundlage,</hi> which has
                    obtained a wide circulation.</p>
                <p>But he will be remembered in future times mainly on account of a paper, <hi
                    rend="italic">Uebcr die</hi><hi rend="italic">Natur der Wärme,</hi> published in
                    1837, which unfortunately has not yet appeared in full in an English
                    translation. The history of this paper is remarkable. It was refused admission
                    into <hi rend="italic">Poggendorff’s</hi><hi rend="italic">Annalen,</hi> and was
                    then sent to Baumgartner of Vienna, in whose <hi rend="italic">Zeitschrift für
                    Physik,</hi> &amp;c., it was at once published. As no proof-sheets reached Mohr,
                    he concluded that his paper had been lost or rejected, and contented himself
                    with publishing a short analysis in the <hi rend="italic">Annalen der</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Pharmacie,</hi><hi rend="italic">of</hi> which he was an editor.
                    This analysis, it is only fair to say, though probably prepared by the author
                    himself, gives a very inadequate idea of the scope and merit of the paper. In
                    1864 Dr. Akin unearthed the paper from the forgotten pages of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Zeitschrift,</hi> and the author was enabled to reprint it, with
                    notes, while the recent discussions as to the history of Conservation of Energy
                    were still being carried on. · Along with it he issued a number of other papers
                    of greatly inferior merit.</p>
                <p>Unless some still earlier author should be discovered, there can be no doubt that
                    Mohr is to be recognized as the first to enunciate in its generality what we now
                    call “conservation of energy.” The thesis of his paper must be stated in his own
                    words,—“Besides the 54 known chemical elements, there is in the physical world
                    one agent only, and this is called Kraft (energy).<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It is to be remembered that even the most
                    accurate authorities in Germany—as, for instance, Von Helmholtz in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Essay</hi> of 1847—used till quite recently the word Kraft in the
                    sense of Energy.</p></note> It may appear, according to circumstances, as
                    motion, chemical affinity, cohesion, electricity, light, and magnetism; and from
                    any one of these forms it can be transformed into any of the others.” Even now,
                    after nearly half a century of rapid advance in science, it would be difficult
                    to improve this statement except by inserting, as regards transformation of
                    energy, some such guarding expression as “in whole or in part.” But if Mohr had
                    inserted this, he might have had claims to the “dissipation of energy” also.
                    Mohr’s starting-point appears to have been the discovery (by Forbes) of the
                    polarization of radiant heat. He goes through the whole of the then range of
                    physics, pointing out the explanation of each experimental result as a
                    transformation of energy, mentioning even the electric currents produced by
                    electro-magnetic induction as a transformation of the energy required to draw
                    the coil from the magnet—one of the earlier methods used by Joule for
                    quantitative determinations. His numerical results, based on data quoted from
                    various books, are, it is <pb break="no"

                    determinations we owe to Joule. But it must be remembered that these
                    speculations, daring as they were and accurate (on the whole) as they have been
                    found to be, required the confirmation which they received from the experimental
                    work of Colding and Joule, or from the <hi rend="italic">Essay</hi> of Von
                    Helmholtz, whose basis also is wholly experimental, being the fact that
                    “perpetual motion” is recognized as unattainable.</p>
