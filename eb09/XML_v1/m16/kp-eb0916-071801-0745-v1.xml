                <p><label type="entry">MONAGHAN</label>, an inland county of Ireland in the province
                    of Ulster, is bounded E. by Armagh, S.E. by Louth, S. by Meath, S.W. by Cavan,
                    W. by Fermanagh, and N. by Tyrone. The area is 318,806 acres, or 498 sq. miles.
                    The north-western part of the county is included in the great central plain of
                    Ireland; but in the south-east there is an uprising of Lower Silurian rocks. The
                    surface is irregular, although none of the hills are of great elevation. The
                    principal range is that of Slievebeagh, a rugged and barren tract extending into
                    Fermanagh, its highest summit being 1254 feet above sea-level. Formerly much of
                    the country was under forest, but it is now very bare of trees, except in the
                    many demesnes of the nobility and gentry. The scenery is redeemed from monotony
                    by the large number of small lakes and streams. The lakes number in all nearly
                    200. The principal rivers are the Finn, which rises near the centre of the
                    county and passes into Fermanagh, and the Blackwater,which forms the boundary
                    with Tyrone. The Ulster Canal passes the towns of Monaghan and Clones, affording
                    communication between Lough Neagh and Lough Erne. Eskers occur at several
                    places. There are seams of unworkable coal in the south-west of the county. The
                    limestone is not only abundant and good, but from the position of the rocks it
                    can be obtained at very small expense in working. Freestone and slates are
                    quarried in considerable quantities. The other minerals include lead ore,
                    antimony, fuller’s earth, marble, and manganese; but the quantities obtained are
                    inconsiderable.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate and Agriculture.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Partly
                    owing to the large proportion of bog and water the climate is somewhat moist.
                    The soil in the more level portions of the county is very fertile where it rests
                    on limestone, and there is also a mixed soil of deep clay, which is capable of
                    high cultivation; but in the hilly regions a strong retentive clay prevails,
                    which could be made productive only by careful draining and culture. Spade
                    husbandry generally prevails. The most common manure is a compost of lime and
                    burned turf mould. Marl is abundant, but is little used, and gypsum also is
                    found.</p>
                <p>The number of holdings in 1881 was 17,849, of which as many as 10,784 did not
                    exceed 15 acres in extent, and 2870 of these did not exceed 5 acres; 6454 ranged
                    between 15 and 50 acres, and only 24 were above 200 acres. The area of arable
                    land was 278,755 acres, or 87 per cent, of the whole, while 5258 were under
                    plantations, 7580 bog and marsh, 5239 barren mountain land, and 21,582 water,
                    roads, and fences. The following table shows the areas under the different crops
                    in 1850 and 1882 :—</p>

                <p>Horses numbered 10,229 in 1872, and 10,666 in 1882. In the same years mules
                    numbered 300 and 469, and asses 4314 and 3476. The number of cattle in 1872 was
                    81,333, and in 1882 only 72,266, an average of 25’9 to every 100 acres under
                    cultivation, the average for Ireland being 25’8. Sheep between 1872 and 1882
                    declined from 17,964 to 9858, a very inconsiderable number; pigs increased from
                    26,008 to 29,972; goats from 8873 to 12,391; and poultry from 341,874 to
                    434,260.</p>
                <p>According to the latest return, the land was divided among 1470 proprietors,who
                    possessed 311,440 acres,with a total annual value of £261,382. The average size
                    of the properties was 211 acres, and the average value per statute acre 17
                    shillings. The following seven proprietors possessed upwards of 10,000 acres: E.
                    P. Shirley, 26,386; marquis of Bath, 22,762; earl of Dartrey, 17,345; Lord
                    Rossmore, 14,839; Sir John Leslie, 13,621; Viscount Templetown, 12,845; A. A.
                    Hope, 11,700.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Manufactures.—</hi> The only manufacture of consequence is
                    linen, which of late years has been on the increase. The number of scutching
                    mills in 1881 was 55, of which 45 were wrought by water, 8 by steam, and 2 by
                    water and steam.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration.—</hi> The county includes 5 baronies, 23
                    parishes, and 1850 town lands. Assizes are held at Monaghan, and quartersessions
                    at Carrickmacross, Castleblayney, Clones, and Monaghan. There are 8 petty
                    sessional districts within the county, and part of another. It includes the
                    poor-law unions of Carrickmacross and Monaghan, and portions of Castleblayney,
                    Clogher, Clones, Cootehill, and Dundalk. It is in the Belfast military district,
                    subdistrict of Armagh. There is a barrack station at Monaghan. In the Irish
                    parliament two members were returned for the county and two for the town of
                    Monaghan, but at the Union Monaghan was disfranchised.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Population.—</hi> The population in 1841 was 200,442; but in
                    1851 it had diminished to 141,823, in 1871 to 114,969, and in 1881 to 102,748,
                    of whom 50,077 were males and 52,671 females. At the last census 73 per cent, of
                    the inhabitants were Roman Catholics, 13 per cent. Episcopalians, and 11 per
                    cent. Presbyterians. The number of emigrants from 1st May 1851 to 31st December
                    1881 was 56,408, or about 1840 persons per annum; while during the twenty years
                    ending 31st March 1881 the annual rate of emigration was 13 '8 per 1000 of the
                    population. The death-rate to every thousand of the population for the ten years
                    ending 1881 was 16 9, the birthrate 23 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 4, and the
                    marriage-rate 3'6. The towns possessing more than 1000 inhabitants are—Monaghan
                    3369, Clones 2216, Carrickmacross 2002, Castleblayney 1810, and Ballyblay 1654.
                    Monaghan, the county town, received its name <hi rend="italic">Muinechan</hi>
                    (the town of monks) from a monastery founded there at a very early period. The
                    town was incorporated by James I., but it was little more than a hamlet till
                    towards the close of last century. Besides the usual county buildings, it
                    contains a Roman Catholic college, and National model schools.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History and Antiquities.—</hi> In the time of Ptolemy, Monaghan
                    formed part of the territory of the Scoti. Subsequently included in the district
                    of Oriel or Orgial, and long known as Macmahon’s country, it became shire ground
                    in the reign of Elizabeth.</p>
                <p>The antiquarian remains of Monaghan are comparatively unimportant. At Clones
                    there is a round tower in good preservation, but very rude in its masonry;
                    another at Inniskeen is very dilapidated. Near Clones there are two large raths.
                    Although there are several old Danish forts, there are no mediaeval castles of
                    importance. The only monastic structure of which any vestiges remain is the
                    abbey of Clones, which was also the seat of a bishopric. The abbey dates from
                    the 6th century, but was rebuilt in the 14th century after destruction by fire.
                    On the site of the Franciscan abbey at Monaghan a castle was erected, which was
                    in a ruinous condition in the time of James I.</p>
