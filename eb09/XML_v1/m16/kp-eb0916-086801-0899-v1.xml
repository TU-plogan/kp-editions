                <p><label type="entry">MOSUL</label>, an important town in Mesopotamia, on the right
                    bank of the Tigris, in 36° 35' N. lat. and 43° 3' E. long. In Mosul, as in
                    Baghdad, only part of the space within the walls is covered with buildings and
                    the rest is occupied by cemeteries; even the solid limestone walls of the
                    ancient town are half in ruins, being serviceable only in the direction of the
                    river, where they check inundations. Of the town gates at present in use, five
                    are on the south, two on the west, two on the north, and the great bridge gate
                    on the east. Leaving Mosul by the last named, the traveller first crosses a
                    stone bridge, 157 feet long; then a kind of island (140 feet), which is
                    overflowed only in spring and summer by the Tigris; next a stretch of the river
                    which, at such times as it is not fordable, is spanned by a bridge of boats, the
                    bridge proper covering only one-sixth of the full width of the stream. During
                    the season of low water excellent vegetables, particularly water-melons, are
                    grown upon the islands and dry portions of the river-bed.</p>
                <p>The interior of Mosul has an insignificant appearance, only a few of the older
                    buildings being left, among which may be mentioned the Great Mosque, with its
                    leaning minaret, formerly a church dedicated to St. Paul. The private houses are
                    partly of brick and partly of stone, the district furnishing an excellent and
                    easily-wrought building-stone resembling marble. Handsome well-built halls <hi
                    rend="italic">(iwàns)</hi> may be seen in many houses; the underground dwellings
                    also, to which the inhabitants retire during the day-time in the hot months of
                    summer, are well and solidly built. The houses are high, and during three or
                    four months of the year the inhabitants sleep on the flat roofs. The streets are
                    for the most part badly paved and very narrow, a small square in the
                    marketplace, overlooked by airy coffee-booths, being almost the only open space.
                    The shops are few and poor. The industry, in comparison with former times, when
                    the town had so considerable a manufacture in “muslin” as to give its name to
                    that fabric, is very unimportant; trade also, which is almost exclusively in the
                    hands of native merchants, has fallen off greatly. Gall nuts, gathered on the
                    neighbouring Kurdish mountain slopes, are mostly exported, but are also made use
                    of by native dyers; and hides, wax, cotton, and gum are sold. Very few Europeans
                    live in Mosul, though the market is abundantly supplied with European goods. The
                    wholesale trade, conducted by means of caravans, has greatly declined from its
                    former importance, owing not only to changes which have been taking place in
                    commercial routes generally, but also to the dangers of the roads near Mosul;
                    for to the north and east of the town there are wild tribes of Kurds, some of
                    whom continue to assert their independence of the 0smanli rule, while the
                    Yezidis, a Kurdish tribe who have never yet accepted Islam, dwell in the Sinjar
                    mountains, upon a northern spur of which the town stands. Semi-independent
                    tribes of Bedouins also roam over the plains in the immediate vicinity. The wild
                    hordes of the Shammar Bedouins have often plundered or threatened the citizens.
                    Mosul, therefore, has a somewhat isolated position, and this perhaps is one
                    reason why Christians and Moslems have lived together on better terms here than
                    elsewhere. Both are animated by an active local patriotism, and both honour the
                    same patron saints, Jirjis (St George) and Jonah; the grave of the latter is
                    pointed out on an artificial mound on the left bank of the Tigris.</p>
                <p>The language of the people of Mosul is a dialect of Arabic, partly influenced by
                    Kurdish and Syriac. The population is probably 25,000 to 30,000. It is stated
                    that the town is divided into 32 quarters, of which one is Jewish and three are
                    Christian, while the rest are Moslem. The Moslems call themselves either Arabs
                    or Kurds, but the prevalent type, very different from the true Arabian of
                    Baghdad, proves the Aramaean origin of many of their number. Of the Christians
                    the community of the Chaldaeans, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> those who have
                    gone over from Nestorianism to Catholicism, seems to be the most important;
                    there are also Syrian Catholics and Jacobites. Mosul has for several centuries
                    been a centre of Catholic missionary activity, the Dominicans especially, by the
                    foundation of schools and printing-offices, having made a marked impression upon
                    an intelligent and teachable population. There are very few Protestants.</p>
                <p>Mosul shares the severe alternations of temperature experienced by Upper
                    Mesopotamia (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Mesopotamia).</hi> The summer heat is
                    extreme, and in winter frost is not unknown. Nevertheless the climate is
                    considered healthy and agreeable; copious rains fall in general in winter. The
                    drinking water is got from the muddy Tigris. At the north-east corner of the
                    town is a sulphur spring, and 4 leagues to the south there is a hot sulphur
                    spring (Hammam 'Ali), much frequented by invalids.</p>
                <p>Mosul probably occupies the site of a southern suburb of ancient <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Nineveh</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi> but it is very
                    doubtful whether the older name of Mespila can be traced in the modern Al-Mausil
                    (Arab., the place of connexion); it is, however, certain that a town with the
                    Arabic name Al-Mausil stood here at the time of the Moslem conquest (636 A. D.
                    ). The town reached its greatest prosperity towards the beginning of the decline
                    of the caliphate, when it was for a time an independent capital. The dynasty of
                    the Hamdanids reigned in Mosul from 934, but the town was conquered by the
                    Syrian Okailids in 990. In the 11th century it belonged to the Seljuks, and in
                    the 12th, under the sway of the Atabeks, particularly of Zenki, it had a short
                    period of splendour. Saladin besieged it unsuccessfully in 1182. Among the later
                    rulers of Mosul the only conspicuous name is that of Lulu, in the first half of
                    the 13th century. The town suffered severely from the Mongols under Hulagu;
                    under Turkish rule it became the capital of a small pashalik, bounded on the one
                    side by the vilayet of Diarbekr, on the other by that of Baghdad. The Persians
                    occupied Mosul for a short time in 1623, until it was, soon afterwards,
                    recovered by Sultan Murad IV. It was visited by an earthquake in 1667, and was
                    unsuccessfully besieged by the Persians under Nadir Shah in 1743. The
                    governorship of the pashalik was long hereditary in the originally Christian
                    family of the 'Abd-al-Jalil, until the Porte, during the course of the present
                    century, succeeded after a long and severe contest in establishing a more
                    centralized system of government.</p>
                <p>Compared with what it was in the Middle Ages the present town is much
                    deteriorated, its decay having advanced steadily from the beginning of the
                    Turkish dominion.</p>
