                    (1814-1875), was a painter of French peasant life, and it may be questioned
                    whether France has produced in our day any greater or more original artist. He
                    himself came of a peasant family, and was born on the 4th of October 1814 in the
                    hamlet of Gruchy, near Gréville (La Manche), in the wild and picturesque
                    district called La Hague. His boyhood was passed working in his father’s fields,
                    but the sight of the engravings in an old illustrated Bible set him drawing, and
                    thenceforth, whilst the others slept, the daily hour of rest was spent by Millet
                    in trying to render the familiar scenes around him. From the village priest the
                    lad learnt to read the Bible and Virgil in Latin, and acquired an interest in
                    one or two other works of a high class which accompanied him through life; he
                    did not, however, attract attention so much by his acquirements as by the stamp
                    of his mind. The whole family seems, indeed, to have worn a character of
                    austerity and dignity, and when Millet’s father finally decided to test the
                    vocation of his son as an artist, it was with a gravity and authority which
                    recalls the patriarchal households of Calvinist France. Two drawings were
                    prepared and placed before a painter at Cherbourg named Mouchel, who at once
                    recognized the boy’s gifts, and accepted him as a pupil; but shortly after
                    (1835) Millet’s father died, and the eldest son, with heroic devotion, took his
                    place at home, nor did he return to his work until the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n339/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0339-0322"/> pressing calls from without were solemnly
                    enforced by the wishes of his own family. He accordingly went back to Cherbourg,
                    but after a short time spent there with another master (Langlois) started with
                    many misgivings for Paris. The council-general of the department had granted him
                    a sum of 600 francs, and the town council promised an annual pension of 400, but
                    in spite of friendly help and introductions Millet went through great
                    difficulties. The system of the École des Beaux Arts was hateful to him, and it
                    was not until after much hesitation that he decided to enter an official
                    studio—that of Delaroche. The master was certainly puzzled by his pupil; he saw
                    his ability, and, when Millet in his poverty could not longer pay the monthly
                    fees, arranged for his free admission to the studio, but he tried in vain to
                    make him take the approved direction, and lessons ended with “Eh, bien, allez à
                    votre guise, vous êtes si nouveau pour moi que je ne veux rien vous dire.” At
                    last, when the competition for the Grand Prix came on, Delaroche gave Millet to
                    understand that he intended to secure the nomination of another, and thereupon
                    Millet withdrew himself, and with his friend Marolle started in a little studio
                    in the Rue de l ’ Est. He had renounced the beaten track, but he continued to
                    study hard whilst he sought to procure bread by painting portraits at 10 or 15
                    francs a piece and producing small “pastiches” of Watteau and Boucher. These
                    works are classed as those of his “flowery manner,” and Millet has been
                    reproached—-he whose whole life was an act of conviction—with having sacrificed
                    his convictions to curry favour with the public. It is true that he himself has
                    recorded his aversion to both these masters. “In the Louvre,” he said, “I
                    received vivid impressions from Mantegna, complete from Michelangelo; after
                    Michelangelo and Poussin I have remained faithful to the early masters.” Boucher
                    was for him an object of “repulsion,” and in Watteau “I saw,” he said, “a little
                    theatrical world which oppressed me.” Thus it was then that Millet naturally
                    felt and saw, but the strongest genius knows moments of self-doubt. Later in
                    life Millet was heard to say that were it not for the small group who believed
                    in him he should have lost faith in himself. In earlier years, before he was
                    certain of his own leading, he was naturally influenced by the advice of others
                    whose arguments were enforced by the pressure of dire poverty. Even so from time
                    to time the native vein showed strong. In 1840, as soon as he had despatched a
                    portrait to the Salon, Millet went back to Gré ville, where he painted Sailors
                    Mending a Sail and a few other pictures—reminiscences of Cherbourg life. His
                    first success was obtained in 1844 when his Milkwoman and Lesson in Riding
                    (pastel) attracted notice at the Salon, and friendly artists presented
                    themselves at his lodgings only to learn that his wife had just died, and that
                    he himself had disappeared. Millet was at Cherbourg; there he remarried, but
                    having amassed a few hundred francs he went back to Paris and presented his St
                    Jerome at the Salon of 1845. This picture was rejected and exists no longer, for
                    Millet, short of canvas, painted over it Oedipus Unbound, a work which during
                    the following year was the object of violent criticism. He was, however, no
                    longer alone; Diaz, Eugène Tourneux, Rousseau, and other men of note supported
                    him by their confidence and friendship, and he had by his side the brave
                    Catharine Lemaire, his second wife, a woman who bore poverty with dignity and
                    gave courage to her husband through the cruel trials in which he penetrated by a
                    terrible personal experience the bitter secrets of the very poor. To this date
                    belong Millet’s Golden Age, Bird Nesters, Young Girl and Lamb, and Bathers; but
                    to the Bathers (Louvre) succeeded The Mother Asking Alms, The Workman’s Monday,
                    and The Winnower. This last work, exhibited in 1848, obtained conspicuous
                    success, but did not sell till Ledru Rollin, informed of the painter’s dire
                    distress, gave him 500 francs for it, and accompanied the purchase with a
                    commission, the money for which enabled Millet to leave Paris for Barbizon, a
                    village on the skirts of the forest of Fontainebleau. There he settled in a
                    three-roomed cottage for the rest of his life—twenty-seven years, in which he
                    wrought out the perfect story of that peasant life of which he alone has given a
                    “complete impression.” Jules Breton has coloured the days of toil with
                    sentiment; others, like Courbet, whose eccentric Funeral at Ornans attracted
                    more notice at the Salon of 1850 than Millet’s Sowers and Binders, have treated
                    similar subjects as a vehicle for protest against social misery; Millet alone, a
                    peasant and a miserable one himself, saw true, neither softening nor
                    exaggerating what he saw. In a curious letter written to Μ. Sensier at this date
                    (1850) Millet expressed his resolve to break once and for all with mythological
                    and undraped subjects, and the names of the principal works painted subsequently
                    will show how stedfastly this resolution was kept. In 1852 he produced Girls
                    Sewing, Man Spreading Manure; 1853, The Reapers; 1854, Church at Gréville
                    (Luxembourg); 1855—the year of the International Exhibition, at which he
                    received a medal of second class— Peasant Grafting a Tree; 1857, The Gleaners;
                    1859, The Angelus (Louvre, engraved Waltner), The Woodcutter and Death; 1860,
                    Sheep Shearing; 1861, Woman Shearing Sheep, Woman Feeding Child; 1862, Potato
                    Planters, Winter and the Crows; 1863, Man with Hoe, Woman Carding; 1864,
                    Shepherds and Flock, Peasants Bringing Home a Calf Born in the Fields; 1869,
                    Knitting Lesson; 1870, Buttermaking; 1871, November—recollection of Gruchy. Any
                    one of these works will show how great an influence Millet’s previous practice
                    in the nude had upon his style. The dresses worn by his figures are not clothes,
                    but drapery through which the forms and movements of the body are strongly felt,
                    and their contour shows a grand breadth of line which strikes the eye at once.
                    Something of the imposing unity of his work was also, no doubt, due to an
                    extraordinary power of memory, which enabled Millet to paint (like Horace
                    Vernet) without a model; he could recall with precision the smallest details of
                    attitudes or gestures which he proposed to represent. Thus he could count on
                    presenting free from after thoughts the vivid impressions which he had first
                    received, and Millet’s nature was such that the impressions which he received
                    were always of a serious and often of a noble order, to which the character of
                    his execution responded so perfectly that even a Washerwoman at her Tub will
                    show the grand action of a Medea. The drawing of this subject is reproduced in
                    <hi rend="italic">Souvenirs de</hi><hi rend="italic">Barbizon,</hi> a pamphlet
                    in which Μ. Piédagnel has recorded a visit paid to Millet in 1864. His
                    circumstances were then less evil, after struggles as severe as those endured in
                    Paris. A contract by which he bound himself in 1860 to give up all his work for
                    three years had placed him in possession of 1000 francs a month. His fame
                    extended, and at the exhibition of 1867 he received a medal of the first class,
                    and the ribbon of the Legion of Honour, but he was at the same moment deeply
                    shaken by the death of his faithful friend Rousseau. Though he rallied for a
                    time he never completely recovered his health, and on the 20th January 1875 he
                    died. He was buried by his friend’s side in the churchyard of Chailly.</p>
