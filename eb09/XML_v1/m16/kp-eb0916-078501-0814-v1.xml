                    (1568-1643), the inventor of the “free style” of musical composition, was born
                    at Cremona in 1568; he was engaged at an early age as violist to the duke of
                    Mantua, and studied composition with some success under Ingegneri, the duke’s
                    “maestro di capella, ’ though without thoroughly mastering the difficulties of
                    musical science. His knowledge of counterpoint was limited, and his ear
                    imperfect, but he was a bold experimenter, and his undisguised empiricism led to
                    discoveries which exercised a lasting influence upon the progress of art. He was
                    the first composer who ventured to use unprepared dissonances,— employing them
                    first in his madrigals, the beauty of which they utterly destroyed, but
                    afterwards introducing them into music of another kind with such excellent
                    effect that their value was universally recognized, and all opposition to their
                    use effectually silenced. In 1603 he succeeded <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0815-0786"/> Ingegneri as “maestro di capella;” and in 1607 he
                    produced, for the marriage of Francesco Gonzaga, his first opera, <hi
                    rend="italic">Ariana,</hi> in which he employed the newly-discovered discords
                    with irresistible effect. Though he did not invent the lyric drama—Peri’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Euridice</hi> having been produced at Florence in 1600—he raised
                    it to a level which distanced all contemporary competition. His second opera,
                    <hi rend="italic">Orfeo,</hi> composed in 1608, was even more successful than
                    <hi rend="italic">Ariana,</hi> and was based upon a principle which is held by
                    some modern critics to embody the only law to which the dramatic composer owes
                    obedience—that of accommodating the music to the exigencies of the scene. In
                    1613 Monteverde was invited to Venice, as “maestro di capella”at St Mark’s. Here
                    he composed much sacred music, the greater part of which is lost,—a circumstance
                    the less to be regretted, since his <hi rend="italic">Vespers</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Masses</hi> bear no comparison with those produced by his
                    predecessors in office. In 1630 he wrote another grand opera, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Proserpina rapita.</hi> In 1639 he produced <hi rend="italic">I.’</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Adone,</hi> and in 1641 <hi rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Nozze di Enea</hi> and <hi rend="italic">II ritomo d</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ulisse.</hi> These later works show him still greatly in advance of his age,
                    notwithstanding the progress made by other composers since the production of <hi
                    rend="italic">Orfeo.</hi> Monteverde was ordained priest in 1633; and he died in
                    1643, universally respected. Though his free employment of the dominant seventh
                    and other unprepared discords put an end to the school of Palestrina, it led the
                    way to the greatest achievements of modern music.</p>
