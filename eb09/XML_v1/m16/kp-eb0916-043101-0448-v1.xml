                <p><label type="entry">MINERAL WATERS</label>. No absolute line of demarcation can
                    be drawn between ordinary and mineral waters. There is usually in the latter an
                    excess of mineral constituents or of temperature, but some drinking waters
                    contain more mineral constituents than others that are called mineral waters,
                    and many very pure waters, both cold and warm, have been regarded for ages as
                    mineral springs.</p>
                <p>As to the origin of mineral waters, there is much in what the elder Pliny said,
                    that waters are such as the soil through which they flow. Thus in limestone and
                    chalk districts an excess of lime is usually present; and the waters of a
                    particular district have much resemblance to each other—as in the Eifel, in
                    Auvergne, and in the Pyrenees. But this is only a partial explanation, for
                    waters are by no means necessarily uniform throughout a particular geological
                    formation. We do not know with any certainty the depth from which various
                    mineral waters proceed, nor the various distances from the surface at which they
                    take up their different mineral constituents.</p>
                <p>The source of the temperature of thermal waters remains a subject of much
                    uncertainty. Among the assigned causes are the internal heat of the globe, or
                    the development of heat by chemical or electrical agencies in the strata through
                    which they arise.</p>
                <p>Their occasional intermittence is doubtless often dependent on the periodical
                    generation of steam, as in the case of the Geysers. A few geological facts are
                    certain, which bear on the origin of mineral waters. Such springs are most
                    abundant in volcanic districts, where many salts of soda and much carbonic acid
                    are present. They occur most frequently at meetings of stratified with
                    unstratified rocks, in saddles, and at points where there has been dislocation
                    of strata.</p>
                <p>The diffusion of mineral waters is very extended. Pliny was quite correct in
                    observing that they are to be found on alpine heights and arising from the
                    bottom of the ocean. They are found at the snow in the Himalayas and they rise
                    from the sea at Baiae and Ischia. They are to be found in all quarters of the
                    globe, but more particularly in volcanic regions, as in the Eifel and Auvergne,
                    in the Bay of Naples, and parts of Greece, in Iceland, New Zealand, and Japan.
                    But there are few countries in which they are not to be found, except in very
                    flat ones and in deltas of rivers,—for instance, in the north of France, where
                    they are very few, and in Holland, from which they are absent. France, Germany,
                    Italy, and Spain, as well as Greece, Asia Minor, and the Caucasus, are all rich
                    in mineral waters. The British Isles have a fair though not very large
                    proportion of them. There are a few in Sweden and Norway. They are abundant in
                    the United States, less so in Canada. They are found in the Azores and in the
                    West India Islands. Of their occurrence in the interior of Africa or of
                    Australia we know little; and the same is true of South America. But they are
                    met with in Algiers, in Egypt, and in the Holy Land. The vast Indian peninsula
                    has for its size a comparatively small supply.</p>
                <p>As the effects of mineral waters on the bodily system have been found to be
                    different from those of drinking waters, an explanation of this has been
                    naturally sought for. It has been imagined that there is something special in
                    the nature of mineral waters, that their heat is not ordinary heat, that their
                    condition is a peculiar electric one. Some French modern writers even say that
                    they have a certain life in them, that their constitution is analogous to that
                    of the serum of the blood. But we must pass by these speculations, and be guided
                    as far as possible by ascertained facts, respecting the action on the system of
                    water, of heat and cold, and of the mineral constituents present.</p>
                <p>Mineral waters, when analysed, are found to contain a great many substances,
                    although some of them occur only in very minute quantities:—soda, magnesia,
                    calcium, potash, alumina, iron, boron, iodine, bromine, arsenic, lithium,
                    caesium, rubidium, fluorine, barium, copper, zinc, manganese, strontium, silica,
                    phosphorus, besides extractive matters, and various organic deposits known under
                    the name of glairin or baregin. Of gases, there have been found carbonic acid,
                    hydrosulphuric acid, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, and ammonia. Of all these by
                    far the most important in a therapeutic point of view are sodium, magnesia, and
                    iron, carbonic acid, sulphur, and perhaps hydrosulphuric acid. These substances,
                    detected separately by chemists, are in their analyses combined by fhem into
                    various salts, if not with absolute certainty, undoubtedly <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n449/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0449-0432"/> with a close approximation to it. Those
                    combinations are very numerous, and some waters contain ten to twenty of them;
                    but there are always some predominating ones, which mark their character, while
                    many of them, such as caesium, rubidium, or fluorine, occur in mere traces, and
                    can not be assumed to be of any real importance. Mineral waters therefore
                    resolve themselves into weaker or stronger solutions of salts and gases in water
                    of higher or lower temperature. For medical purposes they are used either
                    externally or internally, for bathing or for drinking. As the quantity of salts
                    present commonly bears but a very small proportion to that of the fluid
                    containing them, water becomes a very influential agent in mineral-water
                    treatment, about which it is therefore necessary to say something.</p>
                <p>For the action of hot and cold baths the reader is referred to the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Baths.</hi> But it may be observed here that, according to the
                    most generally received opinion, the cutaneous surface does not absorb any
                    portion of the salts in a mineral-water bath, although it may absorb a little
                    gas (an alkaline water, for instance, at most acting as a slight detergent on
                    the skin), and that neither salts nor gases have any action on the system,
                    except as stimulants of the skin, with partial action on the respiratory
                    organs.</p>
                <p>It seems to be ascertained that drinking considerable amounts of cold water
                    reduces the temperature of the body, diminishes the frequency of the pulse, and
                    increases the blood pressure temporarily. Water when introduced into the
                    stomach, especially if it be empty, is quickly absorbed; but, although much of
                    the water passes into the veins, there is no proof that it ever produces in
                    them, as is sometimes supposed, a state of fluidity or wateriness.
                    Therapeutically, the imbibition of large quantities of water leads to a sort of
                    general washing out of the organs. This produces a temporary increase of certain
                    excretions, augmented diuresis, and a quantitative increase of urea, of chloride
                    of sodium, and of phosphoric and sulphuric acids in the urine. Both the sensible
                    and the insensible perspirations are augmented. A draught of cold water
                    undoubtedly stimulates the peristaltic action of the intestines. On the whole
                    water slightly warm is best borne by the stomach, and is more easily absorbed by
                    it than cold water; and warm waters are more useful than cold ones when there is
                    much gastric irritability.</p>
                <p>In addition to the therapeutic action of mineral waters, there are certain very
                    important subsidiary considerations which must not be overlooked. An individual
                    who goes from home to drink them finds himself in a different climate, with
                    possibly a considerable change in altitude. His diet is necessarily altered, and
                    his usual home drinks are given up. There is change in the hours of going to bed
                    and of rising. He is relieved from the routine of usual duties, and thrown into
                    new and probably cheerful society. He takes more exercise than when at home, and
                    is more in the open air, and this probably at the best season of the year. So
                    important has this matter of season and climate been found that it is an
                    established axiom that waters can be used to the greatest advantage during the
                    summer months and in fine weather, and during the periods most convenient for
                    relaxation from business. Summer is therefore the bath season, but of late years
                    provision has been made in many places, with the aid of specially constructed
                    rooms and passages, for carrying out cures satisfactorily during the winter
                    season, e.y., at Aix-la-Chapelle, Wiesbaden, Baden Baden, Baden in Switzerland,
                    Dax, Vichy, and Bath. The ordinary bath season extends from the 15th of May to
                    the 2Oth or 30th September. The season for baths situated at considerable
                    elevations commences a month later and terminates some ten days earlier. Mineral
                    waters may be employed at home, but patients seldom so use them; and this
                    necessarily limits the time of their use. It is common to declare that the
                    treatment should last for such or such a period. But the length of time for
                    which any remedy is to be used must depend on its effect, and on the nature of
                    the particular case. It is found, however, that the continued use of mineral
                    waters leads to certain disturbances of the system, which have been called
                    crises, such as sleeplessness, colics, and diarrhoea, and to skin eruptions
                    known as <hi rend="italic">la poussée.</hi> This cause, and also certain
                    peculiarities of the female constitution, have led to the period of three weeks
                    to a month being considered the usual period for treatment. A certain
                    after-treatment is often prescribed —such as persistence in a particular diet,
                    visiting springs or climates of a different and usually of a tonic character, or
                    continuing for a certain time to drink the waters at home. It may be added that
                    the advantage of having recourse to mineral waters is often felt more after than
                    during treatment.</p>
                <p>Since improved methods of bottling have been discovered, and the advantage of an
                    additional supply of carbonic acid has been appreciated, the export of waters
                    from their sources has increased enormously, and most of the principal waters
                    can now be advantageously used at home. It may be added that many of the
                    artificial imitations of them are excellent.</p>
                <p>The history of the use of mineral waters can only just be alluded to. They have
                    been employed from the earliest periods, and traces of Roman work have been
                    found at most of the European baths which are now in favour,—at almost all the
                    thermal ones. Occasionally new springs are discovered in old countries, but the
                    great majority of them have been long known. They have varied in popularity, and
                    the modes of applying them have also varied, but less so than has been the case
                    with most of the ordinary medicines. Warm waters, and those containing small
                    quantities of mineral constituents, appear to have remained more steadily in
                    favour than any other class within the appropriate sphere of mineral waters,
                    which is limited to the treatment of chronic disease.</p>
                <p>The attempt has been made to range mineral waters according to their therapeutic
                    action, according to their internal or external use, but most generally
                    according to their chemical constituents so far as they have been from time to
                    time understood; and a judicious classification undoubtedly is a help towards
                    their rational employment. But their constituents are so varied, and the
                    gradations between different waters are so finely shaded off, that it has been
                    found impossible to propose any one definite scientific classification that is
                    not open to numberless objections. Thus a great many of the sulphur waters are
                    practically earthy or saline ones. Vet because they contain very minute amounts
                    of such a gas as hydrosulphuric acid, an ingredient so palpable as always to
                    attract attention, it is considered necessary to class them under the head of
                    sulphur. The general rule is to attempt to class a water under the head of its
                    predominant element; but if the amount of that be extremely small, this leads to
                    such waters as those of Mont Dore being classified as alkaline or arseniated,
                    because they contain a very little soda and arsenic. The classification in the
                    following table, which is that usually adopted in Germany, has the merit of
                    comparative simplicity, and of freedom from theoretical considerations which in
                    this matter influence the French much more than the German writers. The more
                    important constituents only are given. The amount of solid constituents is the
                    number of parts to one thousand parts of the water; the temperature of thermal
                    springs is added. The waters are classified as indifferent, earthy, salt,
                    sulphuretted, iron, alkaline, alkaline saline—with subvarieties of table waters
                    and purging waters.</p>

                <p>In addition to their solid constituents, gas is present in many waters in
                    considerable quantity. There is a little oxygen and a good deal of nitrogen in
                    some of them; the quantity of hydrosulphuric acid, even in strong sulphuric
                    waters, is wonderfully small; but the volume of carbonic acid present is often
                    very large,—for instance, in the case of Kissingen, Schwalbach, and Selters.
                    Carbonic acid is so generally diffused that it is practically a very important
                    agent in the therapeutics of mineral waters. Springs that contain it are far the
                    most agreeable to the taste, and consequently most popular with patients. The
                    immediate effect of the carbonic acid which they contain is that of pleasant
                    stimulation to the stomach and system, although it can scarcely be said to
                    approach, as some have thought, the slighter forms of stimulation from alcoholic
                    drinks. Extremely little appears to be known of its actual operation on the
                    system: a part of what is swallowed is returned by eructation, and a part passes
                    on to the intestines; whether any appreciable quantity reaches the blood is
                    doubtful. There is no question that carbonic acid increases diuresis.
                    Practically it is found to aid digestion, helping the functions of the stomach,
                    and in a slight degree the peristaltic action of the intestines. The increased
                    flow of urine may be caused by its favouring the absorption of water by the
                    stomach. In some baths carbonic acid is so abundant that precautions have to be
                    taken to prevent its tendency to accumulate on account of its heavy specific
                    gravity. Carbonic acid gas, used as a bath, proves stimulating to the skin and
                    to the general system; but its employment has not answered the expectations
                    formed of it.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Indifferent Waters</hi> scarcely vary in chemical qualities
                    from ordinary drinking water; but they are usually of higher temperature. Their
                    therapeutic action, which is mainly exercised through baths, has been explained
                    on the theory of peculiarities of their electric or thermal condition, about
                    which we know nothing definite, and on the presence in some of them of a large
                    quantity of nitrogen. It has also been ascribed to the various organic
                    substances in some of them, such as glairin, which when collected is sometimes
                    useful as a cataplasm. These waters are not often much drunk, but any efficiency
                    they may have in dyspepsia and perhaps in neuralgic diarrhoeas must be
                    attributed to the favourable action of hot water on the digestion. The waters of
                    this class, especially the hotter ones in the form of baths, are extremely
                    useful in resolving the effects of inflammation, in thickenings of the joints,
                    and in chronic rheumatism and gout. They also are often effective, especially
                    the cooler ones, in neuralgia and in some hysterical affections. They are
                    sometimes prescribed in urinary affections, in which case they probably assist
                    by dilution. The effects of many of these water's are aided by the baths often
                    being situated at considerable elevations and in out-of-the-way spots, whence

                <p><hi rend="italic">Earthy Waters.—</hi> These differ chiefly from the indifferent
                    waters in containing an appreciable quantity of salts, among which sulphate or
                    carbonate of lime or of magnesia predominates. The great majority of them are of
                    high temperature. They produce the same effects as the indifferent waters, but
                    are perhaps less efficacious in neuralgic affections, while they are more
                    employed in some of the chronic scaly eruptions. There was formerly a tendency
                    to consider these waters useful in urinary affections; but at the present day it
                    is only the colder ones that have come into repute for the expulsion of gravel
                    and biliary calculi and in the treatment of affections of the bladder generally.
                    Some of them have also of late years been considered to exercise a favourable
                    influence on scrofula, and to be useful in the early stages of pulmonary
                    phthisis. This has been attributed to the salts of lime present in them,
                    although it is known that most of its salts pass through the system unaltered.
                    Many of these baths, such as Lenk and Bormio, enjoy the advantages of great
                    elevation, but Bath, otherwise one of the best of them, lies low.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Salt Waters</hi> are so called from containing a predominant
                    amount of chloride of sodium. They also generally contain chlorides of magnesia
                    and of lime, and occasionally small amounts of lithium, bromine, and iodine.
                    They further often contain a little iron, which is an important addition. The
                    great majority of the drinking wells have a large supply of carbonic acid. There
                    are cold and hot salt springs. Sometimes they are used for drinking, sometimes
                    for bathing; and the double use of them is often resorted to.</p>
                <p>The normal quantity of common salt consumed daily by man is usually set down at
                    about 300 grains. The maximum quantity likely to be taken at any well may be 225
                    grains, but commonly not more than half of that amount is taken. The increase to
                    the usual daily amount is therefore probably not much more than one-third. Still
                    it may be presumed that the action of a solution of salt on an empty stomach is
                    different from that of the same amount of salt taken with food. Salt introduced
                    into the stomach excites the secretion of gastric juice, and favours the
                    peristaltic actions, and when taken in considerable quantity is distinctly
                    aperient. We thus see how it is useful in dyspepsia, in atony of the stomach and
                    intestines, and sometimes in chronic intestinal catarrh. Salt when absorbed by
                    the stomach appears again in the urine, of which it increases the amount both of
                    fluid and of solid constituents, especially of the urea. It seems therefore to
                    be pretty certain that considerable quantities of salt taken into the
                    circulation increase the excretion of nitrogenous products through the urine,
                    and on the whole accelerate the transformation of tissue. Salt is thus useful in
                    scrofula by stimulating the system, and also in anaemia, especially when iron is
                    also present. In some German stations, as at Soden, carbonated salt waters are
                    considered to be useful in chronic laryngitis or granular pharyngitis.</p>
                <p>Baths of salt water, as usually given, rarely contain more than 3 per cent, of
                    chloride of sodium, some of the strongest perhaps from 8 to 10 per cent. Their
                    primary action is as a stimulant to the skin, in which action it is probable
                    that the other chlorides, especially that of calcium, and still more the
                    carbonic acid often present, co-operate. In this way, and when aided by various
                    processes of what may be termed water poultices and packing, they are often
                    useful in removing exudations, in chronic metritis and in some tumours of the
                    uterus, and generally in scrofula and rachitis, and occasionally in some chronic
                    skin affections.</p>
                <p>The French accord high praise to some of their thermal salt waters in paralysis,
                    and sor e German ones are used in a similar λvay in spinal affections. The salt
                    waters are sometimes so strong that they must be diluted for bathing. In other
                    cases concentrated solutions of salt are added to make them sufficiently strong.
                    These waters are widely diffused, but on the whole Germany is richest in them,
                    especially in such as are highly charged with salt. The Kissingen springs may be
                    considered as typical of the drinking wells, and sea-water of bathing waters.
                    The air of saltworks and pulverization of the water are employed in German baths
                    as remedial agents.</p>
                <p>Salt springs are found in many quarters of the world, but the chief carbonated
                    groups for drinking purposes occur in Germany, and at Saratoga in America, where
                    very remarkable wells indeed are to be found. France and England have no springs
                    of this class. The stronger wells, used chiefly for bathing, occur where</p>

                <p>Almost all the above stations have several springs of various strengths: the cold
                    may be said to vary from 14 to 5'8 per cent, of chloride of sodium; the warm are
                    generally weaker, perhaps varying from 6∙8 to 1’6.</p>
                <p>there are salt-bearing strata, as in Germany, Galicia, Italy, Switzerland,
                    France, and England. Very powerful waters of this class are those of St
                    Catherines in Canada.</p>

                    rend="italic">bromine</hi> in salt waters is by no means infrequent, and they
                    appear in considerable quantity in some few. It is, however, extremely doubtful
                    whether any known spring contains a sufficient quantity of iodine, still more of
                    bromine, to act specially on the system, even if that action were not
                    necessarily superseded by the presence of the large quantity of other salts with
                    which they are associated. Some of the best known springs of the kind are
                    :—Chalies, Wildegg, Castrocaro, Hall, Adelheid’s Quelle, Krankenheil, Kreuznach,
                    Woodhall Spa.</p>

                    contain less than ’ 03. Many wells, especially in Germany, have a rich supply of
                    carbonic acid, which is unfortunately wanting in French and English ones.</p>
                <p>It has long been the prevalent idea that want of iron in the blood is the main
                    cause of chlorosis and of other anaemic conditions, and that these conditions
                    are best relieved by a supply of that metal. Since the detection of it in
                    haemoglobuline this view has been still more popular. It is pretty certain that
                    the blood contains 37 to 47 grains and the whole system 70 to 74 grains of iron;
                    and it has been calculated that in normal conditions of the system somewhat more
                    than one grain of iron is taken daily in articles of food, and that the same
                    amount is passed in the faeces; for although the stomach takes the iron up it is
                    excreted by the alimentary canal mainly, it being doubtful whether any is
                    excreted in the urine. It is possible by drinking several glasses to take in
                    more than a grain of carbonate of iron in the day, equivalent to half that
                    amount of metallic iron. It has further been ingeniously reckoned from practice
                    that 10 to 15 grains of metallic iron suffice to supply the deficiency in the
                    system in a case of chlorosis. It is thought probable that a portion of the iron
                    taken up in water is in certain pathological states not excreted, but retained
                    in the system, and goes towards making up the want of that metal. But, whether
                    this or any other explanation be satisfactory, there is no question as to the
                    excellent effects often produced by drinking chalybeate waters (especially when
                    they are carbonated), and by bathing in those which are rich in carbonic acid
                    after they have been artificially heated. As regards, the drinking cure we must
                    not, however, forget that carbonate and chloride of sodium, and also the
                    sulphate, are often present and must be ascribed a share in the cure. Thus
                    chloride of sodium is a power</p>

                <p>fui adjuvant in the strong Stahl Quelle of Homburg and in the Putnam Well at
                    Saratoga. A whole category of female complaints is treated successfully with
                    these waters. Indeed anaemia from any source, as after fever or through loss of
                    blood, and enlargements of the spleen, are benefited by them. The stimulating
                    action of the copious supply of carbonic acid in steel baths is a very important
                    adjuvant; no one now believes in direct absorption of iron from the bath. Iron
                    waters are scarcely ever thermal. They are extremely common in all
                    countries,—frequently along with sulphuretted hydrogen in bogs, and near
                    coal-measures. But such springs and non-carbonated wells generally are weak, and
                    not now held in much esteem.</p>
                <p>It may be added that some of the strongest known iron wells are <hi rend="italic"

                    astringent, and can only be used diluted. They are sometimes useful as an
                    application to ulcers and sores. Such springs have often been brought into
                    notice, but never retain their popularity. They are known in the Isle of Wight,
                    in Wales, in Scotland, as well as in Elba, &amp;c.; and of late years the
                    Bedford Alum and Oak Orchard Springs, U. S., have been brought into notice, the
                    latter containing 10 grains of free sulphuric acid in the pint. All such springs
                    have been considered useful in scrofula, anaemia, and chronic diarrhoeas.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sulphur Springs.—</hi> Waters having the odour of
                    hydrosulphuric acid, however slightly, are usually called sulphur ones. They owe
                    their smell sometimes to the presence of the free acid, sometimes to sulphides
                    of sodium, calcium, or magnesia, and sometimes to both. Hydrosulphuric acid is
                    absorbed more freely by cold than by hot water, and is therefore most abundant
                    in cold springs. The sulphides decompose and give off the gas. Most of these
                    springs occur near coal or shale measures, or strata containing fossils, or in
                    moors and in places generally where organic matter is present in the soil or
                    strata. Many of them contain so little mineral impregnation that they might as
                    well be classed among the indifferent or earthy waters. One group contains a
                    considerable amount of ehloride of sodium, another of sulphate of lime, while a
                    third has little mineral impregnation, but contains sulphides.</p>
                <p>Hydrosulphuric acid is a strong poison, and its action on the system has been
                    pretty well ascertained. It has been assumed that the gas in mineral waters acts
                    similarly, though in a modified degree; but there is next to nothing absolutely
                    known of the action of the small quantities of the gas that are present in
                    mineral waters, and which certainly have no toxic effect. It has been assumed
                    that this gas has some special action on the portal system and so on the liver.
                    On the connexion of metallic poisoning with the liver has been founded the idea
                    that sulphur waters are useful in metallic intoxication. Drinking large
                    quantities of these waters, especially of such as contain sulphates or chlorides
                    of sodium or magnesia, combined with hot baths and exercise, may help to break
                    up albuminates, but there is no proof of the action of the sulphur.</p>
                <p>For similar reasons, and primarily to counteract mercurial poison, sulphur waters
                    have been considered useful in syphilis. But it may be well to remember that at
                    most baths mercury is used along with them. No doubt they are frequently, like
                    other warm waters, useful in bringing out old eruptions, acting in this way as a
                    test for syphilitic poison, and in indicating the treatment that may be</p>

                <p>required. Sulphur waters, both hot and cold, are used in gout and rheumatism, in
                    dyspepsia, in hepatic and cutaneous affections; and of late years inhalation of
                    them has been popular in phthisis and in laryngeal affections. They have long
                    been popular remedies in cutaneous affections. While so much doubt has been cast
                    on the action of the sulphur of these waters, it may be admitted that the
                    sulphides are probably decomposed in the stomach and hydrosulphuric acid
                    generated. That gas is probably a slight stimulant to the intestine. What
                    hydrosulphuric acid reaches the blood is eliminated by the lungs. There seems to
                    be no doubt that the gas is absorbed in small quantities by the skin.</p>
                <p>It is in sulphur waters chiefly that glairin and baregin occur. This peculiar
                    organic substance has been found both in American and in European springs. Cold
                    sulphur springs are very widely diff used throughout the world. Thermal ones are
                    not so common. Perhaps the largest though not the strongest group of the latter
                    is to be found in the Pyrenees. We may remark again how very little
                    hydrosulphuric acid there is in many of the most favourite sulphur springs,
                    including the very popular White Sulphur ones of Virginia. There seems to be
                    something peculiarly unsatisfactory in the analysis of sulphur waters, and there
                    has been difficulty in constructing the following imperfect tables.</p>
                <p>Some of the most powerful cold wells are those of Chalies (with its very peculiar
                    water), Leuk, and Harrogate. Uriage has a very large amount of chloride of
                    sodium in its springs. Cold sulphur waters are on the whole more used in liver
                    and indigestion than warm ones. The general effects of warm sulphur waters
                    differ so little at the various baths as to make it difficult to mention
                    anything special to particular localities. Schinznach has a reputation in skin
                    complaints, Cauterets, Eaux Bonnes, and Chalies in laryngeal affections, the two
                    Aixes, Luchon, and Archena in syphilis.</p>

                    bicarbonate) of soda, along with an excess of carbonic acid. Of the action of
                    those carbonates it is known that when taken into the stomach they are
                    neutralized by the gastric juice, and converted into chloride of sodium. On
                    their introduction into the stomach they produce an increased flow of gastric
                    juice. If given during or immediately after meals in any quantity, they impede
                    digestion. They slightly increase peristaltic action, but only feebly, unless
                    assisted by other salts. They act slightly as diuretics. Of the connexion
                    between the biliary system and alkalies, which undoubtedly exists, not much is

                <p>lowered state of the system, or whether they have any direct tendency to combine
                    with fat and carry off a portion of superfluous adipose tissue. Their excess of
                    carbonic acid, through its action on the stomach, favours the operation of
                    alkaline waters. They have been classed as follows :—(I.) simple alkalines,
                    where carbonate of soda is the main agent; (II.) waters containing in addition
                    some chloride of sodium; (III.) waters containing sulphates of soda or of
                    magnesia. All these classes may be said to be used in gout, lithi-asis,
                    affections of the liver, catarrh, and obstructions of the gall ducts, in
                    dyspepsia, chronic catarrh of the stomach, and diarrhoea, in obesity, and in
                    diabetes. Some of the waters of the second class are supposed to influence
                    bronchial catarrhs and incipient phthisis, while the more powerful sulphated
                    waters of the third class are especially useful in catarrh of the stomach, and
                    in affections of the biliary organs; of these only one of importance (Carlsbad)
                    is thermal. The rival cold waters of Tarasp contain twice as much carbonate of
                    soda. The cold ones are chiefly used internally, the thermal ones both
                    internally and externally. The latter, besides acting as warm water, slightly
                    stimulate the skin when the carbonic acid is abundant, and the carbonate of soda
                    has some slight detergent effect on the cutaneous surface like soap. These
                    waters are unknown in England. They are most abundant in countries of extinct
                    volcanoes.</p>
                <p>Classes I. and II. of alkaline waters may be said to have a subvariety in <hi
                    rend="italic">acidulated</hi> springs or carbonated waters, in which the
                    quantity of salts is very small, that of carbonic acid large. These table waters
                    are readily drunk at meals. They have of late years been so widely exported as
                    to be within the reach almost of every one. Their practical importance in aiding
                    digestion is in reality much greater than one could expect from their scanty
                    mineralization. They are drunk by the country people, and also largely exported
                    and imitated. They are very abundant on the Continent, and, although some of the
                    best-known ones enumerated below are German and French, they are common in Italy
                    and elsewhere :— Heppingen, Roisdorf, Landskro, Apollinaris, Selters, Brückenau,
                    Gieshübel, all German; St Galmier, Fougues, Chateldon, French.</p>
                <p>Associated with Class III. is that of the strongly <hi rend="italic"
                    >sulphated</hi> waters known in Germany as bitter or purging waters, which have
                    of late deservedly come into use as purgative agents. They are almost wanting in
                    France and in America, and there are no very good ones in England. The chief
                    supply is from Bohemia and Hungary. The numerous waters of Ofen are the
                    best-known, and some of them are stronger than the Hunyadi, of which an analysis
                    has been given in Table I. They are easily imitated. Some of the best-known are
                    Ofen, Püllna, Saidschütz, Friedrichshall, Birmerstoff, Kissingen.</p>
                <p>Two other classes of waters demand a few words of notice. The French have much
                    faith in the presence of minute quantities of arsenic in some of their springs,
                    and trace arsenical effects in those who drink them, and some French authors
                    have established a class of <hi rend="italic">arsenical</hi> waters. Bourboule
                    in Auvergne is the strongest of them, and is said to contain <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> ⅛th of a grain of arseniate of soda in 7 ounces of
                    water. Baden-Baden, according to Bunsen’s latest analysis, has a right to be
                    considered an arsenical water. It is, however, extremely doubtful whether the
                    small amounts of arseniate of soda which have been detected, accompanied as they
                    are by preponderating amounts of other salts, have any actual operation on the
                    system. The following are among the most noted springs :—Bourboule, Mont Dore,
                    Royat, Salies (Bigorres), Plombières, Baden-Baden.</p>
                <p>Of late years <hi rend="italic">lithium</hi> has been discovered in the waters of
                    Baden-Baden; and various other places boast of the amount of that substance in
                    their springs. Indeed a new bath has been established at Assmannshausen on the
                    Rhine in consequence of the discovery of a weak alkaline spring containing some
                    lithium. Not very much is known of the action of lithium in ordinary medicine,
                    and it undoubtedly does not exist in medicinal doses even in the strongest
                    springs. Among these springs are those of Baden-Baden, Assmannshausen, Elster,
                    Royat, Ballston Spa, and Saratoga (U.S.).</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">American Mineral Waters.</hi> —The number of springs in the
                    United States and Canada to which public attention has been called on account of
                    their supposed therapeutic virtues is very large, amounting in all to more than
                    three hundred. Of this number comparatively few are in Canada, and of these not
                    more than six (St Catharines, Caledonia, Plantagenet, Caxton, Charlottesville,
                    and Sandwich) have attained general celebrity. The first three belong to the
                    saline class, the Caxton is alkaline-saline, and the last two are sulphur
                    waters. The St Catherines is remarkable for the very large amounts of sodium,
                    calcium, and magnesium chlorides which it contains, its total salts (450 grains
                    in the pint) being more than three times the quantity contained in the
                    brine-baths of Kreuznach in Prussia. The Charlottesville and Sandwich springs
                    likewise surpass the noted sulphur-waters of Europe in their excessive
                    percentages of sulphuretted hydrogen, the former containing more than 3 and the
                    latter 4 ’ 72 cubic inches of this gas in the pint.</p>
                <p>The mineral springs in the United States are very unequally distributed, by far
                    the larger number of those which are in high medical repute occurring along the
                    Appalachian chain of mountains, and more especially on or near this chain where
                    it passes through the States of Virginia, West Virginia, and New York. The
                    Devonian and Silurian formations which overlie the Eozoic rocks along the course
                    of the Appalachian chain have been greatly fissured—the faulting of the strata
                    being in some places of enormous magnitude —by the series of upheavals which
                    gave rise to the many parallel mountain ridges of the Appalachians. In many
                    places the springs occur directly along the lines of fault. The various classes
                    of mineral waters are likewise very unequally represented, the alkaline springs,
                    and those containing Glauber and Epsom salts, being much inferior to their
                    European representatives. On the other hand, the very numerous and abundant
                    springs of Saratoga compare very favourably with the Selters and similar saline
                    waters, and among the many American chalybeate springs the subclass represented
                    by the Rockbridge Alum is unequalled in regard to the very large percentages of
                    alumina and sulphuric acid, which it contains. Besides its greater amount of
                    mineral constituents (135 grains per pint), the Ballston spring surpasses the
                    similar saline waters of Homburg, Kissingen, Wiesbaden, and Selters in its
                    percentage of carbonic acid (53 cubic inches). It is also remarkable for the
                    very large proportion of carbonate of lithia, amounting to 0 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 701 grains. Thermal springs are specially numerous in
                    the territories west of the Mississippi and in California. Those in the east
                    mostly occur in Virginia along the southern portion of the Appalachian chain; in
                    the middle and New England States Lebanon is the only important thermal spring.
                    Subjoined is a list of thirty American springs, the design being to represent as
                    many of the more noted spas as possible, while at the same time enumerating the
                    best representatives of the classes and subclasses into which mineral waters are
                    divided according to the German method of classification.</p>
