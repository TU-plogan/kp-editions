                <p><label type="entry">MERCURIAL AIR-PUMP</label>. This name is given to two
                    distinct instruments, one of which is founded on statical, the other on
                    hydrodynamical principles.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">The Statical Pump.—</hi> The famous spiritualist Swedenborg
                    was the first to conceive an air-pump in which a mass of mercury, by being made
                    to rise and fall alternately within a vertical vessel, should do the work which
                    in the ordinary instrument is assigned to the piston. He published a description
                    of his pump in 1722; but it is questionable whether his design was ever
                    realized. Of numerous subsequent inventions the only one which, in fact, has
                    survived is the admirably simple and yet efficient instrument first described in
                    1858, but constructed some time before, by H. Geisler of Bonn, which at once,
                    and justly, met with universal acceptance.</p>
                <p>The general scheme of Geisler’s pump is shown in fig. 1. A and B are pear-shaped
                    glass vessels connected by a long narrow india-rubber tube, which must be
                    sufficiently strong in the body (or strengthened by a linen coating) to stand an
                    outward pressure of 1 to 1⅜ atmospheres. A terminates below in a narrow vertical
                    tube <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> which is a few ∣ inches longer than the height of
                    the ' barometer, and to the lower end of this tube the india-rubber tube is
                    attached which connects A with B. To· the upper end of A is soldered a glass
                    two-way stop-cock, by turning which the vessel A can either be made to
                    communicate through s and a hole in the hollow cock with the vessel to be
                    exhausted (I., fig. 2), or through <hi rend="italic">g</hi> with the atmosphere
                    (II., fig. 2), or can be shut off from both when the cock holds an intermediate
                    position. The apparatus, after having been carefully cleaned and dried, is
                    charged with pure and dry mercury, which must next be worked backwards and
                    forwards between A and B to remove all the air-bells. The air is then driven out
                    of A by lifting B to a sufficient level, turning the cock into position II., and
                    letting the mercury flow into A until it gets to the other side of the
                    stop-cock, which is then placed in the intermediate position. Supposing the
                    vessel to be exhausted to have already been securely connected with <hi
                    rend="italic">b,</hi> we now lower the reservoir B so as to reduce the pressure
                    in A sufficiently below the tension in the gas to be sucked in, and, by turning
                    the cock into position I., cause the gas to expand into and almost fill A. The

                    into A, the metal strikes against the top without interposition of a gas-bell.
                    In a well-made apparatus the pressure in the exhausted vessel is now reduced to
                    - <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> ⅛ or <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> ⅛ of a
                    millimetre, or even less. An absolute vacuum cannot be produced on account of
                    the unavoidable air-film between the mercury and the walls of the apparatus.</p>
                <p>The great advantage of the mercurial over the ordinary air-pump is that it
                    evacuates far more completely than the latter, that it affords direct and
                    unmistakable evidence of the exhaustiveness of its work, and—last not least—that
                    it enables one to transfer the gas sucked out to another vessel without loss or
                    contamination, so that it can be measured and analysed. On account of this
                    latter feature more especially, the instrument is highly valued as an auxiliary
                    in gasometric researches. Without it the researches on which rests our present
                    knowledge of the gases of the blood could not have been earned out. The actual
                    instrument, as constructed for various kinds of work, has of course various
                    complexities of detail omitted in the above description. For these the reader
                    must refer to handbooks of practical physiology.</p>

                <p>As it takes a height of about 30 inches of mercury to balance the pressure of the
                    atmosphere, a Geisler pump necessarily is a somewhat long-legged and unwieldy
                    instrument. It can be considerably shortened, the two vessels A and B brought
                    more closely together, and the somewhat objectionable india-rubber tube be
                    dispensed with, if we connect the air-space in B with an ordinary air-pump, and
                    by means of it do the greater part of the sucking and the whole of the lifting
                    work. An instrument thus modified was constructed by Poggendorff (see his <hi
                    rend="italic">Annalen,</hi> vol. cxxv. p. 151, 1865), and another, on somewhat
                    different principles, by Prof. Dittmar (see the “<hi rend="italic">Challenger"

                <p>Even a Geisler’s stop-cock requires to be lubricated to be absolutely gas-tight,
                    and this occasionally proves a nuisance. Hence a number of attempts have been
                    made to do without stop-cocks altogether. In Töpler’s pump<note anchored="true"

                    vertical capillary glass tubes, soldered, the former to somewhere near the
                    bottom, the latter to the top of the vessel. These tubes, being more than 30
                    inches high, obviously act as efficient mercury-traps; but the already
                    considerable height of the pump is thus multiplied by two. This consideration
                    has led Alexander Mitscherlich <hi rend="italic">{Pogg. Ann.,</hi> cl. 420,
                    1873), and quite lately F. Neisen <hi rend="italic">{Z. f.</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    stop-cocks. As glass floats on mercury, such valves do not necessarily detract
                    from the exhaustive power of the pump.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">The Dynamic Pump.—</hi> This was invented in 1865 by H.
                    Sprengel. The instrument, in its original (simplest) form (fig. 3), consists of
                    a vertical capillary glass tube <hi rend="italic">a</hi> of about 1 mm. bore,
                    provided with a lateral branch <hi rend="italic">b</hi> near its upper end,
                    which latter, by an indiarubber joint governable by a screwclamp, communicates
                    with a funnel. The lower end is bent into the shape of a hook, and dips into a
                    pneumatic trough. The vessel to be exhausted is attached to <hi rend="italic"
                    >b,</hi> and, in order to extract its gas contents, a properly regulated stream
                    of mercury is allowed to fall through the vertical tube. Every drop of mercury,
                    as it enters from the funnel, entirely closes the narrow tube like a piston, and
                    in going past the place where the side tube enters entraps a portion of air and
                    carries it down to the trough, where it can be collected. If the vertical tube,
                    measuring from the point where the branch comes in, is a few inches greater than
                    the height of the barometer, and the glass and mercury are perfectly clean, the
                    apparatus slowly but surely produces an almost absolute vacuum.</p>
                <p>The great advantages of SprengeΓs pump lie in the simplicity of its construction
                    and in the readiness with which it adapts itself to the collecting of the gas.
                    It did excellent service in the hands of Graham for the extraction of gases
                    occluded in metals, and since then has become very popular in gas-laboratories,
                    especially in Britain. Many improvements upon the original construction have
                    been proposed. One of these which deserves mention is to pass the mercury,
                    before it enters the “falling” tube, through a bulb in which a good vacuum is
                    maintained, by means of an ordinary air-pump or a second ‘ <hi
