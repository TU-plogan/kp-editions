                    (1763-1813), the greatest general of the French republic after Napoleon and
                    Hoche, was born at Morlaix in Brittany in 1763. His father was an “avocat” in
                    good practice, and instead of allowing him to enter the army, as he wished,
                    insisted on his studying law at the university of Rennes. Young Moreau showed no
                    inclination for law, but revelled in the freedom of a student’s life. Instead of
                    taking his degree he continued to live with the students as their hero and
                    leader. In that capacity he became a person of political importance, and in the
                    troubles of 1787 formed the law students into a sort of army, which he commanded
                    as their provost. In 1789 he became yet more important, and commanded the
                    students in the daily affrays which took place at Rennes between the young <hi
                    rend="italic">noblesse,</hi> who protested against the mode of election to the
                    states-general, and the populace. Though he had hardly weight enough to be
                    chosen a deputy, he was elected one of the committee of correspondence with the
                    deputies at Paris. He was thus able to follow the course of events in the early
                    days of the Revolution, and was early impressed with the conviction that no
                    compromise with the court was possible, and a republic the only resource. These
                    opinions estranged him from his father, who belonged to the party of Breton
                    independence and preferred Brittany to France. At last, in 1792, at the call for
                    volunteers he organized a battalion, and was at once elected its commandant.
                    With it he served under Dumouriez, and in 1793 the good order of his battalion,
                    and his own martial character and republican principles secured his promotion as
                    general of brigade. Carnot, who had an eye for the true qualities of a general,
                    promoted him to be general of division in 1794, and gave him command of the
                    right wing of the army which, under Pichegru, was destined to drive the English
                    and Austrians out of Flanders by separating the Austrians from the English. This
                    wing was then to cover the occupation of Holland by the main army under
                    Pichegru. These operations established his military fame, and in 1795 he was
                    given the command of the army of the Rhine and the Moselle, with which he
                    crossed the Rhine and advanced into Germany. He was at first completely
                    successful, and won several victories, but at last had to execute before the
                    archduke Charles a retreat which only increased his fame, as he managed to bring
                    back with him more than 5000 prisoners. In 1797 he again crossed the Rhine, but
                    his operations were checked by the conclusion of the preliminaries of Leoben
                    between Bonaparte and the Austrians. It was at this time he found out the
                    traitorous correspondence between his old comrade and commander Pichegru and the
                    prince de Condé, which he foolishly concealed, and naturally has ever since been
                    suspected of at least partial complicity. After Fructidor the Directory ceased
                    to employ his service, until the absence of Bonaparte and the advance of
                    Suwaroff made it necessary to have some great general in Italy. Yet it was only
                    as chief of the staff that he served under Scherer and Joubert, and led back the
                    French army after the latter’s death at Novi. When Bonaparte returned from Egypt
                    he found Moreau at Paris, greatly dissatisfied with the Directory both as a
                    general and as a republican, and obtained his assistance in the <hi
                    rend="italic">coup d'etat</hi> of Brumaire, when Moreau commanded the force
                    which occupied the Luxembourg. In reward, the first consul again gave him
                    command of the army of the Rhine, with which he fought his last great campaign,
                    that of Hohenlinden, when his success was due rather to the splendid military
                    qualities of his generals and their troops, and his own tactical genius, than to
                    any inspiration of victory. On his return to Paris he married Mdlle. Hullot, an
                    ambitious woman, who gained a complete ascendency over him, and with the
                    enormous fortune acquired during his campaigns he purchased a luxurious hotel in
                    Paris and also Barras’s country-seat of Grosbois. His wife exercised an evil
                    influence over him, and collected around her all who were discontented with the
                    aggrandizement of Napoleon. This “club Moreau” frightened Napoleon, and
                    encouraged the royalists; but Moreau, though not unwilling to become a military
                    dictator to restore the republic, would not intrigue for the restoration of
                    Louis XVIII. All this was well known to Napoleon, who seized the conspirators.
                    Moreau he treated with real leniency, and permitted to retire first to Spain,
                    and then to America. Here the general lived in great content for seven years,
                    when his wife, who could not allow him to rest, made him enter into negotiations
                    with Bernadotte, his old comrade, who was now crownprince of Sweden. At his
                    suggestion Moreau entered the service of the czar Alexander; and with Bernadotte
                    he planned the campaign of 1813. Fortunately for his fame as a patriot he did
                    not live to invade France, but was mortally wounded while talking to the czar at
                    the battle of Dresden on 27th August 1813, and died on 2d September. His wife
                    received a pension from the czar, and was given the rank of maréchale by Louis
                    XVIII.</p>
                <p>Moreau’s fame as a general stands very high, and from his marvellous coolness in
                    conducting retreats he has been called the general of retreats. His combinations
                    were splendid, and his temper always unruffled when most closely pressed; but he
                    lacked the sudden spirit of seizing a victory which distinguished Napoleon in
                    his early campaigns. Moreau was a sincere republican, though his own father was
                    guillotined in the Terror; and the army of the Rhine was the hotbed of
                    republicanism, as that of Italy was the great support of a military tyranny. As
                    a man, he was little given to personal ambition till his marriage, and would
                    probably not only have served Napoleon well but moderated his tendency to
                    absolutism by his very existence, had not his wife ruined any such hope by
                    involving him in intrigues. He was fortunate in the moment of his death, though
                    he would have been more so had he died in America. He seems by his final ¾ <hi

                    not to have .regretted being removed from his equivocal position as a general in
                    arms against his country.</p>
