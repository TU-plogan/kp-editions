                    whose life fell between 1550 and 1610, was the last of the series of Scottish
                    poets who flourished in the 16th century under the patronage of the Jameses.
                    With the union of the crowns, and the transference of James VI. from Edinburgh
                    to London, court favour was withdrawn from Lowland Scotch; it practically ceased
                    to be a literary language, and no poetry of mark was written in the dialect, if
                    we except that of Allan Ramsay’s school, till it reappeared in literature as the
                    instrument of the Ayrshire peasant. By a curious coincidence, Montgomery seems
                    to have been, like Burns, a native of Ayrshire. A commendatory sonnet from his
                    pen, extravagantly flattering, as was the custom of the time, was printed with
                    King James’s <hi rend="italic">Essays of a Prentice</hi> in 1584; he received a
                    pension from the crown a few years later, fell into disgrace apparently for a
                    time, was reinstated in favour, and accompanied his patron to England. As might
                    be expected from the poet of a court where the king himself was a keen critic,
                    Montgomery’s miscellaneous poems show a careful attention to form; he tried many
                    metrical experiments, and managed many complicated staves with skill. The sonnet
                    form, at that time a leading fashion in English verse, was also cultivated at
                    the Scottish court, and Montgomery’s sonnets possess considerable merit. His
                    most successful poem, published in 1597, and frequently reprinted in Scotland,
                    was the allegory of <hi rend="italic">The Cherry and the Sloe.</hi> The poet,
                    smitten by Cupid, conceives a longing for some cherries, beautiful fruit, but
                    growing high up on a steep and dangerous bank, above a roaring waterfall. Shall
                    he climb and win? Hope and courage and will urge him to try; dread and danger
                    and despair counsel him to be content with the humbler fruit of the sloe, which
                    grows within easy reach. Experience, reason, wit, and skill debate the question.
