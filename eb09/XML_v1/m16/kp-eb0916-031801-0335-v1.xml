                <p><label type="entry">MILLER, <hi rend="smallcaps">Hugh</hi></label> (1802-1856),
                    eminent in science and literature, and one of the most remarkable among
                    self-taught men of genius, was born at Cromarty, on the northeast coast of
                    Scotland, on the 10th of October 1802. His father, a sagacious and strong-willed
                    seaman, who earned a livelihood by sailing his own sloop, perished at sea when
                    Hugh was five years old. His mother looked much, in the upbringing of her son,
                    to her two brothers, James and Alexander Wright, the one a saddler, the other a
                    carpenter. Scrupulous integrity, sincere religion, unflagging industry, and
                    resolute contentment were the lessons which these men, not so much by precept as
                    by example, impressed upon the boy. But young Miller had inherited from his
                    father a strong individuality and obstinate force of will, and began at a very
                    early age to take a line of his own. The enchantment of open air and freedom—the
                    irresistible charm of mother nature on the hill and by the sea—made him at
                    thirteen an incorrigible truant; and his schoolmaster thought it likely that he
                    would prove a dunce. Nevertheless the truant schoolboy was already giving
                    indications of the destination of the man. At an age too early to date he had
                    found in his pen a divining rod that led him to waters of inexhaustible delight.
                    His mother summed up, in the singular dialect of the district, the impression
                    derived from her son’s boyhood and youth in the words, “he was aye vritin.” But
                    the writing from the first, and increasingly as time went on, could be
                    discriminated from the ordinary productions of boyhood. A continuity of idea, an
                    indefinable grace and freshness, marked his performances. They were never
                    bombastic or verbose. At no period of his life did he suffer from a flux of
                    words. But, boy and man, he had a felicitous knack of fitting words into their
                    right places and avoiding jerkiness and inequality. In verse he lacked the
                    passionate intensity required for true rhythmic movement, but he had a fine
                    sense of cadence and modulation in prose.</p>
                <p>It is a curious fact that what determined Hugh Miller to apprentice himself to a
                    stone-mason was his delight in literary composition. Unemployed during the
                    winter frosts, the mason, he perceived, could enjoy for some months every year
                    the ecstacy of writing. One result of his decision was that he never learned any
                    language but English. Another was that fifteen years of the quarry and the
                    hewing-shed, with stern experiences of over-work and privation, sowed in his
                    frame the seeds of incurable disease. Meanwhile the advantages of his decision
                    were indisputable. Under the discipline of labour the refractory schoolboy
                    became a thoughtful, sober-minded man. Miller always looked back to his years of
                    hand-labour with a satisfaction that has something in it of solemnity and
                    pathos. “Noble, upright, self-relying toil,” he exclaims; “who that knows thy
                    solid worth and value would be ashamed of thy hard hands, and thy soiled
                    vestments, and thy obscure tasks,— thy humble cottage, and hard couch, and
                    homely fare !”</p>
                <p>It cannot be added that his fifteen years of close and constant intercourse with
                    fellow-workmen inspired him with much respect for their class. He was most
                    unfortunate in his comrades during the two seasons, 1824 and 1825, when he
                    worked at Niddrie in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh. Swinish in their
                    enjoyments, meanly selfish in their class ambitions, and fatuously subject to
                    talking charlatans, that Niddrie squad of reprobates which he describes in √l∕y
                    <hi rend="italic">Schools and Schoolmasters</hi> stamped on the mind of Hugh
                    Miller an indelible conviction of the incapacity and degradation of the
                    hand-workers.</p>
                <p>Returning to Cromarty, he worked in happy patience as a stone-cutter year after
                    year, sedulously prosecuting at the same time the grand object of his ambition,
                    to write good English. He found time to invigorate and enrich his mind by
                    careful reading, and was habitually and keenly observant both of man and of
                    nature. His reading was not extensive but well chosen, and embraced Locke and
                    Hume; Goldsmith and Addison were, more than any others, his masters in style. It
                    was to get time to write that he had become a stone-mason; another of the
                    surprises of his career is that it was in advertising himself as a mason that he
                    came before the world as a literary man. A stonemason, figuring as a poetical
                    contributor to the <hi rend="italic">Inverness Courier,</hi> might, he thought,
                    be asked by some of the readers to engrave inscriptions on tombs. He therefore
                    forwarded some of his verses to the editor. These seem to have been consigned to
                    the waste-paper basket, which had been the fate of an “Ode on Greece” offered to
                    the <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi> when he was at Edinburgh. Piqued by his
                    second failure, he now resolved, at all hazards, to see himself in print. In
                    1829 appeared the small volume containing <hi rend="italic">Poems Written in the
                    Leisure Hours of a Journeyman Mason.</hi> It procured its author the valuable
                    friendship of Mr Robert Carruthers, and was favourably noticed by the press.
                    Miller looked at his poems in print, and concluded, at once and irreversibly,
                    that he would not succeed as a poet. It was a characteristic and very manly
                    decision, proving that there was no fretting vanity in his disposition.
                    Doubtless also it was right. His field was prose. But, though his poems yielded
                    nothing in the way of fortune, they were a beginning of fame. The simple natives
                    of Cromarty began to think him a wonder. Some very eloquent<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0336-0319"/> letters on the herring fishery extended his
                    reputation. Good judges in Edinburgh detected in his work the mint-mark of
                    genius, and Miller’s first prose volume, <hi rend="italic">Scenes and Legends of
                    Cromarty,</hi> was published there in 1835. In the interval he had become the
                    accepted lover of Miss Lydia Fraser, a young lady of great personal attractions,
                    rare intellectual gifts, and glowing sympathy with all that was good and brave
                    and bright. Her affection naturally steadied him in his resolution to emerge
                    from the handworking class; the mallet and chisel gradually dropped from his
                    grasp; and when his prose venture appeared he was being initiated, in
                    Linlithgow, into the duties of a bank clerk. On his return to Cromarty he found
                    employment in the local branch of the Commercial Bank.</p>
                <p>He was a married man, and his tent seemed stably fixed at Cromarty, when the
                    agitation that preceded the Disruption of 1843 made the air of Scotland vibrate.
                    Miller loved his church, and deliberately esteemed her the most valuable
                    institution possessed by the Scottish people. Fervently as he had sympathized
                    with those who procured political representation for Scotland by the Reform
                    Bill, he still more fervently took part with those who claimed that Scottish
                    congregations should have no pastors thrust upon them. In the summer of 1839 he
                    wrote his famous pamphlet-letter to Lord Brougham; Dr Candlish read it with
                    “nothing short of rapture”; and the first days of 1840 saw Miller installed in
                    the editorial chair of the <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi> newspaper, published
                    twice a week in Edinburgh to advocate the cause of non-intrusion and spiritual
                    independence. He continued to edit the <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi> till his
                    death, which took place in the night between the 23d and 24th of December 1856.
                    Unremitting brain work had overtaxed a system permanently injured by the
                    hardships of his early mason life; reason at length gave way, and Miller died by
                    a pistol shot fired by his own hand. A <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>
                    examination, attested by four medical men of the highest character, evinced the
                    presence of “diseased appearances” in the brain; and he left a few words
                    indicating the form taken by the insane delusion which had mastered him.</p>
                <p>During the three years preceding the Disruption, championship of the church by
                    Miller did more, probably, than any other single agency to win for it the
                    suffrage of the Scottish people. Months before the day of separation, the name
                    “Free Church” was prospectively assigned to the party proposing to sever
                    connexion with the state; and, whether Hugh Miller suggested the name or did
                    not, he was one of the chief architects of the institution. Nor has the sequel
                    shown that his labour was vain.</p>
                <p>But long ere now an enthusiasm parallel in intensity with that which he felt for
                    his country and his church, and to which even his old literary enthusiasm had
                    become subservient, had taken possession of him. From infancy he had been a
                    keenly interested observer of all natural facts and objects, and during his
                    career as apprentice and journeyman mason he had accumulated a vast store of the
                    particular information belonging to the geologist. But it was not until later
                    that he expressly undertook the study of geology. We still find him, when
                    twenty-seven, laying down charts of study and production without a word about
                    science. When, however, he had convinced himself that his road to the stars was
                    not by poetry, and when the limited success of his prose tales and literary
                    essays in the volume on Cromarty suggested a profound misgiving as to the
                    adequacy of his purely literary materials to produce an important result, he
                    bethought him of his hoard of scientific knowledge, and addressed himself with
                    the concentrated energy of mature manhood to geological reading and geological
                    researches. These, in fact, were not new to him, and he was much impressed by
                    the interest excited among scientific readers by a geological chapter in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Scenes and Legends.</hi> His chief master was Lyell, whom he
                    reverenced henceforward as one of the greatest of living men. The principal
                    scene of his own investigations was the Cromarty district, where he ransacked
                    every wrinkle of the hill-side, and traced every stratum sawn through by the
                    watercourse, and where, on the beach at ebb, in indurated clay of bluish tint
                    and great tenacity, belonging to the Old Red Sandstone formation, he discovered
                    and dug out nodules which, when laid open by a skilful blow of the hammer,
                    displayed certain organisms that had never been seen by a human eye. He had
                    entered upon correspondence with Murchison and Agassiz; and “fellows of the
                    Geological Society and professors of colleges” had been brought by his
                    descriptions “to explore the rocks of Cromarty.” Along with the patriotic and
                    religious enthusiasm, therefore, that burned within him when he went to champion
                    his church in Edinburgh, there glowed, in the depths of his heart, not indeed a
                    stronger but a more gentle and perhaps a dearer enthusiasm for that science in
                    which, he felt persuaded, he had something of his own to say, something to which
                    the world of culture would be glad to listen. So early as September 1840 there
                    began to appear in the <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi> a series of articles
                    entitled “The Old Red Sandstone.” They attracted immediate and eager attention;
                    and the month was not at an end when, at the meeting of the British Association,
                    Murchison brought them under the notice of the geological section, presided over
                    by Lyell. Agassiz, already familiar from Miller’s correspondence with the
                    organisms described, contributed information respecting them, and proposed that
                    one of the most remarkable of the fossils should be called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pterichthys Milleri.</hi> Buckland joined warmly in the encomiums of Murchison
                    and Agassiz, vowing that “he would give his left hand to possess such powers of
                    description as this man.” The articles which met with so enthusiastic a
                    reception from the most eminent geologists in Europe formed the nucleus of a
                    book soon after published, and entitled <hi rend="italic">The Old Red
                    Sandstone.</hi> It established Miller’s reputation not only as an original
                    geologist but as a practical thinker of great sagacity, and as a lucid and
                    fascinating writer. He had at last fairly found his hand; it is impossible to
                    turn from the <hi rend="italic">Scenes and Legends</hi> to the new volume
                    without feeling that the spirit of the author has become more exultant, his
                    touch at once stronger and more free.</p>
                <p>During his seventeen years of residence in Edinburgh he published a variety of
                    books, all of them more or less geological, but claiming attention not on
                    account of their geology alone. His <hi rend="italic">First Impressions of
                    England and its People,</hi> the fruit of eight weeks’ wandering arranged in the
                    leisure hours of a hard-worked editor, will be best appreciated when we contrast
                    its grace and gentleness, the classic moderation of its tone, the quiet vivacity
                    and freshness of its observation, the sense and sentiment and justice of its
                    criticism, with the smartness of the ordinary newspaper correspondent, or the
                    vulgarity and the impudent omniscience of the conventional book of travels.
                    Apart from its masterly descriptions, partly geological partly scenic, and that
                    prose poem on the ubiquity of the ocean which, though brief, will compare not
                    unfavourably with select pages from Wilson or from Ruskin, its two passages on
                    Westminster Abbey and Stratford-on-Avon would alone suffice to prove that the
                    Cromarty stone-mason was a man of extraordinary genius. Of his autobiographical
                    volume, <hi rend="italic">My Schools and Schoolmasters,</hi> no opinion but one
                    has ever been expressed. It ranks among the finest masterpieces of its kind in
                    the English language.</p>
                <p>As a geologist his reputation is securely based upon his actual discovery of
                    important fossil organisms, one of which bears his name, and on his
                    contributions, thoroughly serviceable at the time they were made, to our
                    knowledge of the formation in which those organisms occur. His eye-to-eye
                    acquaintance with nature is attested on every page; and, if his enthusiasm does
                    not often rise into spray and surge of rapture, it is a deep ground-swell
                    perceptible in all he wrote. His powers of observation were singularly strong
                    and accurate, and were accompanied with the most careful reflexion and a fine
                    rich glow of imaginative vision. His discernment of the true position of the
                    ventral plate of <hi rend="italic">Pterichthys,</hi> when <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n337/mode/1up"

                    its being dorsal, affords one of the nicest illustrations to be found of an
                    observational faculty which reasons as wells as sees.</p>
                <p>He was also, in his principal geological books, <hi rend="italic">The Footsteps
                    of the Creator</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Testimony of the Rocks,</hi> a
                    polemical defender of theism and of revelation against some whom he regarded as
                    their deadly assailants. It would have been safe and pleasant for Miller to
                    waive all consideration of the religious question. He would thus have escaped
                    the dreaded sneer of the scientific expert. He would have escaped, also, the
                    cold suspicion of many on his own side; for the great mass of mediocre
                    religionists like nothing so well as the simple ignoring of difficulties and
                    hushing up of objections. But he shrank instinctively from the moral cowardice
                    of reserve. The advance of science has tended to compromise some of his
                    controversial positions. When he occupied the chair of the Royal Physical
                    Society of Edinburgh in 1852, he could look the most eminent representatives of
                    contemporary geology in the face, and claim their assent to the possibility of
                    drawing definite lines of demarcation between the Tertiary, Secondary, and
                    Palaeozoic strata. He could speak of “the entire type of organic being” as
                    altering between these periods. ‘ ‘ All on the one side of the gap,” he could
                    dare to affirm, “belongs to one fashion, and all on the other to another and
                    wholly different fashion.” In the thirty intervening years every form of the
                    cataclysmal scheme of geological progression has been discredited. It has become
                    impossible to obtain anything like a <hi rend="italic">consensus</hi> of opinion
                    among scientific men as to the placing of those frontier lines between period
                    and period which, however wide may be the margins of gradation assigned to
                    “morning” and “evening,” are indispensable to the maintenance of Miller’s theory
                    of the six-days’ vision of creation. “Geographical provinces and zones,” says
                    Professor Huxley, “may have been as distinctly marked in the Palaeozoic epoch as
                    at present, and those seemingly sudden appearances of new genera and species
                    which we ascribe to new creation may be simple results of migration.” Such is
                    now the received opinion of geologists, and we may be sure that Miller, who
                    never shut his eyes to an established fact, would have accepted it. He has said
                    in so many words that the Bible does not teach science.</p>
                <p>In the long and memorable debate on the origin of species he strenuously engaged,
                    maintaining, against the author of the <hi rend="italic">Vestiges,</hi> the
                    doctrine of specific creation. But when he did so he could feel that Buckland,
                    Sedgwick, Murchison, and Lyell were on his side; nor is it a paradox to allege
                    that he was an ally of Darwin himself. If the author of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vestiges</hi> was right, Darwin was wrong. In point of fact, the former was
                    very nearly right; but, precisely because Darwin supplies what is lacking in his
                    argument, those who intelligently assent to the <hi rend="italic">Origin of
                    Species</hi> are bound not to assent to the <hi rend="italic">Vestiges.</hi></p>
                <p>But it is chiefly perhaps in connexion with the sweetness and classical animation
                    of his style, and the lovely views he gives of nature’s facts, that we ought to
                    praise Hugh Miller. In an age prodigal of genius, yet abounding also in
                    extravagance, glare, and bombast, the self-educated stone-mason wrote with the
                    calmness and moderation of Addison. His powerful imagination was disciplined to
                    draw just those lines, and to lay on just those colours, which should reanimate
                    the past. As his friend Carruthers, an admirable critic of style, observed, “the
                    fossil remains seem, in his glowing pages, to live and flourish, to fly, swim,
                    or gambol, or to shoot up in vegetative profusion and splendour, as in the
