                    (1730-1803), an English musician of repute, was born at Exeter, in May 1730. His
                    father, a grocer, bestowed a liberal education upon him, but, on account of the
                    lad’s strong predilection for music, was induced to place him under the care of
                    John Silvester, the organist of Exeter Cathedral, with whom he remained about
                    two years. In 1748 he went to London, and studied under John Travers, organist
                    of the king’s chapel. Returning to Exeter, he settled there as a teacher and
                    composer, andin 1777 was appointed subchanter, organist, lay-vicar, and master
                    of the choristers of the cathedral. In 1755 he published his first work, <hi
                    rend="italic">Twelve Songs,</hi> which became at once highly popular. His next
                    publication, <hi rend="italic">Six Sonatas for the Harpsichord,</hi> was a
                    failure. His third work, <hi rend="italic">Six Elegies for three voices,
                    preceded by an Invocation, ινith an Accompaniment,</hi> was very successful, and
                    placed him among the first composers of his day. Dr Burney considered these as
                    the best of Jackson’s works, and added that “no composer copied less from others
                    than Jackson.” His fourth work was another set of <hi rend="italic">Twelve
                    Songs,</hi> now very scarce; and his fifth work was again a set of <hi
                    rend="italic">Twelve Songs,</hi> all of which are now forgotten. He next
                    published <hi rend="italic">Twelve Hymns,</hi> with some good remarks upon that
                    style of composition, although his precepts were better than his practice. A set
                    of <hi rend="italic">Twelve Songs</hi> followed, containing some good
                    compositions. Next came an <hi rend="italic">Ode to Fancy,</hi> the words by Dr
                    Warton. <hi rend="italic">Twelve Canzonets for two voices</hi> formed his ninth
                    work; and one of them—“Time has not thinned my Flowing Hair ”—long held a place
                    at public and private concerts. His tenth work was <hi rend="italic">Eight
                    Sonatas for the Harpsichord,</hi> some of which were novel and pleasing. He
                    composed three dramatic pieces,— <hi rend="italic">Lycidas</hi> (1767), <hi
                    rend="italic">The Lord of the Manor,</hi> to General Burgoyne⅛ words (1780), and
                    <hi rend="italic">The Metamorphoses,</hi> a comic opera produced at Drury Lane
                    in 1783, which did not succeed. In the second of these dramatic works, two
                    airs—“Encompassed in an Angel’s Form” and “When first this Humble Roof I knew
                    ”—were great favourites. Some of his church music, published after his death,
                    did not please the critics. In 1782 he published <hi rend="italic">Thirty
                    Letters on Various Subjects,</hi> which are well written and interesting. In
                    these he severely attacked canons, and described William Bird’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Non nobis</hi><hi rend="italic">Domine</hi> as containing passages
                    not to be endured. But his anger and contempt were most strongly expressed
                    against catches of all kinds, which he denounced as barbarous<pb break="no"

                    rend="italic">Observations on the Present State of Music in London,</hi> in
                    which he found fault with everything and everybody. He published in 1798 <hi
                    rend="italic">The Four Ages, together with Essays on Various Subjects,—</hi> a
                    work which gives a favourable idea of his character and of his literary
                    acquirements. It appears that he cultivated a taste for landscape painting, and
                    imitated, not unsuccessfully, the style of his friend Gainsborough. He died July
                    12, 1803.</p>
