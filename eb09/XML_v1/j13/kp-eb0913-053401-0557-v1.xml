                    (1824-1863), “Stonewall Jackson,” a distinguished Confederate general in the
                    American civil war, was born in Harrison county, Virginia, 21st January 1824,
                    and came of that Scotch-Irish stock to whose hardy virtues the middle States of
                    America are largely indebted for the pure and resolute virtues of their people.
                    His early education was only such as could be furnished by an obscure country
                    school. Thence he passed to West Point military academy, where, though he was at
                    first impeded by his meagre acquirements, his indomitable courage and
                    conscientious diligence eventually raised him to a foremost place. At West Point
                    he exhibited the qualities by which he was distinguished in the splendour of his
                    career,—courage, patience, constancy of purpose, inflexible fidelity to duty,
                    and an artless simplicity of character which engaged instant and universal
                    confidence. Graduating at twenty-two, he was appointed lieutenant of artillery
                    in the army of the United States, and participated, with distinction, in several
                    of the most important battles in Mexico. After the war he resigned his
                    commission, and accepted the professorship of natural philosophy in the Virginia
                    military institute at Lexington, a position which he held until the outbreak of
                    hostilities between the Union and the Confederate States. During his sojourn at
                    Lexington, he entered the Presbyterian communion, and was remarkable ever after
                    for the fervour of his religious devotion. In political discussions or
                    agitations, Major Jackson—such was his title by brevet—had never engaged; but in
                    principle and by profession he was a State-right Democrat of the Virginia
                    school; in other words, he maintained the legitimacy of negro slavery and the

                    Union, and therefore to the secession movement of 1861 he at once accorded his
                    sympathy. On the organization of the Virginia troops he was commissioned colonel
                    of infantry by Governor Letcher, who, long intimate with him, adequately
                    appreciated his yet undisclosed military genius.</p>
                <p>Jackson’s first exploit in the war of secession was the capture, on May 3, 1861,
                    of the Federal arsenal at Harper’s Ferry. Soon afterwards he received the
                    command of a brigade—the brigade which, by its immovable fortitude at Bull Run,
                    turned the tide of battle in that long doubtful struggle, and, from the
                    admiration of its comrades, extorted for itself and its chief the now historic
                    name of “Stonewall.”</p>
                <p>Detached from the army at Manassas for separate service in the Shenandoah Valley,
                    Jackson soon signalized his genius for war. Placing himself between the
                    converging columns of Shields, Milroy, and Banks, he struck one after the other;
                    and, with a force inferior to his adversaries separately, he eventually drove
                    them back upon Washington in utter defeat In this “campaign of the valley”
                    Jackson displayed true military instinct and the highest military art. By
                    vigilance, sagacity, celerity and secrecy of movement, and faultless tactical
                    skill on the field of battle, he achieved the greatest possible results with the
                    smallest possible means. His reputation was now fixed in the estimation alike of
                    friénd and foe; and, while the Confederate States were filled with the renown of
                    his achievements, the Federal forces were in constant terror of his prowess.
                    Having stayed the invasion of Virginia along the line of the valley, Jackson
                    repaired to Richmond to concert with Lee the deliverance of the Confederate
                    capital, then closely pressed by M <hi rend="superscript"> 4</hi> Clellan.
                    Appointed, meanwhile, to the command of a corps, he suddenly revealed himself on
                    the right flank of the Federal army at Mechanicsville; and in a series of
                    desperately fought engagements he routed the besieging army, and drove M <hi
                    rend="superscript"> i</hi> Clellan to shelter at Harrison’s Landing. Richmond
                    relieved, Jackson, without pause, hastened to confront Pope, who was menacing
                    the city from the north. In the battle of Cedar Run he inflicted signal defeat
                    upon that general, and compelled him to retrace his steps across the
                    Rappahannock.</p>
                <p>Reinforced by M'Clellan’s army and fresh troops from the northern States, Pope
                    made a stand at Manassas; but in the second battle on that field he suffered an
                    overthrow as decisive as that sustained by M‘Dowell in the first fight at Bull
                    Run. As usual Jackson’s corps bore the brunt of the battle; and as usual to his
                    skill and courage the Confederate army was mainly indebted for its success.
                    Following up the victory by the invasion of Maryland, Lee detached Jackson for
                    an attack on Harper’s Ferry, again in the hands of the Federalists, and
                    garrisoned by 12,000 troops. In a few days the surrender of the place, with all
                    its force and munitions of war, was announced to Lee, who, slowly retiring
                    before M'Clellan, anxiously expected the arrival of Jackson, that he might turn
                    and crush his pursuer. But before he could effect the desired junction Lee was
                    brought to bay at Antietam, and compelled to accept battle under every
                    disadvantage. Jackson now arrived, however, with two of his divisions, and his
                    presence not only averted an otherwise inevitable disaster, but rescued the
                    Confederate army from the destruction which awaited it if defeated with its rear
                    resting on the river. Henceforth Jackson’s operations were under the immediate
                    eye and command of Lee; and, while at Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville his
                    gallantry was as conspicuous as ever, to his illustrious chief belongs the glory
                    of those hard-fought fields.</p>
                <p>On the afternoon of May 2, 1863, Jackson fought his last battle. Executing a plan
                    of his own conception, he suddenly struck the flank of the 11th Federal corps,
                    and drove it pell-mell before him. Night fell with the hostile forces in close
                    proximity; and, while Jackson was making a reconnaisance with a view to pressing
                    the pursuit, he was fired on in the dark by men of his own command, and received
                    wounds of which he died on May 10, 1863. His death smote the Confederates with a
                    pang of unspeakable anguish. The fall of their foremost chieftain was bewailed
                    as the omen of the fall of the party.</p>
                <p>In deportment Jackson was grave and measured; but he relaxed on approach, and his
                    address was bland and gracious. In conversation he conveyed the impression of a
                    frank, firm character, and of an intellect clear and direct, but in no wise of
                    superior order. No opinion floated languidly in his understanding; he held all
                    his beliefs with an intense earnestness of conviction, and he was prompt and
                    resolute in carrying his convictions into action. He engaged in the war of
                    secession with an unfaltering faith in the justice of the cause and an
                    unhesitating persuasion of its triumph. He was the idol of his troops. At his
                    command they would cheerfully endure any sacrifice or confront any peril. On the
                    field of battle he was never known to lose his self-possession, or to be
                    surprised by any fluctuation of fortune; his quick eye would detect the exigent
                    moment, and his unerring judgment direct the decisive manoeuvre. <hi
