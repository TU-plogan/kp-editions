                <p><label type="entry">JONSON, <hi rend="smallcaps">Ben</hi></label> (for thus his
                    Christian name was usually abbreviated by himself and his contemporaries, and
                    thus, in accordance with his famous epitaph, it will always continue to be
                    abbreviated by posterity), was born about the ' beginning (N. S.) of the year
                    1573. By the poet’s account his grandfather had been a gentleman who “came from”
                    Carlisle, and originally, the grandson thought, from Annandale, where Johnstons
                    or Johnstones appear to have abounded, and where indeed at least one resident of
                    that name is noticed in the reminiscences of a later native of the border
                    district resembling Ben himself in the quickness of his temper and in his
                    impatience of pretences and pretenders,—the late Thomas Carlyle. Ben Jonson
                    further related that he was born a month after the death of his father, who,
                    after suffering in estate and person under Queen Mary, had in the end “turned
                    minister.” Two years after the birth of her son the widow married again; she may
                    be supposed to have loved him in a passionate way peculiar to herself, since on
                    one occasion we shall find her revealing an almost ferocious determination to
                    save his honour at the cost of both his life and her own. Jonson’s stepfather
                    was a master bricklayer in or near Westminster, who—whether or not he afterwards
                    constrained his stepson, while acquainting himself with the business into which
                    he had been admitted, to undergo the degradation of laying a few bricks with his
                    own trowel—certainly allowed him to lay for himself the foundations of a good
                    education. After attending a private school in the neighbourhood, he was sent to
                    Westminster school,—nor is it at all obvious why the master bricklayer should
                    have been denied the credit of having sent him there. Jonson’s gratitude,
                    however, for an education to which in truth he owed an almost inestimable debt,
                    concentrated itself upon the “most reverend head” of the illustrious Camden,
                    then second and afterwards head master of the famous school, and the firm friend
                    of his pupil in later life.</p>
                <p>After reaching the highest form at Westminster, Jonson is stated, but on
                    unsatisfactory evidence, to have proceeded to the university of Cambridge; but
                    at the utmost he can only have made a transitory appearance in a scene of which
                    as a painter of men and manners he nowhere reproduces a single feature. And
                    doubtless he felt that neither his crop of learning and experience nor his wild
                    oats were yet fully sown, when, goose quill or other implement in hand, he had
                    to apply himself to the family business. He soon had enough of it, and was
                    soldiering in the Netherlands, much to his own subsequent satisfaction when the
                    days of self- ·conscious retrospect arrived, but to no further purpose beyond
                    that of seeing something of the world. By the middle of 1597 we at last come
                    across documentary evidence of him at home in London, in the shape of an entry
                    in Henslowe’s diary on July 28th of 3s. 6d. “received of Bengemenes Johnsones
                    share.” He was therefore by this time, when Shakespeare, his senior by nearly
                    nine years, was already in prosperous circumstances and good esteem, at least a
                    regular member of the profession, with a fixed engagement in the Lord Admiral’s
                    company, then performing under the experienced Henslowe’s management at the
                    Rose. The traditions may very possibly be true according to which he had
                    previously acted at the Curtain (a former house of · the Lord Admiral’s men),
                    and “taken mad Jeronimo’s part” as a stroller. This latter appearance would in
                    that case have probably been in <hi rend="italic">The Spanish Tragedy,</hi>
                    since in <hi rend="italic">The First Part of Jeronimo</hi> Jonson would have had
                    to dwell on the “smallness” of his “bulk.” He was at a subsequent date (1601)
                    employed by Henslowe to write up <hi rend="italic">The Spanish Tragedy,</hi> in
                    pursuance of a fashion differing from that of later times, when old plays have
                    more usually been written <hi rend="italic">down</hi> to the taste of modern
                    audiences. Jonson’s additions, which were not the first changes made in the
                    play, are usually supposed to be those printed with <hi rend="italic">The
                    Spanish Tragedy</hi> in the edition of 1602; Charles Lamb’s doubts on the
                    subject are an instance of that subjective kind of criticism in which it is
                    unsafe to put absolute trust.</p>
                <p>Ben Jonson may be supposed to have married two or three years before the date of
                    Henslowe’s first entry of his name. Of his wife he afterwards spoke with scant
                    enthusiasm, and for one (undated) interval of five years he preferred to live
                    without her. Long burnings of “oil” among his books, and long spells of
                    recreation at the tavern, such as Jonson loved, are not the most favoured
                    accompaniments of family life. But Jonson was no stranger to the tenderest of
                    affections: two at least of the several children whom his wife bore to him he
                    commemorated in touching little tributes of verse; nor in speaking of his lost
                    eldest daughter did he forget “her mother’s tears.”</p>
                <p>Within a year’s time, or little more, from the date at which we first find Ben
                    Jonson in well-authenticated connexion with the English stage, he had produced
                    one of the most memorable plays in its history. <hi rend="italic">Every Man in
                    his Humour,</hi> the original example of a species of English comedy which
                    cannot be said to have become altogether extinct even with the Restoration, was
                    first acted in 1598 —probably in the earlier part of September—by the Lord
                    Chamberlain’s company, which was then still performing at the so-called Theatre,
                    and in which Shakespeare was just on the eve of acquiring one or more shares. He
                    certainly was one of the actors in Jonson’s comedy, and it is in the character
                    of Old Knowell in this very play that, according to a bold but ingenious guess,
                    Shakespeare is represented in the half-length portrait of him in the folio of
                    1623, beneath which were printed Jonson’s lines concerning the picture. <hi
                    rend="italic">Every Man in his Humour</hi> was probably followed by <hi
                    rend="italic">The Case is Altered,</hi> which was certainly acted by 1599, and
                    which contains a satirical attack upon the pageant poet Anthony Munday. Inasmuch
                    as the earlier of these two comedies was indisputably successful, and as
                    Jonson’s reputation was already sufficient to ensure him a mention in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Palladis</hi><hi rend="italic">Tamia</hi> of Francis Meres,
                    published in the same year, 1598, as one of the chief writers in tragedy (on the
                    strength of what play or plays is unknown), it was an awkward fatality that
                    before the year was out he should have found himself in prison and in danger of
                    the gallows. He had had the misfortune of killing in a duel, fought in Hogsden
                    Fields, for some cause unknown, an actor of Henslowe’s company named Gabriel
                    Spenser; possibly Henslowe’s uncourteous designation of Jonson as a “bricklayer”
                    may imply that the success of the new comedy at the other house had not been a
                    subject of congratulation at that to which its author had formerly belonged. In
                    prison Jonson was visited by a <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n775/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0775-0742"/> Roman Catholic priest—a prison being the most
                    likely place in which to meet a priest in those days; and the result was his
                    conversion to the Church of Rome, to which he adhered for twelve years. Jonson
                    was afterwards a diligent student of divinity; but, though his mind was
                    religious, it is not probable that its natural bias much inclined it to dwell
                    upon creeds and their controversies. Though in prison spies were set upon him,
                    which was then thought to be an admirable method for expediting justice, yet his
                    judges (he afterwards boasted) could get nothing out of him but “aye” or “no.”
                    And thus after a short imprisonment he was released, some time early in 1599, in
                    which year he is found back again at work for Henslowe, receiving, together with
                    Dekker, Chettle, and “another gentleman,” earnest-money for a tragedy called <hi
                    rend="italic">Robert II., King of Scots.</hi> It is of more importance that in
                    the same year he brought out through the Lord Chamberlain’s company (possibly
                    already at the Globe, then newly built or building) the elaborate comedy of <hi
                    rend="italic">Every Man out of his Humour,—</hi> a work which subsequently had
                    the honour, for which it was in some respects specially fitted, of being
                    presented before Queen Elizabeth. The sunshine of court favour, rarely diffused
                    during her reign in rays more than metaphorically golden, was not to bring any
                    material comfort to the most learned of her dramatists, before the inevitable
                    hand was laid upon her of which his courtly epilogue had besought death to
                    forget the use.. Indeed, of his <hi rend="italic">Cynthia's Revels</hi> (1600),
                    no doubt primarily designed as a piece of unctuous flattery to the address of
                    the queen, the most marked result had been to offend two playwrights of note
                    with whom he had formerly worked in company— Dekker, who had a coarse and
                    healthy grip of his own,jmd Marston, who was perhaps less dangerous by his
                    strength than by his versatility. Learning their intention, or at least that of
                    Dekker, to wreak literary vengeance upon him, he seems to have sought to
                    anticipate its effect by covering them with contemptuous ridicule beforehand.
                    <hi rend="italic">The Poetaster</hi> (1601), which he states to have been
                    completed fifteen weeks after the plot of it was first conceived, did not,
                    however, silence his adversaries; it rather gave them the opportunity of the
                    last word, which Dekker took in producing his <hi rend="italic">Satiromastix, or
                    the Untrussing of the Humorous Poet</hi> (1602). There was indeed an attempt at
                    some more last words on Jonson’s part; but on the whole he appears to have
                    thought (and very wisely) that the time for a season of silence had arrived for
                    him as a court poet. According to a statement by Overbury, early in 1603, “Ben
                    Johnson, the poet, now lives upon one Townesend” —who this generous patron was
                    we do not know—“and scornes the world.” That, however, he was not sulking in the
                    friendly tent with which he had been accommodated is shown by the fact that in
                    this year (1603) was produced at the Globe the earlier of his two extant
                    tragedies, <hi rend="italic">Sejanus,</hi> —Shakespeare once more taking a part
                    in the performance.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, in. the year which dates the tragedy eon-cerning the fall of the great
                    favourite, there had. begun a reign in England destined to be remembered as that
                    of favourites hardly less hated than he. Adulatory loyalty seemed intent on
                    showing that it had not exhausted itself at the feet of Gloriana, and Jonson’s
                    well-stored brain and ready pen had their share in devising and executing
                    ingenious variations on the theme “Welcome—since we cannot do without thee !” It
                    is very remarkable how promptly his genius, which it is sheer prejudice to
                    describe as wanting in flexibility and lightness, suited itself to the sudden
                    demands of the new taste for masks and entertainments—new of course in degree
                    rather than in kind —introduced with the new reign. The pageant which on the 7th
                    of May 1603 bade the king welcome to a capital dissolved in joy was partly of
                    Jonson’s partly of Dekker’s devising; and, having thus been prominently brought
                    into notice, he was able to deepen and diversify the impression by the
                    composition of masks presented to James I. when entertained at houses of the
                    nobility. He was soon occasionally employed by the court itself,— already in
                    1606 in conjunction with Inigo Jones as responsible for the “painting and
                    carpentry,”—and thus speedily showed himself master in a species of composition
                    to which he, more than any other of our poets before Milton, secured an enduring
                    place in our national poetic literature. Personally, no doubt, he derived
                    considerable material benefit from the new fashion, very valuable to poets in
                    days when there were no monthly magazines,— more especially if his statement to
                    Drummond was anything like correct, that out of his plays he had never gained a
                    couple of hundred pounds.</p>
                <p>Good humour seems to have come back with good fortune. Joint employment had
                    reconciled him with Dekker; and with Marston also he was again on good terms.
                    When therefore, in 1604, the latter and Chapman (who, Jonson told Drummond, was
                    loved of him, and whom he had probably honoured as “Virgil” in <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Poetaster')</hi> produced the excellent comedy of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eastward Ho,</hi> it appears to have contained some contributions by Jonson; at
                    all events, when the authors were arrested on account of one or more passages in
                    the play which were deemed insulting to the Scotch, he voluntarily imprisoned
                    himself with them. They were soon released, and a banquet at his expense,
                    attended by Camden and Selden, terminated the incident. If Jonson is to be
                    believed, there had been a report that the prisoners were to have their ears and
                    noses cut, and, with reference apparently to this peril, “at the midst of the
                    feast his old mother drank to him, and showed him a paper which she had intended
                    (if the sentence had taken execution) to have mixed in the prison among his
                    drink, which was full of lusty strong poison; and that she was no churl, she
                    told him, she minded first to have drunk of it herself.” Strange to say, in 1605
                    Jonson and Chapman, though the former, as he averred, had so “attempered” his
                    style as to have “given no cause to any good man of grief,” were again in prison
                    on account of “a play”; but they appear to have been once more speedily set
                    free, in consequence of the (very manly and dignified) letter addressed by
                    Jonson to the earl of Salisbury. Tn the same year he played a part—which had
                    till recently remained unknown, and is still in some measure obscure— in the
                    mysterious history of the Gunpowder Plot. On November 7th, very soon after the
                    discovery of the conspiracy, whose threads it became the immediate duty of the
                    council to unravel, that body appears to have sent for Ben Jonson, at the advice
                    no doubt of Salisbury, who (ashas just been seen) knew of Jonson; indeed, the
                    latter has been supposed to have given his support as a dramatist to the party
                    headed by Robert Cecil before Queen Elizabeth’s death. As a loyal Roman Catholic
                    Jonson was asked, and undertook to give, his good offices in inducing the
                    priests to do something required by the council,—one hardly likes to conjecture
                    it to have been some tampering with the secrets of confession. In any case, the
                    negotiations fell through, because the priests declined to come forth out of
                    their hiding-places to be negotiated with— greatly to the wrath of Ben Jonson,
                    who declares in a letter to Lord Salisbury that “they are all so en weaved in it
                    that it will make 500 gentlemen less of the religion within this week, if they
                    carry their understanding about them.” Jonson himself, however, did not declare
                    his separation from the Church of Rome for five years longer, however much it
                    might have been to his advantage to do so.</p>
                <p>His powers as a dramatist were at their height during <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0776-0743"/> the earlier half of the reign of James I.; and by
                    the year 1 SI6 he had produced nearly all the plays which are worthy of his
                    genius. They include the tragedy of <hi rend="italic">Catiline</hi> (1611),
                    which achieved only a doubtful success, and the comedies of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Volpane or The Pox</hi> (acted 1605), <hi rend="italic">Epicοene or The Silent
                    Woman</hi> (1609), the <hi rend="italic">Alchemist</hi> (1610), <hi
                    rend="italic">Bartholomew Pair</hi> (1614), and <hi rend="italic">The Devil is
                    an</hi> Ass (1616). During the same period he produced several masks, usually in
                    connexion with Inigo Jones, with whom, however, he seems to have quarrelled
                    already in this reign, though it is very doubtful whether the architect is
                    really intended to be ridiculed in <hi rend="italic">Bartholomew Pair</hi> under
                    the character of Lanthorn Leatherhead. In 1616 a modest pension of 100 marks a
                    year was conferred upon him; and possibly this mark of royal favour may have
                    encouraged him to the publication of the first volume of the folio collected
                    edition of his works (1616).</p>
                <p>He had other patrons more bountiful than the crown, and for a brief space of time
                    (in 1613) had travelled to France as governor to the eldest son of Sir Walter
                    Raleigh, then a state prisoner in the Tower, for whose society Jonson may have
                    gained a liking at the Mermaid Tavern in Cheapside, but for whose moral
                    character he, like so many of his contemporaries, seems to have had but small
                    esteem. Thus by the year 1616 Jonson seems to have made up his mind to cease
                    writing for the stage, where neither his success nor his profits had equalled
                    his merits and expectations. He continued to produce masks and entertainments
                    when called upon; but he was attracted by many other literary pursuits, and had
                    already accomplished enough to furnish plentiful materials for retrospective
                    discourse over pipe or cup. He was already entitled to lord it at the Mermaid,
                    where his quick antagonist in earlier wit-combats no longer appeared even on a
                    visit from his comfortable retreat at Stratford. That on the other hand Ben
                    carried his wicked town habits into Warwickshire, and there, together with
                    Drayton, made Shakespeare drink so hard with them as to bring upon himself the
                    fatal fever which ended his days, is a bit of petty scandal with which we may
                    fairly refuse to load his memory.</p>
                <p>It was in the year 1618 that Ben Jonson, like his great namesake a century and a
                    half afterwards, resolved to have a real holiday for once, and about midsummer
                    started for his ancestral country, Scotland. He had (very heroically for a man
                    of his habits) determined to make the journey on foot; and—imitation is the
                    sincerest kind of flattery—was speedily followed by John Taylor, the water-poet,
                    who still further handicapped himself by the condition that he would accomplish
                    the pilgrimage without a penny in his pocket. Jonson (who put money in his good
                    friend’s purse when he came up with him at Leith) spent more than a year and a
                    half in the hospitable Lowlands, being solemnly elected a burgess of Edinburgh,
                    and on another occasion entertained at a public banquet there. But the best
                    remembered hospitality which he enjoyed was that of the learned and refined
                    Scottish poet Drummond of Hawthornden, to which we owe the so-called <hi
                    rend="italic">Conversations.</hi> In these famous jottings, the work of no
                    extenuating hand, Jonson lives for us to this day, delivering his censures
                    freely in praise and blame, but by no means generously described in the
                    postscript added by his exhausted host as “a great lover and praiser of himself,
                    a contemner and scorner of others.” A poetical account of this journey, “with
                    all the adventures,” was burnt with Jonson’s library.</p>
                <p>After his return to England Jonson appears to have resumed his former course of
                    life. In 1619 his visits to the country seats of the nobility were varied by a
                    sojourn at Oxford with Corbet at Christ Church, on which occasion a master’s
                    degree was conferred upon him by the university. He confessed about this time
                    that he was or seemed growing “restive,” <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> lazy,
                    though it was not long before he returned to the occasional composition of
                    masks. The extremely spirited <hi rend="italic">Gipsies Metamorphosed</hi>
                    (1621) was thrice presented before the king, who was so pleased with it as to
                    grant to the poet the reversion of the office of master of the revels, besides
                    proposing to confer upon him the honour of knighthood. This honour Jonson
                    (hardly in deference to the memory of Sir Petronel Flash) declined, but there
                    was no reason why he should not gratefully accept the increase in his pension,
                    which was in the same year (1621) raised to 200 marks. Yet the close of king
                    James L’s reign found the foremost of the poets of the time in an anything but
                    prosperous condition. It would be unjust to hold “The Sun,” “The Dog,” “The
                    Triple Tun,” or the “Old Devil” with its Apollo club-room, where Ben’s supremacy
                    must by this time have become established, responsible for this result; taverns
                    were the clubs of that day, and a man of letters is not considered lost in our
                    own because he “haunts” a smoking-room in Pall Mall. Disease had weakened the
                    poet’s strength, and the burning of his library, as his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Execration upon Vulcan</hi> sufficiently shows, must have been no mere
                    transitory trouble to a poor man of letters. He thus thought it best to recur to
                    writing for the stage, and in 1625 produced, with no faint heart, but with a
                    very clear anticipation of the comments which would be made upon the
                    reappearance of the “huge, overgrown play-maker,” <hi rend="italic">The Staple
                    of News,</hi> a comedy excellent in some respects,., but little calculated to
                    become popular. In 1628, on the death of Middleton, some interest obtained for
                    him the appointment of city chronologer, with a salary of 100 nobles a year—an
                    office of which he appears to have considered the duties as purely ornamental,
                    inasmuch as in 1631 his salary was suspended until he should have presented some
                    fruits of his labours in his place, or—as he more succinctly phrased
                    it—“yesterday the barbarous court of aidermen have withdrawn their chandlerly
                    pension for verjuice and mustard, &lt;£33, 6s. 8d.” After being in 1628 arrested
                    by mistake on the utterly false charge of having written certain verses in
                    approval of the assassination of Buckingham, he was soon allowed to return to
                    Westminster, where it would appear from a letter of his “son and contiguous
                    neighbour,” James Howell, he was living in 1629, and about this time narrowly
                    escaped another conflagration. In the same year (1629) he once more essayed the
                    stage with the comedy of <hi rend="italic">The New Inn,</hi> which was actually,
                    and on its own merits not unjustly, damned on the first performance. The
                    epilogue dwelt not without dignity upon the neglect which the poet had
                    experienced at the hands of “king and queen”; and it is honourable to King
                    Charles I. that he should not only have immediately sent the unlucky author a
                    gift of a hundred pounds, but on receiving another more cheerful versified
                    appeal in response, should, have increased his standing salary to the same sum,
                    with the addition of an annual tierce of canary,—henceforth the poet-laureate’s
                    customary royal gift. But though he afterwards composed one or two little
                    entertainments, and even a comedy or two, there seemed little power left in his
                    palsy-stricken hand. The patronage of kind friends like the earl of Newcastle
                    was never wholly wanting to him, nor could he have ended in neglect. He was the
                    acknowledged chief of English literature, both at the festive meetings where he
                    ruled the roost among the younger authors whose pride it was to be “sealed of
                    the tribe of Ben,” and by the avowal of grave writers, old or young; not one of
                    whom would have ventured to dispute his preeminence. Nor was he to the last
                    unconscious of the claims upon him which his position brought with it. When
                    death came upon him on August 6, 1637, he left behind him an unfinished work of
                    great beauty, the pastoral drama.</p>

                    prologue, he had feasted the public; at first he could scarce hit its taste, but
                    patience had at last enabled it to identify itself with the working of his
                    pen.</p>
                <p>We are so accustomed to think of Ben Jonson presiding, attentive to his own
                    applause, over a circle of youthful followers and admirers, that we are apt to
                    forget the hard struggle which he had passed through before gaining the crown
                    now universally acknowledged to be his. Howell records, in the year before Ben’s
                    death, that at a solemn supper at the poet’s own house, where the host had
                    almost spoiled the relish of the feast by vilifying others and magnifying
                    himself, “T. Ca.” (Thomas Carew) buzzed in the writer’s ear “that, though Ben
                    had barrelled up a great deal of knowledge, yet it seemed he had not read the
                    <hi rend="italic">Ethics,</hi> which, among other precepts of morality, forbid
                    selfcommendation.” Self-reliance is but too frequently coupled with
                    self-consciousness, and for good and for evil selfconfidence was no doubt the
                    most , prominent feature in the character of Ben Jonson. Hence the combativeness
                    which involved him in so many quarrels in his earlier days, and which jarred so
                    harshly upon the gentler nature of Drummond. But his quarrels do not appear to
                    have entered deeply into his soul, or indeed usually to have lasted long.<note

                    quarrelling with whom, as Howell reminds Jonson, the poet was virtually
                    quarrelling with his bread and butter, he seems to have found it impossible to
                    live permanently at peace; his satirical <hi rend="italic">Expostulation</hi>
                    against the architect was published as late as 1635.</p></note> He was too
                    exuberant in his vituperations to be bitter, and too outspoken to be malicious.
                    He loved of all things to be called “honest,” and there is every reason to
                    suppose that he deserved the epithet. The old superstition, which may perhaps
                    still linger here and there, hardly needs notice, according to which Jonson was
                    filled with malignant envy of the greatest of his fellow-dramatists, and lost no
                    opportunity of giving expression to it. Those who consider that Shakespeare was
                    beyond the criticism of his contemporaries—as he certainly very frequently is
                    above that of posterity—may find blasphemy in the saying of Jonson that
                    Shakespeare “wanted art.” Occasional jesting allusions to particular plays of
                    Shakespeare may be fotmd in Jonson, among which should hardly be included the
                    sneer at <hi rend="italic">Pericles</hi>; but these amount to nothing
                    collectively, and to very little individually; and against them have to be set,
                    not only the many pleasant traditions concerning the long intimacy between the
                    pair, but also the noble lines, as noble as they are judicious, dedicated by the
                    survivor to “the star of poets,” But if Gifford had rendered no other service to
                    Jonson’s fame, he must be allowed to have once for all vindicated him from the
                    cruellest aspersion which has ever been cast upon it. That in general Ben Jonson
                    was a man of strong likes and dislikes, and was wonlr to manifest the latter as
                    vehemently as the former, it would be idle to deny. He was at least impartial in
                    his censures, dealing them out freely to Puritan poets like Wither and princes
                    of his church like Cardinal Duperron. And, if sensitive to attack, he seems to
                    have been impervious to flattery—to judge from the candour with which he
                    condemned the foibles even of so enthusiastic an admirer as Beaumont. The
                    personage that he disliked the most, and abused the most roundly to its face,
                    was unfortunately one with many heads and a tongue to hiss in each,—no other
                    than that “general public” which it was the radical mistake of his life to fancy
                    he could “rail into approbation” before he had effectively secured its goodwill.
                    And upon the whole it may be said that the admiration of the few, rather than
                    the favour of the many, has kept green the fame of the most independent among
                    all the masters of an art which, in more senses than one, must please to
                    live.</p>
                <p>Jonson’s learning and industry, which were alike exceptional, by no means
                    exhausted themselves in furnishing and elaborating the materials of his dramatic
                    works. His enemies sneered at him as a translator—a title which only a
                    generation earlier would have been esteemed of all literary titles the most
                    honourable. But his classical scholarship shows itself not only in his
                    translations from the Latin poets (the <hi rend="italic">Ars Poetica</hi> in
                    particular), in addition to which he appears to have written a version of
                    Barclay’s <hi rend="italic">Argenis</hi>; it was likewise the basis of his <hi
                    rend="italic">English Grammar,</hi> of which nothing but the rough draft remains
                    (the MS. itself having perished in the fire in his library), and in connexion
                    with the subject of which he appears to have pursued other linguistic studies
                    (Howell in 1629 is trying to procure him a Welsh grammar). And its effects are
                    very visible in some of the most pleasing of his non-dramatic poems, which often
                    display that combination of polish and simplicity hardly to be attained
                    to—hardly even to be appreciated— without some measure of classical
                    training.</p>
                <p>Exclusively of the few lyrics in Jonson’s dramas (which, with the exception of
                    the stately choruses in <hi rend="italic">Catiline,</hi> charm, and perhaps may
                    surprise, by their lightness of touch), his non-dramatic works are comprised in
                    the following collections. The book of <hi rend="italic">Epigrams</hi>
                    (published in the first folio of 1616) contained, in the poet’s own words, the
                    “ripest of his studies.” His notion of an epigram was the ancient not the
                    restricted modern one—still less that of the critic (R. C., the author of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Times' Whistle)</hi> in whose language, according to Jonson,
                    “witty” was “obscene.” On the whole, these epigrams excel more in encomiastic
                    than in satiric touches, while the pathos of one or two epitaphs in the
                    collection is of the truest kind. In the lyrics and epistles contained in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Forest</hi> (also in the first folio), Jonson shows greater
                    variety in the poetic styles adopted by him; but the theme of love, which Dryden
                    considered conspicuous by its absence in the author’s dramas, is similarly
                    eschewed here. The <hi rend="italic">Underwoods</hi> (which were not published
                    collectively till the second and surreptitious folio) are a miscellaneous
                    series, comprising, together with a few religious and a few amatory poems, a
                    large number of epigrams, epitaphs, elegies, and “odes,” including both the
                    tributes to Shakespeare and several to royal and other patrons and friends,
                    besides the <hi rend="italic">Execration upon Vulcan,</hi> and the
                    characteristic ode. addressed, apparently in the earlier part of his career, by
                    the poet to himself. To these pieces in verse should be added the <hi
                    rend="italic">Discoveries—</hi> an often highly interesting commonplace-book of
                    aphorisms that occurred to the poet in his daily readings,—self-communings of a
                    more tranquil and perhaps a more sober kind than the outpourings of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Conversations at Hawthorndem</hi></p>
                <p>The dramatic works of Ben Jonson fall into three or, if his fragmentary pastoral
                    drama be considered to stand by itself, into four distinct divisions. His
                    tragedies are only two in number— <hi rend="italic">Sejanus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">his Fall,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Catiline his
                    Conspiracy.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Of <hi
                    rend="italic">The Fall of Mortimer</hi> Johnson left only a few lines behind
                    him; but, as he also left the argument of the play, factious ingenuity contrived
                    to furbish up the relic into a libel against Queen Caroline and Sir Robert
                    Walpole in 1731, and to revive the contrivance by way of an insult to the
                    princess dowager of Wales and Lord Bute in 1762.</p></note> Of these the
                    earlier, as is worth noting, was produced at Shakespeare’s theatre, in all
                    probability before the first of Shakespeare’s Roman dramas, and still contains a
                    considerable admixture of rhyme in the dialogue. Though perhaps less carefully
                    elaborated in diction than its successor, <hi rend="italic">Sejanus</hi> is at
                    least equally impressive as a highly-wrought dramatic treatment of a complex
                    historic theme. The character of Tiberius adds an element of curious
                    psychological interest which is wanting in Catiline and his surroundings<pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0778-0745"/>; but in both plays the action is powerfully
                    conducted, and the care bestowed by the dramatist upon the great variety of
                    characters introduced cannot, as in some of his comedies, be said to distract
                    the interest of the reader. Both these tragedies are noble works, though the
                    relative popularity of the subject has perhaps secured the preference to <hi
                    rend="italic">Catiline.</hi> Yet this play and its predecessor were alike too
                    manifestly intended by their author to court the goodwill of what he calls the
                    “extraordinary” reader. It is difficult to imagine that (with the aid of
                    judicious shortenings) either could altogether miss its effect on the stage;
                    but, while Shakespeare causes us to forget, Jonson seems to wish us to remember,
                    his authorities. The half is often greater than the whole; and Jonson, like all
                    dramatists and, it might be said, all novelists in similar cases, has had to pay
                    the penalty incurred by too obvious a desire to underline the learning of the
                    author.</p>
                <p>Perversity—or would-be originality—alone could declare Jonson’s tragedy
                    preferable to his comedy. Even if the revolution which he created in the latter
                    branch of the drama had been mistaken in its principles or unsatisfactory in its
                    results, it would be clear that the strength of his dramatic genius lay in the
                    power of depicting a great variety of characters, and that in comedy alone he
                    succeeded in finding a wide field for the exercise of this power. There may have
                    been no very original or very profound discovery in the idea which he
                    illustrated in <hi rend="italic">Every Man in his Humour,</hi> ’ and, as it
                    were, technically elaborated in <hi rend="italic">Every Man out of his

                    as to draw the whole of their individualities one way, and that this-phenomenon
                    “may be truly said to be a humour.” But by refusing to apply this term to a mere
                    peculiarity or affectation of manners, and restricting its use to actual or
                    implied differences or distinctions of character, he broadened the whole basis
                    of English comedy after his fashion, as Molière at a later date did that of
                    French after his. It does not of course follow that Jonson’s disciples, the
                    Bromes and the Cartwrights, always adequately reproduced the master’s conception
                    of “humorous” comedy. Jonson’s wide and various reading helped him to diversify
                    the application of his theory, while perhaps at times it led him into too remote
                    illustrations of it. Still, Captain Bobadil and Captain Tucca, Macilente and
                    Fungoso, Volpone and Mosca, and a goodly number of other characters commend
                    themselves readily as well as distinctly enough to the memory of those who have
                    once made their acquaintance. It is a very futile criticism to condemn Jonson’s
                    characters as a mere series of types of general ideas; on the other hand, it is
                    a very sound criticism to object, as Barry Cornwall does, to the “multitude of
                    characters who throw no light upon the story, and lend no interest to it,
                    occupying space that had better have been bestowed upon the principal agents of
                    the plot.”</p>
                <p>In the construction of plots, as in most other respects, Jonson’s at once
                    conscientious and vigorous mind led him in the direction of originality; he
                    depended to a far less degree than the greater part of his contemporaries
                    (Shakespeare with the rest) upon borrowed plots. But either his inventive
                    character was occasionally at fault in this respect, or his devotion (so to
                    speak) to his characters often diverted his attention from a brisk conduct of
                    his plot. The writer just quoted has directed attention to the essential
                    likeness in the plot of two of Jonson’s best comedies, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Volpone</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Alchemist,</hi> and another critic,
                    unsurpassed in his delicate appreciation of the relations between the drama and
                    the stage,—Mr W. Bodham Donne,—has dwelt on the difficulty which, in <hi
                    rend="italic">The Poetaster</hi> and else- . where, Ben Jonson seems to
                    experience in sustaining the <hi rend="italic">promise</hi> of his actions. <hi
                    rend="italic">The Poetaster</hi> is, however, a play <hi rend="italic">suι
                    generis,</hi> in which the real business can hardly be said to begin till the
                    last act.</p>
                <p>Dryden, when criticizing Ben Jonson’s comedies in a superfine vein, which (to do
                    him justice) he very rarely indulged, thought fit, while allowing the old master
                    humour and incontestable “pleasantness,” to deny him wit and those ornaments
                    thereof which Quintilian reckons up under the terms <hi rend="italic"
                    >urbana,</hi><hi rend="italic">salsa,</hi><hi rend="italic">faceta,</hi> and so
                    forth. Such wit as Dryden has in view is the mere outward fashion or style of
                    the day, the euphuism or “sheerwit” or <hi rend="italic">chic</hi> which is the
                    creed of the Fastidious Brisks and of their crafty purveyors at any given
                    moment. In this Ben Jonson was no doubt defective; for he was too accurate an
                    observer of men and manners to be himself a man of fashion, literary or
                    otherwise. But it would be an error to suppose him, as a comic dramatist, to
                    have stood towards the world around him in the attitude of a philosopher,
                    careless of mere transient externalisms. It is said that the scene of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Every Man in his Humour</hi> was originally laid near Florence;
                    and his <hi rend="italic">Volpone,</hi> which is perhaps the darkest social
                    picture ever drawn by him, plays at Venice. But the atmosphere of his comedies,
                    wherever they may be supposed to play, is familiar enough to any one fairly
                    acquainted with the native surroundings amidst which they were produced; and Ben
                    Jonson’s times Jive for us in his men and women, his country gulls and town
                    gulls, his alchemists and exorcists, his “skeldring” captains and whining
                    Puritans, and the whole ragamuffin rout of his <hi rend="italic">Bartholomew
                    Pair,</hi> the comedy <hi rend="italic">par excellence</hi> of Elizabethan low
                    life. After he had described the pastimes, fashionable and unfashionable, of his
                    age, its feeble superstitions and its flaunting naughtinesses, its vapouring
                    affectations and its lying effronteries, with an odour as of “divine tabacco”
                    pervading the whole, little might seem to be left to describe for his “sons” and
                    successors. Enough, however, remained; only that his followers speedily again
                    threw manners and “humours” into one undistinguishable medley.</p>
                <p>The gift which both in his art and in his life Jonson lacked was that of
                    exercising the influence or creating the effects which he wished to exercise or
                    create without the appearance of consciousness. Instead of this, influenced no
                    doubt by the example of the free relations between author and public permitted
                    by Attic comedy, he resorted again and again, from <hi rend="italic">Every Man
                    out of his Humour</hi> to <hi rend="italic">The Magnetic Lady,</hi> to sundry
                    devices of inductions and com-mentatory intermezzos and appendices, which,
                    though occasionally effective by the excellence of their execution, are to be
                    regretted as introducing into his dramas an exotic and often vexatious element.
                    A man of letters to the very core, he never quite understood that there is and
                    ought to be a wide difference between the world of letters and the world of the
                    theatre.</p>
                <p>The richness and versatility of Jonson’s genius will never be fully appreciated
                    by those who fail to acquaint themselves with what is preserved to us of his
                    “masks” and cognate entertainments. He was conscious enough of his success in
                    this direction—“next himself,” he said, “only Fletcher and Chapman could write a
                    mask.” He introduced, or at least established, the ingenious innovation of the
                    antimask, which Schlegel has described as a species of “parody added by the poet
                    to his device, and usually prefixed to the serious entry,” and which accordingly
                    supplies a grotesque antidote to the often extravagantly imaginative main
                    conception. Jonson’s learning, creative power, and humorous ingenuity—combined,
                    it should not be forgotten, with a genuine lyrical gift—all found abundant
                    opportunities for displaying themselves in these productions. Though a growth of
                    foreign origin, the mask was by him thoroughly domesticated in the high places
                    of English literature. He lived long enough to see the species produce its
                    poetic <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n779/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0779-0746"/> masterpiece in <hi rend="italic">Cornus,</hi>
                    after which it soon faded away in times too fierce to allow of its further
                    cultivation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Sad Shepherd,</hi> of which Jonson left behind him three
                    acts and a prologue, is distinguished among English pastoral dramas by its
                    freshness of tone; and, though not altogether without either allegorical
                    allusions or classical ornament, breathes something of the spirit of the
                    greenwood, and is not unnatural even in its supernatural element. While this
                    piece, with its charming love-scenes between Robin Hood and Maid Marion, remains
                    a fragment, another pastoral by Jonson, <hi rend="italic">The May Lord,</hi> has
                    been lost, and a third, of which Loch Lomond was intended to be the scene,
                    probably remained unwritten.</p>
                <p>Though Ben Jonson never altogether recognized the truth of the maxim that the
                    dramatic art has properly speaking no didactic purpose, his long and laborious
                    life was not wasted upon a barren endeavour. In tragedy he added two works of
                    uncommon merit to our dramatic literature. In comedy his aim was higher, his
                    effort more sustained, and his success more solid, than were those of any of his
                    fellows. In the subsidiary and hybrid species of the mask, he helped to open a
                    new and attractive though undoubtedly devious path in the field of dramatic
                    literature. His intellectual endowments surpassed those of most of our great
                    dramatists in richness and in breadth; and in energy of application he probably
                    surpassed them all. Yet it is less by these gifts or even by his power of hard
                    work than by the true ring of his manliness that he is uniquely distinguished
                    among his peers.</p>
                <p>The date of the first folio volume of Jonson’s <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> (of
                    which title his novel but characteristic use in applying it to plays was at the
                    time much ridiculed) has already been mentioned as 1616; the second is described
                    by Gifford as “a wretched continuation of the first, printed from MSS.
                    surreptitiously obtained during his life, or ignorantly hurried through the
                    press after his death, and bearing a variety of dates from 1631 to 1641
                    inclusive.” The whole works were reprinted in a single folio volume in 1692, and
                    again in 6 vols. 8vo in 1715. Whalley’s edition in 7 vols., with a life,
                    appeared in 1756, but was superseded in 1816 by Gifford’s, in 9 vols, (of which
                    the first includes a biographical memoir, and the famous essay on the “Proofs of
                    Ben Jonson’s Malignity, from the Commentators on Shakespeare ”). A new edition
                    of Gifford’s excellent book was published in 9 vols, in 1875 by Colonel F.
                    Cunningham, as well as a cheap reprint in 3 vols, in 1870. Both contain the
                    “Conversations with Drummond,” which were first printed in full by David Laing
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Shakespeare Society's Publications</hi> (1842), and the
                    <hi rend="italic">Jonsonus</hi><hi rend="italic">Virbius,</hi> a collection
                    (unparalleled in number and variety of authors) of poetical tributes published
                    about six months after Jonson’s death by his friends and admirers. There is also
                    a single-volume edition, with a very readable memoir, by Barry Cornwall (1838).
                    Recently <hi rend="italic">Every Mau in his Humour</hi> has been edited, with an
                    excellent brief biographical as well as special introduction, to which the
                    present sketch owes some details, by H. B. Wheatley (1877). The criticisms of
                    Jonson are too numerous to mention; but among many deserving to be overlooked
                    should not be included that of Dryden in the preface to <hi rend="italic">An
                    Evening’s Love, or the Mock Astrologer.</hi> (A. W. W.)</p>
