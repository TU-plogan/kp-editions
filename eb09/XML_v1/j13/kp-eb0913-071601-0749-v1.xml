                <p><label type="entry">JOHN II</label>. (1397-1479), king of Aragon from 1458, was
                    the younger son of Ferdinand I. (the Just), and was born June 29, 1397. He was
                    twice married,—first to Blanche, daughter of Charles III. of Navarre, by whom he
                    had three children (Carlos, heir to the crowns of Navarre and Aragon; Blanche,
                    for some time the wife of Henry</p>
                <p>IV. of Castile; and Eleanor, wife of Gaston, count of Foix); and afterwards (in
                    1447) to Joanna Henriquez, of the blood-royal of Castile, by whom he became the
                    father of Ferdinand V. (the Catholic). For a long time he acted as
                    lieutenant-general in Aragon for his brother Alphonso</p>
                <p>V. , whom business detained in his Neapolitan dominions; in this capacity he
                    intervened frequently in the affairs of Castile, where his weak and
                    inexperienced kinsman John II. occupied the throne, and on one occasion (1444)
                    he invaded that kingdom, but was defeated at Olmedo. On his second marriage he
                    irritated his son Carlos and the community by sending his queen Joanna to share
                    the administration of Navarre with his son; in the revolt which ensued victory
                    declared for John, Carlos himself being reduced to captivity (1452), in which he
                    was detained for many months. In May 1458 John succeeded his brother in Aragon,
                    Sicily, and Sardinia; but the influence of Joanna Henriquez prevented him from
                    recognizing the legitimate claims of his own eldest son to the reversion; an
                    attempt by Carlos to obtain support in other quarters led to his arrest and
                    imprisonment, from which he was released only after Catalonia had risen in arms
                    and the king of Castile had begun an irruption into Navarre. Shortly after this
                    temporary triumph Carlos was carried off by a fever in September 1461,
                    bequeathing the crown of Navarre to his sister Blanche and her posterity.
                    Ferdinand, the half-brother of Carlos, was now put forward as heir apparent of
                    the Aragonese throne, but the indignant Catalonians raised a revolt which did
                    not come to an end until December 1472. Immediately afterwards John entered upon
                    a war with Louis XI. of France in consequence of disputes about Roussillon and
                    Cerdagne; first successful, but afterwards worsted, this bold and energetic but
                    ambitious and unjust prince died January 20, 1479, before the conclusion of the
                    peace. He was succeeded by Ferdinand V.</p>
