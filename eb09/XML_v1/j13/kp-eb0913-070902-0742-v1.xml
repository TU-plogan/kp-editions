                <p><label type="entry">JOHN <hi rend="smallcaps">the Baptist</hi></label>, the last
                    of the prophets and the “forerunner” of Christ, was born in a 7r0λιs Ίοΰδα
                    (according to rabbinical tradition, at Hebron, but according to an ingenious
                    modern interpretation of the phrase, at Jutta), in the beginning of the second
                    half of the year 749 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.u.c.</hi> His father Zechariah was a
                    priest “of the course of Abia ”; his mother Elizabeth was related to Mary, the
                    mother of Jesus, whose senior he was by six months. The circumstances of his
                    birth are related with much detail in Luke i., but those of his early years are
                    summed up in the single expression at ver. 80 that he “grew, and waxed strong in
                    spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel.” In his
                    thirtieth year (Autumn, 779 A.u.c.) he began his public life in the “wilderness
                    of Judaea,” the wild district that lies between the Kidron and the Dead Sea, and
                    particularly in the neighbourhood of the Jordan, where multitudes were attracted
                    by his eloquence. His appearance, costume, and habits of life were such as to
                    recall to the minds of his hearers what they had read about the ancient
                    prophets, and particularly about Elijah, who came to be regarded as his
                    prototype. Nor was his preaching in substance different from theirs: his central
                    doctrine was that “the kingdom of heaven” had come near, and preparation for its
                    speedy arrival by an appropriate change of heart and life was the practical duty
                    he urged. With regard to the nature of the baptism he administered, much
                    uncertainty exists; for some discussion of its origin and meaning, the reader is
                    referred to the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Baptism</hi> (vol. iii. p. 348-9).
                    Amongst those who resorted to this rite was John’s kinsman, Jesus of Nazareth,
                    whom he had foretold, and now acknowledged, as one mightier than himself, the
                    latchet of whose shoes he was not worthy to unloose. The duration of John’s
                    ministry cannot be determined with certainty; it terminated in his imprisonment
                    in the fortress of Machaerus, to which he had been committed by Herod Antipas,
                    whose incestuous marriage with Herodias the Baptist had sternly rebuked, and
                    where he was beheaded under circumstances which are familiar to every reader of
                    the Bible. The date of this event cannot with safety be placed later than the
                    end of 782 A.u.c. For our knowledge of John the Baptist we are almost entirely
                    dependent on the notices contained in the Gospel narratives, but a brief account
                    of his career is also given by Josephus <hi rend="italic">(Ant.,</hi> xviii. 5);
                    some legends of an obviously fictitious character are contained in the
                    apocryphal Gospels.</p>
