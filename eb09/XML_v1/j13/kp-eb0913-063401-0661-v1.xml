                    and 49° 10' N. lat., and between 2° <hi rend="italic">0</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >∣</hi><hi rend="italic">'</hi> and 2° 15⅜' W. long., 16 miles west of Normandy
                    and 125 south of Southampton. The total area comprises 28,717 imperial acres, or
                    about 45 square miles. It is of oblong form, with a length of about 11 miles
                    from east to west, and an average breadth of about 5∣ miles. Along the northern
                    part of the island a belt of elevated land runs from east to west, displaying
                    bold and picturesque cliffs towards the sea. The east, south, and west coasts
                    consist of a continuous succession of large open bays with marshy or sandy
                    shores terminated by rocky headlands. The principal bays are Grève au Lançon,
                    Grève de Lecq, and Bouley Bay on the north coast; St Catherine’s Bay and
                    Grouville Bay on the east coast; St Clement’s Bay, Samarez Bay, St Aubin’s Bay,
                    and St Brelade’s Bay on the south coast: and St Ouen’s Bay on the west coast.
                    The sea in many places has encroached greatly on the land, and sand drifts have
                    been found very troublesome, especially on the west coast. The surface of the
                    country is broken by winding valleys having a general direction from north to
                    south, and as they approach the south uniting so as to form small plains. The
                    lofty hedges which bound the small enclosures into which Jersey is divided, the
                    trees and shrubbery which line the roads and cluster round the uplands and in
                    almost every nook of the valleys unutilized for pasturage or tillage, give the
                    island a rich and luxuriant appearance, and completely neutralize the bare
                    effect of the few sandy plains and sand-covered hills. Some of the coast scenery
                    is grand and striking, presenting many features of special interest.</p>
                <p>According to J. A. Bird (“Geology of the Channel Islands,” in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Geological Magazine,</hi> London, 1878), Jersey rests on syenite
                    rocks, which appear in three great masses in the north-west, south-west, and
                    south-east of the island. Between these masses there is in the west an extensive
                    formation of shale and schist, and in the north-west a formation variously
                    composed of porphyries, limestone schist, altered sandstone, quartzite and
                    quartzose conglomerate. In the neighbourhood of St Helier there is an
                    accumulation of volcanic rocks consisting of trap, porphyry, and amygdaloid.
                    China stone clay is obtained in large quantities. There are some veins of lead,
                    and ironstone is occasionally found. The climate of Jersey is somewhat warmer in
                    summer and colder in winter than that of Guernsey. The annual mean temperature
                    is 51°, the annual rainfall about 30⅛ inches, and the number of days upon which
                    rain falls about one hundred and fifty. The wettest season is from October to
                    January, but rain seldom continues long. The island enjoys a very early spring
                    and a lengthened autumn. Snow and frost are rare, but dense fogs frequently
                    prevail. Fruits and flowers indigenous to warm climates grow freely in the open
                    air. The land is rich and very productive, the soil being chiefly a deep loam,
                    which is lighter upon syenite and granite than upon the other formations; the
                    sandy portions in the vicinity of the bays have become very fruitful through
                    cultivation. The lands are held either as freeholds or on a nine years’ lease.
                    On account of the Norman law of succession the farms have become very much
                    subdivided. It is only rarely that they exceed 50 acres, and very many are less
                    than 3 acres. The farmhouses and cottages are remarkably neat and comfortable;
                    and the peasantry, who all farm their own land, are perhaps the most contented
                    and prosperous in the United Kingdom. A five-course shift (turnips, potatoes or
                    parsnips, wheat, hay, hay) is that usually followed. The frequency with which
                    root crops are grown, and the abundant supply of sea manure, have greatly
                    enriched the soil. The seaweed or <hi rend="italic">vraie</hi> harvest occurs at
                    certain seasons which are prescribed by law. It is only then that it is
                    permissible to cut the vraie from rocks; but loose vraie is gathered in large
                    quantities at all seasons. The implements of husbandry are generally
                    old-fashioned. The peasantry take advantage of every bit of wall and every
                    isolated nook of ground for growing fruit trees. Grapes are ripened under glass;
                    oranges are grown in sheltered situations, but the most common fruits are
                    apples, which are used for cider, and pears. The island is intersected by a
                    network of roads. There is a railway line between St Helier and St Aubin’s, and
                    connects St Helier and Gorey.</p>
                <p>According to the agricultural returns for 1880 the total area of arable land was
                    18,950 acres,—a percentage of 66‘2 to the total area,—of which 2920 acres were
                    under corn crops, 7456 under green crops, 4359 under rotation grasses, 4087
                    under permanent pasture, and 128 fallow. Under orchards there were 1345 acres,
                    under market <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0662-0635"/> gardens 186, and under nursery grounds 38. Wheat,
                    which in 1880 occupied 2524 acres, is the principal and almost exclusive corn
                    crop, the kinds grown being principally Velouzé.and Petit Blanc. For the crop a
                    manure of burnt seaweed is generally used. The area under potatoes in 1880 was
                    4G71 acres. They are grown chiefly for the Covent Garden Market, the earliest
                    crop being ready about the end of April or beginning of May. Only 1313 acres
                    were under turnips. The pasturage is very rich, and is much improved by the
                    application of seaweed to the surface. The mainstay of Jersey is cattle, which
                    in 1880 numbered 11,022, or the large average of 58 to every 100 acres under
                    cultivation, the average of the United Kingdom being only 20 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 7. The breed is that commonly known as the Alderney,
                    and is kept pure by stringent laws against the importation of foreign animals.
                    The number of cows was 5884, of other cattle above two years of age only 756,
                    and of cattle below two years of age 4382. It will thus be seen that cattle are
                    kept chiefly for dairy purposes. The milk is used almost exclusively to
                    manufacture butter. The cattle are always housed in winter, but remain out at.
                    night from May till October. Horses in 1880 numbered 2261. Originally there was
                    a small black breed of horses peculiar to the island, but now they are chiefly
                    imported from France or England. Pigs form the staple food of the inhabitants,
                    and numbered 5844. Only a few sheep are kept, 346 in 1880.</p>
                <p>The number of ships that entered tile ports of Jersey in 1879 was 2001, of
                    281,663 tons burden,—British vessels numbering 1859, of 275,990 tons, and
                    foreign vessels 142, of 5673 tons. In the same year 2018 vessels, of 279,485
                    tons burden, cleared,—British vessels numbering 1876, of 273,319 tons, and
                    foreign vessels 142, of 6166 tons. The number of vessels belonging to the island
                    was 234, with a burden of 17,027 tons, in addition to which there is a large
                    number of fishing boats. There is regular steam communication with England <hi
                    rend="italic">via</hi> Southampton, Weymouth, and Plymouth, and with France <hi
                    rend="italic">via</hi> Granville and St Malo. The principal exports are granite,
                    fruit and vegetables (especially potatoes), oysters, butter, and cattle; and the
                    principal imports coal, wine, rum and other spirituous liquors, sugar, tea,
                    wheat, and eggs. Kelp and iodine are manufactured from seaweed. Fish are not so
                    plentiful as around the shores of Guernsey, but mackerel, turbot, cod, mullet,
                    and especially the conger eel, are abundant at the Minquiers. There is a large
                    oyster bed between Jersey and France, but partly on account of over-dredging the
                    supply is not now so abundant as formerly. There is a great variety of other
                    shell-fish. The islanders build their own ships.</p>
                <p>Jersey is under a distinct and in several respects different form of
                    administrative government from Guernsey and the smaller islands included in the
                    bailiwick of Guernsey. The administration is under the superintendence of a
                    lieutenant-governor· appointed by the crown. The main business of legislature in
                    Jersey is carried on by the “states,” which consist of the bailiff or judge of
                    the royal court elected by the crown, twelve jurats of the royal court elected
                    for life by the ratepayers, the rectors of the twelve parishes, twelve
                    constables elected every three years, and fourteen deputies elected every three
                    years. The lieutenant-governor has a deliberative voice, ami, though he has no
                    vote, has the power of veto. The states have the power of passing <hi
                    rend="italic">ordonnances</hi> which unless they obtain the sanction of the
                    sovereign of England are in force for only three years. English Acts of
                    Parliament after registration become laws in Jersey. Taxation is very light in
                    the island. The only legal tribunal is the royal court, composed of the bailiffs
                    and twelve jurats. The lieutenant-governor has the superintendence of the
                    militia, in which every male between seventeen and sixty-five years of age, who
                    is medically fit, is liable for service. Jersey is divided into twelve parishes,
                    and ecclesiastically it constitutes a deanery in the diocese of Winchester in
                    England.</p>
                <p>The only town of importance is St Helier, situated on St Aubin’s Bay. It has
                    rather a mean and uninteresting appearance, but beautiful views are obtained
                    from various points. Although the streets are generally narrow and irregular,
                    they are clean and well paved, and the Royal Square is spacious and airy. The
                    town possesses an outer and an inner harbour. Fort Regent, a fortress completed
                    in 1815 at a cost of £1,000,000, is situated on a lofty ridge of granite to the
                    east of the harbour; and on the rocks to the west stands Elizabeth Castle, a
                    disused stronghold erected in the time of Elizabeth on the site of an abbey
                    founded in the 12th century. Closely adjoining it there is an ancient ruin
                    called the hermitage. The other principal buildings are the parish church in the
                    Early Pointed style, dating from 1341, and lately completely renovated, the
                    court-house, the Albert Hall for concerts and assemblies, Victoria College, the
                    hospital, and the jail. The population of the town and parish in 1881 was
                    26,893.</p>
                <p>The population of Jersey in 1806 was 22,855. From 1821, when it numbered 28,600,
                    it increased rapidly till 1851, when it had reached 57,020. In 1861 it had
                    declined to 55,613; and, although owing to the number of French who sought
                    refuge in the island it increased in 1871 to 56,627, in 1881 it was only 52,372,
                    of whom 23,415 were males and 28,957 females.</p>
