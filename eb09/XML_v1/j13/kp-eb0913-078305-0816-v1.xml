                <p><label type="entry">JURY</label>. The essential features of trial by jury as
                    practised in England and countries influenced by English ideas are the
                    following. The jury are a body of laymen selected by lot to ascertain, under the
                    guidance of a judge, the truth in questions of fact arising either in a civil
                    litigation or in a criminal process. They are generally twelve in number, and
                    their verdict, as a general rule, must be unanimous. Their province is strictly
                    limited to questions of fact, and within that province they are still further
                    restricted to the exclusive consideration of matters that have been proved by
                    evidence in the course of the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0817-0784"/> trial. They must submit to the direction of the
                    judge as to any rule or principle of law that may be applicable to the case;
                    and, even in deliberating on the facts, they receive, although they need not be
                    bound by, the directions of the judge as to the weight, value, and materiality
                    of the evidence submitted to them. Further, according to the general practice,
                    they are selected from the inhabitants of the locality, whether county or city,
                    within which the cause of action has arisen or the crime has been committed, so
                    that they bring to the discharge of their duties a certain amount of independent
                    local knowledge, an element in the institution which is by no means to be
                    ignored. Such in general terms is the famous judicial institution the
                    development of which is generally regarded as one of the greatest achievements
                    of English j urisprudence.</p>
                <p>What is the origin of this very remarkable and characteristic system <hi
                    rend="italic">1</hi> That is a question which has engaged the attention of many
                    learned men. The fullest discussion of the subject is contained in Forsyth’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Trial by Jury,</hi> published in 1852, and more concise notices of
                    the various theories that have been advanced will be found in Stubbs’s <hi

                    other institutions, was popularly regarded as the work of a single legislator,
                    and in England it is one of the achievements usually assigned to Alfred. It is
                    needless to say that there is no historical foundation whatever for such a
                    supposition, nor is it much more correct to regard it as “copied from this or
                    that kindred institution to be found in this or that German or Scandinavian
                    land,” or brought over ready made by Hengist or by William.<note anchored="true"

                    Canon Stubbs, “have maintained that the entire jury system is indigenous in
                    England, some deriving it from Celtic tradition based on the principles of Roman
                    law, and adopted by the Anglo-Saxons and Normans from the people they had
                    conquered. Others have regarded it as a product of that legal genius of the
                    Anglo-Saxons of which Alfred is the mythic impersonation, or as derived by that
                    nation from the customs of primitive Germany or from their intercourse with the
                    Danes. Nor even when it is admitted that the system of recognition was
                    introduced from Normandy have legal writers agreed as to the source from which
                    the Normans themselves derived it. One scholar maintains that it was brought by
                    the Norsemen from Scandinavia; another that it was derived from the processes of
                    the canon law; another that it was developed on Gallic soil from Roman
                    principles; another that it e,ame from Asia through the crusades,” or was
                    borrowed by the Angles and Saxons from their Slavonic neighbours in northern
                    Europe. The true answer is that forms of trial resembling the jury system in
                    various particulars are to be found in the primitive institutions of all
                    nations. That which comes nearest in time and character to trial by jury is the
                    system of recognition by sworn inquest, introduced into England by the Normans.
                    “That inquest,” says Mr Stubbs, “is directly derived from the Frank
                    capitularies, into which it may have been adopted from the fiscal regulations of
                    the Theodosian code, and thus own some distant relationship with the Roman
                    jurisprudence.” However that may be, the system of recognition consisted in
                    .questions of fact, relating to fiscal or judicial business, being submitted by
                    the officers of the crown to sworn witnesses in the local courts. It is pointed
                    out by Mr Freeman that the Norman rulers of England were obliged, more than
                    native rulers would have been, to rely on this system for accurate information.
                    They needed to have a clear and truthful account of disputed points set before
                    them, and such an account was sought for in the oaths of the recognitors.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This fact would account for
                    the remarkable development of the system on English ground, as contrasted with
                    its decay and extinction in France.</p></note> The Norman Conquest, therefore,
                    fostered the growth of those native germs common to England with other countries
                    out of which the institution of juries grew. Recognition, as introduced by the
                    Normans, is only, in this point of view, another form of the same principle
                    which shows itself in the compurgators, in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >frithbocJc,</hi> in every detail of the action of the popular courts before the
                    Conquest. Admitting with Mr Stubbs that the Norman recognition was the
                    instrument which the lawyers in England ultimately shaped into trial by jury, Mr
                    Freeman maintains none the less that the latter is a distinctively English
                    thing. Mr Forsyth comes to substantially the same conclusion. Noting the jury
                    germs of the Anglo-Saxon period, he shows how out of those elements, which
                    continued in full force under the Anglo-Normans, was produced at last the
                    institution of the jury. “As yet it was only implied in the requirement that
                    disputed questions should be determined by the voice of sworn witnesses taken
                    from the neighbourhood, and deposing to the truth of what they had seen or
                    heard.” What was wanting was to mould the procedure into shape, and that it did
                    not attain until a century after the Conquest.</p>
                <p>The inquest by recognition, which was employed generally for the ascertainment of
                    facts, as for example in assessing taxation, is exemplified in legal matters by
                    the process known as the assize or the great assize, applicable to questions
                    affecting freehold or status. Defendant in such an action was enabled by an
                    enactment of Henry II. to decline the trial by combat and choose the trial by
                    assize, which was conducted as follows. The sheriff summoned four knights of the
                    neighbourhood, who being sworn chose twelve lawful knights who were most
                    cognizant of the facts, who should determine on their oaths which had the better
                    right to the land. If they all knew the facts and were agreed as to their
                    verdict, well and good; if some or all were ignorant, the fact was certified in
                    court, and new knights were named, until twelve were found to be agreed. The
                    same course was followed when the twelve were not unanimous. New jurors, as they
                    may be called, were added until the twelve were agreed. This was called
                    afforcing the assize. At this point the knowledge on which the jurors acted was
                    their own personal knowledge, acquired independently of the trial. “So
                    entirely,” says Forsyth, “did they proceed upon their own previously formed view
                    of the facts in dispute that they seem to have considered themselves at liberty
                    to pay no attention to evidence offered in court, however clearly it might
                    disprove the case which they were prepared to support.” The use of recognition
                    is prescribed by the constitutions of Clarendon for cases of dispute as to lay
                    or clerical tenure. See Forsyth, p. 131; Stubbs, vol. i. p. 617.</p>
                <p>In criminal cases there appears to be a more complete approximation to the jury
                    in Anglo-Saxon times in the twelve senior thegns, who, according to an ordinance
                    of Aethelred II. were sworn in the county court that they would accuse no
                    innocent man and acquit no guilty one. The twelve thegns were a jury of
                    presentment or accusation, like the grand jury of later times, and the absolute
                    guilt or innocence of those accused by them had to be determined by subsequent
                    proceedings—by compurgation or the ordeal. Whether this is the actual origin of
                    the grand jury or not, the assizes of Clarendon and Northampton establish the
                    criminal jury on a definite basis. By the articles of visitation of 1194, four
                    knights are to be chosen from the county who by their oath shall choose two
                    lawful knights of each hundred or wapintake, or, if knights be wanting, free and
                    legal men, so that the twelve may answer for aU <pb break="no"

                    Stubbs, “all the pleas of the crown, the trial of malefactors and their
                    receivers, as well as a vast amount of civil business.” This is the historical
                    grand jury. The petty jury, as it is called, which is the real jury of trial,
                    appears to have arisen as an alternative to the trial by ordeal. A person
                    accused by the inquest of the hundred was allowed to have the truth of the
                    charge tried by another and different jury.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    suggested the theory that the system of compurgation is the origin of the jury
                    system—the first jury representing the compurgators of the accuser, the second
                    the compurgators of the accused.</p></note> “There is,” says Forsyth, “no
                    possibility of assigning a date to this alteration.” “In the time of Bracton
                    (middle of the 13th century) the usual mode of determining innocence or guilt
                    was by combat or appeal. But in most cases the appellant had the option of
                    either fighting with his adversary or putting himself on his county for trial
                    ”—the exceptions being murder by secret poisoning, and certain circumstances
                    presumed by the law to be conclusive of guilt. Some doubt has been expressed
                    whether the twelve jurors who tried the crime were not identical with the
                    accusing jurors, but the separation between the two juries was at any rate
                    complete in the reign of Edward III. (Forsyth, p. 206).<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The number of the jury (twelve) is
                    responsible for some unfounded theories of the origin of the system. This use of
                    twelve is not confined to England, nor in England or elsewhere to judicial
                    institutions. “Its general prevalence,” says Hallam <hi rend="italic">{Middle
                    Ages,</hi> chap, viii.), “shows that in searching for the origin of trial by
                    jury we cannot rely for a moment upon any analogy which the mere number
                    affords.” In a <hi rend="italic">Guide to English Juries, by α Person of
                    Quality,</hi> 1682 (attributed to Lord Somers), the following passage occurs:
                    “In analogy of late the jury is reduced to the number of twelve, like as the
                    prophets were twelve to foretell the truth; the apostles twelve to preach the
                    truth; the discoverers twelve, sent into Canaan to seek and report the truth;
                    and the stones twelve that the heavenly Hierusalem is built on.” Lord Coke
                    indulged in similar speculations.</p></note></p>
                <p>So far we have arrived at the establishment of the jury system in its modern
                    form, alike in civil and in criminal proceedings; and, whatever differences may
                    be traceable in the history of the civil and criminal jury respectively, their
                    subsequent development is one. And there is one great feature by which the jury
                    at the stage we have now reached is distinguished from the jury of modern times.
                    The jury still certify to the truth from their knowledge of the facts, however
                    acquired. In other words, they still retain the character of witnesses. The
                    complete withdrawal of that character from the jury is connected by Forsyth with
                    the ancient rules of law as to proof of written instruments, and a peculiar mode
                    of trial <hi rend="italic">per</hi><hi rend="italic">sectam.</hi> When a deed is
                    attested by witnesses, you have a difference between the testimony of the
                    witness, who deposes to the execution of the deed, and the verdict of the jury
                    as to the fact of execution. It has been contended with much plausibility that
                    in such cases the attesting witnesses formed part of the jury. Forsyth doubts
                    that conclusion, although he admits that, as the jurors themselves were
                    originally mere witnesses, there was no distinction in principle between them
                    and the attesting witnesses, and that the attesting witnesses might be
                    associated with the jury in the discharge of the function of giving a verdict.
                    However that may be, in the reign of Edward HL, although the witnesses are
                    spoken of “as joined to the assize,” they are distinguished from the jurors. The
                    trial <hi rend="italic">per</hi><hi rend="italic">sectam</hi> was used as an
                    alternative to the assize or jury, and resembled in principle the system of
                    compurgation. The claimant proved his case by vouching a certain number of
                    witnesses (secta), who had seen the transaction in question, and the defendant
                    rebutted the presumption thus created by vouching a larger number of witnesses
                    on his own side. In cases in which this was allowed, the jury did not interpose
                    at all, but in course of time the practice arose of the witnesses of the secta
                    telling their story to the jury. In these two instances we have the jury as
                    judges of the facts sharply contrasted with the witnesses who testify to the
                    facts; and, with the increasing use of juries and the development of rules of
                    evidence, this was gradually established as the true principle of the system. In
                    the reign of Henry IV. we find the judges declaring that the jury after they
                    have been sworn should not see or take with them any other evidence than that
                    which has been offered in open court. But the personal knowledge of the jurors
                    was not as yet regarded as outside the evidence on which they might found a
                    verdict, and the stress laid upon the selection of jurymen from the
                    neighbourhood of the cause of the action shows that this element was counted on,
                    and, in fact, deemed essential to a just consideration of the case. Other
                    examples of the same theory of the duties of the jury may be found in the
                    language used by legal writers. Thus it has been said that the jury may return a
                    verdict although no evidence at all be offered, and again, that the evidence
                    given in court is not binding on the jury, because they are assumed from their
                    local connexion tobe sufficiently informed of the facts to give a verdict
                    without or in opposition to the oral evidence. A recorder of London, <hi
                    rend="italic">temp.</hi> Edward VI., says that, “if the witnesses at a trial do
                    not agree with the jurors, the verdict of the twelve shall be taken and the
                    witnesses shall be rejected.” Forsyth suggests as a reason for the continuance
                    of this theory that it allowed the jury an escape from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >attaint,</hi> by which penalties might be imposed on them for delivering a
                    false verdict. They could suggest that the verdict was according to the fact,
                    though not according to the evidence. With the disuse of attaints, the contrary
                    rule came in, and it was established that where a juryman is acquainted with
                    material facts he should tell the court in order that he may be sworn as a
                    witness; and it was clearly laid down by Lord Ellenborough that, if a judge
                    directed the jury that they might be guided by their own knowledge of the facts
                    independently of the evidence, such a direction would be wrong.</p>
                <p>The ordinary jury in civil and criminal trials has now been traced down to the
                    point at which its constitution became stereotyped. An important point still
                    wants some historical explanation. The rule requiring a unanimous verdict has
                    been variously accounted for, but Mr Forsyth’s explanation appears conclusive.
                    He regards the rule as intimately connected with the original character of the
                    jury as a body of witnesses, and with the conception common in primitive society
                    that safety is to be found in the number of witnesses, rather than the character
                    of their testimony. The afforcing of the jury above described marks an
                    intermediate stage in the development. Where the juries were not unanimous new
                    jurors were added until twelve were found to be of the same opinion. From the
                    unanimous twelve selected out of a larger number to the unanimous twelve
                    constituting the whole jury was a natural step, which, however, was not taken
                    without some hesitation. In some old cases we find that the verdict of eleven
                    jurors out of twelve was accepted, but it was decided in the reign of Edward
                    III. that the verdict must be the unanimous opinion of the whole jury. Diversity
                    of opinion was taken to imply perversity of judgment, and the law sanctioned the
                    application of the harshest methods to produce unanimity. The jurors were not
                    allowed to eat or drink but by leave of the justices; and they might be carried
                    round the circuit in carts until they agreed. These rough enforcements of an
                    unanimous verdict have been softened by later practice, but the rule itself
                    remains.</p>
                <p>We may now turn to the jury in actual operation. And let us notice first the
                    various kinds of jury known to English law.</p>

                    twenty-four of his equals or neighbours—twel ve on the grand, and twelve on the
                    petty jury.</p></note> The verdict of less than twelve, although a majority of
                    the whole body, cannot be accepted, but the verdict of twelve is sufficient
                    although the others may dissent. The grand jury, after a general charge from the
                    judge, consider the bills of indictment in private, hearing such of the
                    witnesses as they think fit. If they consider that a <hi rend="italic"
                    >prima</hi><hi rend="italic">facie</hi> case is made out against the accused,
                    they return the indictment into court as a true bill, which then becomes the
                    foundation of the process before the petty jury. If they think otherwise they
                    <hi rend="italic">ignore</hi> the bill, or send it back into court torn up. They
                    have thus a kind of veto on the cases submitted for trial. As these for the most
                    part have been previously investigated by magistrates who have committed the
                    accused for trial, the utility of the grand jury depends very much on the
                    character of the justices’ courts. As a review of the discretion of stipendiary
                    magistrates in committing cases for trial, the judgment of the grand jury is
                    admittedly superfluous; and even when the committing justice is an unlearned
                    magistrate, it seems very doubtful if much is gained by subjecting his open
                    decisions to the control of a secret tribunal. It used to be urged by the
                    defenders of the system that it secures the attendance of the landed gentry and
                    the county justices at the assizes—a kind of argument which is no longer so
                    cogent as it once was. Mr Forsyth thinks that the grand jury will often baffle
                    “the attempts of malevolence” by ignoring a malicious and unfounded prosecution,
                    but they may also defeat the ends of justice, and they have done so ere now, by
                    shielding a criminal with whom they have strong political or social sympathies.
                    The qualification of the grand jurymen is that they should be freeholders of the
                    county,—to what amount appears to be uncertain.</p>
                <p>2. The <hi rend="italic">Coroner's Jury</hi> is undeterminate in number, but the
                    finding must be that of twelve at least of the jurymen. Persons found guilty on
                    this inquest may be put on trial before a petty jury at assizes.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Special and Common Juries.—</hi> This distinction belongs
                    properly to civil trials. The practice of selecting special jurors to try
                    important cases appears to have sprung up, without legislative enactment, in the
                    procedure of the courts. Forsyth says that the first statutory recognition of it
                    is so late as 3 Geo. II. c. 25, and that in the oldest book of practice in
                    existence (Powell’s <hi rend="italic">Attorney's Academy,</hi> 1623) there is no
                    allusion to two classes of jurymen. The Acts, however, which regulate the
                    practice allude to it as well established. The statute now in force (33 &amp; 34
                    Vict. c. 7) defines the class of persons entitled and liable to serve on special
                    juries thus :—every man whose name shall be on the juror’s book for any county,
                    &amp;c., and who shall be legally entitled to be called an esquire, or shall be
                    a person of higher degree, or a banker or merchant, or who shall occupy a house
                    of a certain rateable value <hi rend="italic">(e.g.</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> i</hi>.£100 in a town of 20,000 inhabitants, £50 elsewhere), or a
                    farm of £300, or other premises at £100. A special juryman receives a fee of a
                    guinea for each cause. Either party may obtain a special jury, but must pay the
                    additional expenses created thereby unless the judge certifies that it was a
                    proper case to be so tried. For the common jury any man is qualified and liable
                    to serve who has £10 by the year in land or tenements of freehold, copyhold, or
                    customary tenure; or £20 on lands or tenement held by lease for twenty-one years
                    or longer, or who being a house holder is rated at £30 in Middlesex or £20 in
                    any other county. See 6 Geo. IV. c. 50; and 33 &amp; 34 Vict. c. 77 (the Juries
                    Act). A schedule to the last-cited Act contains a list of the numerous classes
                    of persons exempted from service, which include members of the legislature and
                    judges, ministers of various denominations, and practising lawyers of all
                    grades. These are juries invariably employed in the superior courts. In the
                    county court the jury consists of five.</p>

                <p>From the beginning parties have been allowed to <hi rend="italic">challenge</hi>
                    the jury. In civil and criminal cases a challenge/or <hi rend="italic"
                    >cause</hi> is allowed; in criminal cases only, a peremptory challenge is also
                    allowed. In the former case the challenge may be either to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >array, i.e.,</hi> to the whole number of jurors returned, or to the <hi
                    rend="italic">polls, i.e.,</hi> to the jurors individually. A challenge to the
                    array is either a <hi rend="italic">principal</hi> challenge (on the ground that
                    the sheriff is a party to the cause, or related to one of the parties), or a
                    challenge for <hi rend="italic">favour</hi> (on the ground of circumstances
                    implying “at least a probability of bias or favour in the sheriff ”). A
                    challenge to the polls is an exception to one or more jurymen on either of the
                    following grounds :—(1) <hi rend="italic">propter honoris</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >respectum,</hi> as when a lord of parliament is summoned <hi rend="italic">;
                    (2) propter defectum,</hi> for want of qualification; <hi rend="italic">(ff)
                    propter affectum,</hi> bn suspicion of bias or partiality; and (4) <hi
                    rend="italic">propter delictum,</hi> when the juror has been convicted of an
                    infamous offence. The challenge <hi rend="italic">propter affectum</hi> is, like
                    the challenge to the array, either principal challenge or “to the favour.”
                    Prisoners in criminal trials were by common law entitled to a peremptory
                    challenge without cause shown to the number of thirty-five jurors; and so the
                    law remains, after some fluctuation, in the case of treason. In other cases it
                    is limited to twenty. The crown is no longer entitled to a peremptory challenge
                    as at common lav/; but the cause of challenge need not be assigned by the crown
                    until the whole list has been gone through, or unless there remain no longer
                    twelve jurors left to try the case, exclusive of those challenged—an arrangement
                    which practically amounts to giving the crown the benefit of a peremptory
                    challenge.</p>
                <p>One other special point remains to be mentioned. The province of the jury is to
                    judge of facts; they have nothing to do with the law—which they must take from
                    the presiding judge at the trial. The old <hi rend="italic">decantatum</hi>
                    assigns to each his own independent function :—“Ad quaestionem legis judices
                    respondent, ad quaestionem facti juratores.” But, while the jury are supposed in
                    legal theory to be absolute masters of the questions of fact, in practice they
                    are largely controlled by the judges. Not only does the judge at the trial
                    decide as to the admissibility of questions, but he advises the jury as to the
                    logical bearing of the answers on the issue. Further, after a jury has given its
                    verdict, it may be challenged in the courts on the ground that it is against the
                    evidence, or on the ground that there was no evidence to go before the jury. A
                    verdict is said to be against the evidence when the jury have completely
                    misapprehended the facts proved,—when the logical conclusion to be drawn from
                    the facts is the opposite of that which the jury have drawn. The court will not
                    disturb the verdict of a jury on this ground when the judge who presided at the
                    trial is not dissatisfied with the verdict And it has been ruled emphatically
                    that, when there is conflicting testimony as to the point at issue, it is
                    exclusively <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n820/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0820-0787"/> for the jury to say which side is to be believed,
                    and the court will not iuterfere with the verdict. To upset a verdict on the
                    ground that “there was no evidence to go to the jury” implies that the judge at
                    the trial ought to have withdrawn the case: The meaning of the phrase “evidence
                    to go before the jury” is nowhere definitely ascertained, and a consideration of
                    decided cases makes the difficulty more apparent. The question arises most
                    frequently perhaps in cases involving an imputation of negligence— <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in an action of damages against a railway company for
                    injuries sustained in a collision. Juries are apt to infer negligence very
                    easily, and the court has to say whether, on the facts proved, there was any
                    evidence of the defendant’s being guilty of negligence. This is by no means the
                    same thing as saying whether, in the opinion of the court, they were so guilty.
                    The court may be of opinion that on the facts they were not guilty, yet the
                    facts themselves may be of such a nature as to be evidence of guilt to go before
                    a jury. When the facts proved are such that a reasonable man might have’ come to
                    the conclusion that there was negligence, then, although the court may wholly
                    reject the conclusion in its own mind, it must admit that there is evidence to
                    go before the jury. That perhaps is as near as we have yet got to an
                    understanding of a phrase in daily use in the superior courts; but it scarcely
                    determines what relation between the facts proved and the conclusion to be
                    established is necessary to make the facts evidence from which a jury may infer
                    the conclusion. The true explanation is to be found in the principle of
                    relevancy. Any fact which is relevant to the issue constitutes evidence to go
                    before the jury, and any fact, roughly speaking, is relevant between which and
                    the fact to be proved there may be a connexion as cause and effect. See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Evidence.</hi> When the question is what damages the plaintiff
                    has sustained, the court openly undertakes to review their decision on its
                    merits—although this is as much a question of fact as any other. If the court
                    deems the damages excessive, it will order a new trial to take place,—generally
                    adding the condition that the verdict may stand if the plaintiff will accept a
                    reduced sum for damages, which in effect amounts to the court itself finding a
                    verdict.</p>
                <p>The function of the jury in libel cases was in the last century the subject of a
                    celebrated controversy which ended in the passing of Fox’s Libel Act in 1792.
                    Lord Mansfield and the judges held that the criminality or innocence of an act
                    done, including any paper written, is matter of law and not matter of fact, an
                    undeniable proposition then and since. They had also been in the habit of
                    directing the jury to consider only the question of publication, telling them
                    that its guilt or innocence was not for them to decide. Fox’s Act declares and
                    enacts that the jury may give a general verdict of guilty or not guilty in libel
                    cases, and shall not be required or directed by the court or judge to find a
                    verdict of guilty on proof of publication and of the sense ascribed to it by the
                    prosecution.</p>
                <p>Of the merits of the institution little space is left to speak. The present
                    English jury has at least one conspicuous defect in the requirement of
                    unanimity; yet, so far as that is concerned, in practice it produces hardly any
                    appreciable evil. All that Bentham and others have urged against it—the
                    application of a kind of torture to force conviction on the minds of jurors, the
                    indifference to veracity which the concurrence of unconvinced minds must produce
                    in the public mind, the probability that jurors will disagree and trials be
                    rendered abortive, and the absence of any reasonable security in the unanimous
                    verdict that would not exist in the verdict of a majority— all this is
                    undeniably true. Yet we rarely hear of juries disagreeing or of jurors agreeing
                    under compulsion. When civil juries were established in Scotland, this was one
                    of the arguments used against the experiment, but it has been stated by the
                    judge, Mr Commissioner Adam, under whom the system was started, that he only
                    knew of one instance of disagreement during a period of twenty years. English
                    experience is much the same, and a reform which twenty or thirty years ago was
                    pronounced absolutely necessary by conservative jurists is now hardly ever heard
                    of. Practically juries have no difficulty in coming to a unanimous verdict; and,
                    if a guess may be hazarded on so wide a subject, they have probably less
                    difficulty now than ever. One cause of that result may be the deference which
                    juries invariably pay to the carefully suggested opinion of the judge—arising no
                    doubt from such perfect confidence in the bench as did not always exist, and
                    would not always have been deserved if it had existed.</p>
                <p>But, apart from any incidental defects, it may be doubted whether, as an
                    instrument for the investigation of truth, the jury deserves all the encomiums
                    which have been passed upon it. In criminal cases, especially of the graver
                    kind, i(j is perhaps the best tribunal that could be devised. There the element
                    of moral doubt enters largely into the consideration of the case, and that can
                    best be measured by a popular tribunal. Opinion in England is unanimously
                    against subjecting a man to serious punishment as a result of conviction before
                    a judge sitting without a jury, and the judges themselves would be the first to
                    deprecate so great a responsibility. But in civil causes, where the issue must
                    be determined one way or the other on the balance of probabilities, a single
                    judge would probably be a better tribunal than the present combination of judge
                    and jury. Even if it be assumed that he would on the whole come to the same
                    conclusion as a jury deliberating under his directions, he would come to it more
                    quickly. Time would be saved in taking evidence, summing up would be
                    unnecessary, and the addresses of counsel would inevitably be shortened and
                    concentrated on the real points at issue.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Jury in Scotland.—</hi> According to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Regiam Majestatem,</hi> which is identical with the treatise of Glanvill on the
                    law of England (but whether the original or only a copy of that work is a
                    question which need not delay us), trial by jury existed in Scotland for civil
                    and criminal cases from as early a date as in England, and there is reason to
                    believe that at all events the system became established at a very early date.
                    Its history was very different from that of the English jury system. In Scotland
                    trial by jury survived for criminal trials, but became extinct in civil cases.
                    In the criminal assize the jury has always consisted of fifteen persons chosen
                    from the jury lists, general and special, drawn up by the sheriff,—one-third of
                    the jury being chosen from the special, and two-thirds from the general list.
                    The verdict is to be that of the majority of the jury, and formerly.it had to be
                    expressed in writing, but may now be delivered <hi rend="italic">viva voce</hi>
                    by the chancellor or foreman. Besides the “guilty” or “not guilty” to which the
                    English jury is restricted, a Scotch jury may bring in a verdict of “not
                    proven,” which has legally the same effect as “not guilty” in releasing the
                    accused from further charge, while it practically inflicts upon him the stigma
                    of moral guilt for the rest of his life.</p>
                <p>The civil jury was reintroduced in Scotland by the Act 55 Geo. III. c. 42, mainly
                    on account of the difficulty which Scotch appeals turning on questions of fact
                    presented to the House of Lords. Originally the juries were appointed to try
                    issues sent from the Court of Session under the direction of three lords
                    commissioners, but afterwards the procedure by jury was united with the ordinary

                    The jury was copied strictly from the English practice: the jurors are twelve in
                    number, and their verdict must be unanimous. If they fail to agree within twelve
                    (now six) hours, they must be discharged. This experiment was not at first
                    popular, and it is doubtftxl if it has even now become assimilated to Scotch
                    practice.</p>
