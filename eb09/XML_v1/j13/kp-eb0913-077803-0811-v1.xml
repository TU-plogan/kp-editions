                <p><label type="entry">JUNO</label>, one of the chief goddesses of the Roman state,
                    was identified through the influence of Greek religion with the Hellenic goddess
                    Hera. It is exceedingly unlikely that this identification is grounded on any
                    real connexion between the two, as is the case with Zeus and Jupiter (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Jupiter);</hi> it was suggested solely by some superficial
                    points of resemblance. There was a certain analogy in the relation which they
                    respectively bore to the chief god; but it is probable that the marriage of
                    Jupiter and Juno is not a native but a borrowed idea. In Latin and in modern
                    literature the character of Juno is wholly that of the Greek Hera (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Hera).</hi> The opinion is general that Juno is not an Aryan
                    goddess, but adopted from a non-Aryan race; if so, she must be Etruscan. One of
                    the chief cults of Juno in Rome was that of Juno Regina on the Aventine. She had
                    been brought thither by Camillus when Rome conquered the Etruscan city of Veii
                    and adopted its patron goddess Juno. The Etruscan name is apparently Uni (see
                    Deecke, <hi rend="italic">Das</hi><hi rend="italic">Templum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">von Piacenza).</hi> Another great seat of the worship of Juno was
                    Lanuvium. When that city was conquered, the cultus of Juno Sospita was carried
                    to Rome and established on the Palatine hill. Had Juno been an Aryan goddess, we
                    should certainly find a strong naturalistic element in her; but in fact her
                    sphere is almost entirely limited to human life and action. She must, therefore,
                    have been adopted from some civilized race, where the moral side of the divine
                    conception had been developed, and the naturalistic element which originally
                    belongs to all deities had lost prominence. At Veii, Lanuvium, and other places
                    Juno was the protecting goddess of the state and of society, and in a similar
                    way she had been worshipped at Rome from the earliest times under the epithets
                    Curiatia and Populona.</p>

                <p>The great cultus of Juno at Rome was on the Capitol, where Tarquin had
                    established her beside Jupiter to share with him the sovereignty of the state.
                    Though she has nothing to correspond to the naturalistic side of Jupiter, she is
                    readily associated with him in his moral character. She is the patroness and
                    guardian of women, as he is of men. She watches over women from their birth
                    onward. As Virginensis she protects maidenhood; as Pronuba, Juga or Jugalis,
                    Domiduca, Unxia, Cinxia, she ushers them through all the rites of marriage; as
                    Matrona she presides over their wedded life; as Lucina she helps them in
                    childbirth. The Kalends were sacred to Juno, as the Ides belong to Jupiter; and
                    thus the two divide the month and the year between them. Geese were her
                    favourite birds, and those which were kept in the Capitoline temple gave the
                    garrison timely warning of the Gallic attack. The chief feast of Juno was the
                    Matronalia, on the Kalends of March. Only maidens and wives of stainless
                    character could participate in the procession which was made to the temple of
                    Lucina on the Esquiline hill. On this the first day of the year, the women
                    received presents from their husbands and relatives, and gave presents to their
                    slaves. The name Junones was also applied to the attendant spirits who belong to
                    each woman, just as each man has his own genius. A woman swears by her Juno, a
                    lover by the Juno of his mistress; hence the sarcasm of Juvenal, “per Junonem
                    domini jurante ministro.” When Rome began to coin money in order to compete with
                    the currency of the Greek states on the south coast, the mint was the temple of
                    Juno Moneta; but this was probably due to Greek influence. The coinage was
                    modelled on that of the cities of Magna Graecia, which it was designed to
                    supplant; and these cities had their religious centre in the temple of Hera
                    Lacinia (see Curtius, “Religious Character of Greek Coins,” <hi rend="italic"
                    >Humism. Chron.,</hi> 1870, p. 102).</p>
