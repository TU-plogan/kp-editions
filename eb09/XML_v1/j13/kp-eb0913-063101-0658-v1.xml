                    rend="italic                     smallcaps"> (c.</hi> 1365-1416), the friend and
                    disciple of John Huss, derives the surname by which he is best known from his
                    native town, where he was born somewhere between 1360 and 1370. His family name
                    is sometimes, but erroneously, said to have been Faulfisch. After completing his
                    studies in the university of Prague, he proceeded (about 1396) to Oxford, where
                    in course of a residence of some duration he became acquainted with the teaching
                    and writings of Wycliffe, of which he became a zealous disseminator on his
                    return to his native land. In 1398 he took his bachelor’s degree at Prague, and
                    then visited Paris, Heidelberg, and Cologne; at the first-mentioned university
                    he seems to have graduated as master of arts. Returning about 1407 to Prague, he
                    took a prominent part with Huss in the university disputes which led to the
                    withdrawal of the German “nation.” So great did his reputation for learning,
                    energy, and sagacity become that he was employed by Ladislaus II., king of
                    Poland, in 1410 to assist in placing the university of Cracow upon a proper
                    footing, while by Sigismund, king of Hungary, he was, although not in orders,
                    invited to preach before him at Ofen. His public discourses in Hungary, however,
                    soon brought him under suspicion of Wycliffite heresy, and he found it necessary
                    to fly the country; taking refuge in Vienna, he was there arrested and thrown
                    into prison, but on the intervention of his friends in Prague obtained his
                    release. He now again became closely associated<pb break="no"

                    once more returned, and where he remained after the expulsion of his friend. In
                    1415 he went spontaneously to Constance, determined to do what he could for
                    Huss, who had meanwhile been imprisoned there; the news he received on his
                    arrival were so discouraging, however, that, panic-stricken, he immediately
                    again withdrew. Though without a safe conduct he would no doubt have reached
                    Prague in safety had he only been able to hold his peace; but while resting at
                    Hirschau he allowed his feelings to gain the mastery of him, and, in the
                    presence of many clergy, broke out in vehement denunciation of the injustice of
                    the council; the consequence was that he was forthwith arrested by order of the
                    duke of Bavaria and sent back a prisoner to Constance (May 1415). There, after
                    enduring the most rigorous confinement for some months, he was brought before a
                    public session of the council on September 23, 1415, when he made a full
                    retractation of all errors against the Catholic faith, especially those of
                    Wycliffe and Huss. His enemies, however, were determined that not even thus
                    should he escape their hands; by Michael de Causis and Stephen Palecz (who also
                    had made themselves conspicuous in the persecution of Huss) it was declared that
                    the recantation was ambiguous, and new articles were exhibited against their
                    victim. Thrice again he was brought before a general congregation of the
                    council. On the last of these occasions (May 26, 1416) all his timidity seems to
                    have finally left him. In a bold and vigorous declamation he solemnly retracted
                    the retractation which had been wrung from him eight months before; “of all the
                    sins that I have committed since my youth, none weigh so heavily on my mind and
                    cause me such keen remorse as that which I committed in this evil place when I
                    approved of the iniquitous sentence given against Wycliffe and against the holy
                    martyr John Huss, my mister and friend.” Four days afterwards he was condemned
                    as a relapsed heretic; his reply was an appeal to the supreme Judge before whom
                    he and his accusers alike were destined to stand. Two days later he marched with
                    a cheerful countenance to the stake, bidding the executioner light the fire
                    before his face; “had I the least fear, I should not be standing in this place.”
                    His ashes, like those of Huss, were gathered and thrown into the Rhine. Jerome
                    owes his fame to his association with Huss, and particularly to the splendid
                    heroism with which in his death he atoned for one moment of faltering in his
                    loyalty to the doctrines to which he had faithfully devoted his life. No
                    literary remains survive by which we might estimate with precision how far the
                    claims to learning and superiority of intellect often made for him can be
                    justified. Of absolute originality he obviously had none. The truth seems to be
                    that, with considerable advantages of birth and early training, and with a mind
                    more variously accomplished than that of Huss, he nevertheless wanted the moral
                    weight which gave his master so great an ascendency over the minds and hearts of
                    men. Bold even to rashness, his courage was shown rather in bursts of furious
                    vehemence than in the equable tenor of his life, and more than once failed him
                    in critical moments. In this weakness he only reflected the turbulent and unruly
                    spirit of the age he lived in; but it is also a weakness that sufficiently
                    justifies history in assigning to him a comparatively subordinate though still
                    highly honourable place among the pioneers of the Reformation.</p>
