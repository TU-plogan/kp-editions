                    rend="smallcaps">San Gennaro</hi></label>, the patron saint of Naples, according
                    to the Roman Breviary, was bishop of Benevento, and flourished towards the close
                    of the 3d century after Christ. On the outbreak of the persecution by Diocletian
                    and Maximian, he was taken to Nola and brought before Timotheus the governor of
                    Campania, on account of his profession of the Christian religion. After he had
                    withstood various assaults upon his constancy, he was at last .sentenced to be
                    cast into the fiery furnace, through which he passed wholly unharmed. On the
                    following day, along with a number of fellow martyrs, he was exposed to the fury
                    of wild beasts, which, however, contrary to their nature, laid themselves down
                    in tame submission at his feet. Timotheus, again pronouncing sentence of death,
                    was struck with blindness, but immediately healed by the powerful intercession
                    of the saint, a miracle which converted nearly five thousand men on the spot.
                    The ungrateful judge, only roused to further fury by these occurrences, caused
                    the execution of Januarius by the sword to be forthwith carried out. The body
                    was ultimately removed by the inhabitants of Naples to that city, where the
                    relic became very famous for its miracles, especially in counteracting the more
                    dangerous eruptions of Vesuvius. His clotted blood, preserved in a glass phial,
                    even to this day is wont to liquefy and bubble up as if but recently shed
                    whensoever it is placed within sight of the martyr’s head. So far the Breviary.
                    This liquefaction of the blood, which is brought about at least twice a year, on
                    May 1 and on September 19, the day assigned to this saint in the Roman calendar,
                    is a miracle the recurrence of which is observed by believing Neapolitans on
                    each occasion with various festivities extending over a whole week. The
                    Januarius of Cordoba, to whom along with Saints Faustus and Martialis, a special
                    local office is assigned in the Spanish Breviary, has a story which bears a
                    general resemblance to the preceding; he also is stated to have suffered under
                    Diocletian and Maximian, but the scene of his martyrdom was Cordoba. His day is
                    October 13, and the invention of his remains is commemorated on November 26. The
                    number of minor saints of this name is very considerable; the cognomen appears
                    to have been somewhat common.</p>
