                    the discoverer of vaccination, was born at Berkeley, Gloucestershire, on May 17,
                    1749. His father, the Rev. Stephen Jenner, rector of Rockhampton and vicar of
                    Berkeley, came of a family that had been long established in that county, and
                    was possessed of considerable landed property; he died when the subject of this
                    notice was only six years old, but his place was admirably taken by his eldest
                    son, the Rev. Stephen Jenner, who brought his brother up with paternal care and
                    tenderness. Edward received his early education in local schools at
                    Wotton-under-Edge and Cirencester, where he already showed a strong taste for
                    natural history. The medical profession having been selected for him, he began
                    his studies under Mr Ludlow, a surgeon of Sodbury near Bristol; but in his
                    twenty-first year he proceeded to London, where he became a favourite pupil of
                    the celebrated John Hunter, in whose house he resided for two years. During this
                    period he was employed by Sir Joseph Banks to arrange and prepare the valuable
                    zoological specimens which he had brought back from Captain Cook’s first voyage
                    in 1771. He must have acquitted himself satisfactorily in this task, since he
                    was offered the post of naturalist in the second expedition, but declined it as

                    eldest brother, to whom he was much attached. His speedy success in practice did
                    not engross his intellectual activity. He was the principal founder of a local
                    medical society, to which he contributed several papers of marked ability, in
                    one of which he apparently anticipated later discoveries concerning the
                    rheumatic inflammations of the heart. He maintained a correspondence with John
                    Hunter, under whose direction he investigated various points in biology,
                    particularly the hibernation of hedgehogs and the habits of the cuckoo; his
                    paper on the latter subject was laid by Hunter before the Royal Society, and
                    appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi> for 1788. He
                    also devoted considerable attention to the varied geological character of the
                    district in which he lived, collecting fossils from the Oolite and Lias, and
                    constructed the first balloon seen in those parts. He was a great favourite in
                    general society, from his agreeable and instructive conversation, and the many
                    accomplishments he possessed. Thus he was a fair musician, both as a part-singer
                    and as a performer on the violin and flute, and a very successful writer, after
                    the fashion of that time,’ of fugitive pieces of verse, one of which—“The Signs
                    of Rain”—has been frequently reprinted, and enumerates minutely all the signs of
                    the weather in verse not unworthy of Crabbe. In 1788 he married Catherine
                    Kings-cote, a union destined to form a most important element in his happiness.
                    In 1792 he resolved to confine himself to practising as a physician, and
                    accordingly obtained the degree of doctor of medicine from St Andrews. Finding
                    that Berkeley could not support a physician, he began, a few years later, to
                    visit Cheltenham annually.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile the discovery that was to immortalize his memory had been slowly
                    maturing in his mind. When only an apprentice at Sodbury, his attention had been
                    directed to the relations between cow-pox and small-pox in connexion with a
                    popular belief which he found current in Gloucestershire, as to the antagonism
                    between these two diseases. During his stay in London he appears to have
                    mentioned the thing repeatedly to Hunter, who, being engrossed by other
                    important pursuits, was not so strongly persuaded as Jenner was of its possible
                    importance, yet spoke of it to his friends and in his lectures. After he began
                    practice in Berkeley, Jenner was always accustomed to inquire what his
                    professional brethren thought of it; but he found that, when medical men had
                    noticed the popular report at all, they supposed it to be based on an imperfect
                    induction of facts. His first careful investigation of the subject dates from
                    about 1775, and five years elapsed before he had succeeded in clearing away the
                    most perplexing difficulties by which it was surrounded. He first satisfied
                    himself that two different forms of disease had been hitherto confounded under
                    the term “cow-pox,” only one of which protected against small-pox, and that many
                    of the cases of failure were to be thus accounted for; and his next step was to
                    ascertain that the true cow-pox itself only protects when communicated at a
                    particular stage of the disease. At the same time he came to the conclusion that
                    “the grease” of horses is the same disease as cow-pox and small-pox, each being
                    modified by the organism in which it was developed—an opinion which is generally
                    held at the present day. For many years, cow-pox being scarce in his county, he
                    had no opportunity of inoculating the disease, and so putting his discovery to
                    the test, but he did all he could in the way of collecting information and
                    communicating what he had ascertained. Thus in 1788 he carried a drawing of the
                    cow-pox, as seen on the hands of a milkmaid, to London, and showed it to Sir E.
                    Home and others, who agreed that it was “an interesting and curious subject,”
                    but by no means realized its practical importance. At length, on the 14th of May
                    1796, he was able to inoculate James Phipps, a boy about eight years old, with
                    cow-pox matter. On the first of the following July the boy was carefully
                    inoculated with variolous matter, but (as Jenner had predicted) no small-pox
                    followed. The discovery was now complete, but he desired to act without
                    precipitation, and was unable to repeat his experiment until 1798, owing to the
                    disappearance of cow-pox from the dairies. He then repeated his inoculations
                    with the utmost care, and prepared a pamphlet which should announce his
                    discovery to the world. Before publishing it, however, he thought it well to
                    visit London, so as to demonstrate the truth of his assertions to his friends;
                    but he remained in London nearly three months, without being able to find any
                    person who would submit to be vaccinated. Soon after he had returned home,
                    however, Mr Cline, an eminent surgeon, inoculated some vaccine matter over the
                    diseased hip-joint of a child, thinking the counter-irritation might be useful,
                    and found the patient afterwards incapable of acquiring small-pox. In the autumn
                    of the same year, Jenner met with the first opposition to vaccination; and this
                    was the more formidable because it proceeded from Dr Ingenhousz, a celebrated
                    physician and man of science. But meanwhile Mr Cline’s case, and his advocacy of
                    vaccination, brought it much more decidedly before the medical profession, of
                    whom the majority were prudent enough to suspend their judgment until they had
                    more ample information. But besides these there were two noisy and troublesome
                    factions, the one of which opposed vaccination as an useless and dangerous
                    practice, while the other endangered its success much more by their rash and
                    selfseeking advocacy. At the head of the latter was one Dr Pearson, who in
                    November 1798 published a pamphlet speculating upon the subject, before even
                    seeing a case of cow-pox, and afterwards endeavoured, by lecturing on the
                    subject, and supplying the virus, to put himself forward as the chief agent in
                    the cause. The matter which he distributed, which had been derived from cows
                    that were found to be infected in London, was found frequently to produce, not
                    the slight disease described by Jenner, but more or less severe eruptions
                    resembling small-pox. Jenner concluded at once that this was due to an
                    accidental contamination of the vaccine with variolous matter, and a visit to
                    London in the spring of 1799 convinced him that this was the case. In the course
                    of this year the practice of vaccination spread over England, being urged
                    principally by non-professional persons of position; and towards its close
                    attempts were made to found institutions for gratuitous vaccination and for
                    supplying lymph to all who might apply for it. Pearson proposed to establish one
                    of these in London, without Jenner’s knowledge, in which he offered him the post
                    of honorary corresponding physician! On learning this scheme to supplant him,
                    and to carry on an institution for public vaccination on principles which he
                    knew to be partly erroneous, Jenner once more visited London early in 1800, when
                    he had influence enough to secure the abandonment of the project. He was
                    afterwards presented to the king, the queen, and the prince of Wales, whose
                    encouragement materially aided the spread of vaccination in England. Meanwhile
                    it had made rapid progress in the United States, where it was introduced by Dr
                    Waterhouse, the professor of physic at Cambridge, Massachusetts, and on the
                    continent of Europe, where it was at first diffused by Dr de Carro of Vienna,
                    who practised it with the greatest zeal and discretion, and thence spread to
                    Geneva. In consequence of the war between England and France, the discovery was
                    later in reaching Paris; but, its importance once realized, it spread rapidly
                    over France, Spain, and Italy. It would be tedious and unprofitable to dwell
                    minutely on the extension of vaccination over the whole world; but a few of the
                    incidents<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n651/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0651-0624"/> connected with it are too remarkable to be
                    omitted. Perhaps the most striking is the expedition which was sent out by the
                    court of Spain in 1803, for the purpose of diffusing cow-pox through all the
                    Spanish possessions in the Old and New Worlds, and which returned in three
                    years, having circumnavigated the globe, and succeeded beyond its utmost
                    expectations. Many of the expressions of enthusiasm seem to us strained and
                    almost ridiculous. Thus we read with surprise how clergymen in Geneva and
                    Holland urged vaccination upon their parishioners from the pulpit; how in
                    Sicily, South America, and Naples religious processions were formed for the
                    purpose of receiving it; how the anniversary of Jenner’s birthday, or of the
                    successful vaccination of James Phipps, was for many years celebrated as a feast
                    in Germany; and how the empress of Russia caused the first child operated upon
                    to receive the name of “Vaccinoff,” and to be educated at the public expense.
                    The truth is that we who live in that security from the horrible and universal
                    plague of small-pox for which we are indebted to Jenner’s immortal discovery
                    cannot realize the greatness of the blessing he conferred upon mankind. This
                    universal enthusiasm caused vaccination to spread over the whole world in the
                    marvellously short period of six years, it being accepted with equal readiness
                    by nations of the most diverse climes, habits, and religions. About the close of
                    the year 1801 Jenner’s friends in his native county of Gloucester presented him
                    with a small service of plate as a testimonial of the esteem in which they held
                    his discovery. This was intended merely as a preliminary to the presenting of a
                    petition to Parliament for a grant. He was advised to apply for this, partly to
                    obtain the formal approval of the highest court in this country for vaccination,
                    but also for personal reasons. The premier, Mr Addington, approved fully of this
                    step, and fixed the 17th of March 1802 for the presentation of his petition.
                    This was referred to a committee, of which Admiral Berkeley, one of his warmest
                    friends, was chairman, which examined carefully into the utility of vaccination,
                    and Jenner’s claims to its discovery. The investigations of this committee
                    resulted in a report in favour of the grant, and ultimately in a vote of
                    &lt;£10,000.</p>
                <p>Towards the end of 1802 steps were taken to form a society for the proper spread
                    of vaccination in London, and the “Royal Jennerian Society” was finally
                    established, Jenner returning to town (having retired to Berkeley for three
                    months) to preside at the first meeting. This institution began very
                    prosperously, more than twelve thousand persons having been inoculated in the
                    first eighteen months, and with such effect that the deaths from small-pox,
                    which for the latter half of the last century had averaged 2018 annually, fell,
                    in 1804, to 622. Unfortunately the chief resident inoculator soon set himself up
                    as an authority opposed to Dr Jenner, and this led to such dissensions as caused
                    the society to die out in 1808.</p>
                <p>Jenner was led, by the language of the chancellor of the exchequer when his grant
                    was proposed, to attempt practice in London, but after a year’s trial he
                    returned to Berkeley. His grant was not paid until 1804, and then, after the
                    deduction of about £1000 for fees, it did little more than pay the expenses
                    attendant upon his discovery. For he was so thoroughly known everywhere as the
                    discoverer of vaccination, that the correspondence of the whole world on this
                    subject was upon him. As he himself said, he was “the vaccine clerk of the whole
                    world and, at the same time, he continued to vaccinate gratuitously all the poor
                    who applied to him on certain days, so that he sometimes had as many as three
                    hundred persons waiting at his door. Meanwhile honours began to shower upon him
                    from abroad: he was elected a member of almost all the chief scientific
                    societies on the Continent, the first being that of Göttingen, where he was
                    proposed by the illustrious Blumenbach. But perhaps the most flattering proof of
                    his influence was derived from France. He endeavoured on several occasions to
                    obtain the release of some of the unfortunate Englishmen who had been detained
                    in France on the sudden termination of the peace of Amiens, but without success,
                    until, in the case of two persons (Dr Williams, a Ratcliffe travelling fellow,
                    and a Mr Williams) he applied to the emperor Napoleon himself. It was on this or
                    some such occasion (for he afterwards repeated his intercession) that Napoleon
                    was about to reject the petition, when Josephine uttered the name of Jenner. The
                    emperor paused and exclaimed—“Ah, we can refuse nothing to that name.” Somewhat
                    later he was of the same service to Englishmen confined in Mexico and in
                    Austria; and during the latter part of the great war persons before leaving
                    England would sometimes obtain certificates signed by him which served as
                    passports. In his own country his merits were less recognized. His applications
                    on behalf of French prisoners in England were less successful; he never shared
                    in any of the patronage at the disposal of the Government, and was even unable
                    to obtain a living for his nephew George.</p>
                <p>In 1806 Lord Henry Petty (afterwards the marquis of Lansdowne) became chancellor
                    of the exchequer, and was so convinced of the inadequacy of the former
                    parliamentary grant that he proposed an address to the crown, praying that the
                    college of physicians should be directed to report upon the success of
                    vaccination. Their report being strongly in its favour, the then chancellor of
                    the exchequer (Mr Spencer Perceval) proposed that a sum of £10,000 without any
                    charge for fee or reward should be paid to Dr Jenner. The anti-vaccinationists
                    found but one advocate in the House of Commons; and finally the sum was raised
                    to £20,000. Jenner, however, at the same time had the mortification of learning
                    that Government did not intend to take any steps towards checking small-pox
                    inoculation, which so persistently kept up that disease. About the same time a
                    subscription for his benefit was begun in India, where his discovery had been
                    gratefully received, but the full amount of this (£7383) only reached him in
                    1812.</p>
                <p>The Royal Jennerian Society having failed, the National Vaccine Establishment was
                    founded, for the extension of vaccination, in 1808. Jenner spent five months in
                    London for the purpose of organizing it, but was then obliged, by the dangerous
                    illness of one of his sons, to return to Berkeley. He had been appointed
                    director of the institution; but he had no sooner left London than Sir Lucas
                    Pepys, the president of the college of physicians, neglected his
                    recommendations, and formed the board out of the officials of that college and
                    the college of surgeons. Jenner at once resigned his post as director, though he
                    continued to give the benefit of his advice whenever it was needed, and this
                    resignation was a bitter mortification to him. In 1810 his eldest son died, and
                    Jenner’s grief at his loss, and his incessant labours, materially affected his
                    health. In the following year he happened to be in London when the town was much
                    excited by the case of one of Lord Grosvenor’s children, who took the small-pox
                    severely, after having been vaccinated by Jenner himself ten years before. The
                    boy’s recovery was no doubt to be ascribed to his vaccination, but the
                    occurrence revived for a time all the clamour with which the discovery had been
                    from the first greeted.</p>
                <p>In 1813 the university of Oxford conferred on Jenner the degree of M.D. It was
                    believed that this would lead to his election into the college of physicians,
                    but that learned body decided that he could not be admitted until he had
                    undergone an examination in classics. This <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n652/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0652-0625"/> Jenner at once refused; to brush up his classics
                    would, he said, “be irksome beyond measure. I would not do it for a diadem. That
                    indeed would be a bauble; I would not do it for John Hunter’s museum.”</p>
                <p>He visited London for the last time in 1814, when he was presented to the allied
                    sovereigns, and to most of the principal personages that accompanied them. In
                    the next year his wife died after a long illness, and he felt her loss most
                    acutely. It was the signal for him to retire from public life: he never left
                    Berkeley again, except for a day or two, as long as he lived. He found
                    sufficient occupation for the remainder of his life in collecting further
                    evidence on some points connected with his great discovery, and in his
                    engagements as a physician, a naturalist, and a magistrate. In 1818 a severe
                    epidemic of small-pox prevailed, and fresh doubts were thrown on the efficacy of
                    vaccination, in part, apparently, owing to the bad quality of the vaccine lymph
                    employed. This caused Jenner much annoyance, which was relieved by an able
                    defence of the practice, written by Sir Gilbert Blane. But this led him, in
                    1821, to send a circular letter to most of the medical men in the kingdom
                    inquiring into the effect of other skin diseases in modifying the progress of
                    cow-pox. A year later he published his last work, <hi rend="italic">On the
                    Influence of Artificial Eruptions in certain Diseases;</hi> and in 1823 he
                    presented his list paper—“On the Migration of Birds”—to the Royal Society. In
                    these pursuits the evening of his days passed happily away. On the 24th of
                    January 1823 he retired to rest apparently as well as usual, and next morning
                    rose and cime down to his library, where he was found insensible on the floor,
                    in a state of apoplexy, and with the right side paralysed. He never rallied, and
                    died the following morning, January 26, 1823.</p>
                <p>A public subscription was set on foot, shortly after his death, by the medical
                    men of his county, for the purpose of erecting some memorial in his honour, and
                    with much difficulty a sufficient sum was raised to enable a statue to be placed
                    in Gloucester cathedral. In 1850 another attempt was made to set up a monument
                    to him; this appears to have failed, but at length, in 1858, a statue of him was
                    erected by public subscription in London.</p>
                <p>Independently of that great discovery which will for ever render his name
                    immortal, Jenner possessed talents of observation and reflexion that would have
                    made him eminent as a naturalist and a physician. These qualities would have
                    been more widely appreciated had not his tastes for rural scenes and domestic
                    life led him to sacrifice such fame as is to be gained only amid the busy throng
                    of men. This resolution was strengthened by his love for the simple pleasures of
                    society, for which his varied accomplishments so well fitted him; indeed, there
                    can be little doubt that he would never have had the perseverance to carry
                    through his great discovery of vaccination had not his earnest benevolence
                    pressed it on him, as a duty, to confer such a great and permanent benefit on
                    the whole human race.</p>
                <p>Jenner’s life was written by the intimate friend of his later years, Dr Baron of
                    Gloucester (2 vols. 1827, 1838), and this excellent work is almost the sole
                    source from which the present and other biographies of him have been taken. (J.
