                <p><label type="entry">JOHN XXII</label>. (pope from 1316 to 1334) was born at
                    Cahors about 1244. His original name was Jacques d’Euse, and his father is said
                    to have been a cobbler. Tradition also affirms that the son learned the same
                    employment, but afterwards he was taken charge of by his uncle, a successful
                    merchant, who rose to be chancellor of Robert of Sicily. Through the instruction
                    of a Franciscan friar, Jacques d’Euse acquired, besides an acquaintance with
                    theology, a mastery of canon and civil law which afterwards stood him in good
                    stead; but, although he was also versed in all the details of statemanship, his
                    learning was saturated with scholasticism, and his political ideas were narrowed
                    by a mean and paltry ambition, the principal element of which was a miserly love
                    of gold. He was small in stature and slightly deformed, and his features are
                    said to have unpleasantly indicated his special moral defects. It is uncertain
                    whether he ever joined the Franciscan order, but at any rate he afterwards had
                    intimate connexions with the court of Naples, and some time before 1300 he was,
                    at the instance of the king, appointed by Boniface VIII. bishop of Frejus. By
                    means of forged letters purporting to have the authority of the king of Naples,
                    Clement V. was induced in 1310 to bestow upon him the see of Avignon; and,
                    notwithstanding that the fraud was soon discovered, he so recommended himself to
                    the pope by his prudent conduct and his knowledge of law that in 1312 he was
                    named cardinal-bishop of Porto. Robert of Naples also condescended to forget the
                    liberty that had been taken in the use of the royal seal, and, on the death of
                    Clement V. in 1316, the cardinals, through the liberal expenditure of Neapolitan
                    gold, were won over to elect the bishop of Porto to the papal chair. The
                    leanings of the new pope towards the French party were at once shown by his
                    choice of Avignon as his residence, and by his first promotion of cardinals, all
                    of whom except one were French. During the strife for the empire between Louis
                    of Bavaria and Frederick of Austria, John took no active part on either side,
                    but made use of the opportunity quietly to establish an Italian kingdom under
                    the rule of King Robert of Sicily, and after fortune declared for Louis at the
                    battle of Mühldorf in 1322 continued to act as if the imperial throne were still
                    vacant In consequence of this, Louis found himself compelled to enter into a
                    league with the Ghibellines, whereupon the pope summoned him to appear before
                    him at Avignon, and, on his declining immediate compliance with the request,
                    promulgated against him a ban of excommunication. The empire was offered to
                    Charles the Fair of France, who had married a daughter of the emperor Henry
                    VII., but her death lost him his chief support in Germany; and Louis, owing in a
                    great measure to the influence of the Franciscans, whom the persecutions of John
                    had greatly incensed against the authority of Rome, was accepted as emperor with
                    the unanimous consent of the states at Ratisbon in 1324, a decision fully
                    confirmed by the diet of Spires in 1326. In the following year he experienced
                    equal goodwill at the diet of the imperial feudatories at Trent. After receiving
                    the crown of Italy at Milan he entered Rome with the general acclamation of the
                    inhabitants, and was crowned emperor by two excommunicated bishops. But,
                    although the election of Peter of Corvara as rival pope under the name of
                    Nicholas V. was greeted with the loud approval of the citizens, the threatening
                    attitude of Robert of Naples made it impossible for the emperor and antipope to
                    prolong their stay in Rome, and afterwards a gradual reaction against the
                    'imperial cause took place throughout the whole of Italy. Nicholas was taken
                    prisoner at Pisa, but on making a complete recantation of his errors was
                    forgiven and absolved. With Louis, however, the pope altogether declined to come
                    to terms, although he found it impossible to establish a rival against him. The
                    last years of John were disquieted by a dispute regarding his tenet—held by most
                    theological authorities to be heretical—that the saints at death fall asleep and
                    do not enjoy the beatific vision until after the resurrection. So great latterly
                    became the general clamour against the doctrine that he found it necessary to
                    make an ambiguous semblance of retracting what he had formerly promulgated with
                    passionate zeal. He, however, never showed any tendency to relent in his
                    persecution of the Franciscans, and his persistent animosity against them was a
                    not unimportant element among the influences which produced the Reformation. He
                    died in 1334. By means of <hi rend="italic">annates</hi> he had greatly enriched
                    the papal treasury. His successor was Benedict XII.</p>
