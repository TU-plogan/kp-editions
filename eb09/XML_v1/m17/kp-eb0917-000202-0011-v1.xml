                    (1797-1835), poet, antiquary, and journalist, born in 1797, rendered service in
                    the collection of fugitive border poetry and wrote one or two very touching
                    songs in the Scotch dialect, dying before he had fulfilled the promise of his
                    earlier work. His short life was diversified by few incidents. The son of an
                    ironmonger in Glasgow,he was educated partly in Edinburgh and partly in Paisley.
                    At the age of fifteen he was apprenticed in the office of the sheriff-clerk at
                    Paisley, and appointed sheriff-clerk depute there in 1819. The impulse given by
                    Scott to the pursuit of local ballads was still strongly in force, and the young
                    law apprentice spent his leisure in collecting materials for a volume which he
                    published in 1819 under the title of <hi rend="italic">The Harp of
                    Renfrewshire.</hi> In the course of the next eight years he extended his studies
                    in the same field and published the results in 1827 in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Minstrelsy Ancient and Modern,</hi> prefaced by a very thorough historical
                    introduction. Meantime he made a reputation by casual poems in newspapers and
                    magazines, of which <hi rend="italic">Jeanie Morrison, My Heid is like to
                    break,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Wearie’s Cauld Well</hi> have taken a fixed
                    place in Scotch literature. These poems are his best work, but he gave most of
                    the energy of his vigorous intellect to writing ballads and songs in English;
                    and he interpreted the martial spirit of the Norse sea-rovers with an enthusiasm
                    and force which one would not expect from the plaintive character of his Scotch
                    poems. His critical power and his learning were probably too great for his
                    executive faculty; but, whatever may be thought of his promise as a poet, it was
                    undoubtedly quenched by his entrance into journalism and the fatiguing work of
                    newspaper editing. He became editor of the <hi rend="italic">Paisley
                    Advertiser</hi> in 1828, of the <hi rend="italic">Glasgow Courier</hi> in 1830,
                    and died suddenly of apoplexy in 1835. A trying examination before a
                    Parliamentary Committee was thought to have hastened his end; but Conservative
                    journalism at the time of the Reform Bill was exciting and uphill work, and it
                    is a fair inference from the sad tone of some of his later poems that a baffled
                    longing to achieve enduring fame added to the poet’s worries and increased the
                    strain on his constitution. A small volume of his poems was published in 1832,
                    and a larger volume with a memoir in 1849.</p>
