                <p><label type="entry">MUTTRA</label>, a district in the lieutenant-governorship of
                    the North-Western Provinces, India, lying between 27° 14' and 27° 58' N. lat.
                    and 77° 19' and 78° 33' E. long., is bounded on the N. by Aligarh and Gurgâon,
                    on the E. by Aligarh, Mâinpuri, and Etah, on the S. by Agra, and on the W. by
                    Bhartpur state, with an area of 1453 square miles. The district consists of an
                    irregular strip of territory lying on both sides of the Jumna. The general level
                    is only broken at the south-western angle by low ranges of limestone hills. The
                    eastern half consists for the most part of a rich upland plain, abundantly
                    irrigated by wells, rivers, and canals, while the western portion, though rich
                    in mythological association and antiquarian remains, is comparatively unfavoured
                    by nature. The crops are scanty, and the larger forest trees are not found. For
                    eight months of the year the Jumna shrinks to the dimensions of a mere rivulet,
                    meandering through a waste of sand. During the rains, however, it swells to a
                    mighty stream, a mile or more in breadth. Till recently nearly the whole of
                    Muttra consisted of pasture and woodland, but new roads constructed as relief
                    works in 1837 -38 have thrown open many large tracts of country, and the task of
                    reclamation has since proceeded rapidly.</p>
                <p>The census of 1881 returned the population of Muttra at 671,690 (males 360,967,
                    females 310,723), Hindus numbering 611,669 and Mohammedans 58,088. There were
                    only 65 native Christians. The population of the three municipal towns in 1881
                    was as follows Muttra, 55,016; Brindaban, 21,467; and Kosi, 11,231. In 1881-82,
                    1048 square miles were returned as cultivated, 172 as cultivable, and 103 as
                    uncultivable. <hi rend="italic">Jo&lt;ir</hi> and cotton form the principal

                    mass of the population is fairly well off, and the peasantry are described as
                    being in better circumstances than those of neighbouring districts. Great
                    extremes of temperature occur, the cold of winter being comparatively excessive,
                    while hot winds blow from the west with great violence during April, May, and
                    June. The average rainfall for the ten years ending 1869 was 23 <hi

                <p>The central portion of Muttra district forms one of the most sacred spots in
                    Hindu mythology. A circuit of 84 <hi rend="italic">kos</hi> around Gokul and
                    Brindaban bears the name of the Braj-Mandai, and carries with it many
                    associations of the earliest Aryan times. Here Krishna and his brother Balarâraa
                    fed their cattle upon the plain; and numerous relics of antiquity in the towns
                    of Muttra, Gobard-hân, Gokul, Mahaban, and Brindaban still attest the sanctity
                    with which this holy tract was invested. During the Buddhist period Muttra
                    became a centre of the new faith. After the invasion of Mahmιid of Ghazni the
                    city fell into insignificance till the reign of Akbar; and thenceforward its
                    history merges in that of the Jâts of Bhartpur, until it again acquired separate
                    individuality under Suraj Mall in the middle of the last century. The Bhartpur
                    chiefs took an active part in the disturbances consequent on the declining power
                    of the Mughal emperors, sometimes on the imperial side, and at others with the
                    Mahrattas. The whole of Muttra passed under British rule in 1804.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Muttra,</hi> chief town and administrative headquarters of
                    the above district, is situated on the right bank of the Jumna, about 30 miles
                    above Agra, in 27° 30' N. lat. and 77° 43' E. long., with a population (1881) of
                    55,016, viz., males 28,769, and females 26,247.</p>
                <p>It is an ancient town, mentioned by Fa Hian as a centre of Buddhism about 400 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi>; his successor Hiouen Thsang, about 650, states that
                    it then contained twenty Buddhist monasteries and five Brahmanical temples.
                    Muttra has suffered more from Mohammedan sack and plunder than most of the towns
                    of northern India. It was sacked by Mahmùd of Ghazni in 1017-18; about 1500
                    Sultan Sikandar Lodi utterly destroyed all the Hindu shrines, temples, and
                    images; and in 1636 Shah Jahan appointed a governor expressly to “stamp out
                    idolatry.” In 1669-70 Aurangzeb visited the city and continued the work of
                    destruction. Muttra was again captured and plundered by Ahmad Shah with 25,000
                    Afghan cavalry in 1756. The town still forms a great centre of Hindu devotion,
                    and large numbers of pilgrims flock annually to the festivals.</p>
