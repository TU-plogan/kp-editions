                    (1672-1750), a learned Italian scholar, historian, and antiquary, was born at
                    Vignola in the duchy of Modena 21st October 1672. Whilst still young he
                    attracted the attention of Father Bacchini, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n61/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0061-0050"/> the librarian of the duke of Modena, by whom he
                    was inspired with a taste for historical and antiquarian research, and
                    introduced to the study of MSS. Having taken minor orders in 1688, Muratori
                    proceeded to his degree of doctor <hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >utroque</hi><hi rend="italic">jure</hi> before 1694, in which year he was
                    appointed by Count Carlo Borromeo one of the doctors of the Ambrosian library at
                    Milan. From manuscripts now placed under his charge, and which had been hitherto
                    neglected, he made a selection of materials for several volumes <hi
                    rend="italic">{Anecdota),</hi> which he published with critical and explanatory
                    notes. The reputation he in consequence acquired was such that the duke of
                    Modena offered him the situation of keeper of the public archives of the duchy.
                    Muratori hesitated, until the offer of the additional post of librarian, on the
                    resignation of Father Bacchini, determined him in 1700 to return to Modena. The
                    remainder of his life was an almost uninterrupted course of ardent and
                    indefatigable intellectual labour. The preparation of numerous valuable tracts
                    on the history of Italy during the Middle Ages, and of dissertations and
                    discussions on obscure points of historical and antiquarian interest, as well as
                    the publication of his various philosophical, theological, legal, poetical, and
                    other works absorbed the greater part of his time and attention. These as they
                    successively appeared added to his growing reputation, and brought him into
                    communication with the most distinguished scholars of Italy, France, and
                    Germany. But they also exposed him in his later years to the machinations of the
                    envious. His enemies spread abroad the rumour that the pope, Benedict XIV., had
                    discovered in his writings passages strongly savouring of heresy, even of
                    atheism. Muratori appealed to the pope, repudiating the accusation. His Holiness
                    assured him of his protection, and, without expressing his approbation of the
                    opinions in question of the learned antiquary, freed him from the imputations of
                    his enemies. Muratori died, after a lengthened illness, on 23d January 1750, and
                    was buried with much pomp in the church of Santa Maria di Pomposa, in connexion
                    with which he had laboured as a diligent parish priest for many years. His
                    remains were afterwards, in the year 1774, removed to the church of St
                    Augustin.</p>
