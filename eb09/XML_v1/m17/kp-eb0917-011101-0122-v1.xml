                    (1810-1857), poet, play-writer, and novelist, was born on the 11th December 1810
                    in a house in the middle of old Paris, near the Hôtel Cluny. His father, Victor
                    de Musset, who in the course of his life held several ministerial posts of
                    importance, traced his descent back as far as 1140. In Alfred’s childhood there
                    were various things which fostered his imaginative power. He and his brother
                    Paul, who afterwards wrote a biography of Alfred, delighted in reading old
                    romances together, and in assuming the characters of the heroes of these
                    romances. But it was not until about 1826 that Musset gave any definite sign of
                    the mental force which afterwards distinguished him. In the summer of 1827 he
                    all but won a prix d’honneur by an essay on “The origin of our feelings,” and in
                    1828, when Scribe, Mélesville, and the elder Brazier were in the habit of coming
                    to Madame de Musset’s house at Auteuil, where drawing-room plays and charades
                    were constantly given, Musset, excited by this companionship, wrote his first
                    poem, which, to judge from the extracts preserved, was neither better nor worse
                    than much other work of clever boys who may or may not afterwards turn out to be
                    possessed of genius. Shortly after his first attempt in verse he was taken by
                    Paul Foucher to Victor Hugo’s house, where he met such men as Alfred de Vigny,
                    Mérimée, and Sainte-Beuve. It was under Hugo’s influence, no doubt, that he
                    composed a play. The scene was laid in Spain, and some lines, showing a marked
                    advance upon his first effort, are preserved. In 1828, when the war between the
                    classical and the romantic school of literature was growing daily more serious
                    and exciting, Musset, who had published some verses in a country newspaper,
                    boldly recited some of his work to Sainte-Beuve, who wrote of it to a friend,
                    “There is amongst us a boy full of genius.” At eighteen years old Musset
                    produced a translation, with a few insertions of his own, of De Quincey’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Opium-Eater.</hi> This was published by Marne, attracted no
                    attention, and has been long out of print. His first original volume was
                    published in 1829 under the name of <hi rend="italic">Cantes</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">d'Espagne et d’Italie,</hi> had an immediate and striking success,
                    provoked bitter opposition, and produced many unworthy imitations. In December
                    1830 he was just twenty years old, and was already conscious of that curious
                    double existence within him so frequently symbolized in his plays,—in Octave and
                    Célio for instance (in <hi rend="italic">Les Caprices de Marianne),</hi> who
                    also stand for the two camps, the men of matter and the men of feeling,—which he
                    has elsewhere described as characteristic of his generation. At this date his
                    piece the <hi rend="italic">Nuit Vénitienne</hi> was produced by Harel, manager
                    of the Odéon. The exact causes of its failure might now be far to seek; unlucky
                    stage accidents had something to do with it, but there seems reason to believe
                    that there was a strongly-organized opposition. However this may be, the result
                    was disastrous to the French stage; for it put a complete damper on the one poet
                    who, as he afterwards showed both in theoretical and in practical writings, had
                    the fine insight which took in at a glance the merits and defects both of the
                    classical and the romantic schools. Thus he was strong and keen to weld together
                    the merits of both schools in a new method which, but for the fact that there
                    has been no successor to grasp the wand which its originator wielded, might well
                    be called the school of Musset. The serious effect produced upon Musset by the
                    failure of his <hi rend="italic">Nuit Vénitienne</hi> is curiously illustrative
                    of his character. A man of greater strength and with equal belief in his own
                    genius might have gone on appealing to the public until he compelled them to
                    hear him. Musset gave up the attempt in disgust, and waited until the public
                    were eager to hear him without any invitation on his part. In the case of his
                    finest plays this did not happen until after his death; but long before that he
                    was fully recognized as a poet of the first rank, and as an extraordinary master
                    of character and language in prose-writing. In his complete disgust with the
                    stage after the failure above referred to there was no doubt something of a not
                    ignoble pride, but there was something also of weakness—of a kind of weakness
                    out of which it must be said sprang some of his most exquisite work, some of the
                    poems which could only have been written by a man who was face to face with
                    difficulties which were old enough in the experience of mankind, though for the
                    moment new and strange to him, and by which he felt himself to be
                    overwhelmed.</p>
                <p>In 1833 Musset published the volume called <hi rend="italic">Un Spectacle</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">dans un Fauteuil.</hi> One of the most striking pieces in this—
                    <hi rend="italic">Namouna—</hi> was written at the publisher’s request to fill
                    up some empty space; and this fact is noteworthy when taken in conjunction with
                    the horror which Musset afterwards so often expressed of doing anything like
                    writing “to order,”—of writing, indeed, in any way or at any moment except when
                    the inspiration or the fancy happened to seize him. The success of the volume
                    seemed to be small in comparison with that of his <hi rend="italic">Contes
                    d</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Espagne,</hi> but it led indirectly to Musset’s being
                    engaged as a contributor to the <hi rend="italic">Revue des Deux Mandes.</hi> In
                    this he published, in April 1833, <hi rend="italic">André</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >del Sarto,</hi> and he followed this six weeks later with <hi rend="italic">Les
                    Caprices de Marianne.</hi> This play, which now ranks as one of the classical
                    pieces in the repertory of the Théâtre Français, is a fine illustration of the
                    method above referred to, a method of which Musset gave something like a
                    definite explication five years later. This explication was also published in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Revue des Deux Mondes,</hi> and it set forth that the war
                    between the classical and the romantic schools could never end in a definite
                    victory for either school, nor was it desirable that it should so end. “It was
                    time,” Musset said, <hi rend="italic">“for</hi> a third school which should
                    unite the merits of each.” And in <hi rend="italic">Les Caprices de
                    Marianne</hi> these merits are most curiously and happily combined. It so
                    happens that, as the piece is generally given on the stage, with the omission of
                    one change of scene, the classical unities are almost exactly preserved, while
                    the whole play is impregnated with romanticism in the best sense of the word. It
                    has perhaps more of the Shakespearean quality—the quality of artfully mingling
                    the terrible, the grotesque, and the high comedy tones—which exists more or less
                    in all Musset’s longer and more serious plays than is found in any other of
                    these. In Claudio, the husband, the terrible and the grotesque are strangely and
                    powerfully allied; Tibia, his serving-man, is grotesque with a touch of grimness
                    caught from his master; Octave and Célio represent the two elements which were
                    always warring in Musset’s own heart—one is the careless half-cynical<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n123/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0123-0112"/> man of the world and the other the wholly tender
                    romantic lover; Marianne is that type of the highest comedy to which events lend
                    a touch of tragedy, while in Hermia, Célio’s mother, is the very poetry of
                    maternal love. The piece is called* a comedy, and it owes this title to its
                    extraordinary brilliance of dialogue, truth of characterization, and swiftness
                    in action, under which there is ever latent a sense of impending fate. Many of
                    the qualities indicated are found in others of Musset’s dramatic works, and
                    notably in <hi rend="italic">On</hi><hi rend="italic">ne badine pas avec</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">l'</hi><hi rend="italic">Amour,</hi> where the skill in insensibly
                    preparing his hearers or readers through a succession of dazzling comedy scenes
                    for the swift destruction of the end is very marked. But <hi rend="italic">Les
                    Caprices de Marianne</hi> is perhaps for this particular purpose of illustration
                    the most compact and most typical of all. One other point in Musset’s method may
                    be noted in connexion with this play. Paul de Musset asked him where he had ever
                    met a Marianne. He answered, “Everywhere and nowhere; she is not a woman, she is
                    woman.” The appearance of <hi rend="italic">Les Caprices de Marianne</hi> in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Revue</hi> was followed by that of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rolla,</hi> a marked symptom of the “maladie du siècle.” Then came the
                    unfortunate journey which Musset made to Italy with George Sand. It is well
                    known that the rupture of what was for a time a most passionate attachment had a
                    disastrous effect upon Musset, and brought out the weakest side of his moral
                    character. He was at first absolutely and completely struck down by the blow.
                    But it was not so well known until Paul de Musset pointed it out that the
                    passion expressed in the <hi rend="italic">Nuit de Décembre,</hi> written about
                    twelve months after the journey to Italy, referred not to George Sand but to
                    another and quite a different woman. The story of the Italian journey and its
                    results are told under the guise of fiction from two points of view in the two
                    volumes called respectively <hi rend="italic">Elle et</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Lui</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Lui</hi><hi rend="italic">et Elle.</hi> During
                    Musset’s absence in Italy <hi rend="italic">Fantasio</hi> was published in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Revue,</hi> and not long after his return <hi rend="italic"
                    >On</hi><hi rend="italic">ne badine pas avec</hi><hi rend="italic">Γ</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Amour</hi> appeared in the same way. In 1835 he produced <hi
                    rend="italic">Lucie,</hi><hi rend="italic">La Nuit de Mai, La Quenouille</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de Barberine,</hi><hi rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Chandelier,</hi><hi rend="italic">La Loi sur la Presse, La Nuit de
                    Décembre,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">La Confession d'un Enfant du Siècle.</hi>
                    The last-named work, a prose work, is exceptionally interesting as exhibiting
                    the poet’s frame of mind at the time, and the approach to a revulsion from the
                    Bonapartist ideas amid which he had been brought up in his childhood. To the
                    supreme power of Napoleon he in this work attributed that moral sickness of the
                    time which he described. “One man,” he wrote, “absorbed the whole life of
                    Europe; the rest of the human race struggled to fill their lungs with the air
                    that he had breathed.” When the emperor fell, “a ruined world was a
                    resting-place for a generation weighted with care.” The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Confession</hi> is further important, apart from its high literary merit, as
                    exhibiting in many passages the poet’s tendency to shun or wildly protest
                    against all that is disagreeable or difficult in human life— a tendency to
                    which, however, much of his finest work was due. In 1836 appeared, amongst other
                    things, <hi rend="italic">Il</hi><hi rend="italic">ne faut jurer de Rien,</hi> a
                    comedy which holds, and is likely long to hold, the stage of the Théâtre
                    Français, and the beginning of the brilliant letters of Dupuis and Cotonet on
                    romanticism. <hi rend="italic">Il</hi><hi rend="italic">ne faut jurer de
                    Rien</hi> is as typical of hi§ comedy work as is <hi rend="italic">Les
                    Caprices</hi><hi rend="italic">de Marianne</hi> of the work in which a terrible
                    fatality underlies the brilliant dialogue and light keen characterization. In
                    1839 were published the <hi rend="italic">Caprice</hi> (which afterwards found
                    its way to the Paris stage through, in the first instance, the accident of
                    Madame Allan the actress hearing of it in a Russian translation) and some of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Nouvelles.</hi> In 1839 he began a romance called <hi
                    rend="italic">Le Poète Déchu,</hi> of which the existing fragments are full of
                    passion and insight. In 1840 he passed through a period of feeling that the
                    public did not recognize his genius—as, indeed, they did not—and wrote a very
                    short but very striking series of reflexions headed with the words “À trente
                    Ans,” which Paul de Musset published in his <hi rend="italic">Life.</hi> In 1841
                    there came out in the <hi rend="italic">Revue de Paris</hi> Musset’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Le Rhin Allemand,</hi> an answer to Becker’s poem which appeared
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Revue des Deux Mondes.</hi> This fine war-song made a
                    great deal of noise, and brought to the poet quantities of challenges from
                    German officers. Between this date and 1845 he wrote comparatively little. In
                    the last-named year the charming “proverbe” <hi rend="italic">Il</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">faut qu'une</hi><hi rend="italic">Porte</hi><hi rend="italic">soit
                    ouverte ou fermée</hi> appeared. In 1847 <hi rend="italic">Un Caprice</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">was</hi> produced at the Théâtre Français, and the employment in
                    it of such a word as “rebonsoir” shocked some of the old guard of the old
                    school. In 1848 <hi rend="italic">II</hi><hi rend="italic">ne faut jurer de
                    Rien</hi> was played at the Théâtre Français, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chandelier</hi> at the Théâtre Historique. Between this date and 1851 <hi
                    rend="italic">Bettine</hi> was produced on the stage and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Carmosine</hi> written; and between this time and the date of his death, from
                    an affection of the heart, in May 1857, the poet produced no large work of
                    importance.</p>
                <p>Alfred de Musset now holds the rank which Sainte-Beuve first accorded, then
                    denied, and then again accorded to him as a poet of the first rank. He had
                    genius, though not genius of that strongest kind which its possessor can always
                    keep in check. His own character worked both for and against his success as a
                    writer. His very weakness and his own consciousness of it produced such
                    beautiful work as, to take one instance, the <hi rend="italic">Nuit</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">d'Octobre,</hi> but it too often prevented him, from one cause or
                    another, from producing any work at all. His <hi rend="italic">Nouvelles</hi>
                    are extraordinarily brilliant; his poems are charged with passion, fancy, and
                    fine satiric power; in his plays he hit upon a method of his own, in which no
                    one has dared or availed to follow him with any closeness. He was one of the
                    first, most original, and in the end most successful of the first-rate writers
                    included in the phrase “the 1830 period.” The wildness of his life, though it
                    cannot be denied, has probably been exaggerated; and it has lately been
                    suggested by Μ. Arsène Houssaye that the symptoms of the heart disease which
                    caused his death may sometimes have been mistaken for the symptoms of
                    intoxication. His brother Paul de Musset has given in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Biographie</hi> a striking testimony to the finer side of his character. In the
                    later years of his life Musset was elected, not without some difficulty, a
                    member of the French Academy. Besides the works above referred to, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Nouvelles et</hi><hi rend="italic">Contes</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Oeuvres Posthumes,</hi> in which there is much of interest
                    concerning the great tragic actress Rachel, should be specially mentioned.
                    Musset has had no successor in France either as a poet or as a dramatist. (W. H.
