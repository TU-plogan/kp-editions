                <p><label type="entry">MURGER, <hi rend="smallcaps">Henry</hi></label> (1822-1861),
                    French man-of-letters, was born in February 1822 at Paris. His father was a <hi
                    rend="italic">concierge,</hi> with which employment he combined the trade of
                    tailoring. At the age of fifteen Murger was sent into a lawyer’s office, but the
                    occupation was very uncongenial to him, and his father’s trade still more so. He
                    thus incurred the paternal displeasure, and in his devotion to literature and
                    liberty began to meet with not a few of the hardships which he afterwards
                    described. He was, however, for a time saved from actual want by the employment
                    of secretary to the Russian Count Tolstoy, which was procured for him by Μ. de
                    <hi rend="italic">J</hi> ouy (an old academician of the classical faction, but a
                    very kind friend to youthful literary aspirants) in the year 1838. For the next
                    ten years little positive is known of Murger’s life except that it probably
                    provided the experiences, and certainly supplied him with the ideas, of his most
                    famous book. He made his first independent appearance as an author in 1843 with
                    a book entitled <hi rend="italic">Via Dolorosa,</hi> but it made no mark. He
                    also tried journalism, and the paper <hi rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Castor,</hi> which figures in the <hi rend="italic">Vie de</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Bohème,</hi> and which combined devotion to the interests of the
                    hat trade with recondite philosophy and elegant literature, is said to have been
                    a fact, though a shortlived one. At length he was introduced to better work,
                    either in the <hi rend="italic">Corsaire,</hi> then a favourite organ of the
                    second romantic generation, or in the <hi rend="italic">Artiste ∙,</hi> for both
                    stories are told. In 1848 appeared the collected sketches called the <hi
                    rend="italic">Vie de</hi><hi rend="italic">Bohème.</hi> This book, which is of
                    its kind famous, describes the fortunes and misfortunes, the loves, studies,
                    amusements, and sufferings, of a group of impecunious students, artists, and men
                    of letters, of whom Rodolphe represents Murger himself, while the others have
                    been more or less positively identified. Murger, in fact, belonged to a set or
                    clique of so-called Bohemians, the most remarkable of whom, besides himself,
                    were Privat d’Anglemont and Champfleury. The <hi rend="italic">Scènes de
                    la</hi><hi rend="italic">Vie</hi><hi rend="italic">de Bohème</hi> have been very
                    variously judged. Their very easy-going morality, and the supposed danger of
                    their pictures in prompting to imitation have prejudiced some readers against
                    the book. It is fair, however, to Murger to say that he neither holds up the
                    Bohemian as a hero, nor in the least disguises the hardship and the folly of his
                    ways. He was himself an instance of the dangers of Bohemianism. From the date
                    above mentioned it was perfectly easy for him to make a comfortable living by
                    journalism and general literature. He was introduced in 1851 to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Revue des Deux Mondes,</hi> and contributed to it for two or three
                    years, and he never had any difficulty in securing or keeping literary
                    employment. But he was a slow, a fastidious, and a very capricious worker, and
                    his years of hardship and dissipation had very seriously impaired his health. He
                    continued, however, to produce work pretty regularly, publishing <hi
                    rend="italic">Claude et</hi><hi rend="italic">Marianne</hi> in 1851, <hi
                    rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Dernier Rendezvous</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Pays Latin</hi> in 1852, <hi
                    rend="italic">Adeline Protat</hi> (one of the most graceful and innocent if not
                    the most original of his tales) in 1853, and <hi rend="italic">Les
                    Buveurs</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Eau</hi> in 1854. This
                    last, the most powerful of his books next to the <hi rend="italic">Vie</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de Bohème,</hi> exhibits a reverse side to the picture by tracing
                    the fate of certain artists and students who, exaggerating their own powers and
                    foolishly disdaining merely profitable work, come to an evil end not less
                    rapidly if more respectably than by dissipation. Some years before his death,
                    which took place in a <hi rend="italic">maison</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    santé</hi> near Paris on 28th January 1861, Murger went to live at Mariotte,
                    near Fontainebleau, and it was there that he wrote, and in 1859 published, an
                    unequal book entitled <hi rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Sabot
                    Rouge,</hi><pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n66/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0066-0055"/> in which the character of the French peasant is
                    very uncom-plimentarily treated. Besides the books already mentioned, Murger’s
                    published works fill several volumes of prose and one of verse. The poems
                    contained in the latter <hi rend="italic">(Les</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Nuits</hi><hi rend="italic">d'Hiυer)</hi> are not very strong, but graceful and
                    frequently pathetic. The prose volumes, with the exception of a novel of some
                    scale, <hi rend="italic">Les Roueries de l'ingénue</hi> (which the author left
                    unfinished at his death), consist almost exclusively of short tales in the
                    manner, and more or less on the subject, of the <hi rend="italic">Vie</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de Bohême.</hi> All exhibit the same characteristics — an
                    excellent descriptive faculty, lively humour in drawing the follies of youth,
                    frequently pathos, and not seldom a tender and poetical melancholy.</p>
