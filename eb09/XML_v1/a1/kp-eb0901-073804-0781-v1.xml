                <p><label type="entry">AMIENS</label>, an ancient city of France, capital of the
                    department of Somme, and formerly of the old province of Picardy, situated on
                    the Somme, about 40 miles from its mouth, and 71 miles N. of Paris. It was once
                    a place of great strength, and still possesses a citadel, but the ramparts which
                    surrounded it have been replaced by beautiful boulevards. The new part of the
                    town is well built, but the streets of the old quarter are narrow and irregular,
                    and are so cut up by the eleven canals into which the Somme is here divided,
                    that Louis XI. is said to have called the town “little Venice.” The most
                    interesting object in Amiens is its magnificent cathedral, one of the finest in
                    Europe, commenced in the year 1220 and finished in 1288, although additions to
                    it were afterwards made. Among the other important public buildings are the
                    Hôtel de Ville, the Chateau d’Eau, the theatre, the museum, the hospital, and
                    several churches. The town is the seat of a bishop, of a prefect, and of the
                    departmental courts of justice; and possesses a library containing more than
                    50,000 volumes, besides manuscripts, an academy of sciences, various other
                    learned societies, a theological seminary, a lyceum, and several ordinary
                    schools. It has many important manufactures, the chief being cotton velvets,
                    kerseymeres, woollen and linen cloths, flax, beetroot sugar, soap, leather, and
                    paper. Amiens occupies the site of the ancient <hi rend="italic"
                    >Samarobriva,</hi> capital of the <hi rend="italic">Ambiani,</hi> from whom it
                    probably derives its name. After the dissolution of the empire of the west it
                    repeatedly changed owners, becoming for the first time a dependency of the
                    French crown in 1185, when Philip of Alsace'ceded it to Philip Augustus; and
                    since that date it has more than once passed out of the power of the French
                    kings. The famous treaty between Great Britain, France, Spain, and Holland,
                    which took its name from this city, was signed in the Hôtel de Ville on March
                    25th, 1802. During the recent war between France and Germany Amiens fell into
                    the hands of the Prussians on the 28th of November 1870. General Manteuffel was
                    operating against the French army of the north, which had been formed with the
                    view of helping the armies of Paris and of the Loire to effect a junction, and
                    thus raise the siege of the capital. The French, however, were defeated in a
                    battle in front of Amiens, which was fought on the 27th of November, along a
                    line stretching from Saleux to Marceleane, and extending, it is ^said, more than
                    four leagues. They retreated northward in the direction of Arras, and Amiens
                    surrendered on the following day, after a very slight demonstration of force on
                    the part of the Prussians. Peter the Hermit was born at Amiens about 1050.
