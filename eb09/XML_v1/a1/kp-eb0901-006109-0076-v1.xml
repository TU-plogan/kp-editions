                <p><label type="entry">ABYSSINIA</label> is an extensive country of Eastern Africa,
                    the limits of which are not well defined, and authorities are by no means agreed
                    respecting them. It may, however, be regarded as lying between 7° 30' and 15°
                    40' N. lat., and 35° and 40° 30' E. long., having, N. and N.W., Nubia ;E., the
                    territory of the Danakils; S.,the country of the Gallas; and W., the regions of
                    the Upper Nile.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It is
                    usual to include in Abyssinia the flat country which lies between it and the Red
                    Sea, and to regard the latter as forming its boundary on the east. This,
                    however, is not strictly correct. Abyssinia proper comprises only the
                    mountainous portion of this territory, the low lying portion being inhabited by
                    distinct and hostile tribes, and claimed by the Viceroy of Egypt as part of his
                    dominions. The low country is very unhealthy, the soil dry and arid, and with
                    few exceptions uncultivated, whereas the highlands are generally salubrious,
                    well watered, and in many parts very fertile. This arid track of country is only
                    a few miles broad at Massowah, in the north, but widens out to 200 or 300 miles
                    at Tajurrah, in the south. It is, in a great measure, owing to Abyssinia being
                    thus cut off from intercourse with the civilised world by this inhospitable
                    region, which has for three centuries been in the hands of enemies, that it is
                    at present so far sunk in ignorance and barbarism.</p></note> It has an area of
                    about 200,000 square miles, and a population of from 3,000,000 to 4,000,000.</p>
                <p>The name Abyssinia, or more properly Habessinia, is derived from the Arabic word
                    <hi rend="italic">Habesch,</hi> which signifies mixture or confusion, and was
                    applied to this country by the Arabs on account of the mixed character of the
                    people. This was subsequently Latinised by the Portuguese into <hi rend="italic"
                    >Abassia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Abassinos,</hi> and hence the present name.
                    The Abyssinians call themselves <hi rend="italic">Itiopyavan,</hi> and their
                    country <hi rend="italic">Itiopia,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Manghesta
                    Itiopia,</hi> the kingdom of Ethiopia.</p>
                <p>The country of Abyssinia rises rather abruptly from the low arid district on the
                    borders of the Red Sea in lofty ranges of mountains, and slopes away more
                    gradually to the westward, where the tributaries of the Nile have formed
                    numerous deep valleys. It consists for the most part of extensive and elevated
                    table-lands, with mountain ranges extending in different directions, and
                    intersected by numerous valleys. The table-lands are generally from 6000 to 9000
                    feet above the level of the sea, but in the south there are <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n77/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0077-0062"/> some of considerable extent, which attain a
                    height of more than 10,000 feet. The mountains in various parts of the country
                    rise to 12,000 and 13,000 feet above the sea, and some of the peaks of Samen are
                    said to reach to 15,000 feet, and to be always covered with snow. The average
                    height of the range which divides the streams flowing to the east from those
                    that flow westward is about 8000 feet, rising to 10,000 or 11,000 in the south,
                    and sinking in the north. The whole country presents the appearance of having
                    been broken up and tossed about in a remarkable manner, the mountains assuming
                    wild and fantastic forms, with sides frequently abrupt and precipitous, and only
                    accessible by very difficult passes. The Samen range of mountains are the
                    highest in Abyssinia, and together with the Lamalmon and Lasta mountains form a
                    long but not continuous chain, running from north to south.</p>
                <p>The principal rivers of Abyssinia are tributaries of the Nile. The western
                    portion of the country may be divided into three regions, drained respectively
                    by the Mareb, the Atbara, and the Abai. The most northern of these rivers is the
                    Mareb, which rises in the mountains of Taranta, flows first south, then west,
                    and afterwards turns to the north, where it is at length, after a course of
                    upwards of 500 miles, lost in the sand, but in the rainy season it falls into
                    the Atbara. The Atbara, or Takazza, rises in the mountains of Lasta, and flowing
                    first north, then west, and again turning to the north, at length falls into the
                    Nile, after a course of about 800 miles. The Abai, Bahr-el-Azrek or Blue River,
                    the eastern branch of the Nile, and considered by Bruce to be the main stream of
                    that river, rises from two mountains near Geesh, in lat. 10° 59' 25" N., long.
                    36° 55' 30" E., about 10,000 feet above the level of the sea. It flows first
                    north to the Lake of Dembea or Tzana, then takes a long semicircular sweep round
                    the province of Godjam, and afterwards flows northward to about the 15th degree
                    of N. lat., where it unites with the Bahr-el-Abiad, which has now been
                    ascertained to be the true Nile. The Hawash, the principal river of eastern
                    Abyssinia, rises about lat. 9° 30' N., long. 38° E., and, flowing in a
                    north-easterly direction towards the Red Sea, is lost in Lake Aussa, lat. 11°
                    25' N., long. 41° 40' E. The principal lake of Abyssinia is the Dembea, which
                    lies between 11° 30' and 12° 30' N. lat., and 37° and 37° 35' E. long., being
                    about 60 miles in length by 40 in width, and containing a number of small
                    islands. It is fed by numerous small streams. The lake of Ashangi, in lat. 12°
                    35' N., long. 39° 40' E., is about 4 miles long by 3 broad, and upwards of 8000
                    feet above the sea.</p>
                <p>The fundamental rocks of Tigré, and probably of all Abyssinia, are metamorphic.
                    They compose the mass of the table-land, and while they occupy no inconsiderable
                    portion of its surface, they are exposed, in Tigré at least, in every deep
                    valley. The metamorphics vary greatly in mineral character, “every intermediate
                    grade being found between the most coarsely crystalline granite and a slaty rock
                    so little altered that the lines of the original bedding are still apparent.
                    Perhaps the most prevalent form of rock is a rather finely crystalline gneiss.
                    Hornblende-schist and mica-schist are met with, but neither of the minerals from
                    which they are named appears to be so abundant as in some metamorphic tracts. On
                    the other hand, a compact felspathic rock, approaching felsite in composition,
                    is prevalent in places, as in the Suru defile, between Komayli and Senafé.”
                    There are a few exceptions, but as a general rule it may be asserted that in the
                    neighbourhood of the route followed by the British army, so much of the country
                    as is more than 8000 feet above the sea consists of bedded traps, and this is
                    probably the case in general over Abyssinia. “Between the traps and the
                    metamorphics a series of sandstones and limestones intervene, one group of the
                    former underlying the latter. The limestone alone is fossiliferous, and is of
                    Jurassic age.” “On the route to Magdala volcanic rocks were first met with at
                    Senafé, where several hills consist of trachyte, passing into claystone and
                    basalt. Trap hills, chiefly of trachyte, are dotted over the country to the
                    southward as far as Fokada, a distance of nearly 30 miles. Here a great range of
                    bedded traps commences, and extends for about 25 miles to the south, passing to
                    the west of Adigerat.” At Meshek, two marches south of Antalo, “the route
                    entered high ranges entirely composed of trap, and thence no other rocks were
                    seen as far as Magdala.” “The trappean rocks belong to two distinct and
                    unconformable groups. The lower of these is much inclined, while the higher
                    rests on its upturned and denuded edges.” Denudation has evidently been going on
                    to a great extent in this country. One of its most striking features are the
                    deep ravines which have been worked out by the action of the streams, sometimes
                    to the depth of 3000 or 4000 feet. “How much of the Abyssinian highlands has
                    been removed by these great torrents, and spread as an alluvial deposit over the
                    basin of the Nile ?” “Probably over the whole of northern Abyssinia there
                    existed at least 4000 feet of bedded traps, of which now only a few vestiges
                    remain.”— <hi rend="italic">W</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi><hi rend="italic">T.
                    Blanford.</hi></p>
                <p>Abyssinia is said to enjoy “probably as salubrious a climate as any country on
                    the face of the globe.”— <hi rend="italic">Parkyns.</hi> The heat is by no means
                    oppressive, a fine light air counteracting the power of the sun; and during the
                    rainy season, the sky being cloudy, the weather is always agreeable and cool,
                    while the rain itself is not very severe. In certain of the low valleys,
                    however, malarious influences prevail before and after the rainy season, and
                    bring on dangerous fevers. On the higher parts the cold is sometimes intense,
                    particularly at night. The natural division of the seasons is into a cold, a
                    hot, and a rainy season. The cold season may be said to extend from October to
                    February, the hot from the beginning of March to the middle of June, and the wet
                    or monsoon period from this time to the end of September. The rainy season is of
                    importance, not only in equalising the temperature, increasing <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n78/mode/1up"

                    the country, but, as Sir S. Baker has shown, it plays a most important part in
                    the annual overflow of the Nile.</p>
                <p>On the summits and slopes of the highest mountains the vegetation is of a
                    thoroughly temperate and even English character; the plateaux have a flora of
                    the same character; while on the lower slopes of the hills and in the ravines
                    occur many trees and shrubs of warmer climes. “The general appearance of the
                    plateaux and plains is that of a comparatively bare country, with trees and
                    bushes thinly scattered over it, and clumps and groves only occurring round
                    villages and churches. But the glens and ravines in the plateau sides, each with
                    its little bright spring, are often thickly wooded, and offer a delicious
                    contrast to the open country.”— <hi rend="italic">Markham.</hi> This refers more
                    particularly to the northern portion of the country, that drained by the Mareb;
                    the central and southern parts are much more fertile and productive. Here the
                    fertility is so great that in some parts three crops are raised annually.
                    Agriculture receives considerable attention, and large quantities of maize,
                    wheat, barley, peas, beans, &amp;c., are grown. Very extensively cultivated is
                    <hi rend="italic">teff (Poa abyssinica),</hi> a herbaceous plant with grains not
                    larger than the head of a pin, of which is made the bread in general use
                    throughout the country. The low grounds produce also a kind of corn called <hi
                    rend="italic">tocussa,</hi> of which a black bread is made, which constitutes
                    the food of the lower classes. Coffee grows wild on the western mountains, and
                    the vine and sugar-cane are cultivated in favourable localities. Cotton is also
                    grown to a considerable extent. Among the fruit-trees are the date, orange,
                    lemon, pomegranate, and banana. Myrrh, balsam, and various kinds of valuable
                    medicinal plants are common.</p>
                <p>Most of the domestic animals of Europe are found here. The cattle are in general
                    small, and the oxen belong to the humped race. The famous Galla oxen have horns
                    sometimes four feet long. The sheep belong to the short and fat-tailed race, and
                    are covered with wool. Goats are very common, and have sometimes horns two feet
                    in length. The horses are strong and active. Of wild animals the spotted hyaena
                    is among the most numerous, as well as the fiercest and most destructive, not
                    only roaming in immense numbers over the country, but frequently entering the
                    towns, and even the houses of the inhabitants. The elephant and rhinoceros are
                    numerous in the low grounds. The Abyssinian rhinoceros has two horns; its skin,
                    which has no folds, is used for shields, and for lining drinking vessels, being
                    regarded as an antidote to poison. Crocodiles and hippopotami are plentiful in
                    the rivers; lions, panthers, and leopards are seen occasionally, and buffaloes
                    frequently. Among other animals may be mentioned as common various species of
                    antelopes, wild swine, monkeys, hares, squirrels, several species of hyrax,
                    jackals, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The birds of Abyssinia are very numerous, and many of them remarkable for the
                    beauty of their plumage. Great numbers of eagles, vultures, hawks, and other
                    birds of prey are met with; and partridges, snipes, pigeons, parrots, thrushes,
                    and swallows are very plentiful. Among insects the most numerous and useful is
                    the bee, honey everywhere constituting an important part of the food of the
                    inhabitants, and several of the provinces paying a large proportion of their
                    tribute in this article. Of an opposite class is the locust, the ravages of
                    which here, as in other parts of Northern Africa, are terrible. Serpents are not
                    numerous, but several species are poisonous.</p>
                <p>The inhabitants of Abyssinia form a number of different tribes, and evidently
                    belong to several distinct races. The majority are of the Caucasian race, and
                    are in general well-formed and handsome, with straight and regular features,
                    lively eyes, hair long and straight or somewhat curled, and colour dark olive,
                    approaching to black. Rüppell regards them as identical in features with the
                    Bedouin Arabs. The tribes inhabiting Tigré, Amhara, Agow, &amp;c., belong to
                    this race. The Galla race, who came originally from the south, have now overrun
                    the greater part of the country, constituting a large portion of the soldiery,
                    and, indeed, there are few of the chiefs who have not an intermixture of Galla
                    blood in their veins. They are fierce and turbulent in character, and addicted
                    to cruelty. Many of them are still idolaters, but most of them have now adopted
                    the Mohammedan faith, and not a few of them the Christianity of the Abyssinians.
                    They are generally large and well-built, of a brown complexion, with regular
                    features, small deeply-sunk but very bright eyes, and long black hair. A race of
                    Jews, known by the name of Falashas, inhabit the district of Samen. They affirm
                    that their forefathers came into the country in the days of Rehoboam, but it
                    seems more probable that they arrived about the time of the destruction of
                    Jerusalem. From the 10th century they enjoyed their own constitutional rights,
                    and were subject to their own kings, who, they pretend, were descended from King
                    David, until the year 1800, when the royal race became extinct, and they then
                    became subject to Tigré.</p>
                <p>The prevailing religion of Abyssinia is a very corrupted form of Christianity.
                    This is professed by the majority of the people, as well as by the reigning
                    princes of the different states. There are also scattered over the country many
                    Mohammedans, and some Falashas or Jews. Christianity was introduced into this
                    country about the year 330, but since that time it has been so corrupted by
                    errors of various kinds as to have become little more than a dead formality
                    mixed up with much superstition and Judaism. Feasts and fast-days are very
                    frequent, and baptism and the Lord’s supper are dispensed after the manner of
                    the Greek Church. The children are circumcised, and the Mosaic commandments with
                    respect to food and purification are observed. The eating of animals which do
                    not chew the cud and which have not cloven hoofs is prohibited. The
                    ecclesiastical body is very numerous, consisting of priests of various kinds,
                    with monks and nuns, and is looked upon with great awe and reverence. If a
                    priest be married previous to his ordination, he is allowed to remain so; but no
                    one can marry after having entered the priesthood. The primate or chief bishop
                    is called <hi rend="italic">Alruna (i.e.,</hi> our father), and is nominated by
                    the patriarch of Cairo, whom they acknowledge as their spiritual father. The
                    churches are rude edifices, chiefly of a circular form, with thatched roofs, the
                    interior being divided into three compartments,—an outer one for the laity, one
                    within for the priests, and in the centre the Holy of Holies, exactly after the
                    manner of a Jewish temple. The worship consists merely in reading passages of
                    Scripture and dispensing the Lord’s supper, without any preaching. Like the
                    Greek Church, they have no images of any kind in their places of worship, but
                    paintings of the saints are very common—their faces always in full, whatever may
                    be the position of their bodies. They have innumerable saints, but above all is
                    the Virgin, whom they regard as queen of heaven and earth, and the great
                    intercessor for the sins of mankind. Their reverence for a saint is often
                    greater than for the Almighty, and a man who would not hesitate to invoke the
                    name of his Maker in witness to a falsehood may decline so to use the name of St
                    Michael or St George. Legends of saints and works of religious controversy form
                    almost their entire literature. “At present,” says Bishop Gobat, “the Christians
                    of Abyssinia are divided into three parties, so inimical to each other that they
                    curse one another, and will no longer partake of the sacrament together. It is
                    one single point of theology that disunites them—the unceasing dispute
                    concerning the unction of Jesus Christ.”</p>
                <p>In manners the Abyssinians are rude and barbarous.</p>

                <p>Engaged as they are in continual wars, and accustomed to bloodshed, human life is
                    little regarded among them. Murders and executions are frequent, and yet cruelty
                    is said not to be a marked feature of their character; and in war they seldom
                    kill their prisoners. When one is convicted of murder, he is handed over to the
                    relatives of the deceased, who may either put him to death or accept a ransom.
                    When the murdered person has no relatives, the priests take upon themselves the
                    office of avengers. The Abyssinians are irritable, but easily appeased; and are
                    a gay people, fond of festive indulgences. On every festive occasion, as a
                    saint’s day, birth, marriage, &amp;c., it is customary for a rich man to collect
                    his friends and neighbours, and kill a cow and one or two sheep. The principal
                    parts of the cow are eaten raw while yet warm and quivering, the remainder being
                    cut into small pieces, and cooked with the favourite sauce of butter and red
                    pepper paste. The raw meat in this way is considered to be very superior in
                    taste and much tenderer than when cold. “I can readily believe,” says Mr
                    Parkyns,” that raw meat would be preferred to cooked meat by a man who from
                    childhood had been accustomed to it.” The statement by Bruce respecting the
                    cutting of steaks from a live cow has frequently been called in question, but
                    there can be no doubt that Bruce actually saw what he narrates, though it would
                    appear to have been a very exceptional case. Mr Parkyns was told by a soldier,
                    “that such a practice was not uncommon among the Gallas, and even occasionally
                    occurred among themselves, when, as in the case Bruce relates, a cow had been
                    stolen or taken in foray.” The principal drinks are <hi rend="italic">mése,</hi>
                    a kind of mead, and <hi rend="italic">bousa,</hi> a sort of beer made from
                    fermented cakes. Their dress consists of a large folding mantle and
                    close-fitting drawers; and their houses are very rude structures of a conical
                    form, covered with thatch. Marriage is a very slight connection among them,
                    dissolvable at any time by either of the parties; and polygamy is by no means
                    uncommon. Hence there is little family affection, and what exists is only among
                    children of the same father and mother. Children of the same father, but of
                    different mothers, are said to be "always enemies to each other.”— <hi

                <p>Abyssinia is one of the most ancient monarchies in the world, and has been
                    governed from time immemorial by an emperor. For many years, however, until the
                    accession of the late Emperor Theodore, he had been a mere puppet in the hands
                    of one or other of his chiefs. Each chief is entire master of all sources of
                    revenue within his territory, and has practically full power of life and death.
                    His subjection consists in an obligation to send from time to time presents to
                    his superior, and to follow him to war with as large a force as he can muster.
                    For several generations the emperor had been little better than a prisoner in
                    his palace at Gondar, his sole revenue consisting of a small stipend and the
                    tolls of the weekly markets of that city, the real power being in the hands of
                    the ras or vizier of the empire, who was always the most powerful chief for the
                    time. If at any time a chief “has found himself strong enough to march upon the
                    capital, he has done so, placed upon the throne another puppet emperor, and been
                    by him appointed ras or vizier, till a rival stronger than himself could turn
                    him out and take his place.”— <hi rend="italic">Dr Beke.</hi></p>
                <p>The three principal provinces of Abyssinia are Tigré in the north, Amhara (in
                    which Gondar the capital is situated) in the centre, and Shoa in the south. The
                    governors of these have all at different times assumed the title of Ras. Three
                    other provinces of some importance are Lasta and Waag, whose capital is Sokota;
                    Godjam, to the south of Lake Dembea; and Kivara, to the west of that lake, the
                    birth-place of the Emperor Theodore The two provinces of Tigré and Shoa have
                    generally been in a state of rebellion from or acknowledged independence of the
                    central power at Gondar. The geographical position of Tigré enhances its
                    political importance, as it lies between Gondar and the sea at Massowah, and
                    thus holds as it were the gate of the capital. The province of Shoa is almost
                    separated from that of Amhara by the Wolla Gallas, a Mohammedan tribe, and for a
                    long time the former had been virtually independent, and governed by a
                    hereditary line of princes, to one of whom the Indian government sent a special
                    embassy under Major Harris in 1841.</p>
                <p>The principal towns are Gondar in Amhara, the former capital of the kingdom, and
                    containing about 7000 inhabitants, and Debra Tabor in Amhara, formerly a small
                    village, but which rose to be a place of considerable size in consequence of the
                    Emperor Theodore having fixed upon it as his residence, and near it was Gaffat,
                    w’here the European workmen resided. It was burned by the emperor when he set
                    out on his fatal march to Magdala. Adowa is the capital of Tigré, and the second
                    city in the empire, having about 6000 inhabitants. Antalo is also one of the
                    principal towns of Tigré, and the capital of Enderta. Near Antalo is Chelicut.
                    Sokota, the capital of Lasta Waag, is a town of considerable size. The capital
                    of Shoa is Ankobar, and near it is Angolala, also a place of considerable size.
                    The capital of Agamé is Adigerat.</p>
                <p>The language of the religion and literature of the country is the Geez, which
                    belongs to the Ethiopic class of languages, and is the ancient language of
                    Tigré; of this the modern Tigré is a dialect. The Amharic, the language of
                    Amhara, is that of the court, the army, and the merchants, and is that too which
                    travellers who penetrate beyond Tigré have ordinarily occasion to use. But the
                    Agow in its various dialects is the language of the people in some provinces
                    almost exclusively, and in others, where it has been superseded by the language
                    of the dominant race, it still exists among the lowest classes. This last is
                    believed to be the original language of the people; and from the affinity of the
                    Geez, Amharic, and cognate dialects, to the Arabic, it seems probable that they
                    were introduced by conquerors or settlers from the opposite shores of the Red
                    Sea. The Gallas, who have overrun a great part of Abyssinia, have introduced
                    their own language into various parts of the country, but in many cases they
                    have adopted the language of the people among whom they have come. The
                    literature of Abyssinia is very poor, and contains nothing of much value. During
                    the late war the libraries in connection with the religious communities were
                    found to contain only modern works of little interest. On the capture of
                    Magdala, a large number of MSS. were found there, which had been brought by
                    Theodore from Gondar and other parts. Of these 359 were brought home for
                    examination, and are now deposited in the British Museum. The oldest among them
                    belong to the 15th and 16th centuries, but the great bulk of them are of the
                    17th and 18th, and some are of the present century. They are mostly copies of
                    the Holy Scriptures, canonical and apocryphal, including the Book of Enoch,
                    prayer and hymn books, missals, lives of saints, and translations of various of
                    the Greek fathers.</p>
                <p>The trade and manufactures of Abyssinia are insignificant, the people being
                    chiefly engaged in agriculture and pastoral pursuits. Cotton cloths, the
                    universal dress of the country, are made in large quantities. The preparation of
                    leather and parchment is also carried on to some extent, and manufactures of
                    iron and brass. “The Abyssinians are, I think,” says Mr Markham, “capable of
                    civilisation. Their agriculture is good, their manufactures are not to be
                    despised; but the combined effects of isolation, Galla inroads, and internal
                    anarchy, have thrown them back for centuries.” The foreign trade of Abyssinia is
                    carried on entirely through Massowah. Its principal imports are lead, <pb

                    Persian carpets, and coloured cloths. The chief exports are gold, ivory, slaves,
                    coffee, butter, honey, and wax.</p>
                <p>Abyssinia, or at least the northern portion of it, was included in the ancient
                    kingdom of Ethiopia. The connection between Egypt and Ethiopia was in early
                    times very intimate, and occasionally the two countries were under the same
                    ruler, so that the arts and civilisation of the one naturally found their way
                    into the other. In early times, too, the Hebrews had commercial intercourse with
                    the Ethiopians; and according to the Abyssinians, the Queen of Sheba, who
                    visited Solomon, was a monarch of their country, and from her son Menilek the
                    kings of Abyssinia are descended. During the captivity many of the Jews settled
                    here, and brought with them a knowledge of the Jewish religion. Under the
                    Ptolemies, the arts as well as the enterprise of the Greeks entered Ethiopia,
                    and led to the establishment of Greek colonies. A Greek inscription at Adulis,
                    no longer extant, but copied by Cosmos, and preserved in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Topographia Christiana,</hi> records that Ptolemy Euergetes, the third of the
                    Greek dynasty in Egypt, invaded the countries on both sides of the Red Sea, and,
                    having reduced most of the provinces of Tigré to subjection, returned to the
                    port of Adulis, and there offered sacrifices to Jupiter, Mars, and Neptune.
                    Another inscription, not so ancient, found at Axum, and copied by Salt and
                    others, states that Aeizanas, king of the Axomites, the Homerites, &amp;c.,
                    conquered the nation of the Bogos, and returned thanks to his father, the god
                    Mars, for his victory. The ancient kingdom of Auxume flourished in the first or
                    second century of our era, and was at one time nearly coextensive with the
                    modern Abyssinia. The capital Auxume and the seaport Adulis were then the chief
                    centres of the trade with the interior of Africa in gold dust, ivory, leather,
                    aromatics, &amp;c. At Axum, the site of the ancient capital, many vestiges of
                    its former greatness still exist; and the ruins of Adulis, which was once a
                    seaport on the Bay of Annesley, are now about 4 miles from the shore.
                    Christianity was introduced into the country by Frumentius, who was consecrated
                    first bishop of Abyssinia by St Athanasius of Alexandria about <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 330. Subsequently the monastic system was introduced,
                    and between 470 and 480 a great company of monks appear to have entered and
                    established themselves in the country. Since that time Monachism has been a
                    power among the people, and not without its influence on the course of events.
                    In 522 the king of the Homerites, on the opposite coast of the Red Sea, having
                    persecuted the Christians, the Emperor Justinian requested the king of
                    Abyssinia, Caleb or Elesbaan, to avenge their cause. He accordingly collected an
                    army, crossed over into Arabia, and conquered Yemen, which remained subject to
                    Abyssinia for 67 years. This was the most flourishing period in the annals of
                    the country. The Ethiopians possessed the richest part of Arabia, carried on a
                    large trade, which extended as far as India and Ceylon, and were in constant
                    communication with the Greek empire. Their expulsion from Arabia, followed by
                    the conquest of Egypt by the Mohammedans in the middle of the 7th century,
                    changed this state of affairs, and the continued advances of the followers of
                    the Prophet at length cut them off from almost every means of communication with
                    the civilised world; so that, as Gibbon says, “encompassed by the enemies of
                    their religion, the Ethiopians slept for near a thousand years, forgetful of the
                    world by whom they were forgotten.” About <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 960, a
                    Jewish princess, Judith, conceived the bloody design of murdering all the
                    members of the royal family, and of establishing herself in their stead. During
                    the execution of this project, the infant king was carried off by some faithful
                    adherents, and conveyed to Shoa, where his authority was acknowledged, while
                    Judith reigned for 40 years over the rest of the kingdom, and transmitted the
                    crown to her descendants. In 1268 the kingdom was restored to the royal house in
                    the person of Icon Imlac.</p>
                <p>Towards the close of the 15th century the Portuguese missions into Abyssinia
                    commenced. A belief had long prevailed in Europe of the existence of a Christian
                    kingdom in the far east, whose monarch was known as Prester John, and various
                    expeditions had been sent in quest of it. Among others who had engaged in this
                    search was Pedro de Covilham, who arrived in Abyssinia in 1490, and, believing
                    that he had at length reached the far-famed kingdom, presented to the Negus, or
                    emperor of the country, a letter from his master the king of Portugal, addressed
                    to Prester John. Covilham remained in the country, but in 1507 an Armenian named
                    Matthew was sent by the Negus to the king of Portugal to request his aid against
                    the Turks. In 1520 a Portuguese fleet, with Matthew on board, entered the Red
                    Sea in compliance with this request, and an embassy from the fleet visited the
                    country of the Negus, and remained there for about six years. One of this
                    embassy was Father Alvarez, from whom we have the earliest and not the least
                    interesting account of the country. Between 1528 and 1540 armies of Mohammedans,
                    under the renowned general Mohammed Gragn, entered Abyssinia from the low
                    country, and overran the kingdom, obliging the emperor to take refuge in the
                    mountain fastnesses. In this extremity recourse was again had to the Portuguese,
                    and Bermudez, who had remained in the country after the departure of the
                    embassy, was ordained successor to the Abuna, and sent on this mission. In
                    consequence a Portuguese fleet, under the command of Stephen de Gama, was sent
                    from India and arrived at Massowah. A force of 450 musqueteers, under the
                    command of Christopher de Gama, younger brother of the admiral, marched into the
                    interior, and being joined by native troops were at first successful against the
                    Turks, but were subsequently defeated, and their commander taken prisoner and
                    put to death. Soon afterwards, however, Mohammed Gragn was shot in an
                    engagement, and his forces totally routed. After this, quarrels arose between
                    the Negus and the Catholic primate Bermudez, who wished the former publicly to
                    profess himself a convert to Rome. This the Negus refused to do, and at length
                    Bermudez was obliged to make his way out of the country. The Jesuits who had
                    accompanied or followed Bermudez into Abyssinia, and fixed their head-quarters
                    at Fremona, were oppressed and neglected, but not actually expelled. In the
                    beginning of the following century Father Paez arrived at Fremona, a man of
                    great tact and judgment, who soon rose into high favour at court, and gained
                    over the emperor to his faith. He directed the erection of churches, palaces,
                    and bridges in different parts of the country, and carried out many useful
                    works. His successor Mendez was a man of much less conciliatory manners, and the
                    feelings of the people became more strongly excited against the intruders, till
                    at length, on the death of the Negus, and the accession of his son Facilidas in
                    1633, they were all sent out of the country, after having had a footing there
                    for nearly a century and a half. The French physician Poncet, who went there in
                    1698, was the only European that afterwards visited the country before Bruce in
                    1769.</p>
                <p>It was about the middle of the 16th century that the Galla tribes first entered
                    Abyssinia from the south; and notwithstanding frequent efforts to dislodge them,
                    they gradually extended and strengthened their positions till they had overrun
                    the greater part of the country. The power of the emperor was thus weakened,
                    independent chiefs set themselves up in different parts, until at length he
                    became little better than a puppet in the hands of the most powerful of his
                    chiefs. In 1805 the country was visited by Lord Valentia and Mr Salt, and again
                    by Salt in 1810. In <pb break="no"

                    missionaries by the Church Missionary Society, and were well received by the Ras
                    of Tigré. Mr Kugler died soon after his arrival, and his place was subsequently
                    supplied by Mr Isenberg, who was followed by Messrs Blumhardt and Krapf. In 1830
                    Mr Gobat proceeded to Gondar, where he also met with a favourable reception. In
                    1833 he returned to Europe, and published a journal of his residence here. In
                    the following year he went back to Tigré, but in 1836 he was compelled to leave
                    from ill health. In 1838 other missionaries were obliged to leave the country,
                    owing to the opposition of the native priests. Messrs Isenberg and Krapf went
                    south, and established themselves at Shoa. The former soon after returned to
                    England, and Mr Krapf remained in Shoa till March 1842. Dr Rüppel, the German
                    naturalist, visited the country in 1831, and remained nearly two years. MM.
                    Combes and Tamisier arrived at Massowah in 1835, and visited districts which had
                    not been traversed by Europeans since the time of the Portuguese. In 1839 the
                    French Government sent out a scientific commission under Μ. Lefebvre. Its
                    labours extended over five years, and have thrown great fight on the condition
                    and productions of the country. In 1841 a political mission was sent by the
                    Governor-General of India to Shoa, under the direction of Major Harris, who
                    subsequently published an account of his travels. One who has done much to
                    extend our geographical knowledge of this country is Dr Beke, who was there from
                    1840 to 1843. Mr Mansfield Parkyns was there from 1843 to 1846, and has written
                    the most interesting book on the country since the time of Bruce. Bishop Gobat
                    having conceived the idea of sending lay missionaries into the country, who
                    would engage in secular occupations as well as carry on missionary work, Dr
                    Krapf and Mr Flad arrived in 1855 as pioneers of that mission. Six came out at
                    first, and they were subsequently joined by others. Their work, however, was
                    more valuable to Theodore than their preaching, so that he employed them as
                    workmen to himself, and established them at Gaffat, near his capital. Mr Stern
                    arrived in Abyssinia in 1860, but returned to Europe, and came back in 1863,
                    accompanied by Mr and Mrs Rosenthal.</p>
                <p>Lij Kassa, who came subsequently to be known as the Emperor Theodore, was born in
                    Kuara, a western province of Abyssinia, about the year 1818. His father was of
                    noble family, and his uncle was governor of the provinces of Dembea, Kuara, and
                    Chelga. He was educated in a convent, but, preferring a wandering life, he
                    became leader of a band of malcontents. On the death of his uncle he was made
                    governor of Kuara, but, not satisfied with this, he seized upon Dembea, and
                    having defeated several generals sent against him, peace was restored on his
                    receiving Tavavitch, daughter of Ras Ali, in marriage. This lady is said to have
                    been his good genius and counsellor, and during her life his conduct was most
                    exemplary. He next turned his arms against the Turks, but was defeated; and the
                    mother of Ras Ali having insulted him in his fallen condition, he proclaimed his
                    independence. The troops sent against him were successively defeated, and
                    eventually the whole of the possessions of Ras Ali fell into his hands. He next
                    defeated the chief of Godjam, and then turned his arms against the governor of
                    Tigré, whom he totally defeated in February 1855. In March of the same year he
                    took the title of Theodore III., and caused himself to be crowned king of
                    Ethiopia by the. Abuna. Theodore was now in the zenith of his career. He is
                    described as being generous to excess, free from cupidity, merciful to his
                    vanquished enemies, and strictly continent, but subject to violent bursts of
                    anger, and possessed of unyielding pride and fanatical religious zeal. He was
                    also a man of education and intelligence, superior to those among whom he lived,
                    with natural talents for governing, and gaining the esteem of others He had
                    further a noble bearing and majestic walk, a frame capable of enduring any
                    amount of fatigue, and is said to have been “the best shot, the best spearman,
                    the best runner, and the best horseman in Abyssinia.” Had he contented himself
                    with what he now possessed, the sovereignty of Amhara and Tigré, he might have
                    maintained his position; but he was led to exhaust his strength against the
                    Gallas, which was probably one of the chief causes of his ruin. He obtained
                    several victories over that people, ravaged their country, took possession of
                    Magdala, which he afterwards made his principal stronghold, and enlisted many of
                    the chiefs and their followers in his own ranks. He shortly afterwards reduced
                    the kingdom of Shoa, and took Ankobar, the capital; but in the meantime his own
                    people were groaning under his heavy exactions, rebellions were breaking out in
                    various parts of his provinces, and his good queen was now dead. He lavished
                    vast sums of money upon his army, which at one time amounted to 100,000 or
                    150,000 fighting men; and in order to meet this expenditure, he was forced to
                    exact exorbitant tributes from his people. The British consul, Plowden, who was
                    strongly attached to Theodore, having been ordered by his Government in 1860 to
                    return to Massowah, was attacked on his way by a rebel named Garred, mortally
                    wounded, and taken prisoner. Theodore attacked the rebels, and in the action the
                    murderer of Mr Plowden was slain by his friend and companion Mr Bell, but the
                    latter lost his life in preserving that of Theodore. The deaths of the two
                    Englishmen were terribly avenged by the slaughter or mutilation of nearly 2000
                    rebels. Theodore soon after married his second wife Terunish, the proud daughter
                    of the late governor of Tigré, who felt neither affection nor respect for the
                    upstart who had dethroned her father, and the union was by no means a happy one.
                    In 1862 he made a second expedition against the Gallas, which was stained with
                    atrocious cruelties. Theodore had now given himself up to intoxication and lust.
                    When the news of Mr Plowden’s death reached England, Captain Cameron was
                    appointed to succeed him as consul, and arrived at Massowah in February 1862. He
                    proceeded to the camp of the king, to whom he presented a rifle, a pair of
                    pistols, and a letter in the Queen’s name. In October Captain Cameron was
                    dismissed by Theodore, with a letter to the Queen of England, which reached the
                    Foreign Office on the 12th of February 1863. For some reason or other this
                    letter was put aside and no answer returned, and to this in no small degree is
                    to be attributed the difficulties that subsequently arose with that country.
                    After forwarding the letter, Captain Cameron, hearing that the Christians of
                    Bogos had been attacked by the Shangallas and other tribes under Egyptian rule,
                    proceeded to that district, and afterwards went to Kassala, the seat of the
                    Egyptian administration in that quarter. Thence he went to Metemeh, where he was
                    taken ill, and in order to recruit his health he returned to Abyssinia, and
                    reached Jenda in August 1863. In November despatches were received from England,
                    but no answer to the emperor’s letter, and this, together with the consul’s
                    visit to Kassala, greatly offended him, and in January 1864 Captain Cameron and
                    his suite, with Messrs Stern and Rosenthal, were cast into prison. When the news
                    of this reached England, the Government resolved, when too late, to send an
                    answer to the emperor’s letter, and selected Mr Hormuzd Rassam to be its bearer.
                    He arrived at Massowah in July 1864, and immediately despatched a messenger
                    requesting permission to present himself before the emperor. Neither to this nor
                    a subsequent application was any answer returned till August 1865, when a curt
                    note was received, stating that Consul Cameron had been released, and if Mr
                    Rassam still <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n82/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0082-0067"/> desired to visit the king, he was to proceed by
                    the route of Metemeh. They reached Metemeh on 21st November, and five weeks more
                    were lost before they heard from the emperor, whose reply was now courteous,
                    informing them that the governors of all the districts through which they had to
                    march had received orders to furnish them with every necessary. They left
                    Metemeh on the 28th December, and on 25th January following arrived at
                    Theodore’s camp in Damot. They were received with all honour, and were
                    afterwards sent to Kuarata, on Lake Dembea, there to await the arrival of the
                    captives. The latter reached this on 12th March, and everything appeared to
                    proceed very favourably. A month later they started for the coast, but had not
                    proceeded far when they were all brought back and put into confinement. Theodore
                    then wrote a letter to the Queen, requesting European workmen and machinery to
                    be sent to him, and despatched it by Mr Flad. The Europeans, although detained
                    as prisoners, were not at first unkindly treated; but in the end of June they
                    were sent to Magdala, where they were soon afterwards put in chains. They
                    suffered hunger, cold, and misery, and were in constant fear of death, till the
                    spring of 1868, when they were relieved by the British troops. In the meantime
                    the power of Theodore in the country was rapidly waning. In order to support his
                    vast standing army, the country was drained of its resources: the peasantry
                    abandoned the fertile plains, and took refuge in the fastnesses, and large
                    fertile tracts remained uncultivated. Rebellions broke out in various parts of
                    the country, and desertions took place among his troops, till his army became
                    little more than a shadow of what it once was. Shoa had already shaken off his
                    yoke; Godjam was virtually independent; Walkeit and Samen were under a rebel
                    chief; and Lasta Waag and the country about Lake Ashangi had submitted to
                    Wagsham Gobaze, who had also overrun Tigré, and appointed Dejach Kassai his
                    governor. The latter, however, in 1867 rebelled against his master, and assumed
                    the supreme power of that province. This was the state of matters when the
                    English troops made their appearance in the country. With a view if possible to
                    effect the release of the prisoners by conciliatory measures, Mr Flad was sent
                    back, with some artisans and machinery, and a letter from the Queen, stating
                    that these would be handed over to his Majesty on the release of the prisoners
                    and their return to Massowah. This, however, failed to influence the emperor,
                    and the English Government at length saw that they must have recourse to arms.
                    In July 1867, therefore, it was resolved to send an army into Abyssinia to
                    enforce the release of the captives, and Sir Robert Napier was appointed
                    commander-in-chief. A reconnoitring party was despatched beforehand, under
                    Colonel Merewether, to select the landingplace and anchorage, and explore the
                    passes leading into the interior. They also entered into friendly relations with
                    the different chiefs in order to secure their co-operation. The landing-place
                    selected was Mulkutto, on Annesley Bay, the point of the coast nearest to the
                    site of the ancient Adulis, and we are told that “the pioneers of the English
                    expedition followed to some extent in the footsteps of the adventurous soldiers
                    of Ptolemy, and met with a few faint traces of this old world enterprise.”— <hi
                    rend="italic">C. R. Markham.</hi> The force amounted to upwards of 16,000 men,
                    besides 12,640 belonging to the transport service, and followers, making in all
                    upwards of 32,000 men. The task to be accomplished was to march over 400 miles
                    of a mountainous and little-known country, inhabited by savage tribes, to the
                    camp or fortress of Theodore, and compel him to deliver up his captives. The
                    commander-in-chief landed on 7th January 1868, and soon after the troops began
                    to move forward through the pass of Senafé, and southward through the districts
                    of Agamé, Tera, Endarta, Wojerat, Lasta, and</p>
                <p>Wadela. In the meantime Theodore had been reduced to great straits. His army was
                    rapidly deserting him, and he could hardly obtain food for his followers. He
                    resolved to quit his capital Debra Tabor, which he burned, and set out with the
                    remains of his army for Magdala. During this march he displayed an amount of
                    engineering skill in the construction of roads, of military talent, and
                    fertility of resource, that excited the admiration and astonishment of his
                    enemies. On the afternoon of the 10th of April a force of about 3000 men
                    suddenly poured down upon the English in the plain of Arogié, a few miles from
                    Magdala. They advanced again and again to the charge, but were each time driven
                    back, and finally retired in good order. Early next morning Theodore sent Lieut.
                    Prideaux, one of the captives, and Mr Flad, accompanied by a native chief, to
                    the English camp to sue for peace. Answer was returned, that if he would deliver
                    up all the Europeans in his hands, and submit to the Queen of England, he would
                    receive honourable treatment. The captives were liberated and sent away, and
                    along with a letter to the English general was a present of 1000 cows and 500
                    sheep, the acceptance of which would, according to Eastern custom, imply that
                    peace was granted. Through some misunderstanding, word was sent to Theodore that
                    the present would be accepted, and he felt that he was now safe; but in the
                    evening he learned that it had not been received, and despair again seized him.
                    Early next morning he attempted to escape with a few of his followers, but
                    subsequently returned. The same day (13th April) Magdala was stormed and taken,
                    and within they found the dead body of the emperor, who had fallen by his own
                    hand. The inhabitants and troops were subsequently sent away, the fortifications
                    destroyed, and the town burned. The queen Terunish having expressed her wish to
                    go back to her own country, accompanied the British army, but died during the
                    march, and her son Alam-ayahu, the only legitimate son of the emperor, was
                    brought to England, as this was the desire of his father. The success of the
                    expedition was in no small degree owing to the aid afforded by the several
                    native chiefs through whose country it passed, and no one did more in this way
                    than Prince Kassai of Tigré. In acknowledgment of this several pieces of
                    ordnance, small arms, and ammunition, with much of the surplus stores, were
                    handed over to him, and the English troops left the country in May 1868. Soon
                    after this Prince Kassai declared his independence; and in a war which broke out
                    between him and Wagsham Gobaze, the latter was defeated, and his territory taken
                    possession of by the conqueror. In 1872 Kassai was crowned king of Abyssinia
                    with great ceremony at Axam, under the title of King Johannes. In that year the
                    governor of Massowah, Munzinger Bey, a Swiss, by command of the Viceroy of
                    Egypt, marched an armed force against the Bogos country. The king solicited the
                    aid of England, Germany, and Russia against the Egyptians, whose troops,
                    however, were after a time withdrawn. Sir Bartie Frere, in the blue-book
                    published respecting his mission to Zanzibar, is of the opinion that England,
                    having regard to the passage to India by the Red Sea, should not have wholly
                    abandoned Abyssinia. <hi rend="smallcaps">(d. k.)</hi></p>
