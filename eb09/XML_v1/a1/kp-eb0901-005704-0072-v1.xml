                <p><label type="entry">ABSOLUTE</label> (from the Latin <hi rend="italic"
                    >absolvere),</hi> having the general meaning of <hi rend="italic">loosened
                    from,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">unrestricted,</hi> in which sense it is
                    popularly used to qualify such words as “monarchy” or “power,” has been
                    variously employed in philosophy. Logicians use it to mark certain classes of
                    names. Thus a term has been called absolute in opposition to <hi rend="italic"
                    >attributive,</hi> when it signifies something that has or is viewed as having
                    independent existence; most commonly, however, the opposition conveyed is to <hi
                    rend="italic">relative.</hi> A relative name being taken as one which, over and
                    above the object which it denotes, implies in its signification the existence of
                    another object, also deriving a denomination from the same fact, which is the
                    ground of the first name (Mill), as, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> father and
                    son, the non-relative or absolute name is one that has its meaning for and in
                    itself, as man. This distinction is a convenient one, although, as has been
                    observed, it can hardly in perfect strictness be maintained. The so-called
                    absolute name, if used with a meaning, does·· always stand in some relation,
                    however variable or indefinite, and the meaning varies with the relation.
                    Thus-man, which is a word of very different meanings, as, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> not woman, not boy, not master, not brute, and so forth, may be said
                    to have them according to the different relations in which it admits of being
                    viewed, or, as it has-been otherwise expressed, according to the different
                    notions whose “universe” it composes, along with its different correlatives.
                    From this point of view there is always one-relation in which a real thing must
                    stand, namely, the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n73/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0073-0058"/> relation to its contradictory (as not man) within
                    the universe of being; the correlatives, under less general notions, being then
                    generally expressed positively as contraries (woman, boy, master, brute, and so
                    forth, for man). If there is thus no name or notion that can strictly be called
                    absolute, all knowledge may be said to be relative, or of the relative. But the
                    knowledge of an absolute has also been held impossible, on the ground that
                    knowing is itself a relation between a subject and an object; what is known only
                    in relation to a mind cannot be known as absolute. This doctrine, now commonly
                    spoken of under the name of the Relativity of Knowledge, may, indeed, be brought
                    under the former view, in which subject-object marks the relation of highest
                    philosophical significance within the whole universe of things. Keeping,
                    however, the two views apart, we may say with double force that of the absolute
                    there is no knowledge,—(1), because, to be known, a thing must be consciously
                    discriminated from other things; and (2), because it can be known only in
                    relation with a knowing mind. Notwithstanding, there have been thinkers from the
                    earliest times, who, in different ways, and more or less explicitly, allow of no
                    such restriction upon knowledge, or at least consciousness, but, on the
                    contrary, starting from a notion, by the latter among them called the absolute,
                    which includes within it the opposition of subject and object, pass therefrom to
                    the explanation of all the phenomena of nature and of mind. In earlier days the
                    Eleatics, Plato, and Plotinus, in modern times Spinoza, Leibnitz, Fichte,
                    Schelling, Hegel, and Cousin, all have joined, under whatever different forms,
                    in maintaining this view. Kant, while denying the absolute or unconditioned as
                    an object of knowledge, leaves it conceivable, as an idea regulative of the
                    mind’s intellectual experience. It is against any such absolute, whether as real
                    or conceivable, that Hamilton and Mansel have taken ground, the former in his
                    famous review of Cousin’s philosophy, reprinted in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Discussions,</hi> the latter in his Bampton Lectures on <hi rend="italic">The
                    Limits of Religious Thought,</hi> basing their arguments indifferently on the
                    positions as to the Relativity of Knowledge indicated above. For absolute in its
                    more strictly metaphysical use, see <hi rend="smallcaps">Metaphysics. (g. c.
