                <p><label type="entry">AMOS</label> (not the same as Amoz, the father of Isaiah) was
                    an inhabitant of the district of Tekoa, a fortified town (2d Chron, xi. 6) among
                    the hills of the south of Judah, where a breed of stunted sheep and goats,
                    prized, however, for their wool and hair, found a scanty pasturage (Amos i. 1).
                    Possibly he was a common day labourer; certainly he was far from wealthy, as the
                    Jewish commentators would have him; for though he is called a “nôkëd” <hi
                    rend="italic">(foe. cit.</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> y</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">),</hi> like one of the kings of Moab (2 Kings iii. 4), he tells
                    us himself that he was glad to combine this employment with that of a dresser of
                    sycamore fruit (vii. 14). He may thus be contrasted, as the peasant prophet,
                    with Isaiah, the prophet of the capital and the court. It does not, however,
                    follow that Amos was devoid of such cultivation as could then be had.
                    Distinctions of rank were not, among the primitive Semitic races, coincident
                    with those of culture; it is enough to refer to the pre-Mohammedan Arabs, whose
                    poetry has been so accurately reproduced by Rückert. And in the case of Amos
                    there is evidence in his own works that he was well acquainted with the
                    literature of his day. It is true that he boldly admits the irregularity, from
                    an official point of view, of his prophetic ministrations—“No prophet I, and no
                    prophet’s disciple I” (vii. 14); but his discourses are not only full of
                    references (sometimes dubious) to the book of Joel and the Pentateuch, but
                    framed, however <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n791/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0791-0748"/> imperfectly, on a genuine artistic plan. This is
                    unmistakably the case in the discourse contained in i. 3—ii. 16; but with
                    greater or less correspondence to the course of thought in the remainder of the
                    book. Thus, according to Ewald (who aims, it is true, at an unattainable
                    precision), chapters iii. and iv. consist of five strophes—iii. 1-8, iii. 9-15,
                    iv. 1-3 (incomplete), iv. 5-11, iv. 12, 13; chapters v. and vi. of a prologue
                    (v. 1-3) and four strophes —V. 4-6, 8, 9; V. 7,10-17; v. 18-27; vi. 1-10; with a
                    sort of epilogue in vi. 11-14. And the great critic De Wette goes so far as to
                    declare that no Hebrew prophet has shown an equal regard for clearness and
                    harmony of proportion. (Comp. Dr Pusey, <hi rend="italic">Minor Prophets,</hi>
                    p. 152.)</p>
                <p>The date of the first public appearance of Amos cannot be ascertained. From the
                    heading of the book (i. 1), which, though not by the prophet himself, has the
                    air of a genuine tradition (Ewald, <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Propheten,</hi> i. 123), we learn that he “saw ”—that is, prophesied—“two years
                    before the earthquake.” This earthquake is referred to again in Zech. xiv. 5,
                    and, as some think, in passages of Joel and other prophets. It seems, therefore,
                    to have constituted an era in popular tradition, but is of no significance for
                    chronology, as has been well shown by Dr Pusey (<hi rend="italic">Minor
                    Prophets,</hi> p. 148). More to our purpose is the former part of the heading,
                    which limits the prophetic career of Amos to the twenty-five years that Uzziah
                    and Jeroboam II. were contemporary— <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> 810-784,
                    according to the common chronology; 775-750, according to the Assyrian. (Comp.
                    Schrader, <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic">Keilinschriften und das
                    Alte Testament,</hi> p. 120.) He flourished, therefore, in the greatest age of
                    Hebrew prophecy. He seems to have been younger than Joel, to whose prophecy he
                    makes several references, and more or less senior to Hosea and Isaiah. This view
                    is fully borne out by the gradual emergence of the Assyrians on the prophetic
                    horizon. Altogether absent from Joel’s prophecy, they are but vaguely alluded to
                    in Amos, and first mentioned by name in Hosea and Isaiah.</p>
                <p>It was while “following the flock” (vii. 14, 15) that Amos received a prophetic
                    impulse to leave his home and preach in the sister country. The circumstances
                    are on several accounts worthy of notice. They indicate—1. A distinction between
                    Hebrew prophecy, in its mature stage, and non-Hebrew—viz., that the former is
                    not dependent on a special artificial training; 2. That though his writings are
                    included in the prophetic canon, Amos did not consider himself officially a
                    prophet (which has a bearing on the great controversy of Daniel); and 3. That
                    prophets of the higher or spiritual order did not recognise the revolt of the
                    first Jeroboam (comp. ix. 11; Hos. iii. 5). But the prophecies of Amos had a
                    wider scope than the destiny of Israel. They show a dim presentiment of the
                    philosophy of history, and of the reproductive power of revolutions.
                    Accordingly, Syria, Philistia, Phoenicia, Edom, Ammon, Moab, and Judah were
                    successively rebuked by the inspired messenger. But the chief blame fell upon
                    Israel, whose unparalleled prosperity under Jeroboam II. had developed the germs
                    of vices inconsistent with the religion of Jehovah. The denunciations of Amos
                    produced a powerful impression. He was expelled with contumely by Amaziah, a
                    priest of the reactionary image cultus at the frontier town of Bethel (vii.
                    10-17).</p>
                <p>It is not to be supposed that the discourses of Amos were delivered exactly as
                    they stand. This view is precluded by their elaborate literary character, and by
                    the allusions to the prophet’s experience in Israel in ii. 12, v. 10, 13. He
                    probably put them together, with the addition of a grand Messianic epilogue,
                    after his return to Tekoa. There has never been a doubt of their genuineness.
                    The text is good, but there are a few corrupt passages.</p>
                <p>♦Some of the characteristics of Amos have been already mentioned. The tradition
                    that he was a stammerer (based on an absurd etymology of his name), and the
                    statement of Jerome that he was “imperitus sermone (sed non scientiâ),” only
                    prove the incapacity of the ancients for literary criticism. The simplicity of
                    his style is that of the highest art. He delights in abrupt short clauses, but
                    they are linked together by the closest parallelism. And the supposed rusticity
                    of his dialect is deduced from the spelling of only five words, analogies to
                    which may be traced in the great, poem of Job. All that we can admit as probable
                    is, that the native force and talent for observation displayed by this prophet
                    were derived from his early converse with nature on the wild hills of Judah. His
                    imagery, in fact, from its freshness and appropriateness (comp. ii. 13; iii. 5,
                    12; iv. 2, 9; v. 19; vi. 12; ix. 9), almost reminds us of Dante, and entitles
                    him to as high a place in the history of literature as in that of theistic
                    religion. (τ. κ. c.)</p>
