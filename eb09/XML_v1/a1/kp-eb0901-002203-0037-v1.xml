                <p><label type="entry">ABBOT</label>, the head and chief governor of a community of
                    monks, called also in the East <hi rend="italic">Archimandrita,</hi> from <hi
                    rend="italic">mandra,</hi> “a fold,” or <hi rend="italic">Hegumenos.</hi> The
                    name <hi rend="italic">abbot</hi> is derived from the Hebrew אב, <hi
                    rend="italic">Ab, or father,</hi> through the Syriac <hi rend="italic"
                    >Abba.</hi> It had its origin in the monasteries of Syria, whence it spread
                    through the East, and soon became accepted generally in all languages as the
                    designation of the head of a monastery. At first it was employed as a respectful
                    title for any monk, as we learn from St Jerome (in Epist. ad Gal. iv. 6, in
                    Matt. xxiii. 9), but it was soon restricted to the Superior.</p>
                <p>The name abbot, though general in the West, was not universal. Among the
                    Dominicians, Carmelites, Augustines, &amp;c., the superior was called <hi
                    rend="italic">Proepositus,</hi> “Provost,” and <hi rend="italic">Prior;</hi>
                    among the Franciscans, <hi rend="italic">Custos,</hi> “Guardian;” and by the
                    monks of Camaldoli, <hi rend="italic">Major.</hi></p>
                <p>Monks, as a role, were laymen, nor at the outset was the abbot any exception. All
                    orders of clergy, therefore, even the “doorkeeper,” took precedence of him. For
                    the reception of the sacraments, and for other religious offices, the abbot and
                    his monks were commanded to attend the nearest church.—(<hi rend="italic"
                    >Novellas,</hi> 133, c. ii.) This rule naturally proved inconvenient when a
                    monastery was situated in a desert, or at a distance from a city, and necessity
                    compelled the ordination of abbots. This innovation was not introduced without a
                    struggle, ecclesiastical dignity being regarded as inconsistent with the higher
                    spiritual life, but, before the close of the 5th century, at least in the East,
                    abbots seem almost universally to have become deacons, if not presbyters. The
                    change spread more slowly in the West, where the office of abbot was commonly
                    filled by laymen till the end of the 7th century, and partially so up to the
                    11th. Ecclesiastical Councils were, however, attended by abbots. Thus, at that
                    held at Constantinople, <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 448, for the condemnation
                    of Eutyches, 23 archimandrites or abbots sign, with 30 bishops, and, <hi
                    rend="italic">cir.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 690, Archbishop Theodore
                    promulgated a canon, inhibiting bishops from compelling abbots to attend
                    councils. Examples are not uncommon in Spain and in England in Saxon times.
                    Abbots were permitted by the Second Council of Nicaea, <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.</hi> 787, to ordain their monks to the inferior orders. This rule was
                    adopted in the West, and the strong prejudice against clerical monks having
                    gradually broken down, eventually monks, almost without exception, belonged to
                    some grade of the ministry.</p>
                <p>Originally no abbot was permitted to rule over more than one monastic community,
                    though, in some exceptional cases, Gregory the Great allowed the rule to be
                    broken. As time went on, violations of the role became increasingly frequent, as
                    is proved by repeated enactments against it. The cases of Wilfrid of York, <hi
                    rend="italic">cir.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 675, who held the abbacy
                    of the monasteries he had founded at Hexham and Ripon, and of Aldhelm, who, at
                    the same date, stood in the same double relation to those of Malmesbury, Frome,
                    and Bradford, are only apparent transgressions of the rule. We find more decided
                    instances of plurality in Hugh of the royal Carlovingian house, <hi
                    rend="italic">cir.</hi> 720, who was at the same <pb break="no"

                    Fontenelle and Jumiéges; and Sidonius, Bishop of Constance, who, being already
                    Abbot of Reichenau, took the abbacy of St Gall also. Hatto of Mentz, <hi

                    chief</hi> or <hi rend="italic">archimandrites</hi> exercising jurisdiction over
                    a large number of communities, each of which had its own abbot. Thus, Cassian
                    speaks of an abbot in the Thebaid who had 500 monks under him, a number exceeded
                    in other cases. In later times also, general jurisdiction was exercised over the
                    houses of their order by the abbots of Monte Cassino, St Dalmatius, Clugny,
                    &amp;c. The abbot of Cassino was styled <hi rend="italic">Abbas</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Abbatum.</hi> The chiefs of other orders had the titles of <hi

                    >Generalis.</hi></p>
                <p>Abbots were originally subject to episcopal jurisdiction, and continued generally
                    so, in fact, in the West till the 11th century. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Codex</hi><hi rend="italic">of Justinian</hi> (lib. i. tit. iii. de Ep. leg.
                    xl.), expressly subordinates the abbot to episcopal oversight. The first case
                    recorded of the partial exemption of an abbot from episcopal control is that of
                    Faustus, Abbot of Lerins, at the Council of Arles, <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.</hi> 456; but the oppressive conduct, and exorbitant claims and exactions
                    of bishops, to which this repugnance to episcopal control is to be traced, far
                    more than to the arrogance of abbots, rendered it increasingly frequent, and, in
                    the 6th century, the practice of exempting religious houses partly or altogether
                    from episcopal control, and making them responsible to the Pope alone, received
                    an impulse from Gregory the Great. These exceptions, though introduced with a
                    good object, had grown into a wide-spread and crying evil by the 12th century,
                    virtually creating an <hi rend="italic">imperium in imperio,</hi> and entirely
                    depriving the bishop of all authority over the chief centres of power and
                    influence in his diocese. In the 12th century the abbots of Fulda claimed
                    precedence of the Archbishop of Cologne. Abbots more and more aped episcopal
                    state, and in defiance of the express prohibition of early councils, and the
                    protests of St Bernard and others, adopted the episcopal insignia of mitre,
                    ring, gloves, and sandals. A mitre is said to have been granted to the Abbot of
                    Bobbio by Pope Theodorus I., <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 643, and to the
                    Abbot of St Savianus by Sylvester II., <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 1000.
                    Ducange asserts that pontifical insignia were first assigned to abbots by John
                    XVIII., <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 1004-1009; but the first undoubted grant
                    is said to be that to the Abbot of St Maximinian at Treves, by Gregory VII.
                    (Hildebrand), <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 1073-1085. The mitred abbots in
                    England were those of Abingdon, St Alban’s, Bardney, Battle, Bury St Edmund’s,
                    St Augustine’s Canterbury, Colchester, Croyland, Evesham, Glastonbury,
                    Gloucester, St Benet’s Hulme, Hyde, Malmesbury, Peterborough, Ramsey, Reading,
                    Selby, Shrewsbury, Tavistock, Thorney, Westminster, Winchcombe, St Mary’s York.
                    Of these the precedence was originally yielded to the Abbot of Glastonbury,
                    until in <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 1154 Adrian IV. (Nicholas Breakspear)
                    granted it to the Abbot of St Alban’s, in which monastery he had been brought
                    up. Next after the Abbot of St Alban’s ranked the Abbot of Westminster.</p>
                <p>To distinguish abbots from bishops, it was ordained that their mitre should be
                    made of less costly materials, and should not be ornamented with gold, a rule
                    which was soon entirely disregarded, and that the crook of their pastoral staff
                    should turn inwards instead of outwards, indicating that their jurisdiction was
                    limited to their own house. The adoption of episcopal insignia by abbots was
                    followed by an encroachment on episcopal functions, which had to be specially
                    but ineffectually guarded against by the Lateran Council, <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.</hi> 1123. In the East, abbots, if in. priests’ orders, with the consent
                    of the bishop, were, as we have seen, permitted by the Second Nicene Council,
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 787, to confer the tonsure and admit to the order
                    of reader; but they gradually advanced higher claims, until we find them
                    authorised by Bellarmine to be associated with a single bishop in episcopal
                    consecrations, and permitted by Innocent IV., <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi>
                    1489, to confer both the subdiaconate and diaconate. Of course, they always and
                    everywhere had the power of admitting their own monks, and vesting them with the
                    religious habit. In the first instance, when a vacancy occurred, the bishop of
                    the diocese chose the abbot out of the monks of the convent, but the right of
                    election was transferred by jurisdiction to the monks themselves, reserving to
                    the bishop the confirmation of the election and the benediction of the new
                    abbot. In abbeys exempt from episcopal jurisdiction, the confirmation and
                    benediction had to be conferred by the Pope in person, the house being taxed
                    with the expenses of the new abbot’s journey to Rome. By the rule of St
                    Benedict, the consent of the laity was in some undefined way required; but this
                    seems never to have been practically enforced. It was necessary that an abbot
                    should be at least 25 years of age, of legitimate birth, a monk of the house,
                    unless it furnished no suitable candidate, when a liberty was allowed of
                    electing from another convent, well instructed himself, and able to instruct
                    others, one also who had learned how to command by having practised obedience.
                    In some exceptional cases an abbot was allowed to name his own successor.
                    Cassian speaks of an abbot in Egypt doing this; and in later times we have
                    another example in the case of St Bruno. Popes and sovereigns gradually
                    encroached on the rights of the monks, until in Italy the Pope had usurped the
                    nomination of all abbots, and the king in France, with the exception of Clugny,
                    Prémontré, and other houses, chiefs of their order. The election was for life,
                    unless the abbot was canonically deprived by the chiefs of his order, or, when
                    he was directly subject to them, by the Pope or the bishop.</p>
                <p>The ceremony of the formal admission of a Benedictine abbot in mediaeval times is
                    thus prescribed by the consuetudinary of Abingdon. The newly elected abbot was
                    to put off his shoes at the door of the church, and proceed barefoot to meet the
                    members of the house advancing in a procession. After proceeding up the nave, he
                    was to kneel and pray at the topmost step of the entrance of the choir, into
                    which he was to be introduced by the bishop or his commissary, and placed in his
                    stall. The monks, then kneeling, gave him the kiss of peace on the hand, and
                    rising, on the mouth, the abbot holding his staff of office. He then put on his
                    shoes in the vestry, and a chapter was held, and the bishop or his commissary
                    preached a suitable sermon.</p>
                <p>The power of the abbot was paternal but absolute, limited, however, by the canons
                    of the church, and, until the general establishment of exemptions, by episcopal
                    control. As a rule, however, implicit obedience was enforced; to act without his
                    orders was culpable; while it was a sacred duty to execute his orders, however
                    unreasonable, until they were withdrawn. Examples among the Egyptian monks of
                    this blind submission to the commands of the superiors, exalted into a virtue by
                    those who regarded the entire crushing of the individual will as the highest
                    excellence, are detailed by Cassian and others,— <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> a
                    monk watering a dry stick, day after day, for months, or endeavouring to remove
                    a huge rock immensely exceeding his powers. St Jerome, indeed, lays down, as the
                    principle of the compact between the abbot and his monks, that they should obey
                    their superiors in all things, and perform whatever they commanded.—(Ep. 2, ad
                    Eustoch. de custod, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n39/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0039-0024"/> virgin.) So despotic did the tyranny become in
                    the West, that in the time of Charlemagne it was necessary to restrain abbots by
                    legal enactments from mutilating their monks, and putting out their eyes; while
                    the rule of St Columba ordained 100 lashes as the punishment for very slight
                    offences. An abbot also had the power of excommunicating refractory nuns, which
                    he might use if desired by their abbess.</p>
                <p>The abbot was treated with the utmost submission and reverence by the brethren of
                    his house. When he appeared either in church or chapter all present rose and
                    bowed. His letters were received kneeling, like those of the Pope and the king.
                    If he gave a command, the monk receiving it was also to kneel. No monk might sit
                    in his presence, or leave it without his permission. The highest place was
                    naturally assigned to him, both in church and at table. In the East he was
                    commanded to eat with the other monks. In the West the rule of St Benedict
                    appointed him a separate table, at which he might entertain guests and
                    strangers. This permission opening the door to luxurious living, the Council of
                    Aix, <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 817, decreed that the abbot should dine in
                    the refectory, and be content with the ordinary fare of the monks, unless he had
                    to entertain a guest. These ordinances proved, however, generally ineffectual to
                    secure strictness of diet, and contemporaneous literature abounds with satirical
                    remarks and complaints concerning the inordinate extravagance of the tables of
                    the abbots. When the abbot condescended to dine in the refectory, his chaplains
                    waited upon him with the dishes, a servant, if necessary, assisting them. At St
                    Alban’s the abbot took the lord’s seat, in the centre of the high table, and was
                    served on silver plate, and sumptuously entertained noblemen, ambassadors, and
                    strangers of quality. When abbots dined in their own private hall, the rule of
                    St Benedict charged them to invite their monks to their table, provided there
                    was room, on which occasions the guests were to abstain from quarrels,
                    slanderous talk, and idle gossipping. The complaint, however, was sometimes made
                    (as by Matt. Paris of Wulsig, the third abbot of St Alban’s), that they invited
                    ladies of rank to dine with them instead of their monks. The ordinary attire of
                    the abbot was according to rule to be the same as that of the monks. But by the
                    10th century the rule was commonly set aside, and we find frequent complaints of
                    abbots dressing in silk, and adopting great sumptuousness of attire. Nay, they
                    sometimes laid aside the monastic habit altogether, and assumed a secular
                    dress.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Walworth, the

                    Matthew Paris with adopting the attire of a sportsman.</p></note> This was a
                    necessary consequence of their following the chase, which was quite usual, and
                    indeed at that time only natural. With the increase of wealth and power, abbots
                    had lost much of their special religious character, and become great lords,
                    chiefly distinguished from lay lords by celibacy. Thus we hear of abbots going
                    out to sport, with their men carrying bows and arrows; keeping horses, dogs, and
                    huntsmen; and special mention is made of an abbot of Leicester, <hi
                    rend="italic">cir.</hi> 1360, who was the most skilled of all the nobility in
                    hare-hunting. In magnificence of equipage and retinue the abbots vied with the
                    first nobles of the realm. They rode on mules with gilded bridles, rich saddles
                    and housings, carrying hawks on their wrist, attended by an immense train of
                    attendants. The bells of the churches were rung as they passed. They associated
                    on equal terms with laymen of the highest distinction, and shared all their
                    pleasures and pursuits. This rank and power was, however, often used most
                    beneficially. For instance, we read of Whiting, the last Abbot of Glastonbury,
                    judicially murdered by Henry VIII., that his house was a kind of well-ordered
                    court, where as many as 300 sons of noblemen and gentlemen, who had been sent to
                    him for virtuous education, had been brought up, besides others of a meaner
                    rank, whom he fitted for the universities. His table, attendance, and officers
                    were an honour to the nation. He would entertain as many as 500 persons of rank
                    at one time, besides relieving the poor of the vicinity twice a-week. He had his
                    country houses and fisheries, and when ho travelled to attend Parliament his
                    retinue amounted to upwards of 100 persons. The abbots of Clugny and Vendome
                    were, by virtue of their office, cardinals of the Romish Church.</p>
                <p>In process of time the title abbot was improperly transferred to clerics who had
                    no connection with the monastic system, as to the principal of a body of
                    parochial clergy; and under the Carlovingians to the chief chaplain of the king,
                    <hi rend="italic">Abbas</hi><hi rend="italic">Curioe,</hi> or military chaplain

                    It even came to be adopted by purely secular officials. Thus the chief

                <p><hi rend="italic">Lay abbots,</hi> so called, had their origin in the system of
                    <hi rend="italic">commendation,</hi> in the 8th century. By this, to meet any
                    great necessity of the state, such as an inroad of the Saracens, the revenues of
                    monasteries were temporarily commended, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> handed over
                    to some layman, a noble, or even the king himself, who for the time became
                    titular abbot. Enough was reserved to maintain the monastic brotherhood, and
                    when the occasion passed away the revenues were to be restored to their rightful
                    owners. The estates, however, had a habit of lingering in lay hands, so that in
                    the 9th and 10th centuries most of the sovereigns and nobles among the Franks
                    and Burgundians were titular abbots of some great monastery, the revenues of
                    which they applied to their own purposes. These lay-abbots were styled <hi
                    rend="italic">Abbacomites</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Abbates Milites.</hi> Hugh
                    Capet, before his elevation to the throne, as an <hi rend="italic"
                    >Abbacomes</hi> held the abbeys of St Denis and St Germain <hi rend="italic">in
                    commendam.</hi> Bishop Hatto, of Mentz, <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 891-912,
                    is said to have held 12 abbeys <hi rend="italic">in commendam</hi> at once. In
                    England, as we see from the Acts of the Council of Cloveshoe, in the 8th
                    century, monasteries were often invaded and occupied by laymen. This occurred
                    sometimes from the monastery having voluntarily placed itself under the
                    protection of a powerful layman, who, from its protector, became its oppressor.
                    Sometimes there were two lines of abbots, one of laymen enjoying the lion’s
                    share of the revenues, another of clerics fulfilling the proper duties of an
                    abbot on a small fraction of the income. The gross abuse of lay commendation
                    which had sprung up during the corruption of the monastic system passed away
                    with its reformation in the 10th century, either voluntarily or by compulsion.
                    The like abuse prevailed in the East at a later period. John, Patriarch of
                    Antioch, at the beginning of the 12th century, informs us that in his time most
                    monasteries had been handed over to laymen, <hi rend="italic">beneficiarii,</hi>
                    for life, or for part of their lives, by the emperors.</p>
                <p>In conventual cathedrals, where the bishop occupied the place of the abbot, the
                    functions usually devolving on the superior of the monastery were performed by a
                    <hi rend="italic">prior.</hi> In other convents the prior was the second officer
                    next to the abbot, representing him in his absence, and fulfilling his duties.
                    The superiors of the cells, or small monastic establishments dependent on the
                    larger monasteries, were also called priors. They were appointed by the abbots,
                    and held office at their pleasure.</p>
