                <p><label type="entry">AMPHIARAUS</label>, in Greek legend, a son of Oi’cles and
                    Hypermnestra, descended on the paternal side from the kingly seer Melampus, and,
                    like his ancestor, endowed with the prophetic gift; but at the same time known
                    for hie valour in the great enterprises of his time—the expedition of the
                    Argonauts and the hunt of the Calydonian boar. The expedition, however, on which
                    the chief events of his life hinge is that of the Seven against Thebes, into
                    which he was unwillingly driven by the treachery of his wife, Eriphyle <hi
                    rend="italic">{Odyssey,</hi> xi. 326), a sister of Adrastus, who then ruled in
                    Sicyon, and by whom the enterprise was planned to restore Polynices to the
                    throne of Thebes. As prince of Argos, Amphiaraus was in a position to assist
                    greatly; but when called upon by Adrastus to take a part, he declined, on the
                    ground that the cause was unholy, and would end fatally. His marriage with
                    Eriphyle, however, had not only been meant to heal previous quarrels between him
                    and Adrastus, but was to be a bond of peace for the future in this way, that she
                    should always arbitrate between them. To secure her favour now, Polynices gave
                    her the fatal necklace which Cadmus had once given to Harmonia, and, though
                    warned of the consequences, Eriphyle accepted it and decided against her
                    husband. Knowing that he would never return, Amphiaraus enjoined his son
                    Alcmaeon, then a boy, to avenge his death upon his mother; and to his children
                    generally he gave wise counsel. As he stepped into his chariot to depart he
                    turned with a look of anger towards his wife, a scene which was represented on
                    the chest of Cypselus. The assault of Thebes was disastrous to the Seven; and
                    Amphiaraus, pursued by Periclymenus, would have fallen by his spear had not
                    Jupiter, at a critical moment, struck the earth with a thunderbolt, and caused
                    it to open and swallow him with his horses, Thoas and Dias, his chariot, and his
                    charioteer, Baton. Jupiter and Apollo, it is said in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Odyssey</hi> (xv. 245), loved Amphiaraus dearly; yet he did not reach an old
                    age, but fell at Thebes, through the gift accepted by his wife. After death he
                    continued, as a deified hero, to exercise his prophetic power by giving oracles
                    on the spot where he had sunk into the earth. In earlier times this was believed
                    to have happened at Harma, on the way from Thebes to Potniae, and it was there
                    that the oracle of Amphiaraus was which Croesus and Mardonius consulted <hi
                    rend="italic">{Herodotus,</hi> i. 49, 52; viii. 134). Afterwards this oracle
