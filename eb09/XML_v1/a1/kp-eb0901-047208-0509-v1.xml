                    times aldermen are office-bearers in the muncipal corporations of England and
                    Wales, and Ireland. Before the passing of the Municipal Corporation Act their
                    functions varied according to the charters of the different burghs. By the
                    statute 5th and 6th Will. IV. c. 76, and 3d and 4th Vict. c. 118, the aldermen
                    are elected by the councillors from among themselves (in Ireland, by the
                    burgesses), for six years, one-half going out every three years. The number of
                    councillors in each borough varies from 12 to 48, according to its magnitude.
                    One-fourth of the municipal council consists of alderman, and three-fourths of
                    councillors. In the municipal corporations of Scotland there is no such title as
                    alderman, the office-bearers of corresponding rank there being termed bailies.
                    The corporation of London was not included in the Burgh Reform Act, and the
                    antiquated system remains there in full force. The Court of Aidermen consists of
                    twenty-six, twenty-five of whom are elected for life by the freemen of the
                    respective wards, who return two persons, one of whom the Court of Aidermen
                    elect to supply the vacancy. The city is divided into twenty-six wards;
                    twenty-four of these send up one alderman each, the other two combine to choose
                    a twenty-fifth. The twenty-sixth alderman serves for the independent borough of
                    Southwark, and is appointed by the other aidermen, who generally select the
                    senior from among themselves when a vacancy occurs. The lord mayor is elected
                    from such of the aidermen as have served the office of sheriff; of these the
                    Common Hall, which consists of the freemen of the different wards, select two,
                    and the aidermen elect one of these to the mayoralty. The Court of Aidermen act
                    as magistrates for the city of London, and also possess authority of a judicial
                    nature in the affairs of the corporation. The aidermen are members of the Court
                    of Common Council, the legislative body of the corporation, which consists in
                    all of 232 members, the remainder being elected annually by the freemen. In the
                    United States aidermen form as a rule a legislative rather than a judicial body,
                    although in some cities they hold courts and possess very considerable
                    magisterial powers.</p>
