                <p><label type="entry">ANACREON</label>, an Ionian Greek, born at Teos, on the coast
                    of Asia Minor, probably about 562 B.c. His reputation as a lyric poet stood very
                    high both in his own age and in those that followed. “The charming ”—“the
                    honey-tongued ”—“the swan of Teos ”—“the glory of Ionia,” are some of the
                    epithets constantly given him by ancient writers. “Sing us one of the songs of
                    Alcaeus or Anacreon,” cries one of the guests in a comedy of Aristophanes. “When
                    I hear the verses of Sappho or Anacreon,” says the poet to his friends, in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Symposium</hi> of Plato, “I set down my cup for very shame of
                    my own performances.” But though he has given his name to that class of light
                    and free lyric effusions which celebrate the joys of love and wine, he is to us
                    moderns little more than a name. We can no longer say of him, as Horace could,
                    that “time has not drowned his sportive lays ;” and we have to judge of his
                    merits as a poet chiefly from the warm praises of those who had his poems in
                    their hands. Of the five books of lyrical pieces by Anacreon which Suidas and
                    Athenaeus mention as extant in their time, we have now but the merest fragments,
                    collected from the citations of later writers. Those graceful little poems (most
                    of them first printed from the MSS. by Henry Stephens in 1554), which long
                    passed among the learned for the songs of Anacreon, and which are well known to
                    many English readers in the translations of Cowley and Moore, are really of much
                    later date, though possibly here and there genuine fragments of the poet have
                    been woven up in them. They will always retain a certain popularity from their
                    lightness and elegance, and some of them are fair copies of Anacreon’s style,
                    which would lend itself readily enough to a clever imitator. But an almost
                    conclusive argument against their genuineness lies in the fact that the peculiar
                    forms of the Ionic Greek, in which Anacreon wrote, are not to be found in these
                    reputed odes, while the fragments of his poems quoted by ancient writers are
                    full of Ionicisms. Of the poet’s life little is known beyond a few scattered
                    notices, not in all cases certainly authentic. He probably shared the voluntary
                    exile of the mass of his fellow-townsmen, who, when Cyrus the Great was laying
                    siege to the Greek cities of Asia, took ship, and founded a colony at Abdera in
                    Thrace, rather than surrender their city to his general Harpagus. From Thrace he
                    soon removed to the island of Samos, ruled at that time by Polycrates, one of
                    the grandest of those old “tyrants” who by no means deserved the name in its
                    worst sense. It is said that he acted as Poly crates’s tutor; that he stood very
                    high in his confidence we learn from so good an authority as Herodotus, who
                    represents the poet as sitting in the royal chamber when audience was given to
                    the Persian herald. In return for such favour and protection, he wrote many
                    complimentary odes upon Polycrates and his favourites. But if an anecdote found
                    in Stobaeus is true, he was no mercenary flatterer. On one occasion the “tyrant”
                    presented him with the sum of five talents. He spent two wakeful nights in
                    thinking of his money, and then returned it to the giver, saying that it “was
                    not worth the care it cost him.” A cursory remark in the writings of Maximus of
                    Tyre shows at least the high estimation in which the poet was supposed to have
                    been held by hia royal patron. That writer says that not even the warning given
                    to Polycrates by Amasis, king of Egypt, that his too· great prosperity would
                    surely arouse the jealousy of the gods, could make a man doubt the stability of
                    his happiness, who had, like Polycrates, the command of the Ionian sea, a navy
                    so powerful, and such a friend as Anacreon. The same authority tells us that
                    this companionship exercised a beneficial influence over the stern temper of the
                    tyrant. Like his fellow-lyrist, Horace, who was one of his great admirers, and
                    in many respect of a kindred spirit, Anacreon seems to have been made for the
                    society of courts. On the death of Polycrates, Hipparchus, who was then in power
                    at Athens, and who inherited the literary tastes of his father Pisistratus, sent
                    a special embassy to fetch the popular poet to Athens in a galley of fifty oars.
                    He must have fully enjoyed and contributed much to the enjoyment of the
                    brilliant circle with which Hipparchus had surrounded himself, and there he made
                    acquaintance, amongst others, with the poet Simonides. When this circle was
                    broken up by the assassination of Hipparchus, Anacreon seems to have returned to
                    his native town of Teos. There, according to a metrical epitaph ascribed to his
                    friend Simonides, he died and was buried. Lucian mentions him amongst his
                    instances of the longevity of eminent men, as having completed eighty-five
                    years. If an anecdote given by Pliny (A <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> αi. <hi
                    rend="italic">IIist.</hi> vii. 7) is to be trusted, he was choked at last by a
                    grape-stone; but the story has an air of mythical adaptation to the poet’s
                    habits, which makes it somewhat apocryphal. Anacreon had a reputation as a
                    composer of hymns, as well as of those bacchanalian and amatory lyrics which are
                    commonly associated with his name. Two short hymns to Diana and Bacchus,
                    consisting of eight and eleven Hnes respectively, stand first amongst his few
                    undisputed remains, as printed by recent editors. But pagan hymns, especially
                    when addressed to such deities as Venus, Eros, and Bacchus, are not so very
                    unlike what we call “Anacreontic” poetry as to make the contrast of style so
                    great as the word might seem to imply. The tone of Anacreon’s lyric effusions
                    has probably led to an unjust estimate, both by ancients and moderns, of the
                    poet’s personal character. As Homer was accused of bibulous propensities by some
                    because he makes frequent and kindly mention of “the purple wine,” so Anacreon
                    was held to have been a thorough sensualist because he sang so persistently of
                    wine and love. But a poet must not always be judged by the flights of his fancy.
                    The “triple worship” of the Muses, Wine, and Love, ascribed to him as his
                    religion in an old Greek epigram <hi rend="italic">(Anthol.</hi> iii. 25, 51),
                    may have been as purely professional in the two last cases as in the first, and
                    his private character on such points was probably neither much better nor worse
                    than that of his contemporaries. Athenaeus remarks acutely that he seems at
                    least to have been sober when he wrote; and he himself strongly repudiates, as
                    Horace does, the brutal characteristics of intoxication as fit only for
                    “barbarians” and “Scythians” <hi rend="italic">(Fragm.</hi> 64, Bergk). His own
                    excuse, when charged with hymning the reigning beauties of the day rather than
                    the orthodox gods and goddesses, is said to have been made in these words—</p>
                <p>“But are not these also lesser divinities ?”</p>
                <p>The best editions of Anacreon are those of J. F. Fischer, Leipsic, 1703, and I.
                    Bergk, Leipsic, 1854. (w*. <hi rend="smallcaps">l. c.) .</hi></p>
