                <p><label type="entry">ABIOGENESIS</label>, as a name for the production of living
                    by not-living matter, has of late been superseding the less accurate phrase
                    “Spontaneous Generation.” Professor Huxley, who made use of the word in his
                    presidential address to the British Association in 1870, distinguished
                    Abiogenesis from “Xenogenesis” or “Heterogenesis,” which occurs, or is supposed
                    to occur, not when dead matter produces living matter, but when a living parent
                    gives rise to offspring which passes through a totally different series of
                    states from those exhibited by the parent, and does not return into the parent’s
                    cycle of changes. When a “living parent gives rise to offspring which passes
                    through the same cycle of changes as itself,” there occurs “Homogenesis.”
                    “Biogenesis” includes both of these. Other names for Abiogenesis are <hi
                    rend="italic">Generatio</hi><hi rend="italic">Aequivoca,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Generatio Primaria,</hi> Archigenesis (Urzeugung), Archebiosis, &amp;c. The
                    question of Abiogenesis—whether under certain conditions living matter is
                    produced by not-living matter—as it is one of the most fundamental, is perhaps
                    also the oldest in Biology; but within recent years— partly because the means of
                    accurate experimentation have been increased and the microscope improved, and
                    partly because the question has been recognised in its important bearings on
                    evolution, the correlation of forces, and the theory of infectious
                    diseases—naturalists have been led to bestow more attention upon it than at any
                    previous period. While, therefore, the doctrine of Abiogenesis cannot be said to
                    be either finally established or refuted, it is at least reasonable to believe
                    that we are gradually advancing to a solution. Among the older observers of
                    phenomena bearing on the question may be named Aristotle, who, with the ancients
                    generally, favoured Abiogenesis; Redi, the founder of the opposite view;
                    Vallisnieri; Buffon; Needham; and Spallanzani; among later observers, Schwann
                    and Schulze, Schroeder and Dusch, Pasteur, Pouchet, Haeckel, Huxley, Bastian,
                    and many others. The experiments and observations made by these naturalists, and
                    their results—the ingenious expedients employed to prevent inaccuracy—the
                    interesting and often marvellous transformations which microscopists declare
                    they have witnessed—will be discussed in the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Histology;</hi> here it will be enough to note the general nature of the
                    reasonings with which the opponents and defenders of Abiogenesis support their
                    views. The opponents maintain that all trustworthy observations have hitherto
                    shown living matter to have sprung from pre-existing living matter; and that the
                    further we search and examine, the smaller becomes the number of those organisms
                    which we cannot demonstrate to have arisen from living parents. They hold that
                    seeming instances of spontaneous generation are usually to be explained by the
                    germ-theory—the presence of invisible germs in the air; and they call to their
                    aid such high authorities as Pasteur and Tyndall. The defenders of Abiogenesis,

                    observation and experiment in their own favour, are yet less disposed to rest on
                    these, rather preferring to argue from those wide analogies of evolution and
                    correlation which seem to support their doctrine. Thus Haeckel expressly
                    embraces Abiogenesis as a necessary and integral part of the theory of universal
                    evolution; and Huxley, in the same spirit, though from the opposite camp,
                    confesses that if it were given him to look beyond the abyss of geologically
                    recorded time to the still more remote period when the earth was passing through
                    physical and chemical conditions, he should expect to be a witness of the
                    evolution of living protoplasm from not-living matter. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Critiques and Addresses,</hi> p. 239.) From this point of view, of course, any
                    microscopic observations that have been made seem very limited and comparatively
                    unimportant. The Abiogenists, indeed, are not without arguments to oppose the
                    results of past observation that seem unfavourable to their views; they argue
                    that, as yet, all the forms observed and shown to be produced by Biogenesis are
                    forms possessing a certain degree of organisation, which in their case makes
                    Abiogenesis unlikely, from the first; whereas it has not been shown that the
                    simplest structures—the <hi rend="italic">Monera</hi> —do not arise by
                    Abiogenesis. But it is not so much on grounds of fact and experiment the
                    defenders of the Abiogenesis theory are convinced of its truth, as because it
                    seems to gain confirmation from reasonings of much wider scope; because
                    Abiogenesis aids the theory of evolution by tracing the organic into the
                    inorganic; because it fosters the increasing unpopularity of the hypothesis of a
                    special “vital force;” and because, if this theory of the “perpetual origination
                    of low forms of life, now, as in all past epochs,” were established, it would
                    agree well with the principle of uniformity, and by disclosing the existence of
                    unknown worlds of material for development, would relieve natural selection with
                    its assisting causes from what many consider the too Herculean labour of
                    evolving all species from one or a very few primary forms. The fullest
                    discussion of the subject of Abiogenesis, from the Abiogenist’s point of view,
                    is to be found in Dr Bastian’s <hi rend="italic">Beginnings of Life.</hi>
                    Professor Huxley’s address, already referred to, contains an interesting
                    historical survey, as well as a masterly summary of facts and arguments in
                    favour of Biogenesis. For many interesting experiments, see <hi rend="italic"
