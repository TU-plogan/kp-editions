                <p><label type="entry">ALBERTUS MAGNUS</label>, a celebrated scholastic philosopher,
                    was born of the noble family Von Bollstädt at Lauingen in Suabia. The date of
                    his birth is most probably 1193. He was educated principally at Padua, where he
                    received particular instruction in Aristotle’s writings. In 1223 he became a
                    member of the Dominican order, and studied theology under its rules at Bologna
                    and elsewhere. Selected to fill the position of lecturer at Cologne, where the
                    order had a house, he taught for several years there, at Regensburg, Freiburg,
                    Strasburg, and Hildesheim. In 1245 he repaired to Paris and received his
                    doctorate, teaching for some time, in accordance with the regulations, and with
                    great success. In 1254 he was made provincial of his order, and fulfilled the
                    arduous duties of the office with great care and effectiveness. During the time
                    he held this office he publicly defended the Dominicans against the university
                    of Paris, commented on St John, and answered the errors of the Arabian
                    philosopher, Averroes. In 1259 the pope made him bishop of Regensburg, which
                    office he resigned after three years. The remainder of his life he spent partly
                    in preaching throughout Bavaria and the adjoining districts, partly in
                    retirement in the various houses of his order; almost the last of his labours
                    was the defence of the orthodoxy of his former pupil, Thomas Aquinas. He died in
                    1280, aged 87. Albert’s works, published in twenty-one folios by the Dominican
                    Peter <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n491/mode/1up"

                    activity. He was the most widely read and most learned man of his time. The
                    whole of Aristotle’s works, presented in the Latin translations and notes of the
                    Arabian commentators, were by him digested, interpreted, and systematised in
                    accordance with church doctrine. Albert’s activity, however, is rather
                    philosophical than theological, for while pressing philosophy in general, and
                    Aristotle in particular, into the service of theology, he excludes from what
                    belongs to the natural reason all that is specially biblical, as, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> miracles, the atonement, and the Trinity; though he
                    does not refuse to see with Augustin exemplifications, shadowings, of the latter
                    doctrine even in nature. The philosophical works occupying the first six and the
                    last of the twenty-one volumes are generally divided according to the
                    Aristotelian scheme of the sciences, and consist of interpretations and
                    condensations of Aristotle’s relative works, with supplementary discussions
                    depending on the questions then agitated, and occasionally divergences from the
                    opinions of the master. In logic, he attempts to unite the three rival theories
                    of universals, holding that universals exist in three ways—(1.) <hi
                    rend="italic">Ante res,</hi> as ideas in the mind of God, from which the class
                    is modelled, and which therefore exist before individual things; (2.) <hi
                    rend="italic">In rebus,</hi> as the common basis in a class of individual
                    objects; (3.) <hi rend="italic">Post res,</hi> as the mental notion of the
                    class. In the metaphysical and physical treatises he mainly repeats Aristotle,
                    differing from him as regards the eternity of the world and the definition of
                    the soul. His principal theological works are a commentary in three volumes on
                    the <hi rend="italic">Books of the Sentences</hi> of Peter Lombard (<hi
                    rend="italic">Magister</hi><hi rend="italic">Sententiarum),</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Summa</hi><hi rend="italic">Theologiae,</hi> in two volumes. This
                    last is in substance a repetition of the first in a more didactic form. Albert’s
                    knowledge of physical science was considerable, and for the age accurate. His
                    industry in every department was great, and though we find in his system many of
                    those inner gaps from which no scholastic philosophy was ever free, yet the
                    protracted study of Aristotle gave him a great power of systematic thought and
                    exposition, and the results of that study, as left to us, by no means warrant
                    the contemptuous title sometimes given him—the “Ape of Aristotle.” They rather
                    lead us to appreciate the motives which caused his contemporaries to bestow on
                    him the honourable surname “The Great,” and the no less honourable title,
                    “Doctor Universalis.” For Albert’s life the best authorities are Sighart, <hi

                    rend="italic">und seine</hi><hi rend="italic">Wissenschaft,</hi> 1857; and

                    are those of Stöckl, <hi rend="italic">Geschichte d.</hi><hi rend="italic"
