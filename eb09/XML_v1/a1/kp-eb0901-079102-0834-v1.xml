                <p><label type="entry">ANALOGY</label> is the name in logic for a mode of real or
                    material inference, proceeding upon the resemblance between particulars:
                    speaking generally, it is that process whereby, from the known agreement of two
                    or more things in certain respects, we infer agreement in some other point known
                    to be present in one or more, but not known to be present in the other or
                    others. It was signalised already by Aristotle under the different name of
                    Example (παράδειγμα), the word Analogy (αναλογία) having with him the special
                    sense of mathematical proportion or resemblance (equality) of ratios. The
                    earliest use of the name in its current logical sense is to be found apparently
                    in Galen. While, in popular language, the word has come to be vaguely used as a
                    synonym for resemblance, the logical authorities, though having generally the
                    same kind of inference in view, are by no means agreed as to its exact nature
                    and ground. It has chiefly to be distinguished from the related process of
                    Induction, in their conception of which logicians are notoriously at variance.
                    (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Induction.)</hi></p>
                <p>Aristotle, distinguishing Syllogism and Induction as passing the one from whole
                    to part (any part), and the other from part (all the parts) to whole, notes
                    under each a loose or rhetorical form—Enthymeme under Syllogism, and Paradigm,
                    or Example, under Induction. Thus, to give his own instance, it is an inference
                    by way of example—if a war to come of Athens against Thebes is condemned because
                    a past war of Thebes against Phocis is known to have been disastrous. Here the
                    reasoning, which may be said to pass from part to part, is resolved by Aristotle
                    as compounded of an imperfect induction and a syllogism; the particular case of
                    Thebes against Phocis started from being first inductively widened into war
                    between neighbours generally, and the particular case of Athens against Thebes
                    arrived at being then drawn out by regular syllogism from that major. Example,
                    or, to speak of it by its later name, the inference from analogy, is thus
                    presented by Aristotle as directly related to induction: it differs from an
                    imperfect induction—what is now often called real or material induction from
                    particulars incompletely enumerated—only in having its conclusion particular
                    instead of general, and its datum singular instead of plural.</p>
                <p>Kant and his followers, while maintaining a relation between induction and
                    analogy, mark the difference otherwise than Aristotle. By induction, it is said,
                    we seek to prove that some attribute belongs (or not) to all the members of a
                    class, because it belongs (or not) to many of that class; by analogy, that all
                    the attributes of a thing belong (or not) to another thing, because many of the
                    attributes belong (or not) to this other. In this country Sir William Hamilton
                    has adopted this view <hi rend="italic">{Lectures on Logic,</hi> vol. ii. pp.
                    165-174), though he differs from Kant in understanding it only of the process
                    called applied or modified induction,—not of the pure form of reasoning from all
                    the parts to the whole, which, in the manner of Aristotle, he puts on a level
                    with pure syllogistic deduction. The relation and difference of the two
                    processes may be formulated in the short expressions: One in many, therefore one
                    in all (Induction); Many in one, therefore all in one (Analogy). For instance,
                    it would be an analogical inference—to conclude that a disease corresponding in
                    many symptoms with those observed in typhus corresponds in all, or, in other
                    words, is typhus; whereas it would be an induction—to infer that a particular
                    symptom appearing in a number of typhus patients will appear in all.</p>
                <p>The view of Kant and Hamilton does not reach below the surface of the matter, if
                    it can be maintained at all. In the first of the examples just given the
                    inference might well be a good induction, all depending upon the kind of
                    symptoms that are made the ground of the conclusion; on the other hand, the
                    second might be a case of mere analogy, not to be called induction. Neither,
                    again, is Aristotle's view satisfactory, which practically makes the difference
                    to depend upon the mere quantity of the conclusion, worked out as particular for
                    analogy by appending to the induction involved a syllogism of application. Since
                    the universal always carries with it the particular, and cannot be affirmed
                    unless the particular can, the two processes become to all intents and purposes
                    one and the same. If the particular or analogical conclusion is justifiable, it
                    is because there was ground for a good induction (only not of the pure sort); if
                    there was no ground for a good induction, then, upon Aristotle’s resolution,
                    there can be no ground for the particular inference either. Should it be said,
                    indeed, that the peculiarity of the case lies not so much in the conclusion, as
                    in the start being made from one particular instance, whence the process gets
                    its name Example, that undoubtedly will distinguish it from anything that can
                    seriously be called induction; but then what becomes of the resolution that
                    Aristotle makes of it <hi rend="italic">1</hi> That resolution can be upheld
                    only at the cost of the character of the inductive process.</p>
                <p>The logician who has done most to elaborate the theory of real or material
                    induction, John Stuart Mill, has also been able to give an interpretation of
                    analogy, which, without in the least severing its connection with induction,
                    leaves it as a process for which a distinct name is necessary. According to him,
                    the two kinds of argument, while homogeneous in the type of their inference,
                    which holds for all reasoning from experience,—namely, that things <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n835/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0835-0792"/> agreeing with one another in certain respects
                    agree also in certain other respects,—yet differ in respect of their degree of
                    evidence. In both the argument is from known points of agreement to unknown;
                    but, whereas in induction the known points of agreement are supposed by due
                    comparison of instances to have been ascertained as the material ones for the
                    case in hand or conclusion in view,—in other words, to be invariably connected
                    by way of causation with the inferred properties,—it is otherwise in analogy,
                    where it is only supposed that there is no incompatibility between the inferred
                    properties and the common properties, or known points of resemblance, that are
                    taken as the ground of inference. Thus, if by comparison of instances it had
                    been ascertained, or otherwise it were known, that organic life is dependent on
                    the bare possession of an atmosphere in planetary bodies rotating upon an axis,
                    then it would be an induction to infer the presence of life upon any heavenly
                    body, known or as yet undiscovered, in which these conditions should be
                    detected. With our actual knowledge, confined to the case of the Earth, and only
                    enabling us to say that the absence of an atmosphere must destroy life, the
                    inference to such a planet as Mars, where the conditions stated seem to be
                    present, is but analogical; while to the Moon, which seems to have no
                    atmosphere, the inference has not even this amount of force, but there is rather
                    ground for inductively concluding <hi rend="italic">against</hi> the possibility
                    of organic life. Upon this view it ceases to be characteristic of analogy that
                    the inference should be to a particular case only; for the inductive conclusion,
                    when the evidence is of a kind to admit of such being drawn, may as well be
                    particular; and, again, it may equally well happen that the analogical
                    inference, where nothing stronger can&lt;be drawn, should have universal
                    application. Notwithstanding, it will be found in general that, where the
                    evidence, consisting of bare similarity of attributes in two or more particular
                    instances, permits only of an analogical inference being made, the extension in
                    thought takes place to particular cases only which have a special interest, and
                    the mind hesitates to commit itself to a general law or rule. Mill, therefore,
                    though he does not raise the point, is practically at one with Aristotle and all
                    others who make example or analogy to consist in the passage from one or more
                    particular cases to a particular new case bearing resemblance to the former. It
                    is his peculiar merit to have determined the specific conditions under which the
                    passage in thought, whether to a particular or a general, acquires the authority
                    of an effective induction.</p>
                <p>Analogy is so much resorted to in science in default of induction, either
                    provisionally till induction can be made, or as its substitute where the
                    appropriate evidence cannot be obtained,—it is also much relied upon in
                    practical life for the guidance of conduct,—that it becomes a matter of great
                    importance to determine its conditions. Whether in science or in the affairs of
                    life, the abuse of the process, or what , is technically called False Analogy,
                    is one of the most besetting snares set for the human mind. It is obvious that,
                    as the argument from analogy proceeds upon bare resemblance, its strength
                    increases with the amount of similarity; so that, though no connection is, or
                    can be, inductively made out between any of the agreeing properties and the
                    additional property which is the subject of inference, yet (in Mill’s words),
                    “where the resemblance is very great, the ascertained difference very small, and
                    our knowledge of the subject-matter very extensive, the argument from analogy
                    may approach in strength very near to a valid induction. If (he continues),
                    after much observation of B, we .find that it agrees with A in nine out of ten
                    of its known properties, we may conclude, with a probability of nine to one,
                    that it will possess any given derivative property of A” <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Logic,</hi> b. iii.. c. xx.. § 3 Y But it is equally obvious that against the
                    resemblances the ascertainable differences should be told off. For bare analogy,
                    the differences in the two (or more) cases must as little as the resemblances be
                    known to have any connection, one way or the other, with the point in question;
                    both alike must only not be known to be immaterial, else they should fall quite
                    out of the reckoning. As regards the differences, however, this is what can
                    least easily be discovered, or is, by the mind in its eagerness to bring things
                    together, most easily overlooked; and, accordingly, the error of false analogy
                    arises chiefly from neglecting so to consider them. Thus, if the inference is to
                    the presence of organic life of the terrestrial type on other planetary bodies,
                    any agreements, even when extending to the details of chemical constitution, are
                    of small account in the positive sense, compared with the negative import of
                    such facts as absence of atmosphere in the Moon, and excess of heat or cold in
                    the inmost or outermost planets. To neglect such points will not simply make the
                    analogy loose; but, as the very point in question is concerned in them, the
                    analogy becomes false and positively misleading. Still greater is the danger
                    when the things analogically brought together belong not at all to the same
                    natural classes, but the resemblance is only in some internal relation of each
                    to another thing of its own kind; as when, for example, under the name of
                    motives, particular states of mind (feelings, &amp;c.) are supposed to determine
                    the action of a man, as the motion of a body may be determined by a composition
                    of forces. In such cases there may be nothing to prevent the drawing of a good
                    analogy upon a strictly limited issue; nay, there may even sometimes, in special
                    circumstances, be ground Tor drawing an inductive conclusion; but generally the
                    elements of difference are so numerous, and their import either so hard to
                    appreciate, or, when appreciable, so decisive in a sense opposite to the
                    conclusion aimed at, that to leave them out of sight and argue without reference
                    to them, as the mind is tempted to do, vitiates the whole proceeding. What is
                    not* sufficient for analogy may, however, be good as metaphor, and metaphor is
                    of no small use for expository purposes; while (as Mill says), though it is not
                    an argument, it may imply that an argument exists. - </p>
                <p>The sense just mentioned of a resemblance of relations suggests the question how
                    far the common argument from analogy and mathematically determinate proportion,
                    which was originally called by the name, are cognate processes. Undoubtedly the
                    common argument, proceeding upon resemblance in the properties of things, can be
                    made to assume roughly the guise of a proportion,— <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi>
                    Earth: Mars:: Men: Mars-dwellers, or Earth: Men = Mars: Mars-dwellers, the-fact
                    of planetary nature, or other resembling attributes gone upon, being regarded as
                    common exponent. Less easy is it to interpret a determinate proportion, with
                    numerical equality of ratios, as analogy in the common sense; for here the very
                    determinateness makes all the difference.</p>
                <p>The name analogy is so suggestive to English readers of Bishop Butler’s famous
                    treatise, that a word, in conclusion, seems called for on the nature and scope
                    of the particular application of the process made by him. His work is entitled
                    <hi rend="italic">The Analogy of Religion, Natural and Revealed, to the
                    Constitution and Course of Nature,</hi> and consists in an attempt to convince
                    deists that there are no difficulties urged against revelation, or the system of
                    natural religion, which do not bear with equal force against the order of nature
                    as determined by Providence. The argument is a perfectly fair one within the
                    limits assigned, and Butleι must be allowed the credit of very well apprehending
                    the logical conditions involved in it. In his introduction he understates rather
                    than overstates the strength of his posi∙</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n836/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0836-0793"/>
                <p>tion; for, on the assumption that the system of nature and the system of religion
                    must both spring from one causal source, his argument acquires rather an
                    inductive character. Accordingly, it is interesting to see how, in connection
                    with his sense of analogy, he practically raises, in his Introduction, the
                    question which the general theory of inductive logic, as now understood, has
                    first to consider, —the question, namely, “whence it proceeds that <hi
                    rend="italic">likeness</hi> should beget that presumptive opinion and full
                    conviction which the human mind is formed to receive from it ;” though he would
                    not take it upon him to say “how far the extent, compass, and force of
                    analogical reasoning can be reduced to general heads and rules, and the whole be
                    formed into a system.” (o. c. K.)</p>
