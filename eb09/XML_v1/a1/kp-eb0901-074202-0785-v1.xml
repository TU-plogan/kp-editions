                <p><label type="entry">AMMONITES</label>, called also very frequently <hi
                    rend="italic">the children of Ammon,</hi> a people allied by descent to the
                    Israelites, and living in their vicinity, sprung from Lot, Abraham’s nephew, by
                    the younger of his daughters, as the immediately adjoining people, the Moabites,
                    were by the elder (Gen. xix. 37-38). Both peoples are sometimes spoken of under
                    the common name of the children of Lot (Deut, ii. 19; Ps. lxxxiii. 8); and the
                    whole history shows that they preserved throughout the course of their national
                    existence a sense of the closest brotherhood. The original territory of the two
                    tribes was the country lying immediately on the east of the Dead Sea and of the
                    lower half of the Jordan, having the Jabbok for its northern boundary; and of
                    this tract the Ammonites laid claim to the northern portion, the “half mount
                    Gilead” (Deut. iii. 12), lying between the Arnon and the Jabbok, out of which
                    they had expelled the Zamzummim (Judg. xi. 13; Deut. ii. 20, 21 <hi
                    rend="italic">cf.</hi> Gen. xiv. 5), though apparently it had been held, in part
                    at least, conjointly with the Moabites, or perhaps under their supremacy (Num.
                    xxi. 26, xxii. 1; Josh, xiii. 32). From this their original territory they had
                    been in their turn expelled by the Amorites, who were found by the Israelites
                    after their deliverance from Egypt in possession of both Gilead and BashaD, that
                    is, of the whole country on the left bank of the Jordan, lying to the north of
                    the Arnon (Num. xxi 13). By this Amorite invasion, as the Moabites were driven
                    to the south of the Arnon, which formed their northern boundary from that time

                    flows from south to north, which henceforth continued to be their western
                    boundary (Num. xxi. 24; Deut. ii. 37, iii. 16). The other limits of the <hi

                    Mac. iv. 26), there are no means of exactly defining. On the south it probably
                    adjoined the land of Moab (but <hi rend="italic">cf.</hi> Ewald, <hi
                    rend="italic">Gesch. Israels,</hi> ii. 266); on the north it may have met that
                    of the king of Geshur (2 Sam. xiii. 37); and on the east it probably melted away
                    into the desert peopled by Amalekites and other nomadic races.</p>
                <p>The chief city of the country, called Babbah, or Rabbath of the children of
                    Ammon, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the metropolis of the Ammonites (Deut. iii.
                    11), and Rabbathammana by the later Greeks (Polyb. v. 7, 4), whose name was
                    changed into Philadelphia by Ptolemy Philadelphus, a large and strong city with
                    an acropolis, was situated on both sides of a branch of the Jabbok, bearing at
                    the present day the name of Moiet or N^ahr Amman, the water or river of Ammon,
                    whence the designation “city of waters” (2 Sam. xii. 27; c∕. Burckhardt, <hi
                    rend="italic">Syria,</hi> p. 361). The ruins called Amman by the natives are
                    extensive and imposing. The country to the south and east of Amman is
                    distinguished by its fertility; and ruined towns are scattered thickly over it,
                    attesting that it was once occupied by a population which, however fierce, was
                    settled and industrious (see Burckhardt, <hi rend="italic">op. dt.,</hi> 357,
                    <hi rend="italic">cf.</hi> Lindsay, <hi rend="italic">Holy Land,</hi> 5th ed.,
                    p. 279), a fact indicated also by the tribute of com paid annually to Jotham (2
                    Chron, xxvii. 5). The Israelites on their journey out of Egypt to the land of
                    promise were forbidden to meddle with the territory of Ammon as of Moab (Deut.
                    ii. 19); and it seems to indicate that friendly relations subsisted at first
                    between this people and the chosen nation, that after the latter had conquered
                    and slain Og, the giant king of Bashan, the enemy of both, his bedstead was
                    placed in Rabbah (Deut. iii. 11). Like Moab, however, the Ammonites beheld with
                    jealousy the rising greatness of Israel· They joined the former in hiring Balaam
                    to curse them (Deut, xxiii. 4); and thenceforward their history, so far as
                    known, reveals a spirit of bitter hostility against the people of Jehovah—shown
                    in invasions repeated and violent, and cruelties the most outrageous and
                    unsparing (Judg. x. 8; Amos i. 13). They could not forget that the Gileadite
                    portion of the inheritance of Israel had once been their possession, nor cease
                    to press their claim for its recovery (Judg. xi. 13). We find them joined first
                    with Moab (Judg. iii. 12), and then with the Philistines (Judg. x. 7, 8), in the
                    invasion and oppression for lengthened periods of the land of their enemies.
                    Subdued by the prowess of Jephthah, they began again to act on the offensive in
                    the days of Saul, laying siege to Jabesh-Gilead (1 Sam. xi. 1). David offered
                    his friendship to the king of Ammon, but his offer was rejected with contumely
                    and outrage, for which a terrible vengeance was exacted in the capture and
                    overthrow of their metropolis, and the deliberate slaughter of the people (2
                    Sam. x.) They were united with Moab against Judah in the days of Jehoshaphat (2
                    Chron, xx. 1); they paid tribute to Uzziah and Jotham (2 Chron, xxvi. 8, xxvii.
                    5); and with the neighbouring tribes helped the Chaldean monarch against
                    Jehoiakim (2 Kings xxiv. 2). When, after the destruction of Jerusalem, the poor
                    remnants of the Israelites were gathered together under the protectorate of
                    Nebuchadnezzar, it was by the instigation of a king of Ammon that Gedaliah, the
                    ruler appointed over them, was murdered, and new calamities were incurred (Jer.
                    xii. 14); and when Jerusalem was to be rebuilt, the foremost in opposing the
                    patriotic Jews were a Moabite and an Ammonite (Neh. ii. 10, 19; iv. 1- 3). True
                    to their antecedents, the Ammonites, with some of the neighbouring tribes, did
                    their utmost to resist and check the revival of the Jewish power under Judas
                    Maccabaeus (1 Macc. v. 6; <hi rend="italic">cf.</hi> Jos. <hi rend="italic">Ant.
                    Jud.</hi> xiii. 8, 1). The last historical notice of them is in Justin Martyr
                    <hi rend="italic">{Dial, cum Tryph.</hi> § 119), where it is affirmed that they
                    were still a numerous people. The Ammonites are repeatedly mentioned under the
                    form Bit-Amman, i.e., house of Amman, in the inscriptions of Nineveh among the
                    tributaries of the kings of Assyria (Schrader, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Keilinschriften</hi><hi rend="italic">und</hi><hi rend="italic">d. A. T.</hi>
                    52). The names of their kings, so far as known,—in Scripture, Nahash, Hanun,
                    Baalis, or Baalim (2 Sam. x. 2; Jer. xl. 14); in Assyrian, Puduilu (c∕. Pedahel
                    (Num. xxxiv. 28), Basa (c∕ ’. Baasha, 1 Kings xv. 33), and Sanibi (of less
                    obvious analogy),—testify, in harmony with other considerations, that their
                    language was Semitic, closely allied to the Hebrew; and this fact is now placed
                    beyond question by the discovery of the Mesha-stele, presenting the language of
                    the Moabites, and doubtless that also of the brother tribe (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Moabites).</hi> Their national deity, Moloch or Milcom (sec <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Moloch),</hi> was worshipped with cruel rites,—a circumstance
                    tending to foster that fierceness of character which distinguished this people
                    throughout their history.</p>
