                <p><label type="entry">ALMOND</label>. This is the fruit of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Amygdalus</hi><hi rend="italic">communis,</hi> a plant belonging to the natural
                    order Rosaceae, sub-order Amygdaleae or Drupiferae. The tree appears to be a
                    native of Asia, Barbary, and Marocco; but it has been extensively distributed
                    over the warm temperate region of the Old World. It is a tree of moderate size;
                    the leaves are oblong-lanceolate, and serrated at the edges; and the flowers,
                    which appear early in spring, are of a pink colour. The fruit is a drupe, having
                    a downy outer coat, called the epicarp, covering a tough portion called the
                    mesocarp, which encloses the reticulated hard stony shell or endocarp. The seed
                    is the kernel which is contained within these coverings. The shell-almonds of
                    trade consist of the endocarps enclosing the seeds. The tree grows in Syria
                    and</p>
                <p>Palestine; and is referred to in the Bible under the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Shaked,</hi> meaning “hasten.” The word Luz, which occurs in Genesis xxx. 37,
                    and which has been translated hazel, is supposed to be another name for the
                    almond. In Palestine the tree flowers in January, and this hastening of the
                    period of flowering seems to be alluded to in Jeremiah i. 11, 12, where the Lord
                    asks the prophet, “What seest thou?” and he replies, “The rod of an
                    almond-tree;” and the Lord says, “Thou hast well seen, for I will hasten my word
                    to perform it.” In Ecclesiastes xii. 5 it is said the “almond-tree shall
                    flourish.” This has often been supposed to refer to the resemblance of the hoary
                    locks of age to the flowers of the almond; but this exposition is not borne out
                    by the facts of the case, inasmuch as the flowers of the almond are not white
                    but pink. The passage is more probably intended to allude to the hastening or
                    rapid approach of old age. The application of Shaked or <hi rend="italic"
                    >hasten</hi> to the almond is similar to the use of the name “May” for the
                    hawthorn, which usually flowers in that month in Britain. The rod of Aaron,
                    mentioned in Numbers xvii., was taken from an almond-tree; and the Jews still
                    carry rods of almond-blossom to the synagogues on great festival days. The fruit
                    of the almond supplied a model for certain kinds of ornamental carved work.
                    (Exodus xxv. 33, 34; xxxvii. 19, 20). Dr Tristram remarks: “The blossom of the
                    almond is a very pale pink, but where, as in the <pb break="no"

                    almond trees are intermingled, the almond looks white by comparison. In early
                    spring it forms a beautiful feature in the landscape there, as the lower slopes
                    of Gerizim, as well as the valley, are studded with almonds and peaches, in
                    lively contrast with the deep green foliage of the orange-trees, and rivalling
                    an apple orchard in splendour of colour. There are also many wild almond-trees
                    on Mount Carmel. The tree seldom exceeds 12 to 16 feet in height.” There are two
                    varieties of the plant, the one producing sweet, the other bitter almonds. The
                    kernel of the former contains a fixed oil and emulsin; while that of the latter
                    has in addition a nitrogenous substance called amygdalin, which, by combination
                    with emulsin, produces a volatile oil and prussic acid. The flowers of the
                    bitter almond-tree (<hi rend="italic">Amygdalus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >communis,</hi> variety <hi rend="italic">amara)</hi> are larger and whiter than
                    those of the sweet almond-tree (<hi rend="italic">Amygdalus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">communis,</hi> variety <hi rend="italic">dulcis).</hi> The sweet
                    almond is bland and inodorous. There are numerous commercial varieties, of which
                    the most esteemed is the Jordan almond, imported from Malaga. Valentia almonds
                    are also valued. Fresh sweet almonds are nutritive and demulcent, but as the
                    outer brown skin or episperm sometimes causes irritation of the alimentary
                    canal, they are blanched by removal of this skin when used at dessert. When
                    bitter almonds are pounded in water a ratafia odour is produced, on account of
                    the formation of prussic acid. The essential oil or essence of almonds, so much
                    employed for flavouring dishes, requires to be used with caution, as it
                    possesses marked poisonous qualities. In some cases the oil, even when taken in
                    small quantities, produces nettle-rash. The import of sweet almonds into Britain
                    in 1870 amounted to 36,189 cwt.; of bitter almonds, 7618 cwt.</p>
