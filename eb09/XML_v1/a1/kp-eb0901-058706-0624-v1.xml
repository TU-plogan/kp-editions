                <p><label type="entry">ALLOY</label>, the name given to a combination obtained by
                    fusing metals with each other. Few metals are employed in the pure state, with
                    the exception of iron, copper, lead, tin, zinc, platinum, aluminium; metals are
                    more frequently used in the forms of alloys for technical purposes. Every
                    industrial application necessitates special qualities that may not occur in any
                    isolated metal, but which may be produced by the proper mixture of two or more
                    of these substances. Thus gold and silver, which in their pure state are too
                    soft and flexible for the manufacture of plate, coin, trinkets, &amp;c., are
                    hardened by the addition of a tenth part of copper, while the colour and other
                    valuable qualities are not materially impaired. Similarly copper is rendered
                    hard by mixture with zinc, when we obtain brass, an alloy of a beautiful yellow
                    colour, easier to work than the pure metal. If brass has to be used in turning
                    operations it is found to tear under the action of the chisel, unless a small
                    quantity of lead has been added. These examples are sufficient to show that an
                    alloy is really an industrial metal, often of greater importance than the metals
                    which compose it.</p>
                <p>Alloys are equally interesting from a purely scientific point of view. They are
                    not only mixtures of metals having certain particular qualities, but in reality
                    are true chemical compounds, generally dissolved in an excess of one of the
                    constituent metals. In the appearances which accompany the union of the metals,
                    and in the properties of the resulting products, we observe that which
                    characterises the manifestation of affinity, that is, an evolution of heat and
                    light, resulting in the formation of substances having a definite composition,
                    distinct crystalline form, and a variety of properties different from those of
                    the constituents. If a piece of clean sodium is rubbed in a mortar with a
                    quantity of dry mercury, the metal dissolves, producing a harsh sound resembling
                    the immersion of red hot iron in water. This phenomenon is due to the large
                    evolution of heat which accompanies the combination, as the mercury rises
                    rapidly in temperature on the addition of each successive piece of sodium. If
                    the mass is allowed to cool after the action, long needles of a white brilliant
                    alloy of definite composition crystallise from the middle of the liquid, from
                    which the excess of mercury may be separated by decantation. Platinum, iridium,
                    gold, rhodium, ruthenium, and silver unite with tin, producing an evolution of
                    heat; if <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n625/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0625-0588"/> the tin is in excess after cooling, a metallic
                    ingot is obtained resembling closely the original substance; but if the mass is
                    treated with strong hydrochloric acid, the excess of tin is dissolved and
                    crystals remain of a definite alloy of tin and the precious metal. These alloys
                    are insoluble in strong hydrochloric acid, which dissolves tin so easily; but
                    they are soluble in aqua regia, even when the precious metal contained therein
                    (rhodium, ruthenium, iridium) is in the free state absolutely insoluble. This is
                    no proof that the industrial alloys are always the result of one definite
                    combination dissolved in excess of one of the metals, as many combinations are
                    able to co-exist in the same alloy. This may be proved by taking an alloy of
                    tin, lead, and bismuth, which melts below the boiling point of water, heating to
                    a temperature of 25° C., and observing the rate of cooling by means of a
                    thermometer. The thermometer falls at first regularly as far as a certain
                    degree, where it remains stationary for some time, after which it descends to a
                    lower temperature, where it is again similarly arrested. These two stoppages in
                    the rate of cooling can only be explained by admitting the production of a less
                    fusible alloy in the fluid mass, which solidifies with an evolution of heat,
                    rendering the thermometer stationary for a time. Each successive arrest will
                    therefore correspond to the formation of more fusible combinations. Thus the
                    metals form amongst themselves true chemical combinations; and alloys are often
                    formed by the mixture of one or more of these compounds with excess of one of
                    the constituents.</p>
                <p>Recently hydrogen, which, although a gaseous substance, has chemical properties
                    resembling those of the true metals, has been combined with palladium, sodium,
                    and potassium, producing compounds similar in properties to the recognised
                    alloys.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Properties of Alloys.</hi><hi rend="italic">Density.—</hi>
                    If the density of any alloy is calculated from that of the components— assuming
                    that there is no condensation of volume—the resulting number is sometimes
                    greater than, equal to, or less than, the experimental result. Thus the alloys
                    of gold and silver are less dense than the theoretical mean density; whereas
                    brass and the alloys of lead and antimony vary in the opposite direction. The
                    former are therefore produced through an expansion, the latter through a
                    condensation of their constituents. In the formation of many alloys there is no
                    alteration of volume, and then the calculated density is correct. <hi
                    rend="italic">Colour.—</hi> This is generally grey, unless when we have a
                    coloured metal like copper or gold present in sufficient quantity. <hi
                    rend="italic">Hardness, Ductility, and Tenacity.—</hi> Alloys are for the most
                    part harder and more brittle, and are generally less ductile and possess less
                    tenacity than the constituent metal that has these properties in excess.
                    Aluminium bronze is an exception, as its tenacity is greater than that of either
                    of the components. <hi rend="italic">Fusibility.</hi> —This is always greater
                    than that of the least fusible metal entering into the composition of the alloy,
                    and is sometimes greater than in any of the components. Thus an alloy, composed
                    of 5 parts of bismuth, 3 of lead, and 2 of tin, melts at 91° C. Alloys of lead
                    and silver, containing a small quantity of the latter, are more fusible than
                    lead, and potassium and sodium form an alloy fluid at the ordinary temperature
                    of the air. <hi rend="italic">Liquation.—</hi> The constituents of an alloy
                    heated gradually to near its point of liquefication frequently unite anew in
                    such proportions as to form a mass that is fusible at the given temperature. If
                    the fluid portion is poured off, there remains a solid alloy less fusible than
                    the original. Copper is separated from silver by this process. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Decomposition.</hi> —When the alloy contains a volatile metal like zinc or
                    mercury, heat decomposes it, but the temperature required to expel the last
                    trace of the volatile metal must be considerably higher than that metal’s normal
                    temperature of ebullition. <hi rend="italic">Temper.—</hi> The alloy of 94 parts
                    of copper and 6 parts of tin forms a bronze so brittle that it may be pulverised
                    with a hammer when it has been slowly cooled; but if, on the contrary, it is
                    cooled rapidly by tempering it in cold water, it becomes malleable. <hi
                    rend="italic">Influence of the Constituent Metals.—</hi> Mercury, bismuth, tin,
                    and cadmium give fusibility to alloys into which they enter; tin also gives
                    hardness and tenacity if present in considerable quantity; lead and iron give
                    hardness; arsenic and antimony render alloys brittle.</p>

                    proportions in which the metals enter into the best known alloys, the

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Preparation of Alloys.-</hi> —The metals are generally fused
                    together under a layer of charcoal to prevent oxidation, thoroughly mixed by
                    agitating, and the mass left to cool slowly. This process can only be employed
