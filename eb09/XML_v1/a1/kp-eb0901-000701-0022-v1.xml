                <p><label type="entry">ABAUZIT, <hi rend="smallcaps">Firmin</hi></label>, a learned
                    Frenchman, was born of Protestant parents at Uzès, in Languedoc, in 1679. His
                    father, who was of Arabian descent, died when he was but two years of age; and
                    when, on the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, the authorities took
                    steps to have him educated in the Roman Catholic faith, his mother contrived his
                    escape. For two years his brother and he lived as fugitives in the mountains of
                    the Cevennes, but they at last reached Geneva, where their mother afterwards
                    joined them on escaping from the imprisonment in which she was held from the
                    time of their flight. Abauzit’s youth was spent in diligent study, and at an
                    early age he acquired great proficiency in languages, physics, and theology. In
                    1698 he travelled into Holland, and there became acquainted with Bayle, Jurieu,
                    and Basnage. Proceeding to England, he was introduced to Sir Isaac Newton, who
                    found in him one of the earliest defenders of the great truths his discoveries
                    disclosed to the world.</p>

                <p>Sir Isaac corrected in the second edition of his <hi rend="italic">Principia</hi>
                    an error pointed out by Abauzit. The high estimate Newton entertained of his
                    merits appears from the compliment he paid to Abauzit, when, sending him the <hi
                    rend="italic">Commercium,</hi><hi rend="italic">Epistolicum,</hi> he said, “You
                    are well worthy to judge between Leibnitz and me.” The reputation of Abauzit
                    induced William III. to request him to settle in England, but he did not accept
                    the king’s offer, preferring to return to Geneva. There from 1715 he rendered
                    valuable assistance to a society that had been formed for translating the New
                    Testament into French. He declined the offer of the chair of philosophy in the
                    University in 1723, but accepted, in 1727, the sinecure office of librarian to
                    the city of his adoption. Here he died at a good old age, in 1767. Abauzit was a
                    man of great learning and of wonderful versatility. The varied knowledge he
                    possessed was so well digested and arranged in his retentive mind as to be
                    always within his reach for immediate use. Whatever chanced to be discussed, it
                    used to be said of Abauzit, as of Professor Whewell of our own times, that he
                    seemed to have made it a subject of particular study. Rousseau, who was
                    jealously sparing of his praises, addressed to him, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nouvelle Héloïse,</hi> a fine panegyric; and when a stranger flatteringly told
                    Voltaire he had come to see a great man, the philosopher asked him if he had
                    seen Abauzit. Little remains of the labours of this intellectual giant, his
                    heirs having, it is said, destroyed the papers that came into their possession,
                    because their religious opinions differed from those of Abauzit. A few
                    theological, archaeological, and astronomical articles from his pen appeared in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi><hi rend="italic">Helvétique</hi> and
                    elsewhere, and he contributed several papers to Rousseau’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dictionary of Music.</hi> A work he wrote throwing doubt on the canonical
                    authority of the Apocalypse was answered—conclusively, as Abauzit himself
                    allowed—by Dr Leonard Twells. He edited, and made valuable additions to Spon’s
                    <hi rend="italic">History of Geneva.</hi> A collection of his writings was
                    published at Geneva in 1770, and another at London in 1773. Some of them were
                    translated into English by Dr Harwood (1770, 1774). Information regarding
                    Abauzit will be found in Senebier’s <hi rend="italic">Histoire Littéraire de
                    Genève,</hi> Harwood’s <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies,</hi> and Orme’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Bibliotheca Biblica,</hi> 1834.</p>
