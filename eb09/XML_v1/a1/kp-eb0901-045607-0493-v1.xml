                    Great,” and “The Portuguese Mars,” was born in 1453 at Alexandria, near Lisbon.
                    Through his father, Gonzalvo, who held an important position at court, he was
                    connected by illegitimate descent with the royal family of Portugal, and through
                    his mother, Dona Leonora de Menezes, he could claim kindred with Zarco and other
                    illustrious navigators. He was educated at the court of Alphonso V., and after

                    the scene of his future triumphs. In company w'ith his kinsman Francisco he
                    sailed round the Cape of Good Hope to India, and succeeded in establishing the
                    king of Cochin securely on his throne, obtaining in return for this service

                    the East. He returned home in July 1504, and was well received by King Emmanuel,
                    who entrusted him with the command of a squadron of five vessels in the fleet of
                    sixteen which sailed for India in 1506 under Tristan da Cunha. After a series of
                    successful attacks on the Moorish cities on the east coast of Africa,
                    Albuquerque separated from Da Cunha, and sailed with his squadron against the
                    island of Ormuz, in the Persian Gulf, which was then one of the chief centres of
                    commerce in the East. He arrived on the 25th September 1507, and soon obtained
                    possession of the island, though he was unable long to maintain his position.
                    With his squadron increased by three vessels, he reached the Malabar coast at
                    the close of the year 1508, and immediately made known the commission he had
                    received from the king empowering him to supersede the governor Almeida. The
                    latter, however, refused to recognise Albuquerque’s credentials, and cast him
                    into prison, from which he was only released, after three months’ confinement,
                    on the arrival of the grand marshal of Portugal with a large fleet. Almeida
                    having returned home, Albuquerque speedily showed the energy and determination
                    of his character. An unsuccessful attack upon Calicut in January 1510, in which
                    the commander-in-chief received a severe wound, was immediately followed by the
                    investment and capture of Goa. Albuquerque, finding himself unable to hold the
                    town on his first occupation, abandoned it in August, to return with
                    reinforcements in November, when he obtained undisputed possession. He next
                    directed his forces against Malacca, which he subdued after a severe struggle.
                    He remained in the town nearly a year in order to strengthen the position of the
                    Portuguese power. In 1512 he sailed for the coast of Malabar. On the voyage a
                    violent storm arose, Albuquerque’s vessel, the “Flor de la Mar,” which carried
                    the treasure he had amassed in his conquests, was wrecked, and he himself barely
                    escaped with his life. In September of the same year he arrived at Goa, where he
                    quickly suppressed a serious revolt headed by Idalcan, and took such measures
                    for the security and peace of the town that it became the most flourishing of
                    the Portuguese settlements in India. Albuquerque had been for some time under
                    orders from the home government to undertake an expedition to the Red Sea, in
                    order to secure that channel of communication exclusively to Portugal. He
                    accordingly laid siege to Aden in 1513, but was repulsed; and a voyage into the
                    Red Sea, the first ever made by a European fleet, led to no substantial results.
                    In order to destroy the power of Egypt, he is said to have entertained the idea
                    of diverting the course of the Nile, and so rendering the whole country barren.
                    His last warlike undertaking was a second attack upon Ormuz in 1515. The island
                    yielded to him without resistance, and it remained in the possession of the
                    Portuguese until 1622. Albuquerque’s great career had a painful and ignominious
                    close. He had several enemies at the Portuguese court who lost no opportunity of
                    stirring up the jealousy of the king against him, and his own injudicious and
                    arbitrary conduct on several occasions served their end only too well. On his
                    return from Ormuz, at the entrance of the harbour of Goa, he met a vessel from
                    Europe bearing despatches announcing that he was superseded by his personal
                    enemy Soarez. The blow was too much for him, and he died at sea on the 16th
                    December 1515. Before his death he wrote a letter to the king in dignified and
                    affecting terms, vindicating his conduct and claiming for his son the honours
                    and rewards that were justly due to himself. His body was buried at Goa in the
                    Church of Our Lady, and it is perhaps the most convincing proof possible of the
                    justice of his administration, that, many years after, Moors and Hindoos used to
                    go to his tomb to invoke protection against the injustice of his successors. The
                    king of Portugal was convinced too late of his fidelity, and endeavoured to
                    atone for the ingratitude with which he had treated him by heaping honours upon
                    his natural son Affonso. The latter published a selection from his father’s
                    papers, under the title <hi rend="italic">Commentarios</hi><hi rend="italic">do
                    Grande Affonso d' Alboquerque.</hi></p>
