                    <hi rend="italic">Prosper</hi><hi rend="italic">Alpinus),</hi> a celebrated
                    physician and botanist, was born at Marostica, in the republic of Venice, on the
                    23d November 1553. In his youth he served for a time in the Milanese army, but
                    in 1574 he quitted it, and went to Padua to study medicine. He was admitted to
                    the degree of doctor of physic in 1578, soon after which he left the University,
                    and settled as a physician in Campo San Pietro, a small town in the Paduan
                    territory, at the invitation of its citizens. In the course of his studies he
                    had paid particular attention to botanical science; but the sphere of his
                    present practice was too limited to afford him much opportunity of prosecuting
                    his favourite study. He wished particularly to extend his knowledge of exotic
                    plants, by observing their economy and habits in their native soil. To gratify
                    this laudable curiosity an opportunity presented itself when George Emo or Hemi,
                    the consul for the Venetian republic in Egypt, appointed Alpini his physician.
                    They sailed from Venice in September 1580, and arrived at Grand Cairo in the
                    following year. Alpini spent three years in Egypt, and by his industry and
                    assiduity greatly improved his ‘botanical knowledge, having travelled along the
                    banks of the Nile, visited every place, and consulted every person from whom he
                    expected any new information. From a practice in the management of date-trees
                    which he observed in this country, Alpini seems to have deduced the doctrine of
                    the sexual difference of plants, which was adopted as the foundation of the
                    celebrated system of Linnaeus. He says that “the female date-trees or palms do
                    not bear fruit unless the branches of the male and female plants are mixed
                    together; or, as is generally done, unless the dust found in the male sheath or
                    male flowers is sprinkled over the female flowers.” His treatise <hi
                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Medicina</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Aegyptiorum</hi> contains the first account of the coffee-plant that was
                    published in Europe. When Alpini returned to Venice in 1586 he was appointed
                    physician to Andre Doria, prince of Melfi; and during his residence at Genoa he
                    was esteemed the first physician of his age. The Venetians were unwilling that
                    the Genoese state should number among its citizens a person of such
                    distinguished merit and reputation; and in the year 1593 he was recalled to fill
                    the botanical chair in the university of Padua, with a salary of 200 florins,
                    afterwards increased to 750. He discharged the duties of his professorship for
                    many years with great reputation, till his declining health interrupted his
                    labours. He died of slow fever on the 6th February 1617, in the sixty-fourth
                    year of his age, and was succeeded as botanical professor by one of his sons.
                    The genus Alpinia, belonging to the order Zingiberaceae, is named after him.
