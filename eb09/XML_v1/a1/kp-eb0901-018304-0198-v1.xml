                    Theodor</hi></label>, a distinguished German natural philosopher, was born at
                    Rostock in Saxony in 1724, and died at Dorpat in August 1802. He was descended
                    from John Aepinus (ό. 1499— <hi rend="italic">d.</hi> 1553), the first to adopt
                    the Greek form ( αίπϵvός) of the family name, a leading theologian and
                    controversialist at the time of the Reformation. After studying medicine for a
                    time, Francis Aepinus devoted himself to the physical and mathematical sciences,
                    in which he soon gained such distinction that he was admitted a member of the
                    Berlin Academy of Sciences. In 1757 he settled in St Petersburg as member of the
                    Imperial Academy of Sciences and professor of physics, labouring there and
                    pursuing his favourite studies with great success till his death. He enjoyed the
                    special favour of the Empress Catharine II., who appointed him tutor to her son
                    Paul, and endeavoured, without success, to establish normal schools throughout
                    the empire under his direction. Aepinus is best known by his researches,
                    theoretical and experimental, in electricity and magnetism. His principal work,
                    <hi rend="italic">Tentamen</hi><hi rend="italic">Theoriae Electricitatis et
                    Magnetismi,</hi> published at St Petersburg in 1759, may be regarded as the
                    first systematic and successful attempt to apply mathematical reasoning to these
                    subjects. Adopting Franklin’s theory of positive and negative electricities, or
                    electric forces, he investigated the relations of these fully, and especially
                    the conditions of their equilibrium; and many of the conclusions he arrived at
                    do not depend for their value and importance on the theory of Franklin. Aepinus
                    himself extended the theory, holding that the particles of the electric fluid
                    repel each other, attract the particles of all bodies, and are attracted by
                    them, with a force inversely proportional to the distance; that the fluid
                    resides in the pores of the surfaces of bodies, moving readily through some,
                    called conductors or non-electrics, and with difficulty through others; and that
                    electric phenomena are produced either by the approach of bodies unequally
                    charged, or by the unequal distribution of the fluid in the same body. He
                    propounded a kindred theory of magnetism, a magnetic fluid being supposed to
                    exist corresponding to the electric fluid, but acting on, and acted on by, the
                    particles of iron only. It is to be added that Aepinus was the first to perceive
                    and define, with any measure of clearness, the affinity between electricity and
                    magnetism. There is a remarkable similarity between portions of the work above
                    named and a paper by Cavendish—the result of independent investigations— given
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi> for 1771. In 1787 the
                    Abbé Haiiy published an exposition of Aepinus’s theories. Aepinus did not
                    confine himself to one or two departments of natural science. He published a
                    treatise, in 1762, <hi rend="italic">On the Distribution of Heat at the Surface
                    of the Earth;</hi> and he was also the author of valuable memoirs on different
                    subjects in astronomy, mechanics, optics, meteorology, and pure mathematics,
                    contained in the journals of the learned societies of St Petersburg and Berlin.
                    His discussion of the effects of parallax in the transit of a planet over the
                    sun’s disc excited great interest, having appeared (in 1764) between the dates
                    of the two transits of Venus that took place during last century.</p>
