                    rend="italic">Imperator fidelium.</hi> Spelman says, “In regno Saracenorum
                    quatuor praetores statuit, qui <hi rend="italic">admiralli</hi> vocabantur.” The
                    <hi rend="italic">d</hi> is evidently superfluous, and is omitted by the French,
                    who say <hi rend="italic">Amiral</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi> The Spanish write
                    <hi rend="italic">Almirante;</hi> the Portuguese the same. Milton would seem to
                    have been aware of the origin of the word when he speaks of “the mast of some
                    great ammiral.” It is obvious, then, that the supposed derivations of ἄ <hi

                    rend="italic">ς</hi> from the Greek, <hi rend="italic">aumer</hi> from the

                    unauthorised etymologies.</p>
                <p>Anciently there were three or four admirals appointed for the English seas, all
                    of them holding the office <hi rend="italic">durante</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >beneplacito,</hi> and each of them having particular limits under his charge
                    and government, as admiral of the fleet of ships from the mouth of the Thames,
                    northward, southward, or westward. Besides these, there were admirals of the
                    Cinque Ports. We sometimes find that one person had been admiral of all the
                    fleets—Sir John de Beauchamp, 34 Edw. III., being the first who held the post;
                    but the title of <hi rend="italic">Admiralis</hi><hi rend="italic">Angliae</hi>
                    does not occur till the reign of Henry IV., when the king’s half-brother, Sir
                    Thomas Beaufort (created Earl of Dorset 5th July 1411), a natural son of John of
                    Gaunt, was made admiral of the fleet for life, and admiral of England, Ireland,
                    and Aquitaine for life. It may be observed that there was a title above that of
                    admiral of England, which was <hi rend="italic">locum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >tenens regis</hi><hi rend="italic">gaper mare,</hi> the king’s
                    lieutenant-general of the sea. This title is first mentioned in the reign of
                    Richard II. Before the use of the word <hi rend="italic">admiral</hi> was known,
                    the title of <hi rend="italic">custos</hi><hi rend="italic">maris</hi> was made
                    use of.</p>
                <p>Of the rank of admiral there are three degrees—admiral, vice-admiral,
                    rear-admiral. Each of these degrees formerly comprised three grades,
                    distinguished by red, white, and blue flags—the red being the highest degree in
                    each rank of admiral, vice-admiral, and rear-admiral.</p>
                <p>It may be remarked that for nearly a century there was no admiral of the red
                    squadron. According to a vulgar error, that flag had been taken from us by the
                    Dutch in one of those arduous struggles for naval superiority which that nation
                    was once able to maintain against the naval power of England. But the fact is,
                    the red flag was laid aside on the union of the two crowns of England and
                    Scotland, when the union flag was adopted in its place, and was usually hoisted
                    by the admiral commanding in chief. The red flag was revived on the occasion of
                    the promotion of naval officers in November 1805, in consequence of the
                    memorable victory off Trafalgar. The three degrees of red, white, and blue
                    flag-officers were abolished by order in council on 5th August 1864, and the
                    white ensign was thenceforward adopted as the sole flag for the ships of the
                    royal navy proper. Captains are now promoted to be rear-admirals, rear-admirals
                    to be vice-admirals, and vice-admirals to be admirals <hi rend="italic"

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Admiral of the Fleet</hi> is a mere honorary distinction,
                    which gives no command, but merely an increase of half-pay, his being £3, 7s.
                    a-day, and that of an admiral £2, 2s. The title has been sometimes conferred on
                    the senior admiral on the list of naval officers, and was a short time held by
                    the Duke of Clarence, afterwards William IV. In 1851 were appointed, for the
                    first time, two admirals of the fleet, Sir Thomas Byam Martin, G.C.B., and Sir
                    George Cockburn, G.C.B., the last having been appointed for his long and
                    highly-distinguished services. The number of admirals of the fleet now (1874)
                    authorised to be borne is three. If the admiral of the fleet should happen to
                    serve afloat, he is authorised to carry the union flag at the main-top-gallant
                    mast head, which was the case when the Duke of Clarence escorted Louis XVIII.
                    across the Channel to take possession of the throne of France.</p>
                <p>The comparative rank of flag-officers and officers in the army has been settled
                    as follows by his Majesty’s order in council, in the reign of George IV :—-</p>
                <p>The admiral and commander-in-chief of the fleet has the rank of a field-marshal
                    in the army; admirals with flags at the main take rank with generals of horse
                    and foot; vice-admirals with lieutenant-generals; rear-admirals with
                    major-generals; commodores of the first and second class with broad pendants
                    with brigadier-generals.</p>
                <p>On the active list of admirals there were in 1873 three admirals of the fleet,
                    thirteen admirals, fifteen vice-admirals, and twenty-five rear-admirals.</p>
                <p>In addition to these, there were on the reserved list forty admirals and
                    thirty-four vice-admirals; on the retired list forty-three admirals, fifty-five
                    vice-admirals, and sixty-two rear-admirals. As to the numbers to be borne
                    permanently on these lists, and the regulations according to which admirals are
                    retired and reserved, under Mr Childers’ retirement scheme, see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Navy.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Admiral (the Lord High) of
                    England,</hi> an ancient officer of high rank in the state, who not only is
                    vested with the government of the navy, but who, long before any regular navy
                    existed in England, presided over a sovereign court, with authority to hear and
                    determine all causes relating to the sea, and to take cognizance of all offences
                    committed thereon</p>
                <p>The period about which this officer first makes his appearance in the governments
                    of European nations corroborates the supposition of the office having been
                    adopted in imitation of the Mediterranean powers at the return of the Christian
                    heroes from the Holy Wars. According to Moreri, Florent de Varenne, in the year
                    1270, was the first admiral known in France; but by the most approved writers of
                    that nation the title was unknown till, in 1284, Enguerand de Coussy was
                    constituted admiral. The first admiral by name that we know of in England was W.
                    de Leybourne, who was appointed to that office by Edward I. in the year 1286,
                    under the title of <hi rend="italic">Admiral de la mor du Roy d'
                    Angleterre.</hi> Mariana, in his <hi rend="italic">History of Spain,</hi> says
                    that Don Sancho, having resolved to make war on the barbarians (Moors), prepared
                    a great fleet; and as the Genoese were at that time very powerful by sea, and
                    experienced and dexterous sailors, he sent to Genoa to invite, with great
                    offers, Benito Zacharias into his service; that he accepted those offers, and
                    brought with him twelve ships; that the king named him his admiral (<hi
                    rend="italic">almirante</hi>), and conferred on him the office for a limited
                    time. This happened in the year 1284. Several Portuguese authors observe that
                    their office of <hi rend="italic">almirante</hi> was derived from the Genoese,
                    who had it from the Sicilians, and these from the Saracens; and it appears from
                    Souza’s <hi rend="italic">Historia Genealogica da Caza Real,</hi> that in 1322
                    Micer Manuel Piçagow was invited from Genoa into Portugal, and appointed to the
                    office of <hi rend="italic">almirante,</hi> with a salary of 3000 pounds <hi
                    rend="italic">{livras)</hi> a year, and certain lands, &amp;c., on condition
                    that he should furnish on his part twenty men of Genoa, all experienced in sea
                    affairs, and qualified to be <hi rend="italic">alcaidis</hi> (captains) and <hi
                    rend="italic">arraises</hi> (masters) of ships: all of which terms, <hi
                    rend="italic">almirante, alcaidi</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">arrais,</hi> are
                    obviously of Arabic derivation.</p>
                <p>Edward I., who began his reign in 1272, went to the Holy Land, and visited Sicily
                    on his return. He must therefore have had an opportunity of informing himself
                    concerning the military and naval science of the various countries bordering on
                    the Mediterranean—an opportunity which so able and warlike a prince would not
                    neglect, but whether the title and office of admiral existed in England before
                    his time, as some are inclined to think, or whether W. de Ley-bourne was first
                    created to that office in 1286, as before mentioned, we believe there is no
                    authentic record to enable us to decide. Supposing him, however, to be the
                    first, Edward may either have adopted the office and title from the Genoese, or
                    the Sicilians, or the Spaniards, or the French; or even had it directly from the
                    Saracens, against whom he had fought, and with whom he had afterwards much
                    amicable intercourse. It would seem, however, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n171/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0171-0156"/> that the office was in Edwards time to some
                    extent honorary; for that monarch, in 1307, orders the lord mayor of London, at
                    his peril and without delay, to provide a good ship, well equipped, to carry his
                    pavilions and tents; and in the same year another order is addressed to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Vicecomes Kantioe</hi> to provide for immediate passage across the
                    seas <hi rend="italic">tot et tales pontes et claias,</hi> as the constable of
                    Dover Castle should demand, without one word being mentioned of the admiral.
                    (Rymer, vol. iii. p. 32.) It is to be observed, however, that at this time the
                    royal fleets were made up of royal and private ships, and that the admiral would
                    not be charged with the transport of such things as those mentioned unless the
                    fleet was intended to co-operate with the land forces.</p>
                <p>From the 34th Edward II. we have a regular and uninterrupted succession of
                    admirals. In that year Edward Charles was appointed admiral of the north, from
                    the mouth of the river Thames northward, and Gervase Allard admiral of the west,
                    from the mouth of the Thames westward; and these two admirals of the north and
                    the west were continued down to the 34th Edward III., when Sir John de
                    Beauchamp, lord warden of the Cinque Ports, constable of the Tower of London and
                    of the Castle of Dover, was constituted <hi rend="italic">High Admiral of
                    England.</hi> Nine years afterwards the office was again divided into north and
                    west, and so continued until the 10th Richard II., when Richard, son of Alain,
                    Earl of Arundel, was appointed Admiral of England. Two years after this it was
                    again divided as before; and in the 15th year of the same reign, Edward, Earl of
                    Rutland and Cork, afterwards Duke of Albemarle, was constituted <hi
                    rend="italic">High Admiral of the North and West;</hi> and after him the Marquis
                    of Dorset and Earl of Somerset, son of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster. Percy,
                    Earl of Winchester, next succeeded to the same title, which once more was
                    dropped in the 2d of Henry IV., and divided as before. Sir Thomas Beaufort was
                    twice appointed by Henry IV. admiral of England; and on the accession of Henry
                    V. he was reappointed by letters patent dated 3d June 1413. In the 14th Henry
                    VI., John Holland, Duke of Exeter, was created admiral of England, Ireland, and
                    Aquitaine, for life; and in the third year of Edward VI., John Dudley, Earl of
                    Warwick, was constituted high admiral of England, Ireland, Wales, Calais,
                    Boulogne, the marches of the same, Normandy, Gascony, and Aquitaine, also
                    captain-general of the navy and seas of the king, &amp;c. In the 27th Elizabeth,
                    Charles, Lord Howard, had all the aforesaid titles, with the addition of
                    captain-general of the navy and seas of the said kingdoms.</p>
                <p>On the 20th November 1632 the office of high admiral was for the first time put
                    in commission, all the great officers of state being the commissioners. During
                    the Commonwealth a committee of Parliament managed the affairs of the Admiralty.
                    At the Restoration, in 1660, the Duke of York was constituted <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lord High Admiral of England.</hi> The commission was revoked in 1673, and King
                    Charles II. held the Admiralty in his own hands, and managed it by the great
                    officers of his privy council till 1684, when the Duke of York was re-instated.
                    Charles took this occasion of reserving for his own use all the droits and
                    perquisites claimed by the lord high admiral.</p>
                <p>Annexed is a list of lord high admirals and first lords of the Admiralty from the

                <p>Prince George of Denmark, when lord high admiral, having surrendered, by a formal
                    instrument, all the rights, profits, perquisites, and advantages whatsoever,
                    appertaining to the office, for the benefit and use of the public, with the
                    exception of the sum of £2500 a-year, to be disposed of in such manner and for
                    such particular uses as her Majesty, under her sign manual, should direct; and
                    the salary of the lord high admiral, which had hitherto been no more than 300
                    marks, was now fixed, by warrant under privy seal, at £7000 a-year. This sum, by
                    1st George IL, was divided equally among seven commissioners, an arrangement
                    which continued from that time, except that the pay of the commissioner who
                    stood first in the patent was made up from other funds to £3000 a-year, and in
                    the year 1806 was further increased to £5000 a-year. Since the surrender above
                    mentioned, all the <hi rend="italic">droits of admiralty,</hi> as they are
                    called, with all the fees, emoluments, and perquisites whatsoever, have been
                    taken from the admiral and applied to public purposes.</p>
                <p>These droits and perquisites are by no means inconsiderable. As enumerated in the
                    patent, they consist of flotsam, jetsam, ligan, treasure, deodands, derelicts,
                    found within the admiral’s jurisdiction; all goods picked up at sea; all fines,
                    forfeitures, ransoms, recognisances, and pecuniary punishments; all sturgeons,
                    whales, porpoises, dolphins, and <pb break="no"

                    large fishes; all ships and goods of the enemy coming into any creek, road, or
                    port, by stress of weather, mistake, or ignorance of the war; all ships seized
                    at sea, salvage, &amp;c., together with his shares of prizes; which shares were
                    afterwards called <hi rend="italic">tenths,</hi> in imitation probably of the
                    French, who gave their admiral, for supporting the dignity of his office, <hi
                    rend="italic">son droit</hi><hi rend="italic">de dixième.</hi> All prizes are
                    now wholly given up by the crown to the captors, and such share of the <hi
                    rend="italic">droits</hi> as from circumstances may be thought proper The lord
                    high admiral also claimed and enjoyed as his due the cast ships; and the
                    subordinate officers of the navy, as their perquisites, all other decayed and
                    unserviceable stores.</p>
                <p>Though by Act of 2 William and Mary, stat. 2, c. 2 (extended by the 1 Geo. IV. c.
                    90, and 7 and 8 Geo. IV. c. 65), the lords commissioners of the admiralty are
                    vested with all and singular authorities, jurisdictions, and powers which have
                    been and are vested, settled, and placed in the lord high admiral of England for
                    the time being, to all intents and purposes as if the said commissioners were
                    lord high admiral of England, yet there is this remarkable difference in the two
                    patents by which they are constituted, that the patent of the lord high admiral
                    mentions very little of the military part of his office, but chiefly details his
                    judicial duties as a magistrate; whilst, on the contrary, the patent to the
                    lords commissioners of the admiralty is very particular in directing them to
                    govern the affairs of the navy, and is almost wholly silent as to their judicial
                    powers.</p>
                <p>These powers, as set forth in the patent to the Earl of Pembroke in 1701, are,
                    the power to act by deputy; to take cognisance of all causes, civil and
                    maritime, within his jurisdiction; to arrest goods and persons; to preserve
                    public streams, ports, rivers, fresh waters, and creeks whatsoever within his
                    jurisdiction, as well for the preservation of the ships as of the fishes; to
                    reform too strait nets and unlawful engines, and punish offenders; to arrest
                    ships, mariners, pilots, masters, gunners, bombardiers, and any other persons
                    whatsoever able and fit for the service of the ships, as often as occasion shall
                    require, and wheresoever they shall be met with; to appoint vice-admirals,
                    judges, and other officers, <hi rend="italic">durante</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >beneplacito;</hi> to remove, suspend, or expel them, and put others in their
                    places, as he shall see occasion; to take cognisance of civil and maritime laws,
                    and of death, murder, and mayhem.</p>
                <p>It was by no means necessary that the lord high admiral should be a professional
                    man. Henry VIII. made his natural son, the Duke of Richmond, lord high admiral
                    of England when he was but six years old. When the high admiral, however, went
                    to sea in person, he had usually a commission under the great seal appointing
                    him admiral and captain-general of the fleet, sometimes with powers to confer
                    knighthood, and generally to punish with life and limb. Such a commission was
                    granted by Henry VIII. to Sir Edward Howard, who executed indenture with the
                    king to furnish 3000 men, 18 captains, 1750 soldiers, 1232 mariners and gunners;
                    his own pay to be 10s. and that of a captain 1s. 6d. a-day. The rest had 5s. per
                    mensem as wages, and 5s. for victuals each man, together with certain dead
                    shares.</p>
                <p>It appears, from Mr Pepys’ <hi rend="italic">Naval Collections,</hi> that the
                    lord high admiral did anciently wear, on solemn occasions, a gold whistle, set
                    with precious stones, hanging at the end of a gold chain.</p>
                <p>The salary of the first lord commissioner is £4500 a-year, and of each of the
                    naval lords £1500, in addition to the half-pay of their rank. The civil lord
                    gets £1000, and the parliamentary secretary £2000 a-year.</p>
                <p>The opening paragraph of the <hi rend="italic">Black Book of the Admiralty</hi>
                    has the following noteworthy instruction as regards the deputies and officers to
                    be chosen by the lord high admiral :—</p>
                <quote> “When one is made admirall, hee must first ordaine and substitute for his
                    lieutenants, deputies, and other officers under him, some of the most loyall,
                    wise, and discreete persons in the maritime law and auncient customes of the

                <p>Had this precept been always acted on, there would probably have been less
                    occasion than has presented itself for the many reorganisations which the
                    administration of the lord high admiral’s administrative office has undergone.
                    As it has been, the necessity for periodical changes has been urgent and
                    unavoidable. From the time of which Macaulay wrote, that the king (James II.)
                    was the only honest man in his dockyards, down to the present date, the need has
                    been incumbent on successive first lords and high admirals to lay the axe to the
                    root of a tree which, in some shape or other, has not ceased to bring forth evil
                    fruit. The soil favoured corruption, and no efficient means were employed to
                    prevent its growth. A root and branch reformation was urgently needed, though it
                    was not applied except in particular instances. Till the great French war of
                    1793-1815 led to the formation of a navy board of commissioners to superintend
                    the work and management of the dockyards; of a victualling board, to see to the
                    provisioning of the fleet; and of sick and hurt commissioners, to look after the
                    sick and wounded —the administrative departments of the navy were left to
                    nominees of the lord high admiral or first lord, the said nominees deriving “no
                    small advantage” from the arrangement. Under the departmental boards things
                    certainly improved from what they were in the time of Charles II.; but they fell
                    far short of what was desirable, and, by the vagueness of their administrative
                    principle, opened a door for irresponsible wrongdoing, which in the end made
                    them exceedingly bad instruments of government. These boards continued till
                    1832, when Sir James Graham, then first lord of the admiralty, introduced
                    sweeping changes. He abolished the several intangible boards which administered
                    under the shelter of the board of admiralty, and appointed in their stead five
                    principal officers of the navy, who were afterwards included in the admiralty
                    patent. These officers were—a surveyor or architect and constructor of the navy;
                    a storekeeper-general, charged with oversight and purchase of the material for
                    dockyards and ships; an accountant-general, charged with the duty of seeing that
                    all wages and cash paid were duly brought to account; a comptroller of
                    victualling and transport services, charged with the maintenance of the
                    victualling establishments of the navy, and of sufficient supplies of provisions
                    and clothing for the fleet, and with the oversight of the transport arrangements
                    for men and stores; and a physician of the navy, afterwards called medical
                    director-general, charged with the oversight of all hospitals and of all
                    sanitary arrangements of the navy. Each of these officers administered the
                    department entrusted to him in every particular, not only in respect of stock,
                    but of replenishment and account of stock. A lord of the admiralty was told off
                    to supervise the permanent head and to represent his department at the board.
                    These alterations were in many respects very beneficial. Altered circumstances
                    required some modification of the original scheme of duties; and the addition of
                    three principal officers—the director of works, the director of transports (who,
                    after the Crimean war, relieved the comptroller of victualling of his transport
                    duties), and the registrar of contracts. In 1860 the office of surveyor of the
                    navy was abolished, and that of controller of the navy, with larger powers over
                    dockyard management, was revived. In 1869, Mr Childers, first lord of the
                    admiralty, made changes which tended <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0173-0158"/> to subordinate the members of the board of
                    admiralty more effectually to the first lord, constituting him in effect
                    minister of marine; and to render departmental officers at once more
                    individually responsible and more intimate with the controlling members of the
                    board. He increased the power and functions of the controller of the navy,
                    giving him a seat at the board, and charging him with the stock-keeping
                    attributes of the storekeeper-general, whose purchasing functions were
                    transferred to a new officer—the superintendent of contracts, the head of the
                    contract and purchase department, and his accounting functions to the
                    accountant-general. The office of store-keeper-general was abolished. The office
                    of comptroller of victualling was also abolished—the storekeeping functions
                    being transferred to a new officer, the superintendent of victualling—the
                    purchasing function to the head of the purchase department, the accounts to the
                    accountant-general. The other officers remained; but in the case of each this
                    modification of business ensued, viz., that all stores whatever required by any
                    of them were to be obtained through the agency of one supply or purchase
                    department; that all accounts whatever were to be rendered to the
                    accountant-general. The departmental officers of the admiralty at the present
                    time (1874) are— the controller of the navy, without a seat at the board (who
                    has on his staff a chief naval architect, a chief engineer, a surveyor of
                    dockyards, a superintendent of naval stores, and a director of ordnance)—the
                    director-general of the medical department, the director of works, the director
                    of transports, the hydrographer, the superintendent of contracts, the
                    superintendent of victualling. The department of the two permanent secretaries
                    of the admiralty (one a naval officer, the other a civilian) undertakes the
                    conduct of all business relating to the <hi rend="italic">personnel</hi> of the
                    navy and the ordering of the fleets.</p>
                <p>To control the departmental officers, and to advise the responsible first lord,
                    there are the following members of the board of admiralty, viz., the
                    parliamentary or financial secretary, who has oversight of all business relating
                    to finance, estimates, expenditure, and accounts, and who is the <hi
                    rend="italic">alter ego</hi> of the first lord in Parliament; the first naval
                    lord, who, assisted by two other naval “lords,” takes oversight of the <hi
                    rend="italic">personnel</hi> and of all executive functions of the fleet; and a
                    civilian lord, who assists the financial secretary, and has particular oversight
                    also of naval civil establishments and of the works department.</p>

                <p>As regards the navies of foreign countries, their government is in the hands of
                    ministers or departments variously constituted. The Russian Admiralty is a
                    highly-organised bureau, divided into departments after the English manner, and
                    under the supreme control of a high admiral, usually a Grand Duke of the
                    Imperial House. The German Admiralty was, till 1872, a branch of the War Office,
                    though governed by a vice-admiral under a naval prince of the reigning family.
                    In 1872 it was severed from the War Office, though remaining an appanage
                    thereof, and a general of the army was placed at its head. The French minister
                    of marine, assisted by a permanent staff, controls the navy of France on a
                    highly centralised system of administration; but the departments are well
                    organised, and work well. The Italian fleet is governed on principles analogous
                    to the French, but with a large admixture of the English representative element.
                    The American navy is governed by a secretary of the navy, a cabinet minister, to
                    whom the departmental heads are responsible, and under whose orders they work.
