                <p><label type="entry">ABERCROMBIE, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label>, an
                    eminent physician of Edinburgh, was the son of the Rev. George Abercrombie of
                    Aberdeen, in which city he was born in 1781. After attending the Grammar School
                    and Marischal College, Aberdeen, he commenced his medical studies at Edinburgh
                    in 1800, and obtained his degree of M.D. there in 1803. Soon afterwards he went
                    to London, and for about a year gave diligent attention to the medical practice
                    and lectures in St George’s Hospital. In 1804 he returned to Edinburgh, became a
                    Fellow of the College of Surgeons, and commenced as general practitioner in that
                    city; where, in dispensary and private practice, he laid the foundation of that
                    character for sagacity as an observer of disease, and judgment in its treatment,
                    that eventually elevated him to the head of his profession. In 1823, be became a
                    Licentiate of the College of Physicians; in 1824, a Fellow of that body; and
                    from the death of Dr Gregory in 1822, he was considered the first physician in
                    Scotland. Abercrombie early began the laudable practice of preserving accurate
                    notes of the cases that fell under his care; and at a period when pathological
                    anatomy was far too little regarded by practitioners in this country, he had the
                    merit of sedulously pursuing it, and collecting a mass of most important
                    information regarding the changes produced by disease on different organs; so
                    that, before the year 1824, he had more extended experience, and more correct
                    views in this interesting field, than most of his contemporaries engaged in
                    extensive practice. From 1816 he occasionally enriched the pages of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal</hi> with essays, that
                    display originality and industry, particularly those “on the diseases of the
                    spinal cord and brain," and “on diseases of the intestinal canal, of the
                    pancreas, and spleen.” The first of these formed the basis of his great and very
                    original work, <hi rend="italic">Pathological and Practical Researches on
                    Diseases of the Brain and Spinal Cord,</hi> which appeared at Edinburgh in 1828.
                    In the same year he published also another very valuable work, his <hi
                    rend="italic">Researches on the Diseases of the Intestinal Canal, Liver, and
                    other Viscera of the Abdomen.</hi> Though his professional practice was very
                    extensive and lucrative, he found time for other speculations and occupations.
                    In 1830 he published his <hi rend="italic">Inquiries concerning the Intellectual
                    Powers of Man and the Investigation of Truth,</hi> a work which, though less
                    original and profound than his medical speculations, contains a popular view of
                    an interesting subject, expressed in simple language. It was followed in 1833 by
                    a sequel, <hi rend="italic">The Philosophy of the Moral Feelings,</hi> the
                    object of which, as stated in the preface, was “to divest the subject of all
                    improbable speculations,” and to show “the important relation which subsists
                    between the science of mind and the doctrines of revealed religion.” Both works
                    have been very extensively read, reaching the 18th and 14th editions
                    respectively in 1869. Soon after the publication of <hi rend="italic">Moral
                    Feelings,</hi> the University of Oxford conferred on the author the honorary
                    degree of Doctor of Medicine, and in 1835 he was elected Lord Rector of
                    Marischal College, Aberdeen. Dr Abercrombie was much beloved by his numerous
                    friends for the suavity and. kindness of his manners, and was universally
                    esteemed for his benevolence and unaffected piety. He died on the 14th of
                    November 1844 of a very uncommon disease, the bursting (from softening of the
                    muscular substance) of the coronary vessels of the heart.</p>
