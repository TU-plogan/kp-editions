                    rend="smallcaps">St Jean D’Acre,</hi> a town and seaport of Syria, and in
                    ancient times a celebrated city. No town has experienced greater changes from
                    political revolutions and the calamities of war. According to some this was the
                    <hi rend="italic">Accho</hi> of the Scriptures; and its great antiquity is
                    proved by fragments of houses that have been found, consisting of that highly
                    sun-burnt brick, with a mixture of cement and sand, which was only used in
                    erections of the remotest ages. It was known among the ancients by the name of
                    <hi rend="italic">Ace,</hi> but it is only from the period when it was taken
                    possession of by Ptolemy Soter, king of Egypt, and received from him the name of
                    <hi rend="italic">Ptolemais,</hi> that history gives any certain account of it.
                    When the empire of the Romans began to extend over Asia, Ptolemais came into
                    their possession. It is mentioned by Strabo as a city of great importance; and
                    fine granite and marble pillars, monuments of its ancient grandeur, are still to
                    be seen. During the Middle Ages Ptolemais passed into the hands of the Saracens.
                    They were expelled from it in 1110 by the Crusaders, who made it their principal
                    port, and retained it until 1187, when it was recovered by Saladin. In 1191 it
                    was retaken by Richard I. of England and Philip of France, who purchased this
                    conquest by the sacrifice of 100,000 troops. They gave the town to the knights
                    of St John of Jerusalem, from whom it received the name of St Jean D’Acre. In
                    their possession it remained for a century, though subject to continual assaults
                    from the Saracens. It was at this time a large and extensive city, populous and
                    wealthy, and contained numerous churches, convents, and hospitals, of which no
                    traces now remain. Acre was finally lost to the Crusaders in 1291, when it was
                    taken by the Saracens after a bloody siege, during which it suffered severely.
                    From this time its prosperity rapidly declined. In 1517 it fell into the hands
                    of the Turkish sultan, Selim I.; and in the beginning of the 18th century, with
                    the exception of the residences of the French factors, a mosque, and a few poor
                    cottages, it presented a vast scene of ruin. Towards the end of that century
                    Acre was much strengthened and improved by the Turks, particularly by Djezzar
                    Pacha, and again rose to some importance. It is memorable in modern history for
                    the gallantry with which it was defended in 1799 by the Turks, assisted by Sir
                    Sydney Smith, against Bonaparte, who, after spending sixty-one days before it,
                    was obliged to retreat. It continued to enjoy an increasing degree of prosperity
                    till 1832. Though fettered by imposts and monopolies, it carried on a
                    considerable foreign trade, and had resident consuls from most of the great
                    states of Europe. On the revolt of Mehemet Ali, the pacha of Egypt, Acre was
                    besieged by his son, Ibrahim Pacha, in the winter of 1831-32. The siege lasted
                    five months and twenty-one days, and, before the city was taken, its public and
                    private buildings were mostly destroyed. Its fortifications were subsequently
                    repaired and improved by the Egyptians, in whose hands it remained until 3d Nov.
                    1840, when the town was reduced to ruins by a three hours’ bombardment from the
                    British fleet, acting as the allies of the sultan. The Turks were again put in
                    possession of it in 1841.</p>
                <p>Acre is situated on a low promontory, at the northern extremity of the Bay of
                    Acre. The bay affords no shelter in bad weather; and the port is scarcely
                    capable of containing a dozen boats. Vessels coming to this coast, therefore,
                    generally frequent the anchorage of Caiffa, on the south side of the bay. Acre
                    is 80 miles N.N.W. of Jerusalem, and 27 S. of Tyre. Population, 10,000.</p>
