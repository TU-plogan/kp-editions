                <p><label type="entry">AIKIN, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label>, M.D.
                    (1747-1822), was born at Kibworth-Harcourt, received his elementary education at
                    the dissenting academy of Warrington, where his father was tutor, and prosecuted
                    his medical studies in the university of Edinburgh, and in London under the
                    celebrated Dr William Hunter. He commenced his professional career as a surgeon
                    at Chester; but being unsuccessful, he removed to Warrington. Finally, he went
                    to Leyden, took the degree of M.D. in that university (1780), and attempted to
                    establish himself as a physician in London. His success in this new field does
                    not seem to have been considerable; chiefly, no doubt, because he concerned
                    himself more with the advocacy of liberty of conscience than with his
                    professional duties. He therefore began at an early period to devote himself to
                    literary pursuits. Dr Aikin’s reputation chiefly rests on his endeavour to
                    popularise scientific inquiries. In conjunction with his sister, Mrs Barbauld,
                    he commenced the publication of a series of volumes on this principle, entitled
                    <hi rend="italic">Evenings at Home</hi> (6 vols., 1792-5), a popular and
                    interesting work, chiefly commendable for the purity of the principles it
                    inculcates, and the pleasing views it gives of human nature. It has been
                    translated into almost every European language. His love of nature, and his
                    power in delineating its features, are well illustrated in <hi rend="italic">The
                    Natural History of the Year,</hi> as well as in his miscellaneous <hi
                    rend="italic">Essays.</hi> In 1798 Dr Aikin retired from professional life, and
                    devoted himself with great industry to literary undertakings of numerous and
                    varied kinds, among which his valuable <hi rend="italic">Biographical
                    Dictionary</hi> (10 vols. 1799-1815) holds a conspicuous place. Besides these,
                    he published <hi rend="italic">Biog. Memoirs of Medicine</hi> (1780); <hi
                    rend="italic">Lives of John Selden and Archbishop Usher; Memoirs of Huet, Bishop
                    of Avranches; Geographical Delineations of All Nations,</hi> &amp;c. He edited
                    the <hi rend="italic">Monthly Magazine</hi> from 1796 to 1807, and. started the
                    <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi> in 1807. The latter was discontinued, however,
