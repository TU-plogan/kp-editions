DORCHESTER (the Durnovaria of the Romans), a parliamentary and municipal borough and market town of England, capital of the county of Dorset, situated on an eminence on the right bank of the Frome, 8 miles N. of Weymouth, and 120 miles from London by the old coach road, but some 20 miles farther by railway. It stands within a wide open tract of land, containing 3400 acres, held under the duchy of Cornwall, called Fordington Field. It is governed by a mayor, four aldermen, and twelve councillors, and returns one member to parliament. The population of the borough in 1871 was 6915; the area 635 acres. The town, consisting chiefly of three spacious streets, is neat and pleasantly situated, and is nearly surrounded by fine avenues. St Peter’s church is an ancient edifice in the Perpendicular style, containing some curious monuments. The grammar school has two exhibitions to St John’s College, Cambridge, and one to each university. Of the other public buildings the principal are—the town-hall, with market-house, shire-hall, county prison, and county hospital; there is also a small county museum, containing many local objects of much interest. The cavalry barracks in the vicinity may also be noticed. There are also several almshouses and other charities, and a savings-bank. Market-days, Wednesday and Saturday. The woollen manufacture of Dorchester was once considerable, and it was noted also for its ale, of which there are still some popular breweries. It is a place of considerable trade, and large sheep and lamb fairs are held there annually. The borough includes four parishes—All-Saints, St Peter’s, Holy Trinity, and Fordington. In the vicinity there are some interesting Roman remains, including an amphitheatre, the most perfect of its kind in England. The seats for the spectators are formed of masses of chalk, rising 30 feet above the arena. This amphitheatre when perfect is supposed to have been capable of accommodating 13,000 spectators. The camp called Poundbury, to the N.W. of the town, is probably Roman, and well worthy of examination. Durnovaria was one of the principal stations in England of the Romans, by whom it was surrounded with a wall and fosse, part of the former being still standing. Here Judge Jeffreys’s “bloody assize” was held in September 1685, when 292 prisoners were sentenced to death.
