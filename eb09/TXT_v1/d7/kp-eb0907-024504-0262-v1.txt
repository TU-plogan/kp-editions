DIOGENES (about 412-223 b.c.), the famous Cynic philosopher, was the son of Icesias, a money-changer of Sinope in Pontus. Having been detected in adulterating coin, his father and he were compelled to leave their native city. According to another account, however, Icesias died in prison, and Diogenes fled to Athens with a single attendant. On his arrival in that city he dismissed his attendant with the piquant question, “If Manes could live without Diogenes, why not Diogenes without him î” and on the same principle he denúded himself of all superfluous dress, furniture, and even ideas. A wooden bowl, which, with his cloak and wallet, formed his only movables, is said to have been immediately discarded when he saw a boy drinking water from the hollow of his hand. The fame of Antisthenes soon attracted him to Cynosarges, and the pertinacity with which, for the sake of wisdom, he not only endured the scoffs but Volunteered to submit to the blows of the great teacher, soon procured him a favourable reception from the whole Cynical school. The favourite pupil, however, soon outstripped his master in the extravagancies of his life, and the pungent keenness of his sarcasms. That he took up his abode in a cask belonging to the temple of Cybele is a circumstance liable to suspicion, from being more frequently alluded to by the satirists than by the biographers of Diogenes. That ho [9:7:246] used to inure himself to the vicissitudes of the weather by rolling himself in hot sand in summer, and in winter by embracing statues covered with snow, are facts resting on the authority of all the ancient historians. His numerous witty apophthegms are preserved by Diogenes Laertius. After his voyage to Aegina, during which he fell into the hands of pirates, who sold him as a slave in Crete, the conduct of Diogenes appears in a much less ridiculous light. With characteristic boldness he proclaimed to his captors that he knew no trade except “to govern men,” and wished to be sold “to a man that wanted a master.” Such a purchaser he seems to have found in Xeniades, who took him to Corinth to superintend the education of his children. There he spent the rest of his life; and he is said to have reached an extreme old age. There at the Isthmian games he taught the assembled concourse in the Kraneion; and thither he attracted a crowd of disciples when Antisthenes had ceased to tickle their ears in Cynosarges. There, too, in all probability, his famous interview with Alexander took place, in which the only favour he had to beg of the prince was that he would not stand between him and the sun,—when Alexander is said to have exclaimed, “If I were not Alexander, I would be Diogenes.” To Athens Diogenes seems never to have returned. Of his death, which is said to have taken place on the same day with that of Alexander the Great, there are various conflicting accounts. That he perished by the bite of a dog, or from the immoderate use of raw flesh, or by his own hand, is now generally disbelieved. It is more probable that his death was calm and peaceful; and in spite of his desire to be thrown to the beasts of the field, he received from Xeniades an honourable interment. In the days of Pausanias the Corinthians pointed with pride to his grave; and on the isthmus there was a pillar erected to his memory, on which, as the self-chosen symbol of his life, there rested a dog of Parian marble. His alleged connection with Lais, and the open indecencies of which he is said to have been guilty, have thrown a shade upon his character. The former is, however, it must be confessed, exceedingly improbable; and the latter charge was undoubtedly exaggerated, if it was not originated by the shameless excesses of the later Cynics. The Cynics answered arguments by facts. When some one was arguing in support of Zeno of Elea’s notion respecting the impossibility of movement, Diogenes rose and walked. Definitions might prove that there was no motion, but definitions were only verbal, and could be answered by facts. This appeal to common sense, the argumentum ad bacillum,, was of more value and importance in ethical than in speculative philosophy.
