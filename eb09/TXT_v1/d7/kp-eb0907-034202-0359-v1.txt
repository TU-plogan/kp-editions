DOL, a town of France, in the department of Ille-et-Vilaine, about 15 miles by rail from St Malo, on an eminence in the midst of a marshy plain, protected from the inroads of the sea by a dyke of the 12th century, which extends for a distance of 22 miles. A quiet, sombre, agricultural little place, with nothing more remarkable in its modern life than the corn-market which is held in the old Carmelite church of Notre-Dame-sous-Dol, it preserves, in the remains of its ramparts and its ditch, the memory of the time when it was one of the most important fortresses [9:7:343] on the frontier between Brittany and Normandy. The streets are still rendered picturesque by the dark houses of the 14th and 15th centuries, which form deep arcades by the projection of their upper stories; and, high above all, in spite of its five hundred years, rises the grey granite of the cathedral, which formerly ranked as the metropolitan church of all Brittany, and still keeps fresh the name of that old Bishop St Samson, who, having fled, as the legend tells, from the Saxon invaders of England, selected this spot as the site of his monastery. To the architect it is interesting for the English character of its design, and to the antiquarian for its stained glass windows of the 13th century, its tombs, and its carvings. The town was twice besieged by William the Conqueror, had thrice to defend itself during the wars of the League, and in 1793 witnessed the defeat of the republican forces by the Vendeans who had taken refuge within its walls. About a mile and a half from the town is the pierre du champ dolant, a menhir about 30 feet above the √ ground; not far off stands the great granite rock of Mont Dol, about 200 feet in height, and surmounted by the chapel of Notre Dame de l’Espérance; and about 10 miles to the south is the castle of Com-bourg where Chateaubriand spent his early days. Population in 1875, 3356.
