DOBSON, William (1610-1646), an English portrait and historical painter, born at London in 1610. His father was master of the Alienation Office, but by his improvidence had fallen into reduced circumstances. The son was accordingly bound an apprentice to Peak, a stationer and picture dealer in Holborn Bridge; and while in his employment he began to copy the pictures of Titian and Vandyck, whose manner he ever after retained. He also took portraits from life under the advice and instruction of Francis Cleyn, a German artist of considerable repute. Vandyck, happening to pass a shop in Snow Hill where one of Dobson’s pictures was exposed, sought out the artist, and presented him to Charles I., who took Dobson under his protection, and not only sat to him several times for his own portrait, but caused the prince of Wales, Prince Rupert, and many others, to do the same. The king had a high opinion of his artistic ability, styled him the English Tintoret, and appointed him sergeant-painter on the death of Vandyck. After the fall of Charles, Dobson was reduced to great poverty, and fell into dissolute habits.

He died at the early age of thirty-six. Excellent examples of Dobson’s portraits are to be seen at Blenheim, Chatsworth, and several other country seats throughout England. The head in the Decollation of St John the Baptist at Wilton is said to be a portrait of Prince Rupert
