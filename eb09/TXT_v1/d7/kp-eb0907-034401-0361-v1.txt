DOLE, a town of France, at the head of an arrondissement in the department of Jura, 28 miles N. of Lons-le-Saulnier, occupying the declivity of a hill on the right bank of the Doubs, which is there accompanied by the canal between the Rhone and the Rhine. It is the seat of a tribunal of primary instance, and has a Jesuit college, an agricultural society, a school of design, a theatre, a museum, and a public library of upwards of 40,000 volumes. The principal public buildings are the court-house, originally a Franciscan monastery dating from 1572; the church of Notre Dame, a Gothic structure of the 16th century; the Hôtel-Dieu, the prison, the barracks, two hospitals, and the ancient tower of Vergy. Among the manufactures of the town are straw hats, hosiery, chemicals, leather, and agricultural implements; and it carries on a good trade in agricultural produce, wood, iron, and marble. Dole is believed to have been a station on the Roman road from Lyons to the Rhine, and it still preserves what seem to be remains of an aqueduct, a bridge, and a theatre, of Roman construction From 1423 to 1481 it was the seat of a university; but there can have been but little study in the year 1479 when the town was taken by Louis XI., and so completely sacked that only Jean Vurry’s house, as it is still called, and other two buildings were left standing. It subsequently came into the hands of the Spaniards, aud in 1530 was fortified by Charles V. In 1636 it was able to hold out against the prince of Condé; but in 1668 and 1674 it was captured by the French, and on the latter occasion was deprived of its defences. Till Besançon was incorporated with the province, Dole ranked as the capital of Franche Comté, and was the seat of a parlement.
