DUVAL, Jules (1813-1870), a French economist, was born at Rodez, in the department of Aveyron, received his early education at the college of St Geniez d’Olt, passed as advocate at the age of twenty-three, and for eight years held an official position first at St Affrique and afterwards in his native town. On the pacification of Algeria he took an active part in the foundation of the Union Agricole d’Afrique; and in 1847 he established an agricultural colony in the plain of Siz. Obliged by ill health to abandon in 1850 the personal charge of the enterprise, he did not leave the country, but in 1852 became editor of the Echo T0raη, and from 1858 to 1861 acted as member and secretary of the general council of the province of Oran. Removing to Paris in the latter year, he there devoted himself to the literary exposition of his views; and among numerous other enterprises founded and edited till his death the Économiste Français, a weekly periodical devoted to the treatment of all matters connected with colonization and social reform, which bore his favourite device of 7t‰∙e et harmonique essor des farces. He was killed at Plessis-lès-Tours in a railway accident on the 20th of September 1870, while on his way to his native town.

Besides a series of contributions to the Journal des Debats and the Revue des Deux Mondes, he wrote Tableau de l’Algérie (1854), Les colonies et ΐ Algérie au concours général et national d'agriculture de Paris en 1860, Gheel ou ιιnecolonie d'aliénés (1860), Histoire de l'émigration europénne, asiatique, et africaine auXIX. siècle (1862,—- probably his masterpiece, and the work by which he gained the prize offered by the Académie des sciences morales in 1860), Les colonies et la politique coloniale de la France (1864), Des rapports entre la géographie et l'économie politiques (1864), Mémoire sur Ant. de Mont Chrétien, auteur du premier traité d'économie politique (1868), Notre Pays (1869), Notre planète (1869).
