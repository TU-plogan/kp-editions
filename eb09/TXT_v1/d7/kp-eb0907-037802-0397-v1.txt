DOUSA, Janus [Jan van dee Does] (1545-1604), a distinguished Dutch statesman, historian, poet, and philologist, the heroic defender of Leyden, was born at Noordwyck, in the province of Holland, December 6, 1545. Left an orphan at the age of five, he was brought up by his grandfather, after whose death an uncle took charge of him. He began his studies at Lier in Brabant, became a pupil of Henry Junius at Delft in 1560, and thence passed successively to Louvain, Douai, and Paris. Here he studied Greek under Peter Dorat, professor at the College Royal, and became acquainted with the Chancellor L’Hôpital, Turnebus, Ronsard, and other eminent men. On his return to Holland in 1565 he married. His name stands in the list of nobles who in that year formed a league against Philip IL; but he does not appear to have taken any active part in public affairs till 1572, when he was sent as head of an embassy to England. Two years later he was intrusted with the government and defence of Leyden, then besieged by the Spaniards; and in this arduous post he displayed rare intelligence, fortitude, and practical wisdom. On the foundation of the university of Leyden by William 1. of Orange, Dousa was appointed first curator, and this office he held for nearly thirty years. Through his friendships with foreign scholars he drew to Leyden many illustrious teachers and professors. After the assassination of William I. in 1584, Dousa came privately to England to seek the aid of Queen Elizabeth, and in the following year he was sent formally for the same purpose. About the same time he was appointed keeper of the Dutch archives, and the opportunities thus afforded him of literary and historical research he turned to good account. In 1591, being named a member of the States-General, he removed to the Hague. Heavy blows fell upon him in the deaths of his eldest son in 1597 and of his second son three years later. A bitterer trial still was the misconduct of another son. Dousa was author of several volumes of Latin verse and of philological notes on Horace, Catullus, Tibullus, Petronius Arbiter, and Plautus. But his principal work is the Annals of Holland, which first appeared in a metrical form in 1599, and was published in prose, under the title of Bataviae Hollandiaeque Annales, in 1601. This work had been begun by his eldest son. Dousa also took part, as editor or contributor, in various other publications. He died at Noordwyck, October 8, 1604, and was interred at the Hague; but no monument was erected to his memory until 1792, when one of his descendants placed a tomb in his honour in the church of Noordwyck.
