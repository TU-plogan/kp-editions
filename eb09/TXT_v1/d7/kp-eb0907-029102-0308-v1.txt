DITTON, Humphry (1675-1715), an eminent mathematician, was born at Salisbury, May 29, 1675. In compliance with the wishes of his father rather than by his own inclination he entered on the study of theology, and was for some years a dissenting minister at Tunbridge, where he married. On the death of his father, however, he was induced to relinquish the clerical profession; and at the persuasion of Whiston and Dr Harris he devoted himself to the more congenial study of mathematics. Through the influence of Sir Isaac Newton, he was elected mathematical master in Christ’s Hosnital, where he continued till his death in 1715.

Ditton was the author of the following treatises :— Of the Tangents of Curves, &c., Phil. Trans, vol. xxiii.; A Treatise on Spherical Catoptrics, published in the Phil. Trans, for 1705, from which it was copied and reprinted in the Acta Eruditorum, 1707, and also in the Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences at Paris; General Laws of Nature and Motion, 8vo, 1705, a work which is commended by Wolfius as illustrating and rendering easy the writings of Galileo and Huyghens, and the Principia of Newton; An Institution of Fluxions, containing the First Principles, Operations, and Applications of that admirable method, as invented by Sir Isaac Newton, 8vo, 1706. In 1709 he published the Synopsis Algcbraica of John Alexander, with many additions and corrections. In his Treatise on Perspective, published in 1712, he explained the mathematical principles of that art; and anticipated the method afterwards elaborated by Dr Brook Taylor. In 1714 Ditton published his Discourse on the Resurrection of Jesus Christ √ and The New Law of Fluids, or a Discourse concerning the Ascent of Liquids in exact Geometrical Figures, between two sιearly contiguous Surfaces. To this was annexed a tract to demonstrate the impossibility of thinking or perception being the result of any combination of the parts of matter and motion,—a subject much agitated about that time. There was also added an advertisement from him and "Whiston concerning a method for discovering the longitude, which it seems they had published about half a year before. Although the method had been approved by Sir Isaac Newton before being presented to the Board of Longitude, and successfully practised in finding the longitude between Paris and Vienna, the board determined against it. This disappointment, aggravated as it was by certain unquotable lines written by Dean Swift, affected Ditton's health to such a degree that he died in the following year
