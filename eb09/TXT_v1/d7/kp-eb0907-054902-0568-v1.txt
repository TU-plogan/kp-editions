DUPONT, Pierre (1821—1871), a French song-writer of great popularity, the son of a workman of Provins, was born at Lyons, hie mother’s native city, but brought up from childhood under the care of an elderly cousin who occupied the position of priest of Roche-Taillée-sur-Saône. From the seminary of Largentières, where his education was completed, he passed to the uncongenial drudgery of a lawyer’s and banker’s office; in 1839 found his way to Paris, and got some of his poems inserted in the Gazette de France and the Quotidienne ; and two years later was saved from the conscription and enabled to publish his first volume— Les deux Anges— through the exertions of a Provins kinsman and M. Lebrun. The prize founded by M. de Maillé La Tour-Landry was awarded to him in 1842, and he was employed for some time in connection with the Academy’s great dictionary. The thought of trying his fortune as a writer for the stage was taking shape in his mind, when in 1847 the success of his peasant song Pai deux grands boeufs dans mon étable opened up another prospect of fame; and from that date to his death he confined himself mainly, though not exclusively, to the cultivation of his lyrical faculty. Accompanied, as they often were, by airs of his own invention, many of his songs became in the widest sense popular, and were equally welcome in the workshop and the drawing-room. His sympathies were much less, however, with the drawing-room than the workshop; and in 1851 he paid the penalty of having become the poet laureate of the socialistic aspirations of the time by being condemned to seven years of exile from France. The sentence was cancelled, and the poet withdrew for a season from participation in politics. He died at Paris in 1871. His lyrical poems may very fairly be arranged according to his own classification—rustic and, as far as the writer is concerned, objective, legendary and subjective, patriotic and contemporaneous. They have appeared in various forms— Chants et Chansons, 3 vols., with music, 1852-54; Chants et Poésies, 7th edition, 1862; &c. Among the best known are Le braconnier, Le tisserand, La vache blanche, La chanson du blé, but many others might be mentioned of equal merit,—natural, bold, delicate, and piquant. Hix eclogues, 1864, Fin de la Pologne, 1847, La legende du juif errant, 1862, written to accompany Doré’s engravings, and Muse juvénile, 1859, are separate publications.

See Sainte-Beuve, Causeries du lundi, vol. iv., where ân interesting description is given of the style in which the author sung his own songs in the clubs and political meetings; Ch. Baudelaire, Notice sur Ρ. Dupont, 1849; Dechaut, Biographie de Pierre Dupont, 1871.
