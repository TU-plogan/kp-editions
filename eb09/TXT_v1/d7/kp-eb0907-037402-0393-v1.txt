DORTMUND, a town of Germany, capital of a circle of the same name, in the district of Arnsberg, and Prussian province of Westphalia, is situated on the Emscher, in 5Γ 3Γ 25" N. lat. and 7° 27' 9" E. long. Among the chief structures may be mentioned the large railway station, the workshop and factories of which give employment to upwards of 1000 hands, the Reinoldikirche, with a choir built in 1421-1450, the old Marienkirche, and the Gothic Dominican church. To the W. of the station is one of the ancient linden trees of the Königshof, where the meetings of the supreme court of the formidable Vehmgericht, or secret tribunal of the Middle Ages, were held. In the vicinity of Dortmund are collieries, in the working of which several thousands of persons are engaged. Since the discovery of iron-ore in the coal district, in 1850, many forges and blast-furnaces have been erected. The manufactures include tobacco, iron and steel, machinery, porcelain, earthenware, oil and flour, and woollen, linen, and cotton fabrics. In 1875 the town had 47 breweries, which furnished more than 6⅜ millions of gallons of beer. The population in 1875 was 57,742.

Dortmund, the Throtmanni, Trutmanna, Trutmonia, Tremonia, and Trotmunde of early history, was already a town of some importance in the year 800. In 1005 it was the scene of an ecclesiastical council, and in 1016 and 1180 of inq>erial diets. The town was walled in the 12th century, and in 1387-88 successfully withstood the troops of the archbishop of Cologne, who besieged it for 21 months. About the middle of the 13th century it joined the Hanseatic League. At the close of the Thirty Years’ War the population had become reduced to 3000. In 1803 Dortmund lost its rights as a free town, and was annexed to Nassau. The French occupied it in 1806, and in 1808 it was made over by Napoleon to the grand duke of Berg, and became the chief town of the department of Ruhr. Through 'the cession of Westphalia by the king of the Netherlands, May 31, 1815, it became a Prussian town.
