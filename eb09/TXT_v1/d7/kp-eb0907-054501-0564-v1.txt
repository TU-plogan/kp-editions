DUNOON, a town in Argyllshire, Scotland, situated on the Firth of Clyde, about nine miles west from Greenock, and on the opposite shore. Of recent growth (having been about the beginning of this century a mere fishing hamlet), it is now one of the most extensive and prosperous watering-places on the shores of the Clyde, a condition for which it is much indebted to the late James Ewing of Strathleven, who first drew attention to its capabilities as an agreeable summer residence. On account of the mildness of the climate that prevails, and the amenity of the situation, it was selected as the site of a convalescent home, which has proved a boon to many of the hard-wrought population of Glasgow and its neighbourhood. On a conical hill close above the main pier stand the fragments of Dunoon Castle, the hereditary keepership of which was conferred by Robert Bruce on the family of Sir Colin Campbell of Loch Awe, an ancestor of the duke of Argyll. Near the hillock is the modern castle of Dunoon. Including the suburb of Kirn, the population at the census of 1871 was 3750.
