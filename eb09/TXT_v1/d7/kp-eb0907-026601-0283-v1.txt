DISTRESS is one of the few cases in which the law still permits an injured person to take his remedy into his own hands. Other instances mentioned in the text-books are self-defence in the case of a personal assault, the reseizure of property wrongfully taken away, the abatement of nuisances, &c. Distress differs from these as being a remedy for what is really a breach of contract, and it is the only case of the kind in which such a remedy is given. It is the right which the landlord has of seizing the personal chattels of his tenant for non-payment of rent. Cattle damage feasant (doing damage or trespassing upon a neighbour’s land) may also be distrained, i.e., may be detained until satisfaction be rendered for the injury they have done. The cattle or other animals thus distrained are a mere pledge in the hands of the injured person, who has only power to retain them until the owner appear to make satisfaction for the mischief they have done. Distress for rent was also at one time regarded as a mere pledge or security; but the remedy, having been found to be speedy and efficacious, was rendered more perfect by enactments allowing the thing taken to be sold. Blackstone notes that the law of distresses in this respect “has been greatly altered within a few years last past.” The legislature, in fact, converted an ancient right of personal redress into a powerful remedy for the exclusive benefit of a single class of creditors, viz., landlords. Now that the relation of landlord and tenant in England has come to be regarded as purely a matter of contract, the language of the law-books seems to be singularly inappropriate. The defaulting tenant is a “wrong-doer,” the landlord is the “injured party ;” any attempt to defeat the landlord’s remedy by carrying off distrainable goods is denounced as “fraudulent and knavish.” The operation of the law has, as we shall point out, been mitigated in one important respect by a recent Act, but it still remains an almost unique specimen of one-sided legislation.

At common law distress was said to be incident to rent service, and by particular reservation to rent charges; but by 4 Geo. II. c. 28 it was extended to rent seek, rents of assize, and chief rents (see Rent.) It is therefore a general remedy for rent certain in arrear. All personal chattels are distrainable with the following exceptions :—1, things in which there can be no property, as animals ferae naturae; 2, things in actual use; 3, things delivered to a person following a public trade, as a horse sent to be shoed, &c.; 4, things already in the custody of the law; 5, money, unless placed in a sealed bag; 6, things which cannot be restored in as good a plight as when distrained; 7, fixtures; 8, beasts of the plough and instruments of husbandry; 9, instruments of a man’s trade or profession. These exceptions, it will be seen, imply that the thing distrained is to be held as a pledge merely—not to be sold. They also imply that in general any chattels found on the land in question are to be available for the benefit of the landlord, whether they belong to the tenant or not. This principle worked with peculiar harshness in the case of lodgers, whose goods might be seized and sold for the payment of the rent due by their landlord to his superior landlord. Now, however, by the Lodgers’ Goods Protection Act (34 and 35 Vict. c. 79), where a lodger’s goods have been seized by the superior landlord the lodger may serve him with a notice stating that the intermediate landlord has no interest in the property seized, but that it is the property or in the lawful possession of the lodger, and setting forth the amount of the rent due by the lodger to his immediate landlord. On payment or tender of such rent the landlord cannot proceed with the distress against the goods in question. And originally the landlord could only seize things actually on the premises,, so that the remedy might be defeated by the things being taken away. But by 9 Anne c. 14, and 11 Geo. II. c. 19, he may follow things fraudulently or clandestinely removed off the premises within thirty days after their removal, unless they have been in the meantime bona fide sold for a valuable consideration.

The sixth exception mentioned above was held to extend to sheaves of corn; but by 2 Will, and Mary c. 5, com, when reaped, as well as hay, was made subject to distress.

Excessive or disproportionate distress exposes the distrainer to an action, and any irregularity formerly made the proceedings void ab initio, so that the remedy was attended with considerable risk. The statute 11 Geo. II. c. 19, before alluded to, in the interests of landlords, protected distresses for rent from the consequences of irregularity. In all cases of distress for rent, if the owner do not within five days replevy the same with sufficient security, the thing distrained may be sold towards satisfaction of the rent and charges, and the surplus, if any, must be returned to the owner. To “replevy” is when the person distrained upon applies to the proper authority (the registrar of the county court) to have the thing returned to his own possession, on giving security to try the right of taking it in an action of replevin.

Duties and penalties imposed by Act of Parliament are sometimes enforced by distress.
