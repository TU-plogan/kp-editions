+=====================================================================+


DION, of Syracuse (408-353 b.c.), was the son of Hipparinus, and brother-in-law of Dionysius the Elder. In his youth he was an ardent admirer and diligent pupil of Plato, whom Dionysius had invited to Syracuse; and he used every effort to promote the carrying out of his master’s maxims in the administration of the kingdom. His near relationship to the despot gave him great influence at court, and also enabled him to amass considerable wealth. Accordingly, on the accession of the younger Dionysius, the stern morality of the philosopher stood in marked contrast to the dissolute character of the prince. An antagonism thus silently sprung up between the two; and the proposal of Dion to invite Plato again to Syracuse was made the occasion of an open rupture. To counteract the influence of that distinguished philosopher, the enemies of Dion obtained the recall of the historian Philistus, vho had already signalized himself as a faithful supporter of despotic power. This artful courtier quickly regained his ascendency over the mind of Dionysius, and was at length successful in procuring the banishment of Dion. The exiled philosopher retired to Athens, where he was at first permitted to enjoy his revenues in peace; but the intercessions of Plato served to exasperate the tyrant, and at length provoked him to confiscate the property of Dion, and give his wife to another. This last outrage roused Dion to seek the liberation of his country by force of arms. Assembling a small force at Zacynthus, he sailed to Sicily, and, in the absence of Dionysius, was received with demonstrations of joy. He succeeded in defeating the forces of the tyrant, but was himself soon after supplanted by the intrigues of Heraclides. Again he was banished; but the incompetency of the new leader soon led to his recall. He had, however, scarcely made himself master of Sicily when the people began to express their discontent with his tyrannical conduct, and he was assassinated by Caliphus, an Athenian who had accompanied him in his expedition.
