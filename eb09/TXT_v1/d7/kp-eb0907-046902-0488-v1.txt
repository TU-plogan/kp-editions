DREW, Samuel (1765-1833), theologian, was bom in the parish of St Austell, in Cornwall, March 3, 1765. His [9:7:470] father was a poor farm-labourer, and could not afford to send him to school long enough even to learn to read and write. At the age of seven he lost his mother, a woman of superior mind and religious character; and he was then sent to work with the tinners. At ten he was apprenticed to a shoemaker, and at twenty he settled in the town of St Austell, first as manager for a shoemaker; and about three years later he began business on his own account. He had already gained a reputation in his narrow circle as a keen debater and a jovial companion. He was first aroused to serious thought by the preaching of Adam Clarke; and the impression thus produced was deepened by the death of his elder brother. He now joined the Methodists, was soon employed as a class leader and local preacher, and continued to preach till a few months before his death. His opportunities of gaining knowledge were very scanty, but he strenuously set himself to make the most of them. It is stated that an accidental introduction to Locke’s great essay determined the ultimate direction of his studies. In 1798 the first part of Paine’s Age of Reason was put into his hands; and in the following year he made his first appearance as an author by publishing his Remarks on that work. The book was favourably received, and was republished in 1820. Drew had begun to meditate a greater attempt before he wrote his Remarks on Paine; and the fruits of his laborious investigation were given to the world in the Essay on the Immateriality and Immortality of the Soul, in 180'2. This work made him widely known, and for some time it held a high place in the judgment of the religious world as a powerful and conclusive argument on its subject. A fifth edition appeared in 1831. Drew continued to work at his trade till 1805, when he entered into an engagement which enabled him to devote himself entirely to literature. In 1809 he published his Essay on the Identity and General Resurrection of the Human Body, perhaps the most original of his works, which reached a second edition in 1822. In 1819 Drew removed to Liverpool, on being appointed editor of the Imperial Magazine, then newly established, and in 1821 to London, the business being then transferred to the capital. Here he filled the post of editor till his death, and had also the supervision of all works issued from the Caxton press. He was an unsuccessful competitor for a prize offered in 1811 for an essay on the existence and attributes of God. The work which he then wrote, and which in his own judgment was his best, was published in 1820, under the title of An Attempt to demonstrate from Reason and Revelation the Necessary Existence, Essential Perfections, and Superintending Providence of an Eternal Being, who is the Creator, the Supporter, and the Governor of all Things (2 vols. 8vo). This procured him the degree of M. A. from the university of Aberdeen. Among Drew’s lesser writings are a Life of Dr Thomas Coke (1817), a History of Cornwall (1824), and a work on the divinity of Christ (1813). He died at Helston, in Cornwall, March 29, 1833. A memoir of his life by his eldest son appeared in 1834.
