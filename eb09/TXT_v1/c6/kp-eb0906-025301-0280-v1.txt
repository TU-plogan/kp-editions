CONDOM, a town of France, at the head of an arrondissement, in the department of Gers, 26 miles from Auch, on the Bayse, a tributary of the Garonne, there crossed by two stone bridges. The church of St Peter, formerly a cathedral, is included among the historic monu ments of France, and deserves notice for the height of its vaulted roof. The manufactures of the town include woollen fabrics and porcelain; and its trade is mainly in rural produce and brandy. The nucleus of the place was furnished by an abbey, founded in the lθth century; in 1317 it was made a bishopric by Pope John XXII., and in 1549 the monks were appointed canons of the cathedral. In the 18th century it was the centre of a district called Condomois, which contained the towns of Nerac, Gabaret, and Mont de Marsan; and it possessed three convents and two nunneries. Among its celebrities are Dupleix the historian, and Montluc the leader of the crusade against the Albigensians. Bossuet was bishop of Condom in 1669. Population in 1872, 5205.
