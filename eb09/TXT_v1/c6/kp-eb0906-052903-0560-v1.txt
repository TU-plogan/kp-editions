COUTTS, Thomas, an eminent banker, head of the London house of Coutts & Co., was born probably about 1731. He was the fourth son of John Coutts, who carried on business at Edinburgh as a corn factor and negotiator of bills of exchange, and who in 1742 was elected lord provost of the city. The family w as originally of Montrose, but one of its members had settled at Edinburgh about or before 1696. Soon after the death of John Coutts, the exprovost, the business was divided into two branches, one carried on at Edinburgh, the other in London. The London branch was in the hands of Patrick and Thomas Coutts, the eldest and the youngest sons of John Coutts. From the death of his brother in 1788, Thomas, as surviving partner, became sole head of the firm; and under his direction the banking house rose to the highest distinction. His ambition was to establish his character as a man of business and to make a fortune; and he lived to succeed in this aim and long to enjoy his reputation and wealth. A gentleman in manners, hospitable and benevolent, he counted amongst his friends some of the literary men and the best actors of his day. Of the enormous wealth wshich came into his hands he made munificent use. His private life was not without its romantic elements. Soon after his settlement in London he married Elizabeth Starkey, a young woman of humble origin, who was in attendance on the daughter of his brother James. They lived happily together, and had three daughters,—Susan, married in 1796 to the third earl of Guildford; Frances, married in 1800 to the first marquis of Bute; and Sophia, married in 1793 to Sir Francis Burdett, Baronet. Mrs Coutts dying in 1815, her husband soon after married the popular actress, Harriet Mellon; and to her he left the whole of his immense fortune. He died in London, February 24 i 1822. His widow married in 1827 the duke of St Albans, and died ten years later, having bequeathed her property to Angela, youngest daughter of Sir Francis Burdett, who then assumed the additional name and arms of Coutts. She was created Baroness Burdett-Coutts in 1871.
