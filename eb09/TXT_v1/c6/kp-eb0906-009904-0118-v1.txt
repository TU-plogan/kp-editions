COCKERELL, CharlesRobert (1788-1863), architect, was born in London. After a severe preliminary training in his profession, he visited and studied the great architectural remains of Greece, Italy, and Asia Minor. At Aegina, Phigalia, and other places of interest, he conducted excavations on a large scale, enriching the British Museum with many fine fragments, and adding several valuable monographs to the . literature of archaeology, the best of which is said to be that on the mausoleum of Halicarnassus. Elected in 1829 an associate of the Royal Academy, he became a member in 1836, and in 1839 he was appointed professor of architecture, his lectures in which capacity were so greatly esteemed as to be attended by all the students of the several arts professed within the school. On the death in 1837 of Soane, the distinguished architect of the Bank of England, Cockerell was appointed Lis successor, and successfully carried out the alterations that have been needed in that building. In addition to branch banks at Liverpool and Manchester he erected in 1840 the New Library at Cambridge, and in 1845 the university galleries at Oxford, the last one of the architect’s least happy efforts, as well as the Sun and the Westminster Fire Offices in Bartholomew Lane and in the Strand; and Tite and he were joint architects of the London and Westminster Bank. On the death of Henry Lonsdale Elmes in 1847, Cockerell was selected to finish the St George’s Hall, Liverpool, a task which he executed with great success. Cockerell’s best conceptions were those inspired by classic models; his essays in the Gothic—the college at Lampeter, for instance, and the chapel at Harrow—are by no means so successful. Among his numerous publications, however, may be mentioned those On the Iconography of Wells Cathedral, and On the Sculptures of Lincoln and Exeter Cathedrals, which prove his thorough knowledge of Gothic art as well as of Greek. His Tribute to the Memory of Sir Christopher Wren (1838) is a collection of the whole of Wren’s works drawn to the same scale.
