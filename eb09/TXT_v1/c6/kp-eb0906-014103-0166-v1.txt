COLLAERT, Hans, a Flemιsn engraver, was the son of Adrian Collaert, a draughtsman and engraver of repute, and was born at Antwerp about 1545. After working some years in his father’s studio, he went to Rome to perfect himself in his art. His engravings after Rubens are very highly esteemed. He left many works; among the best may be mentioned a Life of Saint Francis, 16 prints; a Last Judgment, folio; Monilium, Bullarum, Inauriumque Artificiosissimae Icones, 10 prints, 1581; The Dead Christ in his Mother’s Lap; Marcus Curtius; Aloses Striking the Rock, and The Resurrection of Lazarus, after Lambert Lombard; the Fathers of the Desert; and Biblia Sacra and the History of the Church, after Rubens.
