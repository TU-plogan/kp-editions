COQUEREL, Aγhanase Josuè (1820-1875), son of A. L. C. Coquerel, noticed below, a minister of the French Protestant Church, was born at Amsterdam in 1820. At an early age he succeeded his father as editor of Le Lien, and he held this post till 1852. In that year he took part in establishing the Nouvelle Revue de Théologie, which had the distinction of being the first periodical organ of scientific theology published in France. Meanwhile he had gained a high reputation as an eloquent and earnest preacher, and especially as the advocate of religious freedom in opposition to the imposition of tests. Advancing beyond his father’s [9:6:368] doctrinal position, his teaching became more and more offensive to the old orthodox party; and on the appearance (1864) of his article on Renan’s Vie de Jésus in the Nouvelle Revue de Théologie, the storm of suspicion and dislike which had long been gathering burst on his head, and he was forbidden by the Paris Consistory to continue his ministerial functions. He received an address of regretful sympathy from the consistory of Anduze, and a provision was voted for him by the Protestant Liberal Union, to enable him to continue his preaching. This he did with much earnestness and success till within a few weeks of his death. Coquerel received the cross of the Legion of Honour in 1862. He died at Paris, July 25, 1875.

CoquereΓs principal writings are — Jean Calas et sa famille (1858); Des Beaux-Arts en Italie, (of which an English translation was published in 1859); La Saint Barthélemy (1860); Précis de s' église réformée (1862); Le Catholicisme et le Protestantisme con-lidérée dans leur origine et leur développement (1864); Libres études, and La conscience et la foi (1867).
