CORSSEN, Wilhelm Paul (1820-1875), a distinguished German philologist, was born at Bremen, January 20, 1820, and received bis school education in the Prussian town of Schwedt, to which his father, a merchant, had removed. After spending some time at the Joachimsthal Gymnasium in Berlin, where his interest in philological pursuits was awakened by the Rector Meinike, he proceeded to the university, and there came especially under the influence of Boeckh and Lachmann. His first important appearance in literature was as the author of Origines Poesis Romance, by which he had obtained the prize offered by the “philosophical” or “arts” faculty of the university. In 1846 he was called from Stettin, where he had for nearly two years held a post in the gymnasium, to occupy the position of lecturer in the royal academy at Pforta (near Naumburg), and there he continued to labour for the next twenty years. The philosophico-historical class of the Royal Prussian Academy of Sciences having, in 1854, offered a prize for the best work on the pronunciation and accent of Latin, he gained the day by means of a treatise which at once took rank, on its publication under the title of Ueber Aussprache, Vokalismus, und Betonung der Lateinischen Sprache (2 vols. Leipsic, 1858-59), as one of the most erudite and masterly works in its department. This was followed in 1863 by his Kritische Beiträge zur Lat. Formenlehre, which were supplemented in 1866 by Kritische Nachträge zur Lat. Formenlehre. In the discus sion of the pronunciation of Latin he was naturally led to consider the various old Italian dialects, and the results of his investigations appeared in miscellaneous communications to Kuhn’s Zeitschrift für vergleichende Schriftforschung. The state of his health obliged him to give up his professorship at Pforta, and return to Berlin, in 1866; but it produced almost no diminution of his literary activity. In 1867 he published an elaborate archaeological study entitled the Alterthümer und Kunstdenkmale des C ister denser-klosters St Marien und der Landesschule Pforta, in which he gathers together all that can be discovered about the history of the establishment where he had taught so long; and in 1868-69 he brought out a new edition of his work on Latin pronunciation. From a very early period he had been attracted to the special study of Etruscan remains, and had at various times given occasional expression to his opinions on individual points; but it was not till 1870 that he had the opportunity of visiting Italy and completing his equipment for a formal treatment of the whole subject by personal inspection of the monuments. In 1874 appeared the first volume of Ueber die Sprache der Etrusker, in which with great ingenuity and erudition he endeavours, it cannot be said with complete success, to prove that the Etruscan language was cognate with that of the Romans. Before the second volume had received the last touches of his hand he was cut off by a comparatively early death, which had in all probability been hastened by those long hours which he had spent in “damp grave-chambers,” painfully deciphering by candle-light the faded and fragmentary inscriptions of forgotten days. Whatever may be the ultimate decision of criticism on the great question at issue, [9:6:441] and however unfortunate his conjectures may be proved by later investigators, it cannot be denied that he has brought the matter one step nearer to a final conclusion. The posthumous volume appeared in 1875, having been edited by E. W. A. Kuhn.
