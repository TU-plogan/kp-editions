CRICHTON. James (1560-1582), commonly called “the Admirable Crichton,” was the son of Robert Crichton, lord-advocate of Scotland in the reign of James VI., and was born at Eliock, in Dumfriesshire. He was sent when ten years old to Saint Salvator’s College, St Andrews, where he took his master’s degree at fifteen. In 1577 he was still living in Scotland; some time after that date, however, a quarrel with his father, who had become a Protestant, drove him to France. In Paris his dialectics and his sword-play are said to have gained him equal admiration; and, according to Urquhart’s very doubtful story, a contest in twelve languages resulted in an easy victory over the whole staff of the Sorbonne. His Parisian triumphs were followed by a couple of years of obscure campaigning in the French army, but in 1580 he appeared at Venice. A Latin poem addressed to Aldus Manutius laid the foundation of a lasting friendship with the great printer, who dedicated his edition of Cicero’s Paradoxa to Crichton, and, according to some, conferred on him still more substantial favours; he also became intimate with Sperone Speroni, and with Lorenzo Massa and Giovanni Donati. His first public display was the delivery of an address to the doge and senate, whom he astonished with his eloquence and oratorical grace; and he followed this up with a series of disputations on mathematical, theological, and philosophical subjects, which so extended his fame that it was reckoned the highest honour to Mazzoni, a famous dialectician, thrice to have met and vanquished him in argument. But these exertions produced an illness which held him prostrate for four months. At Padua, the scene of his next exhibition, he astonished the assembled professors by extemporizing in succession a Latin poem, a daring onslaught on certain Aristotelian errors, and an impassioned oration in praise of ignorance. His return to Venice was signalized by the publication of the challenge preserved by Aldus Manutius, in which he undertook not only to refute innumerable errors in Aristotelians, mathematicians, and schoolmen, but to meet his opponents on any ground, and to conduct the dispute either logically, or according to the secret doctrine of numbers, or in a hundred sorts of verse; and in the church of San Paolo and San Giovanni the young Scotsman held his own for three days against all comers. He then seems to have quitted the republic for Mantua, where he had been appointed tutor to Vincenzo Gonzaga, heir to the dukedom. There he distinguished himself, according to Urquhart, by killing a professional duellist, who had challenged and vanquished many of the best swordsmen of Italy, and by playing before the court some fifteen characters in succession, keeping the stage for five hours. His brilliance made men envious, and he is said to have supplanted the prince in the affections of his mistress. One July evening in 1582 he was attacked by three masquers in the streets of Mantua. But he fought so well that their leader to save his life was forced to discover himself. It [9:6:578] was Vincenzo Gonzaga himself. The tutor fell on his knee, and presenting his sword, asked pardon; but the prince basely ran him through the body.
