COUNT, COUNTESS (Latin, Comes, Comitissa). In the peerage of Great Britain and Ireland the Continental title count, in its highest and most dignified acceptation, is represented by earl,—an earl’s wife, however, being styled countess. In the times of the Roman commonwealth, personages of different degrees of rank, who in various capacities officially accompanied the proconsuls and proprietors into the provinces, bore the common designation of comites, either a comitando or a commeando. At a later period, the comites, as personal companions and counsellors of the prince, whose name they always added to the title of their office, became lords of the palace, whence the origin of their style as counts j)alatine. At a considerably later era, this same title implied princely rank, dignity, and power enjoyed by the bearer under a supreme imperial sovereign. By Constantine the title comes was first established as a definite dignity; but this same title, within a short time after its first formal establishment, was conferred indiscriminately upon various classes of public officers, of whom a long list, specifying the capacity in which each one served, is given by Du Cange. After the fall of the Roman empire the governors of provinces and cities who commanded in war and during peace presided over the administration of the laws retained the titles of duces and comites (dukes and counts); occasionally also the distinction between these titles failed to be observed, and some counts became governors of provinces. Under the last king of the second royal dynasty of France, the dignity of the counts of the highest rank was rendered hereditary, when they even aspired to independent sovereignty. From the inability of Hugh Capet to maintain the supremacy of the Crown against their encroachments, these great peers assigned to his reign their first assumption of coronets with their arms, to denote their enjoyment of sovereign power in their particular counties or territories. In after times, the dignity of count, hereditary in the male line, was granted by a sovereign upon his erecting a territory into a county, with a reserve of sovereignty and jurisdiction to the Crown, and also with reversion to the Crown in default of heirs male. At the present day, from the custom of styling all the sons of a count also counts, the titular bearers of this designation on the Continent are very numerous, while their rank is little more than nominal. In Germany the equivalent for count is Graf, and the several orders of these German counts are distinguished by the formation of compound titles, as “landgraves,” “palsgraves,” Ac. See Earl.
