COCKBURN, Mrs Alison (1712-1794), justly celebrated for having written one of the most exquisite of Scottish ballads, the “Flowers of the Forest,”^[1. There are two versions of this song,—the one by Mrs Cockburn, the other by Miss Jean Elliot of Minto. Both were founded on the remains of an ancient Border ballad. It is believed by the descendants of her family that Mrs Cockburn composed her version—that beginning “I’ve seen the smiling of fortune beguiling”—before her marriage in 1’31. Anyhow, it was composed many years before Jean Elliot’s sister verses, beginning, “I’ve heard them lilting at our ewe-milking.” These were written in 1756, and printed soon afterwards. Mrs Cockburn’s song, however, was not published until 1765, when Jean Elliot's was already popular.] w as the daughter of a border laird, Robert Rutherfurd of Fairnalee, and was bom in the heart of the Southern Highlands in the autumn of 1712. Her education was slight. She spent her youth in rambling and riding about the countryside, and in paying visits to an aged minister iu the neighbourhood, of whose “heavenly affection” for her she wrote enthusiastically in after years. She was a graceful dancer, spent two winter seasons in Edinburgh, and was one of the Edinburgh belles of her time. Different causes have been assigned for the composition of the “Flowers of the Forest.” Mr Chambers states that it was written on the occasion of a great commercial disaster which ruined the fortunes of some Selkirkshire lairds. Her later biographers, however, think it more probable that it was written on the departure to London of a certain John Aikman, between whom and Alison there appears to have been an early attachment. In 1731 Alison Rutherfurd was married to Patrick Cockburn of Ormiston, one of a family of stanch Whigs and Presbyterians, and an advocate at the Scottish bar. After her marriage she knew all the intellectual and aristocratic celebrities of her day. In the memorable year 1745 she vented herWhiggism in a squib upon Prince Charlie, and narrowly escaped being taken by the Highland guard as she was driving through Edinburgh in the family coach of the Keiths of Ravelston, with the parody in her pocket Mrs Cockburn was an indefatigable letter-writer and a composer of parodies, squibs, toasts, and “character-sketches”·—then a favourite form of composition—like other wits of her day; but the “Flowers of the Forest” is the only thing she wrote that possesses great literary merit. She survived her husband forty-one years, living to the age of eighty-two, and to the last she maintained her social popularity. At her house on Castle-hill, and afterwards in Crighton Street, she received many illustrious friends, among whom were Mackenzie, Robertson, Hume, Home, Monboddo, the Keiths of Ravelston, the Balcarres family, and Lady Anne Barnard, the authoress of “Auld Robin Gray.” She was in Edinburgh when Dr Johnson visited that city, towed thither by the triomphant Boswell. She saw and commented upon Burns’s short, bright Edinburgh career. As a Rπtherfurd she w as a connection of Sir Walter Scott’s mother, and was her intimate [9:6:99] friend. Lockhart quotes an interesting letter written by Mrs Cockburn in 1777, describing the precocious conduct of little Walter Scott, then scarcely six years old, during a visit which she paid to his mother. It was Mrs Cockburn also who wrote the character-sketch of Scott’s father, which, when it was given as a toast, was so true as to be immediately recognized. Scott himself spent pleasant evenings at Mrs Cockburn’s house when she was a very old lady and he a young advocate. Mrs Cockburn died in 1794, having survived her only child, Captain Adam Cockburn, fourteen years.
