CONSTABLE, in England, an ancient officer of the peace. The name, as well as the office, are, according to Blackstone, borrowed from the French. In the Middle Ages there was a great officer of this name, whose duties related to matters of chivalry. “The office of Lord High Constable,” says Blackstone, “hath been disused in England, except only upon great and solemn occasions—as the king’s coronation and the like—ever since the attainder of Stafford, duke of Buckingham, under King Henry VIII., [9:6:295] as in France it was suppressed about a century after by an edict of Louis XIII., but from that office, says Lambard, this lower constableship was first drawn, and is, as it were, a very finger of that hand.”

The Statute of Winchester (13 Edw. I. st. 2, c. 6), ordaining every citizen to have armour according to his condition to keep the peace, requires that in every hundred and fran chise two constables be chosen to make the view of armour twice a year, and that the said constables “shall present before justices assigned such defaults as they do see in the county about armour, and of the suits, and of watches, and of highways; and also shall present all such as do lodge strangers in uplandish towns, for whom they will not answer.” These are the officers known as high constables; who are especially charged with the peace of the hundred, just as the petty constables are charged with the peace of the parish or township. They were appointed at the court of the hundred, or in default thereof by justices at special sessions (7 and 8 Vict. c. 33, § 8). By a recent Act, 32 and 33 Vict. c. 47, they are practically abolished, as the justices of each county are required to consider and determine whether it is necessary that the office of high constable of each hundred, or other like district, should be continued.

The petty or parish constable unites two offices—the ancient one of head-borough or tithing man, and the modern one, instituted about the reign of Edward III., of assistant to the high constable. Considering what manner of men were for the most part appointed to these offices, Blackstone thought it was well that they should be kept in ignorance of the extent of their powers. Besides their general duties in the preservation of the peace they are charged with the execution of warrants and the service of summonses. No action can be brought against a constable for any act done in the execution of his office unless within six months from the time of its being committed. By 24 Geo. II. c. 44, the justice who signed the warrant must be made a co-defendant in any action against the constable, and on the production of such warrant at the trial the jury must find for the constable, notwithstanding any want of jurisdiction in the magistrate. Petty constables were formerly elected at the court leet or, in default thereof, by two justices. But by 5 and 6 Vict. c. 109, it is .ordered that the justices shall annually issue their precept to the overseers of each parish in their county, requiring them to return a list of persons in such parish qualified and liable to serve as constables, and that the justices on special petty sessions shall revise the list, and select therefrom such number of constables as they may deem necessary. Every able-bodied man resident within the parish, between the ages of twenty-five and fifty-five, rated to the relief of the poor or to the county rate, on any tenements of the net yearly value of £4 and upwards, is qualified and liable to serve as constable for that parish. But large classes of persons are specially exempted from the liability to serve,— including peers and members of Parliament, judges, justices, clergymen and ministers, lawyers, physicans, officers of the army and navy, public servants, &c. Licensed victuallers and beer-sellers, game-keepers, and convicts are disqualified. Every person so chosen must serve; but those who have served already shall not be liable to serve again until every other person liable shall have served. Boroughs under the Municipal Corporation Act do not come within this statute. In .consequence of the establishment of a county constabulary it is now enacted, by 35 and 36 Vict. c. 92, that no such constable shall be appointed unless for parishes in regard to which the magistrates for the county shall at their general or quarter sessions determine that it js necessary that such appointment shall be made.

Special Constables are appointed to act on occasional emergencies when the ordinary police force is thought to be deficient. In the absence of volunteers the office is compulsory, on the appointment of two justices. The lord-lieutenant may also appoint special constables, and the statutory exemptions may be disregarded.

The Acts establishing and regulating county constabulary are the 2 and 3 Viet, c, 93, 3 and 4 Vict. c. 88, 19 and 20 Vict. c. 69, 20 Vict. c. 2, ar/í 22 and 23 Vict. c. 32. The police force of every county shall be under the superintendence of a chief-constable, who, with the approbation of justices in petty sessions, may appoint constables and provisional superintendents. The chief-constable has the general superintendence and direction of the force (including the petty constables where they still exist), and he may dismiss them at his pleasure, subject to the orders of Quarter Sessions, and the rules established for the government of the force. The salaries and other expenses under these Acts are to be paid by a police rate, to be made by the justices at Quarter Sessions. Counties and boroughs may consolidate their police force. The Crown appoints inspectors to report on the efficiency of the police, and whenever a certificate shall be granted by the Secretary of State that the police has been maintained during the preceding year in a state of efficiency as to discipline and numbers, the Treasury shall grant a sum in aid of the expenses not exceeding one-fourth of the charge for pay and clothing.
