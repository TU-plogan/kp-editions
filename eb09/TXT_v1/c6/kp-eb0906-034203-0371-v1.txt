COPAL, a hard lustrous resin, varying in hue from an almost colourless transparent mass to a bright yellowish brown, having a conchoidal fracture, and, when dissolved in alcohol, spirit of turpentine, or any other suitable menstruum, forming one of the most valuable varnishes. Like many other commercial substances, copal is obtained from a variety of sources; the term is not uniformly applied or restricted to the products of any particular legion or series of plants, but is vaguely used for resins which, though very similar in their physical properties, differ somewhat in their constitution, and are altogether distinct as to their source. Thus the resin obtained from Trachylobium Hornemannianum is known in commerce as Zanzibar copal, or gum animé. Madagascar copal is the produce of T. verrucosum. From Guibourtia copallifera is obtained Sierra Leone copal, and another variety of the same resin is found in a fossil state on the west coast of Africa, probably the produce of a tree now extinct. From Brazil and other South American countries, again, copal is obtained which is yielded by Trachylobium Martianum, Hymenaea Courbaril, and various other species, while the dammar resins and the piney varnish of India are occasionally classed and spoken of as copal. Of the varieties abovo enumerated by far the most important in a commercial point of view is the Zanzibar or East African copal, yielded by Trachylobium Hornemannianum. The resin is found in two distinct conditions :—1st, raw or recent, called by the inhabitants of the coast sandarusiza miti or chakazi, the latter name being corrupted by Zanzibar traders into “jackass” copal; and 2d, ripe or true copal, the sandarusi inti of the natives. The raw copal, which is obtained direct from the trees, or found at their roots or near the surface of the ground, is not regarded by the natives as of much value, and does not enter into European commerce. It is sent to India and China, where it is manufactured into a coarse kind of varnish. The true or fossil copal is found embedded in the earth over a wide belt of the mainland coast of Zanzibar, on tracks where not a single tree is now visible. The copal is not found at a greater depth in the ground than 4 feet, and it is seldom the diggers go deeper than about 3 feet. It occurs in pieces varying from the size of small pebbles up to masses of several ounces in weight, and occasionally lumps weighing 4 or 5 K) have been obtained; and it is said that one piece of 35 lb weight has been found. After garbling and freeing from foreign matter, the resin is submitted to various chemical operations for the purpose of clearing the “goose-skin,” the name given to the peculiar pitted-like surface possessed by fossil copal. The goose-skin was formerly supposed to be caused by the impression of the small stones and sand of the soil into which the soft resin fell in its raw condition; but Dr Kirk states that the copal when first dug up has no trace of the goose-skin on it. He believes the appearance to arise from an oxidation of the surface taking place to a certain depth after exposure to the air, or to be caused by some molecular change which renders the skin more brittle than the inner mass. The copal digging is conducted by the natives in a careless and desultory manner, and the whole trade is, as usual in dealings with untutored tribes, surrounded with many difficulties. It is believed that the supply is practically inexhaustible, and with proper organization the trade would be a permanent source of support to a larger community than at present inhabits the copal-yielding regions. A large proportion of the resin is sent to the European market by way of Bombay; but considerable[9:6:343] quantities are also shipped direct to Hamburg and to British ports. The amount annually exported is subject to great fluctuations, which equally affect the market value of the product. During the year 1872-73 the imports into Bombay were 966 cwts., and probably at least an equal quantity went in other directions. The following analysis of Zanzibar and Madagascar copal is given by Filhol :—
