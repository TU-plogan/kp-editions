CORVEY, a famous Benedictine abbey in Saxony, situated on the Weser, in the neighbourhood of Höxter, with which it communicates by an avenue about three-quarters of a mile in length. It was founded by Louis the Pious in 813, and received its name from the fact that the first body of monks by whom it was held came from Corbie in Picardy. Raised to the rank of a bishopric in 1793, it was secularized in 1802, and bestowed on the Nassau Orange family; and since then it has passed through various hands to those of the present prince of Ratibor, who received it in 1840 by the will of Victor Amadeus of Hesse-Rothenbeιg. The abbey, or, as it is now called, the castle of Corvey, possesses a very extensive library, especially rich in old illustrated works; but the ancient collection due to the literary enthusiasm of the Benedictines is no longer extant. It at one time preserved the famous manuscript of Tacitus vhich contains the six books of the Annals. Widukind composed his history of the Saxons within the precincts of Corvey; and the Annales Corbejenscs of the monks can still be read in Pertz’s Monumenta Germanice Historica, vol. iii. The Chronicon Corbejense, published by Wedekind in 1824, has been proved a forgery. (See Wigand, Geschichte der Abtei Korvey, Höxter, 1819, and Der Korveische Güterbesitz.)
