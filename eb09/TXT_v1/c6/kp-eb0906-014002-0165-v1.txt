COLIGNI, Gaspard de (1517-1572), admiral of France, was son of the Marshal Gaspard de Coligni and Louise de Montmorency, and was born at Chatillon-sur-Loing, the hereditary domain of his house. At twenty-two he came to court, and there contracted a friendship with Francis of Guise. In the campaign of 1543 Coligni distinguished himself greatly, and was wounded at the sieges of Montmédy and Bains. In 1544 he served in the Italian campaign under the Due d’Enghien, and was knighted on the field of Cerisolles. Returning to France, he took part in [9:6:141] different military operations; and having been made colonel general of the infantry, exhibited great capacity and in telligence as a military reformer. He was soon afterwards made admiral in room of D’Annebaut. At the battle of Renty (1554) began the quarrel between him and Francis of Guise, which was to bring such evil on both their houses, and on their native land; and the enmity was increased tenfold in 1556 by the rupture, at the instance of Guise, of the Treaty of Vauxcelles. In 1557 he was intrusted with the defence of Saint Quentin. In the siege he displayed great courage, resolution, and strength of character; but the place was taken, and he was imprisoned in the stronghold of LΕcluse. On payment of a ransom of 50,000 crowns he recovered his liberty. But he had by this time become a Huguenot, through the influence of his brother Dandelot; and he busied himself secretly with protecting his co-religionists, a colony of whom he sent to Brazil, whence they were afterwards expelled by the Portuguese. On the death of Henry II. he placed himself, with Louis, prince of Condé, in the front of his sect, and demanded religious toleration and certain other reforms. In 1560, at the Assembly of Notables at Fontainebleau, the hostility between Coligni and Francis of Guise broke violently forth; the death of Francis IL and the policy of Catharine precipitated matters to an issue; the civil war began; and the battle of Dreux (1562), clearing the ground of the Constable Montmorency and the prince of Condé, set the two great rivals at the head of their respective parties. In 1563, however, the Pacification of Amboise was effected; Francis of Guise was assassinated; and peace was maintained for some years. The Huguenot attempt to seize on the person of Charles IX. at Monceaux brought about a resumption of hostilities. At St Denis (1567) Coligni defeated Montmorency; in 1569 he was defeated at Jarnac by the duke of Anjou, and repaired with the remains of his army to Cognac. There he was joined by the prince of Navarre, who was forthwith placed at the head of the Protestant party; the two laid siege to Poitiers, which was defended by Henry of Guise; but the siege was raised, and the Huguenots were routed at Moncontour (1569) with terrible slaughter. A price of 50,000 crowns was set upon the admiral’s head; but the peace of St Germain was concluded in 1570, and he returned to court. He grew rapidly in favour with Charles IX. As a means of emancipating the king from the tutelage of his mother and the faction of the Guises, the admiral proposed to him a descent on Spanish Flanders, with an army drawn from both sects, and commanded by Charles in person. The king’s regard for the admiral, and the bold front of the Huguenots, alarmed the queen mother; and the massacre of St Bartholomew was the consequence. On 22d August 1572 Coligni was shot in the street by Maurevert, a bravo in the pay of Henry of Guise; the bullets, however, only tore a finger from his right hand and shattered his left elbow. The king visited him, but the queen mother prevented all private intercourse between them. On the 24th August, the night of the massacre, he was attacked in his house by the minions of Guise, led by a German named Behme, who slaw him and cast him from a window into the courtyard at their master’s feet. His body was gibbeted at Montfaucon; it was, however, carried off by his retainers, and buried at Chatillon, where it remained till 1786, when Montesquieu had it reinterred at his own estate of Maupertuis. His papers were seized and burned by the queen mother; among them, according to Brantôme, was ahistory of the civil war “très-beau et très-bien faict, et digne d’estre imprimé.”
