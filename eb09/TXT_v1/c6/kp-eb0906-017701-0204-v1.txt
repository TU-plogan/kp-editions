COMACCHIO, a town of Italy, in the province of Ferrara, at the head of a circondario, is situated on a long island near the seaward side of an extensive lagoon in the Adriatic, known as the Valli diComacchio, in 44° 41' 36" N. lat. and 29° 51' 23" E. long. It is the seat of a bishop, and possesses a Capuchin convent and several fine churches. It was at one time strongly fortified, and still has remains of the citadel, which, in accordance with the treaty of Vienna, was held by the Austrians till 1859. The inhabitants are mainly engaged in the manufacture of salt and the prosecution of the fisheries in the lagoon, which, with its shallow area of 41,600 acres, affords a rich feeding ground for eels and grey mullets. The seaward entrance is carefully guarded by a system of nets, so that the fish, once within the lagoon, cannot find their way out again. The eels are exported to all parts of Italy, sometimes alive, Dut more usually in a pickle; and they are greatly esteemed for their delicate flavour. The average annual production is 1,800,000 ìb, and the value about £40,000. Population, 8900
