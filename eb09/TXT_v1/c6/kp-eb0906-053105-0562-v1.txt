COWES, West and East, two towns of England, in the county of Hants, on the estuary of the Medina, on the north coast of the Isle of Wight, directly opposite to the mouth of Southampton Water. The port between them is the chief one of the island, and is the headquarters of the Royal Yacht Squadron (founded in 1815); it is in constant steam communication with Ryde, and with Portsmouth and Southampton, each eleven miles distant. A steam ferry across the Medina, here 600 yards broad, unites the towns. Behind the harbour the houses rise [9:6:532] picturesquely on gentle wooded slopes, and numerous villas adorn the vicinity. The towns owe their origin to two forts or castles, built on each side of the mouth of the Medina by Henry VIII. in 1540, for the defence of the coast; the eastern one has disappeared, but the west castle still stands and is used as the club-house of the Yacht Squadron. The marine parade of West Cowes, and the public promenade called the Green, are close to the castle. Within the town the streets are narrow; there are no buildings of architectural pretensions; and the place is quiet excepting in the yachting and bathing season from May to November. The resident population is chiefly employed in the ship-building yards, where yachts of the finest models and smaller naval vessels are built, and in ship provisioning. West Cowes is in railway communication with Newport and Ryde. Population (1871), 5730. On the opposite side of the Medina a broad carriage way leads to East Cowes Castle, a handsome edifice built by Nash, the favourite architect of George IV., in 1798, and immediately beyond it are the grounds surrounding Osborne House, the residence of the queen, completed in 1845. Norris Castle, on the rising ground above the shores of the Solent, built in 1799, and Whippingham Church on the right bank of the Medina, are other buildings of interest in the neighbourhood of East Cowes, the population of which in 1871 was 2058.
