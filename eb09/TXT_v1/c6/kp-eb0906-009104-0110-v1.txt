COCHABAMBA, a city and bishop’s see of Bolivia, capital of a province and department, is situated about 8370 feet above the level of the sea, on both banks of the Rio de la Rocha, a sub-tributary of the Rio Grande, to the south of a considerable Cordillera. It is about 122 miles N.N W. of Sucre, its latitude is 17° 27' S., and its longitude 65 r 46' W. The streets are broad, and the houses for the most part of one story and surrounded by gardens, sc that the area of the city is great in comparison with its population. There are fifteen churches, a gymnasium, and a cabildo; and an extensive industry is maintained in the production of woollen and cotton stuffs, leather, soap, glass-ware, and pottery. The population is largely composed of Indians; and the prevailing language is Quichua. Cochabamba was founded in the 16th century, and for a time was called Oropesa. In the revolution of 1815 the women of the city distinguished themselves by their bravery, and successfully attacked the Spanish camp; and in 1818 a number of the heroines were put to death by the Spanish forces. In 1874 the city was seized by Migue] Aguirre, and a large part of it laid in ruins, but peace was soon afterwards restored, and the regular authorities reinstated. The population in 1858 was 40,678.
