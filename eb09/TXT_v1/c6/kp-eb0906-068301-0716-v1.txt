CUBEBS (Arabic, kabábahst, the fruit of species of plants belonging to the genus Cubeba, natural order Piperaceae. The cubebs of pharmacy are produced by C. officinalis (Piper Cubeba, Linn.), a climbing woody shrub indigenous to South Borneo, Sumatra, Prince of Wales Island, and Java. It has round, ash-coloured, smooth branches; oblong, or ovate-oblong, coriaceous, shining leaves, 4 to 6 j inches long, and 1∣ to 2 inches broad; and dioecious flowers. The fruits are small, globose, about ¾th inch in diameter, and not so large as white pepper; their contracted bases or pedicles are between ⅜ and ¾ inch in length; and from forty fo fifty of them are borne upon a common rachis. Commercial cubebs consist of the dried ripe berries, usually with their pedicles attached; the pericarp is greyish-brown, or blackish and wrinkled; and the seed, when present, is hard, white, and oily. The odour of cubebs is agreeable and aromatic; the taste, pungent, acrid, slightly bitterish, and persistent. About 15 per cent, of a volatile oil, polymeric with oil of turpentine, is obtained by distilling cubebs with water; after rectification with water, or on keeping, this deposits rhombic crystals of camphor of cubebs or hydrate of cubebene, C 30 H 48 ,2H 2 O; cubebene, the liquid portion, has the formula C 30 H 48 . Cubebin is a crystalline substance existing in cubebs, discovered by Soubeiran and Capitaine in 1839; it may be prepared from cubebene, or from the pulp left after the distillation of the oil. The drug, along with gum, fatty oils, and malates of magnesium and calcium, contains also about 1 per cent, of cubébic acid, and to this and to a resin Bernatzik and Schmidt attribute its therapeutic effects. Cubebs are administered for arresting excessive mucous urethral discharges, also as a gentle stimulant, carminative, and stomachic. They are most safely employed in gonorrhoea when the inflammation is confined to the mucous membrane of the urethra. The introduction of the drug into medicine is supposed to have been due to the Arabian physicians in the Middle Ages. Cubebs were formerly candied and eaten whole, or used ground as a seasoning for meat. Their modern employment in England as a drug dates from 1815. “Cubebae” were purchased in 1284 and 1285 by Lord Clare at 2s. 3d. and 2s. 9d. per lb respectively; and in 1307 1 lb for the King’s Wardrobe cost 9s., a sum representing about £3, 12s. in present value (Rogers, Hist, of Agriculture and Prices, i. 627-8; ii. 544). The plant Cubeba Clusii produces the African cubebs or West African black-pepper, the berry of which is smoother than that of common cubebs, and usually has a curved pedicle. It is said by Stenhouse (Ann. Ch. Pharm., xcv. 106) to contain piperin and not cubebin. In the 14th century it was imported into Europe from the Grain Coast, under the name of pepper, by merchants of Rouen and Lippe.
