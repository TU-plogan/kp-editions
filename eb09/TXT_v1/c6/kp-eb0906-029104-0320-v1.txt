CONSERVATORY (Ital. Conservator™, Fr. Conservatoire, Ger. Conservatoriurn), a name applied first in Italy, and afterwards throughout the Continent, to institutions for training in music and for preserving the true theory and practice of the art. They arose out of the necessity of providing trained choristers for the service of the church, and were generally maintained upon some charitable foundation which provided board in addition to a musical education for orphans and the children of poor parents, other pupils being occasionally taken on payment of fees. When fully equipped, each conservatorio had two maestri or principals, one for composition and one for singing, besides professors for the various instruments. Though St Ambrose and Pope Leo I., in the 4th and 5th centuries respectively, are sometimes named in connection with the subject, the historic continuity of the conservatoire in its modern sense cannot be traced farther back than the 16th century. The first to which a definite date can be assigned is the Conservatorio di Santa Maria di Loretto, at Naples, founded by Giovanni di Tappia in 1537. Three other similar schools were afterwards established in the city, of which the Conservatorio di Sant’ Onofrio deserves special mention on account of the fame of its teachers, such as Alessandro Scarlatti, Leo, Durante, and Porpora. There were thus for a considerable time four flourishing conservatories in Naples. Two of them, however, ceased to exist in the course of last century, and on the French occupation of the city the other two were united by Murat in a new instituti on under the title Real Collegio di Musica, which admitted pupils of both sexes, the earlier conservatorios having been exclusively for boys. In Venice, on the other hand, there [9:6:292] were from an early date four conservatories conducted on a similar plan to those in Naples, but exclusively for girls. These died out with the decay of the Venetian republic, and the centre of musical instruction for Northern Italy was transferred to Milan, where a conservatorio on a large scale was established by Prince Eugene Beauharnais in 1808. The celebrated conservatoire of Paris owes its origin to the Ecole Royale de Chant et de Declamation, founded by Baron de Breteuil in 1784, for the purpose of training singers for the opera. Suspended during the stormy period of the Revolution, its place was taken by the Conservatoire de Musique, established in 1795 on the basis of a school for gratuitous instruction in military music, founded by the mayor of Paris in 1792. The plan and scale on which it was founded had to be modified more than once in succeeding years, but it continued to flourish, and in the inter-valbetween 1820and 1840,under the direction of Cherubini, may be said to have led the van of musical progress in Europe. In more recent years that place of honour belongs decidedly to the conservatorium at Leipsic, founded by Mendelssohn in 1842, which, so far as composition and instrumental music are concerned, is now the chief resort of those who wish to rise to eminence in the art. Of other Continental conservatoires of the first rank may be named those of Prague, founded in 1810, of Brussels, founded in 1833 and long presided over by the celebrated Fetis, of Cologne, founded in 1849, and those instituted more recently at Munich and Berlin, the instrumental school in the latter being under the direction of Joachim. In England the functions of a conservatoire have been discharged by the Royal Academy of Music of London, which was founded in 1822, and received a charter of incorporation in 1830. With very limited resources as compared with the larger Continental establishments, it has done excellent service in providing a constant succession of thoroughly trained professional musicians. A national training school of music was opened at South Kensington under distinguished auspices in May 1876, the object being to provide a free education of the highest kind to pupils of remarkable promise as tested by examination.
