CUNNINGHAM, Peter (1816-1869), topographical and antiquarian littérateur, was born in London, April 7, 1816. He was the son of the Scottish poet Allan Cunningham, and was educated at Christ’s Hospital. He led a singularly uneventful life; for at the age of eighteen he was appointed by Sir Robert Peel, in recognition of his father’s genius and reputation, to a junior clerkship in the audit office, and after twenty years’ faithful and efficient service he was promoted to a chief clerkship. This post he filled till 1860, when he retired from the public service. His literary career began before his official, and his first published work was The Life of Drummond of Hawthornden, with large selections from his poetical works. This volume appeared in 1833. His most important topographical work is the Handbook of London, the first edition of which was published in 2 vols, in 1849, and the second in 1 vol. in 1850. It bears a high character for fulness and accuracy of information, and is made particularly attractive by the intermingling of authentic anecdote and incident with the necessary details of names and dates. Among Cunningham’s other publications are,— Songs of England [9:6:708] and Scotland (1835), Handbook of Westminster Abbey (1842), a Life of Inigo Jones for the old Shakespeare Society (1848), Modern London (1851), The Story of Nell Gwynn (1852), and a “Memoir of J. Μ. W. Turner,” prefixed to Burnett’s Turner and his Works (1852). In 1854 he edited, for Mr Murray’s “Library of British Classics,” the works of Oliver Goldsmith and Johnson’s Lives of the Poets, with additional lives. He was a contributor to the Athenaeum, Thae Illustrated London News, Eraser's Magazine, and other periodicals. He was also engaged as collaborateur with Croker on a new edition of Pope’s works. He died at St Alban’s, May 18, 1869.
