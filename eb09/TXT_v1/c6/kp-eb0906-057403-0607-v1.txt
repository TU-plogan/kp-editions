CREUZER, Georg Friedrich (1771-1858), a German philologist and archaeologist, born on March 10, 1771, at Marburg, was the son of a bookbinder of that town. Having studied at Marburg and Jena, he for some time lived at Leipsic as a private tutor; but in 1802 he was appointed professor at Marburg, and two years later professor of philology and ancient history at Heidelberg. The latter position he held for nearly forty-five years, with the exception of a short time spent at the university of Leyden, where he was unable to remain on account of the injurious effect produced upon his health by the Dutch climate. He had the honour of being one of the principal founders of the Philological Seminary established at Heidelberg in 1807. The Academy of Inscriptions of Paris appointed him one of its members, and from the grand-duke of Baden he received the dignity of privy councillor. He died at the age of eighty-seven, February 16,1858. Creuzer’s first and most famous work was his Symbolik und Mythologie der alten Völker, besonders der Griechen (Leipsic, 1810-12), in which he maintained that the mythology of Homer and Hesiod came from an Eastern source through the Pelasgians, and was the remains of the symbolism of an ancient revelation. This work was vigorously attacked by Hermann, in his Briefen über Homer und Hesiod, and his letter, addressed to Creuzer, Ueber das Weseiι und die Be- [9:6:575] handlung der Mythologie; by Voss, in his Antisymbolik; and by Lobek, in his A glaophamos. Of Creuzer’s other works the principal are an edition of Plotinus; a partial edition of Cicero, in preparing which he was asssisted by Moser; Die Historische Kunst der Griechen (Leips. 1803); Epochen de>' Griech. Literaturgeschichte (Marburg, 1802); Abriss der römischen Antiquitäten (Leips. 1824); Zur Geschichte alti'ömischer Cultur am Oberrhein und Neckar (Leips. 1833); Zur Gemmenkunde (Darmstadt, 1834); Das Mithreum von Neuenheim (Heidelberg, 1838); Zur Galerie der alten Dramatiker (Heidelberg, 1839); Zur Geschichte der classischen Philologie (Leips. 1854).

See the autobiographical Aus dem Leben eines alten Professors (Leips, and Darmstadt, 1848), to which was added in the year of his death Paralipomena der Lebenskizze eines alten Professors (Frankfort, 1858); also Starck, Friederich Kreuzer, sein Bildungsgang und seine bleibende Bedeutung (Heidelberg, 1875).
