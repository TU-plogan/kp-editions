CONCORDANCE, a verbal index, in which all the leading words used by an author are alphabetically arranged, with a reference to the place where each occurs. The want of such a work first made itself felt in the department of biblical interpretation, and the earliest concordances were those of the Scriptures. Hence the application of the term has been generally limited to a Biblical index. The first of these was compiled under the direction of Cardinal Hugo de St Caro, who died about 1262. This concordance was formed from the Vulgate translation, and it is said that nearly 500 Dominican monks were employed on it. The earliest Hebrew concordance, called The Light of the Way, was produced by Rabbi Mordecai Nathan (1438-48), and published at Venice in 1523. This was followed by the much more complete and accurate work of Marius de Calasio, a Franciscan friar, whose concordance, based on that of Nathan, was published at Rome in 1621. Buxtorf’s is the next Hebrew concordance that deserves mention—a work marked by much care and scholarship, but following the Masoretic divisions of the Old Testament, and so less likely to be of use to the general student. It was published at Basel in 1632, and abridged by Ravius, under the title Fount of Zion (Berlin, 1677). In 1754, Dr John Taylor of Norwich published his Hebrew Concordance, Adapted to the English Bible, Disposed after the Manner of Buxtorf. This held the first place among works of the kind, until the appearance of Dr Julius Fürst’s Hebrew and Chaldee Concordance. Of Greek concordances to the Septuagint, the best is that compiled by Abraham Trommius, minister of Groningen, which was published at Amsterdam in 1718. This is a work distinguished by great industry and erudition[9:6:241]; it forms a complete index and lexicon to the Septuagint, all save the book of Daniel, which was not at that time included in the Septuagint version. Among Greek concordances to the New Testament, the principal place is held by that of Erasmus Schmid (1638), reprinted in a corrected form at Gotha in 1717. An abridged edition of this valuable work is published by Messrs Bagster, in their Polymicrian Series. The first of English concordances was one to the New Testament, published at London, before 1540. The earliest concordance to the entire Bible, in English, was formed by Marbeck (London, 1550). This work is very imperfect, and refers only to chapters, not to verses. It was followed by various others, among which may be noted the Cambridge Concordance (1689). The Englishman’s Concordance, designed for the use of students who are acquainted only with the vernacular, is valuable for purposes of exegesis, and the comparison of different English translations of the same Greek and Hebrew words. But all of these were thrown into the shade by the full and trustworthy work of Alexander Cruden. This is entitled A Complete Concordance to the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testament, and was published in 1737. It has been frequently re-edited, and still retains its place as an authority. Besides concordances to the entire Bible, verbal indexes to separate portions of it have been prepared. There is a Concordance of the Proverbs of Solomon, and of his Sentences in Ecclesiastes; a Concordance of the Metrical Psalms and Paraphrases (Edin., 1856); and a Concordance of the Prayer-Book Version of the Psalms. There is also a Concordance of the Apocrypha. Concordances to other works than the Scriptures are of more recent date. The very earliest is a Concordance of Feudal Law, compiled at the end of the 17th century. Twiss and Ayscough each prepared a concordance to the works of Shakespeare, but these were both incomplete and incorrect. Mrs Μ. Cowden Clarke, in 1847, supplied the deficiency by her elaborate Concordance to Shakespeare. A Concordance to Milton was published in 1867. The latest works of this class are the Concordance to the Works of Alfred Tennyson, D.C.L., by D. B. Brightwell (1869), and that to the works of Alex. Pope by Edwin Abbott (1875).
