CODRINGTON, Sir Edward (1770-1851), admiral, belonged to an old Gloucestershire family. He entered the navy in 1783. In 1794 he served as lieutenant on board How e’s flagship in the actions off Brest, and was sent home with despatches announcing the result. In 1805 he received the command of the “Orion,” a seventy-four, in which he fought at Trafalgar, receiving a gold medal for his conduct in the action. In 1808 he was gazetted to the “Blake,” another seventy-four, in command of which he shared in the Walcheren expedition, assisting in the forcing of the Scheldt in 1809. During the next three years he was on active service off the Spanish coast, In 1813 he sailed for North America, where he was made rear-admiral and captain of the fleet. Returning to England at the close of the war, he received a Knight Commandership of the Bath in 1815; and six years afterwards (1821) he was gazetted vice-admiral. In 1826 he was appointed to the command-in-chief of the Mediterranean squadron of eleven sail sent to restrain Ibrahim Pasha from operating against the Greeks, and sailed in the “Asia” for the Morea. Here he was joined by the French aud Russian contingents, of five and eight sail respectively, under Admirals de Rigny and Heiden, who were put under his orders. A literal interpretation of instructions led to the battle of Navarino, in which the Turkish and Egyptian fleets, of 36 sail, with a cloud of gunboats, schooners, and craft of all sorts, were almost entirely destroyed. For his share in this action Codrington received a Grand Cross of the Bath; but the steps which led to it occasioned considerable dissatisfaction in England, and he was recalled in 1828. He was returned to Parliament for Devonport in 1832 in the Liberal interest, and was re-elected in 1835 and 1837. In the latter year he was gazetted admiral. He accepted the Chiltern Hundreds in 1839, on his appointment as commander-in-chief at Portsmouth, and his three years’ tenure of that office concluded his public life. He died in London, April 28,1851. A memoir of Codrington, by his daughter, Lady Bourchier, appeared in 1873, and an abridgment of the larger work in 1875.
