COURT, ANTOINE (1696-1760), who has been designated the ,t Restorer of Protestantism in France,” was born at the village of Villeneuve-de-Berg, in the province of the Vivarais, in 1696. His parents were poor, belonging to the peasant class, and were unable to give him what was considered a good education. But they were pious folk, adherents of the Reformed Church, against which the most ruthlessly cruel persecution was so Jong directed by the French Government. Brought up in the fear of God, and early acquainted with the Holy Scriptures, he began to show in his boyhood the signs of a high calling. He was eight years old when the Camisard revolt was finally suppressed, and nineteen when the infamous decree of Louis XIV. was published, declaring that all who professed the Reformed faith should be punished as relapsed heretics. Antoine, taken to the secret meetings of the persecuted Calvinists, held “in dens and caves of the earth,” often in darkness, no pastor nor “prophet” present to teach or console, began, when only seventeen, to speak and exhort in these congregations of “the desert.” The desire naturally arose in him to deliver the people, and to build up on solid foundations the church which was threatened with extinction. For this purpose he proposed four things as essential :— regular religious meetings for teaching and worship; suppression of the fanaticism of the “inspired,” and of the disorders to which it gave rise; restoration of discipline by the establishment of consistories, conferences, and synods; and the careful training of a body of pastors. To the execution of this vast undertaking he devoted his life. The scene of his labours for fifteen years was Languedoc, the Vivarais, and Dauphiny. His beginnings were very small prayer-meetings in “the desert,” attended by some half [9:6:520] dozen or dozen persons only. But the work progressed under his wise direction, and after forty years’ labour he addressed on one occasion a meeting of 10,000 on the spot where at first he could scarcely gather fifty. In 1724 another heavy blow was struck at Protestantism in the edict of Louis XV., wshich again assuming that there were no Protestants in France, prohibited the most secret exercise of the Reformed religion, and imposed monstrous penalties. It was impossible fully to carry out its menaces. But persecution raged, especially against the pastors. Many of them were executed, and many fled. A price was set on the life of Antoine Court; and in 1730 he quitted France and took up his abode at Lausanne. He had seen that it was necessary to have a theological college, and Lausanne appeared to be a fitting place for it. He therefore, with the aid of some of the Protestant princes, established the college, and during the remaining thirty years of his life he filled the post of director. He had the title of deputy-general of the churches, and was really the pillar of their hope. He carried on a very extensive correspondence; and, through the often repeated persecutions of his fellow-religionists, fought their battle manfully. The college of Lausanne sent forth all the pastors of the Reformed Church of France till the days of the first French empire. Court formed the design of writing a history of Protestantism, and made large collections for the purpose; but this he did not live to carry out. His character has been thus drawn by Μ. de Végobre :—he possessed sound straightforward sense, wonderful facility of expression, intrepid courage joined with consummate prudence, astonishing vigour to support the greatest fatigues of body and mind, purity and integrity ever beyond suspicion, and unshaken devotion to the holy cause to wshich he had consecrated himself. Antoine Court died at Lausanne in 1760. He was the father of the more generally known Court de Gebelin. He hardly finds a place in biographical dictionaries; indeed, for a long time his name and work were almost ignored even by French writers on the history of the Reformed Church.

For details of his life see Peyrat's Histoire des Pasteurs du Désert, CoquereΓs work bearing the same title, and De Felicé’s Histoire des Protestants de France. The first special biography of Court appears to be that by Μ. Edmond Hugues, entitled Antoine Court, Histoire de la Restauration du Protestantisme en France au X VIII. Siècle, published in 1872.
