COLMAN, George (1762—1836), the Younger, son of the preceding, passed from Westminster School to Christ Church, Oxford, and King’s College, Aberdeen, and was finally entered as a student of law at the Temple, London. While at Aberdeen he published a poem in honour of Charles James Fox, called The Man of the People; and in 1782 he produced, at his father’s playhouse in the Haymarket, his first play, The Female Dramatists, for which Roderick Random supplied the materials. It was unanimously condemned, but his next attempt, Two to One, was entirely successful, and the young Templar’s vocation was decided on. The failing health of the elder Colman obliging him to relinquish the management of the Haymarket theatre, the younger George succeeded him, at a yearly salary of £600. On the death of the father the patent was continued to the son; but difficulties arose in his way, lawsuits and pamphlets accumulated round him, and he was forced to take sanctuary within the Rules of the King’s Bench. Here he resided for many years. Released at last through the kindness of George IV., who had appointed him exon of the Yeomen of the Guard, a dignity disposed of by Colman to the highest bidder, he was made examiner of plays by the duke of Montrose, then lord chamberlain. This office, to the disgust of all contemporary dramatists, to whose MSS. he was as illiberal as severe, he held till his death. Colman’s comedies, which have never been collected, are a curious mixture of genuine comic force and platitudinous sentimentality. Several of them are yet acted; but their popularity is rather to be attributed to the humour of the actors who adopt them as vehicles for display than to any intrinsic vitality. The best of them are John Bull (1805), for which the author received the largest sum of money that had till then been paid for any single play, The Poor Gentleman, and The Heir-at-Law. Colman, whose conversational powers were remarkable, as Byron has recorded, was also the author of a great deal of so-called humorous poetry (mostly coarse, though much of •it was popular)— My Night Gown and Slippers (1797), Broad Grins (1802), and Poetical Vagaries (1812). Some of his writings were published under the assumed name of Arthur Griffinhood of Turnham Green. See Random Records, London, 1830, 2 vols.; and R. B. Peake, Memoirs of the Colman Family, London, 1842, 2 vols.
