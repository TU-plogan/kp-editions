CORVISART-DESMABETS, Jean Nicolas, Baron de (1755-1821), French physician, was born at Vouziers, in Champagne. His parents intended him for the profession of the law, but he turned aside to the study of medie cine, in which he took an enthusiastic interest. He became parish doctor of Saint-Sulpice, and then obtained a post in the hospital of La Charité, where he founded a flourishing [9:6:444] clinical school. He was next appointed professor in the College de France (in which position he was eminently successful), and member of the Academy of Sciences. But he was still struggling with debt when the Empress Josephine introduced him to Napoleon, by whom he was created baron and member of the Legion of Honour. His only original work of importance is his Essay on Diseases of the Heart and the Great Vessels.
