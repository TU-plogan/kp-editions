COKE, the carbonaceous residue produced when coal is subjected to a strong red heat, out of contact with the air, until the volatile constituents are driven off It consists essentially of carbon, the so-called fixed carbon, together with the incombustible matters or ash contained in the coal from which it is derived. In addition to these it almost invariably contains small quantities of hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, the whole, however, not exceeding 2 or 3 per cent. It also contains water, the amount of which may vary considerably according to the method of manufacture. When produced rapidly and at a low heat, as in gas-making, it is of a dull black colour, and a loose spongy or pumice-like texture, and ignites with comparative ease, though less readily than bituminous coal, so that it may be burnt in open fire-places; but when a long-continued heat is used, as in the preparation of coke for iron and steel melting, the product is hard and dense, is often prismatic in structure, has a brilliant semi-metallic lustre and silvery-grey colour, is a good conductor of heat and electricity, and can only be burnt in furnaces provided with a strong chimney draught or an artificial blast. The strength and cohesive properties are also intimately related to the nature and composition of the coals employed, which are said to be caking or non-caking according to the compact or fragmentary character of the coke produced.

The simplest method of coking, that in open heaps or piles, is conducted in a very similar manner to charcoal burning. The coal is piled in a domed heap about 30 feet in diameter and 5 feet high, with a chimney of bricks arranged in open chequer work in the centre, around which the largest lumps of coal are placed so as to allow a free draught through the mass. The outside of the heap is covered with a coating of wet coke dust, except a ring about a foot high at the bottom. Fire is communicated by putting a few live coals near the top of the chimney, or from the interior by throwing them down the chimney, and the combustion proceeds downwards and outwards by the draught through the uncovered portion at the bottom. Whenever the fire takes too strong a hold and burns out to the surface it is damped by plastering over the spot with wet coke dust and earth, this being a point requiring considerable skill on the part of the coke burner. When flame and smoke are no longer given off, which usually happens in from five to six days, the whole surface is smothered with coke dust, and the chimney is stopped for three or four days longer, when the heap is sufficiently cooled to allow of the coke being broken up and removed, or, as it is called, drawn. The cooling is usually expedited by throwing water upon the heap before drawing. The principle of coking in rectangular piles is generally similar to the foregoing, but chimneys are not used. The dimensions generally adopted are a height of from 3J to 5 feet, and a breadth of 12 feet at the base.

In coking by clamps or kilns a rectangular pile of coal is enclosed between upright walls, having a system of vertical and horizontal passages traversing them at intervals, which serve as chimneys to conduct the combustion through the pile. This system has been used at different times in South Wales, Germany, and other places, but is now generally abandoned, as the draught holes have a tendency to consume the coal unnecessarily unless very carefully watched.

The largest proportion of the coke used for industrial purposes is made in close kilns or ovens. These vary very considerably in form and details of construction, but the same general principles are observed in all, the object being to effect the coking as much as possible by the consumption of the volatile inflammable gases given off above the surface of the coal, and to protect the latter from the direct access of currents of air. A further object is the utilization of the heat given off by the waste gases, which may be employed to heat the oven by circulating them in flues round the outside, and further by employing them for the accessory objects of raising steam, heating air, &c., in collieries and iron-works.

In its oldest and simplest form, the coke oven consists of a round chamber from 7 to 10 feet in diameter, with a low cylindrical wall, and a domed roof rising about 20 inches in height above the floor. A hole about 1 foot in diameter in the crown of the roof serves for charging, and the finished coke is drawn through a door in the wall, about 2⅜ feet square. When cleared for a fresh charge, the oven being red-hot, small coal is introduced through the hole in the roof, and spread uniformly over the floor, until it is filled up to the level of the springing of the roof, when the doorway is filled up with loose bricks which give a sufficient passage between them for the admission of air to ignite the gases given off by the distillation of the heated coal. After a few hours these air-ways must be closed by plastering up the brickwork, except the top layer, which is left open for twenty-four hours. The heat developed by the burning gases causes the coking to proceed downwards until the entire charge is converted, this taking from three to four days, according to the quantity of coal. When the escape of flame from the hole in the roof ceases, all apertures are stopped whereby air can enter to the incandescent mass, which being no longer protected by an atmosphere of combustible gases, would bum to waste if brought in contact with the atmosphere. At this point, therefore, all holes in the oven and chimney are completely closed for about twelve hours, when the door is opened, and the coke, which forms a coherent mass, somewhat less in size than the original charge, and divided by a system of columnar joints, is removed by an iron drag, or cross-bar, inserted at the far end of the floor, and moved by a chain and windlass, a stream of water from a hose being used to quench the glowing coke as it is brought out. This class of oven, which is now not much used, was adopted by most of the railway companies, tvhen coke was burnt exclusively in locomotives, and is also common in the Durham ooal-field. They are generally known as beehive ovens, also as bakers’ ovens. Usually from six to ten, or twelve, or more ovens are placed side l>y side in one block of brickwork, which is supplied with a tall chimney, the individual ovens being connected by pillars, with well-regulated dampers. A railway is generally laid along the top of the range of ovens, so that the charging can be effected directly from the colliery trucks. The yield of coke by this method may be from 55 to 65 per cent., according to the nature of the coal. With charges varying[9:6:119] from 3 to 10 tons, the operation, including the period of cooling, lasts from four to seven days. The coke obtained is of the highest quality, being dense and well burned. In some cases the cooling of the coke is effected by watering it before drawing. There is a certain amount of sulphur removed by this method, as the steam generated being brought into contact with the sulphide of iron in the heated mass, formed from pyrites in the coal, produces sulphuretted hydrogen and magnetic oxide of iron. The amount of desulphurization by this method is, however, practically insignificant, as the operation does not last a sufficient time to allow the mass of the fuel to be affected. The proportion of sulphur in finished coke, as compared with that of the original coal, may be roughly stated at about one-half. It has been sought to reduce the amount by decomposing the residual ferrous sulphide in various ways, as by the addition of salt, carbonate of soda, lime, &c., to the coal before coking but none of these methods is found to be practically useful.

In the South Wales coal-field the ordinary form of coke oven is nearly rectangular, being about 14 feet long, 5 feet wide at the back, and 6 feet at the front or drawing ends; the height to the crown of the cylindrical roof is 5 feet 6 inches, with usually two charging holes. Two charges are worked weekly, the first, of 4⅜ tons, is finished in three days, while the second, of 5 tons, is allowed four days, so as to remain in the oven over Sunday. The yield in both cases is about the same.

The addition of heating flues exterior to the wall of the oven allows the time of coking to be very much shortened, Of the numerous contrivances proposed for this purpose, that of a Belgian engineer, Mr Coppée. has latterly come into favour in many places, as very well adapted for use with comparatively dry coal. The coking chamber is a long narrow retort of fire brick, measuring about 30 feet in length, 17 inches in width at the front, and about 2 inches more at the back, where the charge is pushed out, with vertical walls about 3 4 feet high, covered by a low arched roof. One of these walls is solid, but the other contains twenty-eight vertical descending flues (∕) which communicate with the interior at the springing of the roof, and below with the large flue of the same width as the oven, and running along its entire length. As usually built, a series or battery includes about thirty ovens, which are arranged in pairs as in the figure, from which it will be seen that the left hand oven (A) is heated by the joint current of gases on both sides, while B is heated on one side by its own gas, and on the other by that of the next oven to the right The current then passes along the bottom flue of A, and back through that of B, whence it escapes by a flue to the chimney, or may be led to a steam boiler if the waste heat is used, as is generally the case, for raising steam The working of the adjacent pair of ovens is so. arranged that they are drawn alternately at exactly intermediate periods; thus supposing the time of coking to be fortyeight hours, A is drawn twenty-four hours after the charging of B, while the latter is in full activity, and keeps up the heat of the empty oven during charging, while necessarily the burning hydrocarbon gases given off during the first heating of the coal tend to keep up the heat in the adjoining oven. At Ebbw Vale, in Monmouthshire, where the coking requires only twenty-four hours, the ovens are numbered consecutively, the odd numbers being drawn and re-charged in the morning, and the even ones twelve hours later. The combustion of the gases is effected by air which is brought in through special channels (c) in the brickwork communicating with the gas flues at the top, and becomes heated in the passage. The object sought to be obtained is the combustion of the gases as much as possible in the flues, and not in the oven itself. The oven is closed at both ends by cast-iron doors in two parts, which can be opened together or separately during the drawing and recharging. The charging is effected through three holes (D D) in the roof, the coal, in the form of slack, being contained in hopper-shaped trams, running upon rails, which are run over the holes and emptied by drawing a slide. The charge is about 3 tons, and the yield from 36 to 44 cwt., according to the nature of the coal operated upon. The finished coke forms a prismatic mass, 30 feet long, 3 feet high, and 16 inches broad; it is pushed out by a ram, shaped like the cross section of the oven, which is moved by steam power acting upon a long racked rod. This apparatus, together with the engine and boiler for moving it, is mounted on a carriage moving on a railway in front of the range of ovens, so that it can be brought up to any one of them as required. The mass of coke is pushed out on to a floor running along the back, where it is immediately broken, and quenched by heavily watering the fragments. The whole operation, including the drawing and recharging of the empty oven, is effected in about eight minutes. The yield of coke very closely approximates to that obtained by experiments in crucibles. A similar kind of oven with outside heating flues, that of the Brothers Appolt, has been in use for several years on the Continent, more particularly in France. It differs from Coppée’s in the position of the coking chambers, which are vertical instead of horizontal, the coal being charged from the top, and the finished coke dropped into a truck placed below. Various schemes have been proposed at different times for the purpose of utilizing the condensible products, such as tar, ammoniacal water, &c., given off during the earlier stages of the process of coking, but they are not generally found to be applicable to the manufacture of meìallur-gieal coke, being only suited for gas-works, where the quality of the coke is only a secondary consideration.

The slack of dry or non-caking coal, or anthracite, which cannot be coked alone, may* be converted into a useful coke by mixing it with a proportion of bituminous coal, or gas-pitch, or a mixture of both. At Swansea, a mixture of 60 to 70 per cent, of anthracite with from 30 to 35 per cent, of bituminous coal, and 5 or 6 of gas pitch, made by grinding the ingredients in one of Carr’s disintegrator mills, is coked in the ordinary South Wales ovens, a thin layer of bituminous coal being placed above the charge before it is lighted, to prevent the pitch from burning to waste. The yield of coke is about 80 per cent, of the weight of the charge. It is exceedingly hard, and about 23 per cent, heavier than that made from bituminous coal, with a correspondingly higher calorific value.

Coke is used for all purposes where a smokeless fire is required, as, for instance, in drying malt or hops, or in raising steam in locomotives within the limits of towns, also for producing strong local heat, as in melting metals (gold, silver, brass, or steel) in crucibles in air furnaces. In blast furnaces its value depends upon the difficulty of combustion, so that the particles keep their form until they reach the proper place of combustion at the point of entry of the blast in the lower part of the furnace. The great economy of fuel that has been effected in the process of iron smelting in the Cleveland district by increasing the height of the furnaces, is in great part due to the strength of the coke used, which is made in the south part of the Durham coal-field, and has sufficient cohesive power to bear the pressure of a column of iron-making materials from 80 to 100 feet in height without crushing, a result which cannot be obtained with the coke of otħer districts. Finely ground coke is used mixed with clay for making crucibles for steel melting, and also for filling the hearths of blast-furnaces in many German smelting works.

Apart from its convenience for special purposes, coke is not an economical fuel, the useful heating effect being about the same as that of an equal weight of coal. This circumstance has led to the nearly general abandonment of coke and the substitution of raw coal as fuel in locomotive engines on railways.
