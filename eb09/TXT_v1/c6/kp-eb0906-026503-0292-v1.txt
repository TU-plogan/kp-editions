CONGLETON, a market-town and municipal borough of England, in the county of Cheshire, near the border of Staffordshire, 2B miles south of Manchester by rail. It is finely situated in a deep valley, on the banks of the Dane, a tributary of the Weaver. Its main streets are well built, and its western suburb consists of handsome villas and gardens. Though a place of considerable antiquity, it makes little figure in history, and possesses few buildings of architectural interest. The parish churches, the guildhall, built in 1822, the market hall, and the town-hall datingfrom 1864 are the most important. At one time the leather laces known as “Congleton points” were in high repute; but the principal industry of the town is now the manufacture of silk, which was introduced in 1752 by a Mr Pattison of London. The making of salt is carried on to an extent which gives employment to nearly 200 men; and at the census of 1871 upwards of 700 were engaged in the neighbouring coal mines. There is canal communication with Macclesfield. In 1871 the population of the municipal borough, which embraces 2564 acres, was 11,344, inhabiting 2559 houses.
