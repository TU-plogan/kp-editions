COPENHAGEN (Danish, Kiöbenhami; Latin, Hafnia or Haunia), the capital of Denmark, is situated at the southern extremity of the Sound, at that part about 20 miles broad, 180 miles north-east of Hamburg, in 55° 40' 52" N. lat. and 12° 35' 46" E. long. The main portion of the city is built on low-lying ground on the east coast of the island of Seeland between the sea and a series of freshwater lakes, known respectively as St Jörgens Sö, Peblings Sö, and Sortedams Sö; a southern and smaller portion, distinguished as Christianshavñ, occupies the northern part of the island of Amager or Amak. An excellent harbour is furnished by the natural channel between the two islands; and communication from one division to the other is afforded by two bridges—the Langebro and the Knippelsbro, the latter of which, an iron structure erected in 1869, has replaced the wooden drawbridge built by Christian IV. in 1620. The older city, including both the Seeland and Amager portions, was formerly surrounded by a complete line of ramparts and moats; but since 1863 these defences are being gradually demolished and filled up, to make way for new streets and squares. Towards the sea the city will be still protected by the citadel of Frederikshavn and several minor forts. Outside of the line of the ramparts, which had a circuit of about five miles, there have sprung up several extensive suburbs,—Oesterbro, Nörrebro, and Vesterbro (East Bridge, North Bridge, and West Bridge) in the Seeland portion, and Amagerbro to the south of Christianshavn; and with these suburbs the city occupies an area of 3200 acres. In the intramural city there are numerous public squares of considerable extent :—Amalienborg Place, or Frederick’s Place, a handsome octagon formed by four palaces of uniform size and design, ajιd having in the centre an equestrian statue of Frederick V., erected in 1768 at the cost of the former Asiatic Company; Kongens Nytorv (the king’s new market, formerly called Hollandsaas) an irregular square, the largest in the city, with an equestrian statue of Christian V. in the centre, remarkable only for its size; the Gammeltory and Nytorv (old and new markets), forming one oblong area; and the Slotsplace on which stand the Christiansborg Palace, the chapel royal, the exchange, and the chancery buildings. A long street called Gothers Gade divides the Seeland portion of the intramural city into two nearly equal halves.

Public Buildings.— The citadel already mentioned is a regular polygon with five bastions, and is connected with the city by an esplanade. It was founded by Frederick III. about 1662-63, and has become associated as a stata prison with the names of Griffenfeld, Struensee, and Brandt.

The royal palace of Christiansborg, originally built by Christian VI., but afterwards destroyed by fire in 1794, has since been rebuilt on an extensive scale. It occupies the site of the old castle of Bishop Absolon, which v as restored at great expense by Frederick IV., and is famous in history for its Blaataarn, or Blue Tower, long used as a state prison. Over the principal entrance are two basreliefs by Thorwaldsen, representing Minerva and Prometheus, Hercules and Hebe, Jupiter and Nemesis, and Aesculapius and Hygeia. The Riddersal (knights’ hall) is a magnificent apartment, 120 feet long, 44 feet high, and [9:6:344] 50 feet wide, with a gallery supported by Corinthian columns. In the great entrance hall is the Triumphal March of Alexander into Babylon by Thorwaldsen. In the upper part of the building is the Royal Gallery of Paintings, enriched by many valuable specimens of the Flemish, Dutch, and Italian schools. The palace also contains the council chamber and the apartments in which both Houses of the Parliament hold their sittings. The large exterior court on the west side forms a riding ground, and is inclosed on both sides by regular buildings with piazzas, containing the court theatre, stables, and riding-house. In connection with the palace is the royal library, with about 550,000 volumes and 30,000 manuscripts; and the chapel, adorned with works by Thorwaldsen and Bissen.

The palace of Rosenborg, supposed to have been planned by Inigo Jones, was erected in 1604. It is an irregular building in the Gothic style, with a high pointed roof, and flanked by four towers of unequal dimensions. It contains the coin and medal cabinet, a fine collection of Venetian glass, the famous silver drinking-horn of Oldenburg, the regalia, and other objects of interest as illustrating the history of Denmark. The Riddersal, a spacious room, is covered with tapestry representing the various battles of Christian V., and has at one end a massive silver throne. The gardens, formerly much more extensive, are open to the public, and afford an agreeable promenade.

The palace of Charlottenborg, on the Kongens Nytorv, which takes its name from Charlotte, the wife of Christian V., is a huge desolate-looking building, built in 1672. Frederick V. made a grant of it to the Academy of Arts, which holds its annual exhibition of paintings and sculpture within its walls, in April and May.

The four palaces on the Amalienborg were built for the residence of four noble families; but on the destruction of Christiansborg in 1794 they became the residence of the king and court, and so continued till the death of Christian VIII. in 1848. At present (1877) one of the four is inhabited by the king, the second by the crown prince, and the third by the queen-dowager, while the fourth is occupied by the foreign office and the principal court of justice or Hojeste Ret.

Prindsens Palais to the west of Christiansborg, once the residence of Christian V. and Frederick VI. when crown princes, now contains the Royal Museum of Art, the Ethnographical Museum, and the Royal Museum of Northern Antiquities. The last named was founded in 1807, and under the management of Mr Worsaae has become the richest collection of Scandinavian antiquities in the world. The chancery buildings, immediately adjoining the Christiansborg, and united to it by a corridor, consist of a large main building erected by Frederick IV., and of three others since added. Here are deposited the privy archives of the state and of the royal family. The townhall and court-house, in the Slotsholm or Castle Island (built 1805-15), contains the municipal council chamber, the police and criminal courts, and other public offices. The exchange, also on the Castle Island, is surmounted by a remarkable spire, formed of four dragons, with their heads directed to the four points of the compass, and their bodies entwining each other till their tads coma to a point at the top.

The Thorwaldsen Museum, built 1837-46 in a combination of the Egyptian and Etruscan styles, is 230 feet in length, 125 feet in breadth, and 46 feet high, and consists of two stories. In the centre is an open court, 116 feet long and 50 feet broad, containing the artist’s tomb. The exterior walls are decorated with groups of figures of coloured stucco, illustrative of events connected with the formation of the museum. Over the principal entrance is the Chariot of Victory drawn by four Horses, executed in bronze from a model by Bissen. The front hall, corridors, and apartments are painted in the Pompeian style, with brilliant colours and with great artistic skill. The museum contains about 300 of Thorwaldsen’s works; and in one apartment is his sitting-room furniture arranged as it was found at the time of his death in 1844.

Educational Buildings.— At the head of the educational institutions is the university, which, with its library and zoological museum, occupies a series of buildings forming a large quadrangle next Frue Kirke. It was founded by Christian I. in 1479; but its present constitution dates from 1788. There are five faculties,—a theological, juridical, medical, philosophical, and mathematical—with thirty-four professors: and the average number of students is about 1000. In 1851 an English, and in 1852 an Anglo-Saxon, lectureship was established. All the professors are bound to give a series of lectures open to the public free of charge. The university possesses considerable endowments and has several foundations for the assistance of poor students; the “regent’s charity,” for instance, founded by Christian, affords free residence and a small allowance to 100 bursars. In connection with the university are the observatory, the chemical laboratory in Ny Vester Gade, the surgical academy in Bred Gade, founded in 1786, and the botanic garden. The university library, formerly lodged in Trinity Church, but now in a special building erected in. 1863, has been incorporated with the former Classen Library, collected by the famous merchants of that name, and now contains about 200,000 volumes, besides about 4000 manuscripts, which include Rask’s valuable Oriental collection and the Arne-Magnean series of Scandinavian documents. It shares with the royal library, which has 550,000 volumes and 30,000 MSS., the right of receiving a copy of every book published in Denmark. Among the other educational institutions may be mentioned the polytechnic school, founded in 1829; the veterinary and agricultural college, established by Abildgaard in 1773, and adopted by the state in 1776; the military academy, and the school of navigation.

Among the literary and scientific associations may be mentioned the Danish Royal Society, founded in 1742, for the advancement of the sciences of mathematics, astronomy, natural philosophy, &c., by the publication of papers and essays; the Royal Antiquarian Society, founded in 1825, for diffusing a knowledge of Northern and Icelandic archaeology, and stimulated by the efforts of such men as Thomsen, Rape, Finn Magnusen, and Petersen; the Society for the Promotion of Danish Literature, for the publication of works chiefly connected with the history of Danish literature; the Natural Philosophy Society; the Royal Agricultural Society; the Danish Church History Society; the Industrial Association, founded in 1838, the Royal Geographical Society, established in 1876; and several musical and other societies. The Academy of Arts was founded by Frederick V. in 1754, for the instruction of artists, and for disseminating a taste for the fine arts among manufacturers and operatives. Attached to it are schools for the study of architecture, ornamental drawing, and modelling. An Art Union was founded in 1826, and a musical conservatorium in 1870, under the direction of the composers Gade and Hartmann.

Churches.— The principal church, or cathedral, the Frue Kirke (Church of our Lady), was almost entirely destroyed in the bombardment of 1807, but was completely restored in 1811-29. The works of Thorwaldsen, by which it is adorned, constitute its chief attraction. In the pediment is a group in terra cotta of sixteen figures, representing John the Baptist preaching in the wilderness; over the entrance within the portico is a bas-relief of Christ’s entrance into Jerusalem ∙. on one side of the entrance is a [9:6:345] statue of Moses by Bissen, and on the other a statue of David by Jerichan. In a niche behind the altar stands a colossal marble statue of our Saviour, and marble statues of the twelve apostles adorn both sides of the church. Nearly opposite the Frue Kirke is St Peter's Church, built i.ι a quasi-Gothic style, with a spire 260 feet high, and appropriated since 1585 as a parish church for the German residents in Copenhagen. The round tower of Trinity Church is 115 feet high, and is considered to be unique in Europe. It was constructed from a plan of Tycho Brahe’s favourite disciple Longomontanus, and was formerly used as an observatory. It is ascended by a broad inclined spiral way, up which Peter the Great is said to have driven in a carriage and four. The Church of our Saviour in Christianshavn, dedicated in 1696, has a curious steeple 300 feet high, ascended by an external spiral staircase. The lower part of the altar is composed of Italian marble, with a representation of Christ’s sufferings in the garden of Gethsemane; and the organ is considered the finest in Copenhagen. The Marble Church, intended to have been an edifice of great extent and magnificence, was commenced in the reign of Frederick V., but after twenty years was left unfinished. The Holmens Kirke, or church for the royal navy, originally erected as an anchor-smithy by Frederick II., but consecrated by Christian IV., is remarkable for a chapel containing the tombs of the great admirals Niels Juel and Tordenskjold. The churches above mentioned belong to the national Lutheran Church; the most important of those belonging to other denominations are the Reformed church, founded in 1688, and rebuilt in 1731, the Catholic church of St Ansgarius, consecrated in 1842, ’and the Jewish synagogue in Krystalgade, which dates from 1853.

Of the monastic buildings of mediaeval Copenhagen various traces are preserved in the present nomenclature of the streets. The Franciscan establishment gives its name to the Graabrödretorv or Grey Friars’ market; and St Clara’s Monastery, the largest of all, which was founded by Queen Christina, is still commemorated by the Klareboder or Clara buildings, near the present post-office. The Duebrödre Kloster occupied the site of the hospital of the Holy Ghost.

Hospitals.— Among the hospitals of Copenhagen the most important are Frederick’s Hospital, erected in 1752-57 by Frederick V., with accommodation for 600 patients; the Communal Hospital, erected in 1859-63, on the eastern side of the Sortedamssö, with room for 850; the General Hospital in Amalia Street, founded in 1769; the Garrison Hospital, in Rigens Gade or Empire Street, established in 1816 by Frederick VI.; a children’s hospital in the same street dating from 1849; and a maternity hospital with a school of midwifery. The lunatic asylum for Copenhagen is situated at Roskilde. Of the numerous benevolent institutions in the city it is sufficient to mention Barton Hospital, dedicated by its founder, Christian I., to the Holy Ghost, with accommodation for 508 inmates; Abel Kathrine’s Buildings for 24 poor women; the Copenhagen Invalids’ Home, erected in 1857-59; an orphan asylum, dating from 1727; a blind asylum, erected in 1811 by a private society; a deaf and dumb asylum, founded in 1807; and an asylum for imbeciles, established in 1855. The Jewish community has several important institutions of its own. After the cholera epidemic of 1853 the medical association built several ranges of workmen’s houses, and their example has been followed by various private capitalists, among whom may be mentioned the Classen trustees, whose buildings occupy an open site on the western outskirts of the city.

Theatres.— The principal theatre is the Royal, on Kongens Nytorv, a beautiful edifice of modem erection on the site of a former building of the same name which dates from 1748. Statues of Holberg and Oehlenschläger, the former by Stein and the latter by Bissen, keep watch on either side of the entrance, and the front is crowned by a group by King, representing Apollo and Pegasus and the fountain of Hippocrene. The royal court theatre is elegantly fitted up, and can accommodate about 800 spectators. The Vesterbro Theatre, outside the western gate, is seated for about 1400 persons. The casino, built in 1846, is used as a theatre, and is capable of containing about 2300 spectators; while the small saloon in the same building, seated for from 600 to 700 persons, is usually let for concerts and similar entertainments. The Tivoli Gardens, immediately beyond the western gate, form the favourite place of resort in the summer evenings. The amusements include concerts, pantomimes, gymnastic feats, and other performances. A freemasons’ lodge was founded in 1870, the building being erected after the designs of Tvede.

In the neighbourhood of the city there are numerous places of public resort,—the most important being Frederiksbërg, with its royal palace, its park, and its zoological gardens, about a mile and a half from the old west gate, and the Dyrehave about six miles to the north, with its fine forest of beech and oak.

Trade.— Copenhagen is becoming more and more the commercial centre of Denmark; its local industries and its foreign trade are both making rapid advances. At the commencement of 1872, 500 merchant vessels of about 51,000 tons burden belonged to the port. The harbour is large and commodious, and by the aid of canals, large vessels can come almost to the centre of the town. The entrance is commanded by the powerful batteries of Trekroner, Provesten, and Sextus. The principal imports are timber, pitch, and tar, chiefly from Norway and Sweden; flax, hemp, masts, sailcloth, and cordage from Russia; tobacco from America; wines and brandy from France; coal, earthenware, iron, steel, and salt from England; and West India produce. The principal exports are corn, rape-seed, butter, cheese, beef, pork, horses, cattle, wool, hides, skins, bones, and grain-spirits.

There are extensive cloth and calico factories, foundries, and iron-works, as well as breweries, distilleries, tanneries, sugar-refineries, lime-works, and tobacco-factories. Pianofortes, clocks, watches, sαrgical and mathematical instruments, and porcelain are among its other productions. The royal China factory is celebrated for its models of Thorwaldsen’s works in biscuit China. Among institutions for the furthering of commerce, the most important besides the Exchange are the National Bank, with a capital of £2,190,000, the Private Bank, the Industrial, the Agricultural, and the Commercial. A large Industrial Exhibition was held in 1872; and the building, which is situated at the western side of the town near the railway station, is intended to be permanent. The population of Copenhagen in 1769 was 92,571; in 1801, 100,975; in 1834, 119,292; in 1840, 120,819; in 1845, 126,787; in 1850, 129,695; in 1860, 155,143; and in 1870, 184,291. In the last year the number of females was 96,965, and that, of males 89,326; there were 3145 Jews, 1092 Catholics, 220 Baptists, and 172 Mormons. Including the suburbs, the population in 1876 was estimated at 233,000.

History.— The first mention of Copenhagen in Danish history belongs to the year 1027, when the kings of Norway and Sweden took advantage of the absence of Canute in England to attack his kingdom. It is called merely the Höfn or Haven; and it was still only a fishing village about the middle of the 12th century, when Valdemar I. presented that part of the island to Axel Hvide, renowned in Danish history as Absolon, bishop of Roskilde, and afterwards archbishop of Lund. In 1165, or shortly after, this prelate erected a castle on the spot where the Christiansborg palace now stands, and the building Was called after him Axel-huus. The settlement gradually became a great resort for merchants, and thus [9:6:346] acquired the name which, in a corrupted form, it still bears, of Kaupmannahöfn, Kjöbmannshavn, or Portus Mercatorum, as it is translated by Saxo Grammaticus. Bishop Absolon bestowed the castle and village, with the lands of Amager, on the see of Roskilde; and Bishop Erlandsen granted the little community municipal rights and privileges, which were confirmed and augmented in 1284 by King Eric Glypping. Meanwhile its prosperity was checked by aι. attack by the people of Lübeck in 1248, and by another on the part of Prince Yarimar of Riga in 1259. In 1306 it managed to repel the Norwegians, but in 1362, and again in 1368, it was captured by the opponents of Valdemar Atterdag. In the following century a new enemy appeared in the Hanseatic League, which was jealous of its rivalry, but their invasion was frustrated by Queen Philippa. Various attempts were made by successive kings to obtain the town from the see of Roskilde, as the most suitable for the Royal residence; but it was not till 1443 that the transference was effected, and Copenhagen became the capital of the kingdom. From 1523 to 1524 it held out for Christian II. against Frederick I.; and it was only after a year’s siege that it yielded in 1536 to Christian III. From 1658 to 1660 it was unsuccessfully beleaguered by Charles Gustavus of Sweden; and in the following year it was rewarded by various privileges for its gallant defence. In 1660 it gave its name to the treaty which concluded the Swedish war of Frederick III. In 1700 it was bombarded by the united fleets of England, Holland, and Sweden; in 1728 a conflagration destroyed 1640 houses and five churches; another in 1794 consumed the Christiansborg; and a third in 1795 laid waste 943 houses, the church of St Nicolas, and the Town House. In 1801 the Danish fleet was destroyed in the roadstead by the English, under Nelson; and in 1807 the city was bombarded by the British army under Lord Cathcart, and saw the destruction of the university buildings, its principal church, and numerous other edifices. In 1853 it lost 4100 of its population from cholera.
