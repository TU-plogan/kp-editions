COVILHA, a town of Portugal, in the province of Beira-baixa, on the south-eastern slope of the highest part of the Serra da Estrella, where it descends to the upper valley of the River Zezere, 30 miles north of Castello-Branco, to which district it belongs. The town, which is perched on the declivity in the form of an amphitheatre, has been compared to a collection of swallows’ nests, and is 2180 feet above the sea. It has several churches and convents. Population (1864), 9022. The people are chiefly employed in the manufacture of the brown cloth called saragoça, which is worn throughout Portugal. At the village of Ünhacs-da-Serra, five miles λV.S.λV., there are noted sulphurous baths.
