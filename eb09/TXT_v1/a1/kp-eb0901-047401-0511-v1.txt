ALDERSHOTT CAMP, a standing garrison for a large force, situated about 35 miles from London, on the confines of Hampshire and Surrey. It was established in May 1855, and was intended as a military training school, especially for officers of the higher grades. Its germ is to be found in the temporary camp on Chobham Ridges, formed in 1853 by Lord Hardinge, then commander-in-chief, the success of which convinced him of the necessity of giving our troops practical instruction in the field, and affording our generals opportunities of manoeuvring large bodies of the three arms. He therefore advised the purchase of a tract of waste land whereon a permanent camp might be established. His choice fell on Aldershott, a spot also recommended by strategic reasons, being so placed that a force holding it covered the capital. Nothing came of Lord Hardinge’s proposal till the experience of the Crimean campaign fully endorsed his opinion. The lands at Aldershott—an extensive open heath country, sparsely dotted by fir woods and intersected by the Basingstoke canal—were then acquired by the Crown. The first occupants of the camp were two battalions of the Guards and seven of embodied militia. On the return of the Crimean army, cavalry, artillery, and infantry of the line arrived and took possession of the fines of wooden huts and the permanent barracks, which had by this time been erected. Since then Aldershott has varied little in its principal features. It is separated into two grand divisions, styled the north and south camps. Beyond the latter are the permanent cavalry and infantry barracks and the queen’s pavilion. Farnham is the nearest town, being only 4 miles from the south camp; Guildford and Godaiming are 10 and 12 respectively, Windsor 18½, and Reading 21 miles. The soil on which the camp stands is a light peat, and a fruitful source of discomfort to its inhabitants. A little wet turns it into tenacious mud, while a little sunshine produces a black dust, not soon forgotten by those who have campaigned in the “Long Valley.” The force stationed at Aldershott at the beginning of 1874 was composed of 1 cavalry and 3 infantry brigades; in the former there were 3 full regiments, in the latter a total of 11 battalions, with several depots of regiments abroad. Besides these, there were 2 batteries of horse and 6 of field artillery, 2 companies of Royal Engineers, and 4 troops of Royal Engineers’ train (with pontoon, &c.); 7 companies of the Army Service Corps and 2 of the Army Hospital Corps—to provide for transport, and the services of bakehouse and slaughterhouse and hospital—made up the total strength of all ranks, as shown in the returns dated 1st January 1874, to 10,601 men, 2198 horses, and 48 guns. It is a lieutenant-general’s command, and one highly prized, from its essentially military character and the practical experience it affords in handling a considerable force. Sir William Knollys (afterwards comptroller of the household to the Prince of Wales) was its first chief. He was succeeded by Sir John Pennefather; Sir James Scarlett followed; then Sir Hope Grant, who held the command in 1874. Naturally so large a military colony soon attracted other elements to Aldershott heath. Within a few years a town of Aldershott sprang up close by, and increased rapidly. Here the professions and all trades are well represented; there are respectable solicitors, surgeons, bankers, brewers, many schools, a steam printing press, a weekly military paper, and numerous shops. During the summer months or “drill season” the camp is a scene of incessant activity; field-days and parades follow in rapid succession, and owing to the camp’s accessibility from London, the troops are often turned out at a few hours’ notice to make a show for royalty or foreign visitors. Yet there is much to beguile vacant hours; many clubs—for cricket, croquet, racquets, and the drama—a gymnasium, and several excellent libraries. Admirable charities also exist for the assistance and relief of the soldiers’ wives and children. (a. g.)
