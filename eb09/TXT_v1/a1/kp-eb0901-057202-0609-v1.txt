+=====================================================================+


ALI, the fourth in order of the caliphs or successors of Mahomet, was born at Mecca, about the year 600 a.d. His father, Abu Taleb, was an uncle of the prophet, and Ali himself was adopted by Mahomet and educated under his care. While he was still a mere boy he distinguished himself by being the first to declare his adhesion to the cause of Mahomet, who in return made him his vicegerent, and some years after gave him his daughter Fatima in marriage. Ali proved himself to be a brave and faithful soldier; and when Mahomet died without male issue, he seemed to have the best claims to become the recognised head of Islamism. Three other companions of Mahomet, however, Abubekr, Omar, and Othman, occupied this position before him, and it was not until 656, after the murder of Othman, that he assumed the title of caliph. Almost the first act of his reign was the suppression of a rebellion under Telha and Zobeir, who were instigated by Ayesha, the widow of Mahomet, a bitter enemy of Ali, and hitherto one of the chief hindrances to his advancement to the caliphate. The rebel army was defeated at Kharibah, near Bassorah, the two generals being killed, and Ayesha taken prisoner. Ali’s next care was to get rid of the opposition of Moawyah, who had established himself in Syria at the head of a numerous army. A bloody battle took place in the plain of Suffein, near the Euphrates, which seemed at first to be going in favour of Ali; when suddenly a number of the enemy, fixing copies of the Koran to the points of their spears, exclaimed that “the matter ought to be settled by reference to this book, which forbids Mussulmans to shed each other’s blood.” On hearing this the superstitious soldiers of Ali refused to fight any longer, and demanded that the matter should be referred to arbitration. Abu Musa was appointed umpire on the part of Ali, and Amru, one of the shrewdest men in the kingdom, on the part of Moawyah. Amru persuaded Abu Musa that it would be for the advantage of Moslemism that neither candidate should reign; and also, with a pretence of deference, asked him to give his decision first. Abu Musa, falling into the snare, proclaimed that he deposed both Ali and Moawyah; thereupon Amru declared that he also deposed Ali, but that he invested Moawyah with the caliphate. This treacherous decision greatly injured the cause of Ali, which was still further weakened by the loss of Egypt, Syria, and Persia, including the sacred cities of Mecca and Medina. Ali, however, resolved to make a final effort, and collected a large army for that purpose. He was not destined to see the result of his plans. Three of the fanatic sect of the Karigites made an agreement to assassinate Ali, Moawyah, and Amru as the authors of disastrous feuds among the faithful. The only victim of this plot was Ali, who died at Kufa in 661, of the wound inflicted by a poisoned weapon. He had eight wives besides Fatima, and in all, it is said, thirty-three children, one of whom, Hassan, a son of Fatima, succeeded him in the caliphate. Ali is described as a bold, noble, and generous man, “the last and worthiest of the primitive Moslems, who imbibed his religious enthusiasm from companionship with the prophet himself, and who followed to the last the simplicity of his example.” He was also remarkable for learning and wisdom, and there are still extant collections of proverbs, verses, &c., which bear his name, especially the Sentences of Ali, an English translation of which, by William Yule, was published at Edinburgh in 1832. The question of All’s right to succeed to the caliphate is an article of faith which divided the Mahometan world into two great sects, the Sunnis and the Shiahs, the former denying and the latter affirming his right. The Turks, consequently, who are usually Sunnis, hold his memory in abhorrence; whereas the Persians, who are generally Shiahs, venerate him as second only to the prophet, and celebrate the anniversary of his martyrdom.
