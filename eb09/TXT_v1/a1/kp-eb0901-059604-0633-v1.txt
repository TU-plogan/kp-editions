ALNWICK, the county town of Northumberland, is situated on the south bank of the river Alne, 310 miles N. of London, 34 N. of Newcastle, and 29 S. of Berwick. There are remains of the old wall which surrounded the town, and one of the four gates still exists; but most of the houses are comparatively modern, and are laid out in well-paved spacious streets. In the market-place there is a large town-hall, and a handsome building containing an assembly-room and a reading-room. Besides the parish church, Alnwick possesses a beautiful district church, a Roman Catholic chapel, and several Protestant dissenting places of worship. The chief employments are brewing, tanning, and brickmaking, but these manufactures are here of little importance. A small export trade is carried on through Alnmouth in corn, pork, and eggs, and a market is held every Saturday chiefly for these articles. The local government consists of a bailiff, nominated by the Duke of Northumberland, and twenty-four common councilmen, four of whom are elected annually as chamberlains; the councilmen fill up vacancies in their body from the freemen, who usually are about 300 in number. The ceremony of making freemen is of a very peculiar kind. The candidates, mounted on horseback, assemble in the market-place very early in the morning of St Mark’s day— the 25 th April—clad in white from head to foot, with swords by their sides, and attended by the bailiff and chamberlains, who are mounted and armed in the same manner. From the market-place they proceed, with music playing before them, to a large pool called Freeman’s Well, where they dismount and draw up in a body at some distance from the water, and, on a given signal from the bailiff, rush into the pool, and scramble through the mud as fast as they can. As the water is generally very foul, they come out in a dirty condition; but they put on dry clothes, remount their horses, and ride at full gallop round the boundaries of the town. According to tradition, the observance of this custom was enjoined by King John to punish the inhabitants for their carelessness, the king having, it is said, lost his way, and been bemired in a bog, from their neglect of the roads near the town. To the [9:1:597] north west of the town is Alnwick Castle, which has belonged to the Northumberland family since 1310. In early times this fortress was an important defence against the Scotch, and was besieged by them on several occasions, most memorably in 1093, when Malcolm Canmore and his son Edward were slain under its walls; and in 1174, when William the Lion was defeated and taken prisoner. For a long time it was permitted to fall into decay, but it has recently been restored, and to some extent remodelled, and is now one of the most magnificent specimens of a baronial residence in England. The grounds are extensive, and contain the remains of two abbeys, Alnwick and Hulme. The population of Alnwick in 1871 was 5822.
