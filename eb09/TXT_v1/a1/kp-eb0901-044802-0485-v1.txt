ALBANO, a town and lake in the Campagna di Roma, Italy, about 14 miles S.E. of Rome. The town is much admired for the picturesque scenery around it. It is well built, and the Roman aqueduct and other monuments of antiquity are in tolerable preservation. It contains a cathedral, and there are many handsome villas of the Roman nobles in the vicinity. Population, 6400. The lake of Albano, lying to the N.E. of the town, occupies the crater of an extinct volcano, and is of a beautiful oval form, surrounded with high wooded banks, and about 7 miles in circumference. It has long been an object of attraction to the painter and the traveller. In the fourth century of ancient Rome, during the siege of Veii, there was an extraordinary rise of the waters of this lake, and the oracle declared that there was no hope of success against Veii while the Alban lake was allowed thus to swell. This prompted the Romans to drain it by a tunnel cut through the rock, a mile and a half in length, 4 feet wide, and 6 high, which is still perfect. This outlet keeps the surface of the lake at the height of 920 feet above the level of the sea. Monte Cavo, the ancient Albanus, rises on the eastern side of the lake to a height of 3000 feet, and commands a magnificent prospect. On its summit stood the famous temple of Jupiter Latialis.
