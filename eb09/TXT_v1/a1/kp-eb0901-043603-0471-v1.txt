AKERMAN, John Yonge, an antiquarian, distinguished chiefly in the department of numismatics, was born in Wiltshire on the 12th June 1806. He became early known in connection with his favourite study, having initiated the Numismatic Journal in 1836. In the following year he became the secretary of the newly-established Numismatic Society. In 1848 he was elected secretary to the Society of Antiquaries, an office which he was compelled to resign in 1860 on account of failing health. He died on 18th November 1873. Akerman published a considerable number of works on his special subject, the more important being a Catalogue of Roman Coins (1839); a Numismatic Manual (1840); Roman Coins relating to Britain (1844), for which he received the medal of the French Institute; Ancient Coins— Hispania, Gallia, Britannia (1846); and Numismatic Illustrations of the New Testament (1846). He wrote also a Glossary of Words used in Wiltshire (1842); Wiltshire Tales, illustrative of the Dialect (1853); and Remains of Pagan Saxondom (1855).
