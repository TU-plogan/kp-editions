AMPHIARAUS, in Greek legend, a son of Oi’cles and Hypermnestra, descended on the paternal side from the kingly seer Melampus, and, like his ancestor, endowed with the prophetic gift; but at the same time known for hie valour in the great enterprises of his time—the expedition of the Argonauts and the hunt of the Calydonian boar. The expedition, however, on which the chief events of his life hinge is that of the Seven against Thebes, into which he was unwillingly driven by the treachery of his wife, Eriphyle {Odyssey, xi. 326), a sister of Adrastus, who then ruled in Sicyon, and by whom the enterprise was planned to restore Polynices to the throne of Thebes. As prince of Argos, Amphiaraus was in a position to assist greatly; but when called upon by Adrastus to take a part, he declined, on the ground that the cause was unholy, and would end fatally. His marriage with Eriphyle, however, had not only been meant to heal previous quarrels between him and Adrastus, but was to be a bond of peace for the future in this way, that she should always arbitrate between them. To secure her favour now, Polynices gave her the fatal necklace which Cadmus had once given to Harmonia, and, though warned of the consequences, Eriphyle accepted it and decided against her husband. Knowing that he would never return, Amphiaraus enjoined his son Alcmaeon, then a boy, to avenge his death upon his mother; and to his children generally he gave wise counsel. As he stepped into his chariot to depart he turned with a look of anger towards his wife, a scene which was represented on the chest of Cypselus. The assault of Thebes was disastrous to the Seven; and Amphiaraus, pursued by Periclymenus, would have fallen by his spear had not Jupiter, at a critical moment, struck the earth with a thunderbolt, and caused it to open and swallow him with his horses, Thoas and Dias, his chariot, and his charioteer, Baton. Jupiter and Apollo, it is said in the Odyssey (xv. 245), loved Amphiaraus dearly; yet he did not reach an old age, but fell at Thebes, through the gift accepted by his wife. After death he continued, as a deified hero, to exercise his prophetic power by giving oracles on the spot where he had sunk into the earth. In earlier times this was believed to have happened at Harma, on the way from Thebes to Potniae, and it was there that the oracle of Amphiaraus was which Croesus and Mardonius consulted {Herodotus, i. 49, 52; viii. 134). Afterwards this oracle yielded to that in the neighbourhood of Oropus, where was also a sanctuary to Amphiaraus (Jupiter Amphiaraus, as he was styled), with athletic and [9:1:750] musical festivals in his honour, and with a sacred enclosure (temenos) in which were two springs. At one of them he was thought to have risen from the lower world, and hence its water was employed for no sacred purpose. Invalids who had been cured by oracular prescriptions threw a piece of money in it. The water of the other spring was excellent to drink and to bathe in (Άμφιαράου λουτρά). The oracles were conveyed in dreams, to obtain which it was necessary to fast for a time, then to offer sacrifice at the great altar (Pausanias, L 34, 2), and again to sacrifice a ram and to sleep on its skin. The ruins of the temple, with inscriptions which identify them as such, exist still at Maurodilissi, in the ancient Oropia. In the derivation of his name from άμφι-άράομαι, the piety for which Amphiaraus was celebrated is expressed. (a. s. μ.)
