ANAGRAM, the transposition of the letters of a word or words, is derived from the Greek άνάγραμμα, which was used in precisely the same sense. But the number of different ways in which even a few letters can be arranged being very great (with eight different letters, for instance, it is l×2×3×4×5χ6×7×8 = 40,320), the term anagram is generally restricted to such rearrangements of the letters as form other words, and these usually words which express a meaning. Camden (Remains, 7th ed., 1674) defines “Anagrammatisme” as “a dissolution of a name truly written into his letters, as his elements, and a new connection of it by artificial transposition, without addition, substraction, or change of any letter, into different words, making some perfect sence applyable to the person named.” Considering the amount of labour that has been spent (or misspent) in transpositions of this kind,—in “torturing one poor word ten thousand ways,”—the anagrams that display a felicitous perfection of “applyable sence” are remarkably few. Among the best are the anagrammatic answer to Pilate’s question, “Quid est veritas?” — namely, “ .Est vir qui adest;” and the transposition of “Horatio Nelson” into “Honor est a Nilo;’ and of “Florence Nightingale” into “Flit on, cheering angel.” James I.’s courtiers discovered in “James Stuart” “A just master,” and converted “Charles James Stuart” into “Claimes Arthur’s seat.” “Eleanor Audeley,” wife of Sir John Davies, is said to have been brought before the High Commission in 1634 for extravagances, stimulated by the discovery that her name could be transposed to “Reveale, 0 Daniel,” and to have been laughed out of court by another anagram submitted by the Dean of the Arches, “Dame Eleanor Davies,” “Never soe mad a ladie.” There must be few names that could furnish so many anagrams as that of “Augustus do [9:1:791] Morgan,” who tells that a friend had constructed about 800 on his name, specimens of which are given in his Budget of Paradoxes, p. 82. The pseudonyms adopted by authors are often transposed forms, more or less exact, Of their names; thus “Calvinus” becomes “Alcuinus;” “François Rabelais,” “Alcofribas Nasier;” “Bryan Waller Proctor,” “Barry Cornwall, poet;” “Henry Rogers,” “R. E. H. Greyson,” <fcc. It is to be noted that the last two are impure anagrams, an “r” being left out in both cases. “Telliamed,” a simple reversal, is the title of a well-known work by “De Maillet.” The most remarkable pseudonym of this class is the name “Voltaire,” which the celebrated philosopher assumed instead of his family name, “François Marie Arouet,” and which is now generally allowed to be an anagram of “Arouet, Lj.,” that is, Arouet the younger. Perhaps the only practical use to which anagrams have been turned is to be found in the transpositions in which some of the astronomers of the 17th century embodied their discoveries, with the design apparently of avoiding the risk that, while they were engaged in further verification, the credit of what they had found out might be claimed by others. Thus Galileo announced his discovery that Venus had phases like the moon in the form, ,t Hoec immatura a me jam frustra leguntur — oy,” that is, “Cynthia: figuras aemulatur Mater Amorum.”
