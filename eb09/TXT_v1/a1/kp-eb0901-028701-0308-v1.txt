It is the seat of the governor of Slavonia and Croatia, of a bishop, of the courts of justice, and of the meetings of the provincial diet. Agram is divided into three parts, called the upper and lower towns, and the town of the bishop. It has a lyceum, library, museum, gymnasium, an ancient cathedral, and a large library. Some silk and porcelain are manufactured, and a brisk trade is carried on in grain, potash, tobacco, and honey. Population in 1869, 19,857.
