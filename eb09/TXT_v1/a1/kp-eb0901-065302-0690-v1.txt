AMARAPURA, literally “the City of the Gods,” a town of independent Burmah, situated on the east bank of the Irawadí river, in 21° 57' N. lat., and 73° 4' E. long. The town was founded in 1783, and made the capital of the Burmese kingdom. It increased rapidly in size and population, and in 1810 was estimated to contain 170,000 inhabitants; but in that year the town was destroyed by fire, and this disaster, together with the removal of the native court in 1819, caused a decline in the prosperity of the place. In 1827 its population was estimated at only 30,000. Since then it has suffered another severe calamity from an earthquake, which in 1839 destroyed the greater part of the city. It is regularly laid out, but, with the exception of some temples, is built only of bamboos, although several of the buildings, being richly gilt, have a showy appearance. The most remarkable edifice is a celebrated temple, adorned with 250 lofty pillars of gilt wood, and containing a colossal bronze statue of Buddha. The remains of the ancient palace of the Burmese monarchs still survive in the centre of the town. During the time of its prosperity Amarapura was defended by a rampart and a large square citadel, with a broad moat, the walls being 7000 feet long and 20 feet high, with a bastion at each corner.
