AL-FARABI, Abu Nasr Muhammad Ibn Tarkhan, one of the earliest Arabian philosophers, flourished during the former half of the 10th century. Philosophy, among the Arabs, was originally an extension of the related sciences of astronomy and medicine, and the first philosophers were physicians. The more eminent of them were court physicians, and to this they doubtless owed their protection against the jealous suspicions of the Mahometan sects. Al-Farabi is supposed (for the detailed accounts of his life are legendary) to have concerned himself more with the theory than the practice of medicine; but he is known to have been a physician at the court of Seif-Eddaula, and died when it was at Damascus in 950. Unlike some of his successors, notably Avicenna, he was an ascetic, and his philosophy, which has a slight Platonic infusion, bears traces of the contrast. He was unsystematic, and the sketches and aphorisms of his which have come down to us (many of his treatises are still in MS.) only partially enable us to reconstruct his philosophy. In his opusculum He Scientiis he enumerates six orders of sciences :—(1.) Language, by which he means little more than grammar. (2.) Logic, which he names as an art, conceives generally as a science, and confounds in its details with the corresponding art, with rhetoric, and with criticism. (3.) The mathematical sciences, embracing geometry, arithmetic, optics, the science of the stars, music, and the sciences of weights and of capacities (ingenia). Arithmetic is abstract and concrete; geometry is active, passive, and speculative; and the science of the stars includes astronomy, astrology, the science of climates, and of dreams and auguries. (4.) The natural sciences, ten in number. (5.) Civil science, including judicial science and rhetoric. (6.) Divine science, or metaphysics. This hierarchy has striking approximations to the most modern classifications. Logic and mathematics, the most abstract sciences, are near the beginning, if not quite first; what stands for social science follows the physical concrete sciences; and the distinction between abstract and concrete, which Comte made one of the bases of his classification, and which has been more accurately discriminated by Spencer, is on the whole clearly seized. But art is throughout confounded with science; superstitions are mixed up with facts; physical and mental phenomena are not always separated; the subjective and the objective (learning and science) are confused, as they afterwards were by Bacon; and there is no science of man—man was not yet conceived, metaphysically, as an individual. This agrees with Al-Farabi’s science of politics as expounded in another work, in which he follows his master, Aristotle, in denying the permanence of the individual soul, and anticipates the Averrhoistic doctrine of the unity of souls. For his metaphysics is Peripatetic, as Peripateticism was interpreted by the Neo-Platonist commentators on Aristotle. Starting with the distinction between the possible and the necessary, he assumes that there must be some supreme necessary existence which accounts for all actual existence. This supreme existence has infinite life, wisdom, power, beauty, goodness, &c., but it is an absolute unity, and is without distinguishable attributes. How does the world, with its infinite [9:1:502] multiplicity and diversity, issue from this absolutely one and identical being? Here Al-Farabi neo-platonises. It proceeds by emanation. The absolute Being knows itself, and in virtue of this knowledge the first intelligence exists. He does not explain how self-consciousness comes to be inseparable from necessary existence, but his dynamic, at this and all the lower stages, is self-knowledge; and indeed the act of knowing and the resultant existence appear at this height of abstraction to be all but identical. The first intelligence, intrinsically a unity, contains multiplicity, because it is no longer devoid of attributes. In so far as it necessarily exists, it evolves the second intelligence; in so far as it is merely potential being, and knows itself, it evolves the world-soul and the uppermost world-circle, which is moved by that soul. Similarly descending intelligences, ever-wider world-circles and the corresponding souls, are evolved by the same process of emanation, down to the active reason, which is most nearly related to the earthly elements and human souls. The active reason, by its contact with matter, impresses on it forms, of which the human soul is one, with greater or less permanence according to the degree in which it is immersed in, or rises above, matter. The forms decline in permanence the further we descend below the active reason, and the matter which has least form is the limit of emanation. There is here nothing like what is now called evolution: the conception of the universe is, as in all theories of emanation, really statical, not dynamical, for the ideas of cause and perpetual causation do not yet exist; and of course the process is the reverse of that implied in the modem development theory.
