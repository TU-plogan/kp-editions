AMRÂOTÎ, a district and city of India, in the commissionership of East Berar, within the Haidarâbâd assigned districts. The district lies between 20° 23' and 21° 7' N. lat., and between 77° 24' and 78° 13' E. long. It is bounded on the N. by the Elichpur district; on the E. by the Wardhâ river, separating it from the central provinces; on the S. by the Bâsim and Wùn districts; and on the W. by Akolâ district. The area is estimated at 2566 square miles, but the survey has not yet been completed. The population in 1867 was returned at 407,276 souls, which, taking the area as given above, would show an average density of 158 persons per square mile; number of males, 212,575; females, 194,701; the proportion of males to the total population being 52 19 per cent. The district consists of an extensive plain, about 800 feet above sea-level, the general flatness being only broken by a small chain of hills, running in a north-westerly direction, between Amrâoti and Chândor, with an average height of from 400 to 500 feet above the level of the lowlands. Four towns are returned as containing a population exceeding 5000 souls—namely, Amrâoti, population 23,410; Karinjâ, a considerable commercial town, population 11,750; Badnerâ, a town on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, which intersects the district, population 6876, Kolâpur, population 6169.
