AMES, Fisher, an eminent American statesman and political writer, son of Nathaniel Ames, a physician, was born at Dedham, in Massachusetts, on 9th April 1758. He studied at Harvard college, where he graduated in 1774. After practising the law for some little time, he abandoned that profession for the more congenial pursuit of politics, and in 1788 became a member of the Massachusetts convention for ratifying the constitution. In this assembly he bore a conspicuous part, and in the next year, having passed to the house of representatives in the state legislature, he distinguished himself greatly by his eloquence and sprightliness and readiness in debate. During the eight years of Washington’s administration he took a prominent part in the national councils; and on Washington’s retirement, he returned to his residence at Dedham to resume the practice of the law, which the state of his health after a few years obliged him to relinquish. He still continued his literary labours, and published numerous essays, chiefly in relation to the contest between Great Britain and revolutionary France, as it might affect the liberty and prosperity of America. Four years before hi3 death he was chosen president of Harvard college, an honour which his broken state of health obliged him to decline. Ho died on the 4th July 1808, admired and respected by his countrymen from the brilliancy of his talents and his private virtues. His writings, which abound in sparkling passages, displaying great fertility of imagination, were collected and published, with a memoir of the author, in 1809, by the Rev. Dr Kirkland, in one large octavo volume. A more complete edition in two volumes was published by his son, Seth Ames, in 1854.
