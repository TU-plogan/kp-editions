AMERICA

OUR object in this article is to take a comprehensive survey of the American continent in its physical. moral, and political relations. In attempting this, we shall dwell at some length upon those great features and peculiarities which belong to it as a whole, or facts which can be most advantageously considered in connection with one another. The new continent may be styled emphatically “a land of promise.” The present there derives its greatest importance from the germs it contains of a mighty future. It is this prospective greatness which lends an interest to the Western continent similar to that which the Eastern derives from its historical associations. But the Western continent also has its past, which abounds in points of interest relating to both the historic and prehistoric periods. Facts show that although America may be called the New World in consequence of its having been the last to come under the general knowledge of geographers, it is from most other points of view an old world. It abounds in the oldest known strata; it has yielded some of the oldest known remains of man, indicating that he has long been a denizen there; and it has afforded evidences of a civilised era, which may even have preceded that of Western Europe.

The new continent, when compared with the old, enjoys three important advantages. First, it is free from such vast deserts as cover a large part of the surface of Asia and Africa, and which not only withdraw a great proportion of the soil from the use of man, but are obstacles to communication between the settled districts, and generate that excessive heat which is often injurious to health, and always destructive to industry. Secondly, no part of its soil is so far from the ocean as the central regions of Asia and Africa. Thirdly, the interior of America is penetrated by majestic rivers, the Mississippi, Amazon, and Plata, greatly surpassing those of the old continent in magnitude, and still more in the facilities they present for enabling the remotest inland districts to communicate with the sea.

In the physical formation of North and South America there is a remarkable resemblance. Both are very broad in the north, and gradually contract towards the south till they end, the one in a narrow isthmus, and the other in a narrow promontory. Each has a lofty chain of mountains near its western coast, abounding in volcanoes, with a lower ridge on the opposite side, destitute of any recent trace of internal fire; and each has one great central plain declining to the south and the north, and watered by two gigantic streams, the Mississippi, corresponding to the Plata, and the St Lawrence to the Amazon. In their climate, vegetable productions, and animal tribes, the two regions are very dissimilar.

The extent of the American continent and the islands connected with it is as follows :—

Square Eng. miles. North America .'. 7,400,000

South America 6,500,000

Islands 150,000

Greenland, and the islands connected with it lying 900,00 north of Hudson’s Straits, may be estimated at ’

14,950,000

The American continent, therefore, with its dependent islands, is four times as large as Europe, and about one-third larger than Africa, but somewhat less than Asia, while it is nearly five times the size of the Australian continent. It constitutes about three-tenths of the dry land on the surface of the globe. It is characterised by having a greater length from N. to S. than any other continent; and by the northern and southern portions being connected by a comparatively narrow strip of land. South America has a more regular form, and as a mass is situated much farther east than North America. In South America the most central point lies in about 58° W.; but in North America the most central point would be in about 100° W.

As regards continuity of land, America comprises some islands at the southern end; a main continental portion, including South America, Central America, and North America; some islands off the north shore, and many other islands along the east and west coasts, those on the east being the most important. The most northern point of the mainland is that of Boothia Felix, in Bellot Strait, 71° 55' N., 92° 25' W. The islands to the north extend beyond 82° 16' N., 65° W., which point was reached by the “Polaris” in August 1871. The southernmost point of the mainland is Cape Froward, which lies close to 54° S., 71° W.; while Cape Horn, the most southern point of the islands, is in 56° S., 67° 20'W. The extreme points traced are consequently 138° apart; and the continental part stretches over about 126 degrees of latitude. This corresponds to lengths of 8280 and 7560 geographical miles respectively. The extreme east points of the continent are Cape St Roque, in 5° 28'S., 35° 40' W., in South America, and Cape St Charles, in 52° 17' N., 55° 35' W., in North America. The most western point of South America is Point Parina, in 4° 40' S., 81° 10' W.; and of North America, Prince of Wales Cape, in 65° 30' N., 167° W. The greatest breadth of North America is [9:1:670] between Cape Lisburne and Melville Peninsula; and of South. America, between Pernambuco and Point Aguja. The narrowest part is 28 miles, at the isthmus of Panama. The nearest approach to the Old World is at Behring Strait, which is 48 miles across, and shallow. On the east side the nearest point to the Old World is Cape St Roque, which is opposite the projecting part of the African coast at Sierra Leone. Greenland is separated from the archipelago of Arctic America by a deep and for the most part broad sea, and seems naturally to belong to the European rather than the American area.

North America, with the general form of a triangle, naturally divides itself into five physical regions: 1. The table-land of Mexico, with the strip of low country on its eastern and western shores; 2. The plateau lying between the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific Ocean, a country with a mild and humid atmosphere as far north as the 55th parallel, but inhospitable and barren beyond this boundary; 3. The great central valley of the Mississippi, rich and well wooded on the east side; bare but not unfertile in the middle; dry, sandy, and almost a desert on the west; 4. The eastern declivities of the Alleghany Mountains, a region of natural forests, and of mixed but rather poor soil; 5. The great northern plain beyond the 50th parallel, four-fifths of which is a bleak and bare waste, overspread with innumerable lakes, and resembling Siberia both in the physical character of its surface and the rigour of its climate.

South America is a peninsula likewise of triangular form. Its greatest length from north to south is 4550 miles; its greatest breadth 3200; and it covers an area, as already mentioned, of 6,500,000 square English miles, about three-fourths of which lie between the tropics, and the other fourth in the temperate zone. From the configuration of its surface, this peninsula also may be divided into five physical regions— 1. The low country skirting the shores of the Pacific Ocean, from 50 to 150 miles in breadth, and 4000 in length. The two extremities of this territory are fertile, the middle a sandy desert. 2. The basin of the Orinoco, a country consisting of extensive plains or steppes, called Llanos, either destitute of wood or merely dotted with trees, but covered with a very tall herbage during a part of the year. During the dry season the heat is intense here, and the parched soil opens into long fissures, in which lizards and serpents lie in a state of torpor. 3. The basin of the Amazon, a vast plain, embracing a surface of more than two millions of square miles, possessing a rich soil and a humid climate. It is covered almost everywhere with dense forests, which harbour innumerable tribes of wild animals, and are thinly inhabited by savages, who live by hunting and fishing. 4. The great southern plain, watered by the Plata and the numerous streams descending from the eastern summits of the Cordilleras. Open steppes, which are here called Pampas, occupy the greater proportion of this region, which is dry, and in some parts barren, but in general is covered with a strong growthof weeds and tall grass, which feeds prodigious herds of horses and cattle, and affords shelter to a few wild animals. 5. The country of Brazil, eastward of the Parana and Uruguay, presenting alternate ridges and valleys, thickly covered with wood on the side next the Atlantic, and opening into steppes or pastures in the interior.

In our more particular description of the physical conformation, the geological structure, the mountains, rivers, and forests, and the climates of America, we shall first deal with the southern peninsula, as having the more strongly marked conditions.

The mountain areas of South America are, as a general rule, those which have received the thickest accumulations of sedimentary matter, and this thickness is nearly proportional to their height. During the periods of the formation of such deposits, these areas were to a great extent areas of subsidence, and since those beds which once formed the sea bottoms now constitute the highest peaks, these areas must have been subjected to subsequent upheaval. Vertical movements of this kind have occurred again and again, indicating that these areas are specially liable to disturbance, either from comparative weakness or from the greater comparative power of the moving forces. The history of the mountain chains is almost coextensive with that of the continent itself. In the sea the beds were deposited horizontally, or nearly so; and at certain intervals the deposition was arrested, in consequence of the beds being uplifted above the sea. Each successive submergence and emergence occupied a long period of time, during which the rocks were at one time faulted, folded, and metamorphosed, and at other times denuded both by the sea and by meteoric agents. As a general rule, the strike or line of direction of the strata ran approximately parallel to the trend of the shore line on the large scale, and the dip was at right angles to their direction. During each elevation the land was uplifted in a broad band, the axis of which ran parallel to the shore of the sea in which the beds were formed. The axes of the principal folds and faults usually run parallel to the stratigraphical axis or strike. The principal ridges formed during the same period usually coincide in direction with the stratigraphical strike of the bed forming them. In the mountains of South America, and especially in the Andes, several of these groups of ridges, formed at different periods, combine to make up a single system of mountains. The high range of mountains which extends from the most southern parts of South America, and runs approximately on the same meridian of 72° to the isthmus of Panama, forms the Andes. These consist of a vast rampart, having an average height of some 11,000 or 12,000 feet, and a width varying from 20 to 300 or 400 miles. In most places the chain rises to heights of several thousand feet, and upon this chain rest two or three principal ridges of mountains, enclosing lofty plains or valleys, separated one from another by mountain knots, which mark the spots where ridges belonging to different systems intersect. In one sense, the lofty plains of the Desaguadero, Quito, and others, are valleys, since they are encompassed by mountains; but in a certain sense they are plateaus, since they form the broad summit of the range or platform on which the bounding ridges themselves stand. Further details respecting the Andes are given under Andes, and in the geological remarks of this article.

Three branches or transverse chains proceed from the Andes, nearly at right angles to the direction of the principal chain, and pass eastward across the continent, about the parallels of 18° of S. and 4° and 9° of N. latitude; thus forming the three natural areas of the Orinoco, Amazon, and La Plata river basins. The most northern of these is “the Cordillera of the coast,” which parts from the main trunk near the south extremity of the lake Maracaybo, reaches the sea at Puerto Cabello, and then passes eastward through Caraccas to the Gulf of Paria. Its length is about 700 miles, and its medium height from 4000 to 5000 feet; but the Silla de Caraccas, one of its summits, has an elevation of about 8632 feet; and its western part, which is at some distance from the sea, contains the Sierra of Merida, 15,000 feet in height. The second transverse chain is connected with the Andes at the parallels of 3° and 4° north, and passing eastward, terminates in French Guiana, at no great distance from the mouth of the Amazon. It consists properly of a succession of chains nearly parallel to the coast, and is sometimes called the Cordillera of Parimé, but is named by Humboldt the “Cordillera of the Cataracts of the Orinoco,” because this river, which flows amidst its ridges in the [9:1:671] upper parts of its course, forms the cataracts of Maypure at the point where it descends into the plains. Its mean height is estimated at 4000 feet above the level of the sea; but at about 70° and 75° W. longitude, it sinks to less than 1000 feet, and at other points rises to 10,000. This chain divides the waters of the Orinoco and the rivers of Guiana from the basin of the Amazon, and is covered with magnificent forests. Its breadth is supposed to be from 200 to 400 miles, and it encloses amidst its ridges the great lake Parimé, in longitude 60°, and several of smaller size. At the Caratal gold-field, which lies south of Angostura, the range is about 60 miles across, and the watershed about 1100 feet above the sea. On a table-land forming part of it, about the 67th degree of longitude, the Cassi-quiari forms an intermediate channel which connects the rivers Orinoco and Negro, so that, during the annual floods, a part of the waters of the former flows into the latter. This singular phenomenon was made known long ago by the Spanish missionaries, but was thought to be a fable till the truth was ascertained by Humboldt. The length of this chain is about 1500 miles. The third transverse chain leaves the main trunk near 17° 25' S., and extends almost as far as Santa Cruz, near the river Mamore. Some of the mountains in the western part are of considerable height. South of this range are a number of ridges having an east and west direction, an average height of about 10,000 feet, and terminating in the plains near the Paraguay. This country, which divides the waters of the Amazon from those of the Plata, is a broad plateau of elevated land, rather than a distinct mountainous ridge, and consists of low hills or uneven plains, with very little wood, presenting in some places extensive pastures, and in others tracts of a poor sandy soil. Its average height probably does not exceed 2000 or 3000 feet above the level of the sea.

The mountains of Brazil, which are of moderate height, and occupy a great breadth of country, form an irregular plateau, bristled with sharp ridges running in a direction approximately parallel to the eastern coast, connected by offsets running in a more or less east and west direction. They extend from 5° to 25° of south latitude, and their extreme breadth may be about 1000 miles. Between Victoria on the north and Morro de St Martha on the south, a range with numerous curves lies a little way back from the coast, and is, for the greater part of its length, known as the Sierra do Mar; somewhat farther inland is a higher range, the different parts of which have different names, but it is best known as the Sierra de Mantiqueira. It contains the highest peaks in Brazil, amongst which may be mentioned Mount Itacolumi, famous for the gold and diamond yielding strata in its vicinity; the Pico dos Orgaos, which is 7700 feet high; and Itambe, 8426 feet. Some of the peaks are believed to be even higher. West of this the uplands of Brazil stretch far into the interior, and at length sink into the great central plain through which flows the Paraguay and its tributaries.

Although large areas of South America remain as yet unexplored by geologists, the researches of D'Orbigny, Humboldt, Boussingault, Darwin, Forbes, Agassiz, and many other travellers, suffice to give an approximately correct general view. This is mainly owing to the simplicity of the stratigraphy of the country. The same groups of rocks spread over such extensive areas, that, from what is seen in the areas which have been examined, we can safely infer the general condition of those which have not been explored. The general disposition of the rocks is as follows:—The oldest rocks, which are Pre-Silurian, possibly Laurentian, form the outermost rim of the continent, of which the N.E. and S.E. corners have probably been swept away. These corners now correspond with the mouths of the Orinoco, the Amazon, and the La Plata rivers. Within this basin, and following close upon these old rocks, are schists and quartzites, which are in all probability of Silurian age. These enter largely into the transverse ranges by which the central hollow is subdivided into three basins. Within this again are sandstones and limestones, usually referred to the Carboniferous period, which also form part of the transverse ridges. A band of rocks of secondary age follow, some of which are believed to be Triassic, while others are identified as Cretaceous. Tertiary beds, some of Miocene date, together with Post-Tertiary beds, cover the largest part of the areas of the great river basins and the hollows in the mountain range, and also occur on the seaward flanks of the principal chains.

By following the development of these beds, we shall be able to give a brief account of the growth of the present continent. In the Argentine Confederation a few bosses of gneiss protrude through the more recent beds constituting the Pampas. Granite, supporting gneiss and quartzite, occurs along the coast of Chili. In Bolivia we find a range of granitic mountains which have a general direction somewhat to the E. of N., and which are flanked on either side by zones of gneiss and quartzite. The gneiss also prevails along the shores of Peru, Ecuador, and New Granada, or, to call it by the name which it received in 1861, Columbia. The gneiss is again seen at the eastern base of the Andes, in the last-mentioned State, associated with quartzites, and both these can be traced along the Venezuelan coast. Gneiss is largely developed near Angostura, and has a strike approaching E. and W. At Limones, which is near the Caratal gold-field, the country consists largely of granite and gneiss, which latter lies here a little to the E. or to the W. of N. In Brazil the gneiss forms a long band from Bahia to the southern portion of the province of Santa Catharina. Near the coast it rests upon and apparently passes into granite; but towards the west, as far as the Mantiqueira chain, it gradually becomes more and more schistoid. Gneiss, again, is met with in the mountains which stretch through the Bolivian provinces of Moxos and Chiquitos. It has not been ascertained if these older rocks appeared above the waters before the deposition of those which follow, and which will next be noticed.

In Chili the succeeding rocks are slaty schists. In Bolivia the mountainous district crossing the country is largely composed of talcose schists, which, where exposed to the weather, have formed by their decomposition a layer of clay; in advancing from the east towards the west the schists become more and more crystalline, and are at last replaced by gneiss. This, as has already been stated, rests against granite, on the west side of which gneiss is again brought in by an anticlinal arrangement of the beds, and dips beneath a thick mass of schists, which constitute the great bulk of the Andes in this district. In this mountain range the lower portion of the formation is mainly siliceous schist, alternating with beds of compact quartz; above this come talc-bearing quartzites, alternating with slaty schists, which latter become more and more prevalent as we ascend in the strata, and at last constitute the predominating rock. They form, indeed, the crest of the range; the thickness of the formation may be roughly estimated at 10,000 feet. These rocks are much disturbed and faulted against other and probably newer rocks, which with them constitute the great bulk of the lofty eminences in the range of which Mount Illimani forms so conspicuous a feature. The lower argillaceous schist, which is associated with gneiss all along the Pacific coast from lower Peru to Panama, possibly belongs to this group of rocks. In the high valleys of Ecuador the oldest rocks visible are granite, gneiss, and schists, which are frequently in a vertical position. The schistose group appears [9:1:672] to “be absent on the east side of the Andes in Columbia, as also along the coast of Venezuela. In the mountain range south of the Orinoco, hornblende, talcose, and mica schists again appear on a large scale, more especially in the Caratal district, where auriferous veins occur. In Brazil the micaceous and talcose schists enter into the composition of the Mantiqueira chain and of the uplands to the west; they probably pass beneath the valley of the Panama, since they occur to the west of it, and extend through the provinces of Goyaz and Matto Grosso, so as to approach within a moderate distance of the similar strata in Bolivia. They are associated with talc-bearing quartzites, which are famous for the diamonds and auriferous particles they have yielded in the district around Mount Itacolumi. The soil is usually a clay, such as would result from the decomposition of talcose schist; but we shall have occasion to refer to the soil of South America subsequently. Some of these rocks in various parts of the continent have yielded Silurian fossils. Facts are not sufficient yet to warrant the correlation of these strata with those of other countries, or to settle how far they belong to distinct geological periods. The prevalent strike of the rocks is about east and west, but sometimes the strike approaches to a north and south direction. At any rate, the rocks which overlie them do so unconformably, indicating that, prior to the deposition of these newer rocks, land had appeared at least once on areas now constituting part of South America. At this early date the continent was represented by a few islands only; one corresponded with part of Brazil, another with parts of Venezuela and Columbia; perhaps a third more or less with Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Chili; while a few small islands appeared where now we have the Pampas. These were the nuclei around which the present land has accumulated, and already we see faint indications of the existing outline and broad geographic features of the future continent.

The next group of rocks are always in stratigraphical discordance with those beneath them; and, in consequence of the highly metamorphosed condition of those on the west side of the continent, it is difficult to correlate them with the rocks of Brazil. In the Andes of Chili they are represented by enormous stratified masses of quartzose porphyries, which there is good reason to believe are metamorphosed argillaceous schists and felspathic sandstones, into which rocks they have been seen gradually to pass. These porphyries not only form the great bulk of the principal chain of the Andes, but also the smaller chain on the west, the interval between them being formed by the longitudinal valley of Chili. Further west they rest on syenitic rocks, beyond which come the older rocks already noticed. On passing into Bolivia, we find that to the west of the great fault developed there, the beds consist of micaceous sandstones and dark bituminous schists, which are believed to be the equivalents of the porphyries of Chili. Such formations constitute the west slope of the Andes from Sorata to Illimani, and also form two bands, one stretching from Illimani to Cochabamba, the other between Calamarca and Chayanta. Towards the west they dip beneath black bituminous and siliceous limestones, which are well developed near Tiahuanaco. Carboniferous strata with seams of coal occur near Pisco and Arequipa in Peru. In Brazil the beds which succeed those previously mentioned are quartzites, rich in mica and magnetic oxide of iron; talcose schists; and crystalline limestones, containing a great deal of talc. These rocks form the highest regions and loftiest peaks in Brazil. Unconformably upon these rest micaceous sandstones and argillaceous schists, which occupy the western part of St Paul province between Ytu and the banks of the Parana. In Mount Arasoyaba and Borne other places, a carboniferous limestone succeeds and is overlain by a thick white or yellowish sandstone, siliceous limestones, and bituminous schists. The limestones occupy most of the area between the Uruguay and the Parana. In the Diamantina district the carboniferous limestone is over-lain by red sandstone, which belongs to the succeeding group of beds. The beds in Brazil appear to be fuller than those on the west side of the continent, and represent probably both the Devonian and Carboniferous periods. Rocks of this age are also exposed in a narrow band round portions of the basin of the river Amazon. The strata next in succession are of secondary age. The lowest formation is a red sandstone, which is spread over a very extensive area. It is remarkably well developed in Chili, where, together with more recent beds, it is a marked feature in the crest of the Andes. In the small chain to the west it is associated with conglomerates. In the small chain of Colorado, near Tiahuanaco, a thick conglomerate rests on the older limestones, and supports red sandstones and conglomerates dipping west beneath marls. The red sandstone extends across the province of Carangas, and uninterruptedly over both slopes of the western Cordillera. In the desert of Atacama the red sandstone, with the overlying marls, forms a number of parallel chains directed north and south. Red sandstones and conglomerates form the base of the Cordilleras of Quito; they stretch north into the basins of the Magdalena and Cauca rivers, and east over the basin of the Orinoco. In the province of Bahia, and far away to the north, there is a great development of red sandstone. The age of these sandstones has been variously stated; their stratigraphical position would indicate a secondary age, and possibly they may be Triassic. After their deposition, and prior to that of the marls, syenitic rocks were introduced amongst the strata in the Andes, causing the red sandstones, as also the older sandstones and schists, to be converted into porphyries. This eruption was also accompanied by, and probably connected with, the formation of auriferous veins, the elevation of the strata, and the faulting of the rocks. The strike of the strata, as also of the faults, was about 8° to the E. of N., but subsequent movements have modified the direction in places. The red sandstone has a similar strike from Venezuela in the north to Magalhaens Strait on the south, and this favours the idea that all are of the same age. Several of the ranges in the Andes have a corresponding direction. As the sandstone is believed to underlie the basins of the great rivers, it appears that during its deposition South America was still represented by a few large islands only. Its elevation gave rise to north and south trending mountains, whereby these scattered portions were connected, and the Andes received their first development. The great features of the continent were then first distinctly marked out, and only a few gaps remained to be filled up. The next succeeding period, represented by strata, is characterised by saliferous and gypseous marls, which rest unconformably on the rocks beneath. In Chili they occur in the lower plains, or abut against the western spurs of the Andes; but they have been largely denuded, so that they now occur in isolated plateaux or basins, and there is a patch capping the lofty Aconcagua. It is stated that in Chili the marls, or at least some of them, are Liassic. In Bolivia, also, they form plateaux between San Andres and the mountains of Tarija. Here they consist of alternations of greenish marls and wine-coloured beds supporting limestones, with interstratified beds of gypsum and saliferous clay. There are beds of gypsum and limestone in the Orinoco plains. Maris are associated with marly sandstones in the Gulf of Bahia and in the plains of Reconcavo. These beds are arranged along strikes which are approximately east and west, and their elevation is apparently connected with the formation of chains running [9:1:673] in the same direction, as, for instance, most of the lateral spurs from the Andes. Some geologists think it is also connected with the east and west faults, through which, in the Andes, labradorite and hypersthenite rocks have been erupted. This eruption, it is said, has caused the metamorphism of the calcareous rocks into crystalline limestones, marls into jaspers, and red sandstones into porphyries; and has also given rise to the copper-bearing veins. Calcareous beds occupy large areas in Venezuela, Columbia, and other parts of the continent. Miocene strata occur in Venezuela, and probably in other districts. Finally, there are deposits of Post-Miocene date, which chiefly belong to the Post-Pliocene and recent periods, and which cover most of the lower lands along the coasts and in the interior of the continent. In Chili they occur in the valleys, and fill up the gulfs in the old granite range near the coast. Here the succession is a calcareous sandstone abounding in marine shells and beds of lignite; above this is a pumiceous conglomerate, which passes in places into a pebbly conglomerate, and then follow the marine sands which stretch from Coquimbo across the desert of Atacama. The most recent formation is drift, which occurs in patches and sheets. In the valley plains of the Desaguadero there are clays and sandy marls overlain by pumiceous conglomerates, which near La Paz are surmounted by drift. Near this place the drift is many hundred feet thick, and formed of large blocks; but, on receding from the mountains, it passes into a sand which encircles the plains of the Desaguadero, which are chiefly formed by limestone deposits, such as concretionary limestone, which abounds in the fossil remains of plants and fresh water shells. The lacustrine beds approximate in age to the marine tertiary beds near the coast. In Peru the pumiceous conglomerate is overlain by drift. Tertiary beds occur at Guayaquil in Ecuador, while in the valley of Quito there are enormous layers of pumice, scoriae, and drift, which last has yielded the remains of various Post-Pliocene mammals and terrestrial shells. Drift with similar remains occurs in the lower grounds of Columbia. In the Gulf of Bahia there are recent beds; and near St Paul, as also in many other parts of Brazil, there are patches of lacustrine deposits. On the west side of the continent the pumiceous conglomerate is intimately connected with trachytes, and indeed is formed from them. It is intermediate in age between the lacustrine beds, the marine deposits near the shore, and the drift, which is in its turn covered by the more recent lava overflows; and it is in this intermediate age that the upheaval of the principal chain of the Andes occurred. The ranges and faults which are assigned to this period, probably Pliocene or Post-Pliocene, run very nearly north and south. This elevation did not materially alter the extent of land west of the Andes, its general effect being to add a strip about thirty miles in width. On the east the change was great, since the larger proportion of the great central plain then emerged, and thus connected the high lands on the east, west, and north into one great continent. The eruption of the trachytes, which form so marked a feature in the Andes, was accompanied by a metamorphism distinct in character from those of earlier ages. The rocks were then subjected not only to heat and water, but also to acid vapours, which changed the felspar into sulphates of alumina and iron, salt into anhydrous sulphate of soda; and, probably, by freeing the chlorine and iodine, originated the chlorides and iodides which are so abundant in the argentiferous veins. Since the drift there has been a slight elevation along a meridional axis.

Such is a brief account of the growth of South America. We must, however, mention that Professor Agassiz and his coadjutors believe that the red soil and immediately underlying beds, seen near Rio Janeiro and in the valley of the Amazon, are true glacial formations, and infer that the similar beds which are spread over such an enormous area in South America have been formed under similar conditions. Professor Agassiz has found moraines and ice-transported boulders in various places in the mountains of Brazil, as also indications of valley glaciers. Professor Orton has found marine shells in these beds at Pebas in Ecuador.

The foregoing sketch indicates that there have been several periods of volcanic activity; and that, so far as our present knowledge goes, such activity has only been manifested along the line of the Andes. Volcanic rocks have rarely been observed on the east side of the continent, but some of the Tertiary and Post-Tertiary beds of the plains contain matter which has been showered upon them during eruptions, and which now forms a portion of the Pampean deposits. At one period or other the whole system of the Andes has been subjected to volcanic disturbance, but at the present time the active volcanoes occur in groups more or less widely separated. The most southern active volcano is Corcovado, in 43° 10' S. There are, besides, some twenty or more volcanic cones, of which about a dozen are known to be active. Bolivia has one or two active vents, and Peru several; but it is in Ecuador, with its dozen igni-vomous vents, that have occurred the grandest and most frequent displays. Columbia has four or five volcanoes. With the exception of the Moluccas, no country in the world has had so many and so destructive earthquake shocks as South America. But these are concentrated, both as regards frequency and strength, along the Andes, and more particularly their western slope. Comparatively few are felt in the plains to the east of them; but occasionally it happens that shocks are felt at points on the opposite slopes of this great range without being perceived in the intermediate higher regions. Peru seems to be the principal focus of action; and next to it in importance as a seismic area comes Chili; but although some earthquake shocks spread over both these areas, there does not seem to be the community of action which we should expect between the two areas. In Peru the maxima of seismic intensity were in the decades ending 1590, 1610, 1660, 1690, 1710, 1720, 1730, 1750, 1770, 1790, 1840, 1870. In Chili they occurred in the decades ending 1580, 1640, 1650, 1660, 1690, 1730, 1780, 1800, 1820, 1840, 1850. Nearly every other portion of the continent is subject to earthquakes. Bolivia, which lies between Peru and Chili, is comparatively free from them, as also are Brazil, Patagonia, and the Argentine Confederation, but they are more frequent in Ecuador, Columbia, Venezuela, and the three Guianas.

The mountains of North and Central America will not detain us long. The ranges of Central America have no relation to the Andes, differing from them both as regards age and direction, which is generally N. 55° W., and being separated from them by gaps only a few hundred feet above the sea, and upwards of 100 miles wide. During the Tertiary period the mountains of N. and S. America had still less connection than at present, for where the isthmus now forms a bridge of land there was a broad strait, which lasted up to the end of the Pliocene, or beginning of the Post-Pliocene period. Volcanoes are frequent in Central America; and basalt and other volcanic products cover a large portion of the country. The large development of trachytes indicates an earlier period of volcanic activity, during which most of the Tertiary strata were metamorphosed into porphyries. At any rate these rest upon cretaceous limestones. In many places the clays and sandstones of the Cretaceous age have been metamorphosed into granite rocks. From Puebla to Durango the Mexican mountains no longer present the appearance of a chain, but spread out to a table-land or elevated plain, from 5000 [9:1:674] to 9000 feet in height, and from 100 to 300 miles in breadth. Across this plain, close to the 19th parallel, six volcanoes are distributed in a line running east and west, as if a vast rent, extending from the Atlantic to the Pacific, had opened a passage for the internal fires of the globe at this spot. Two of those on the east side of the continent, with a group of four or five other cones lying between Jalapa and Cordoba, have an elevation exceeding 17,000 feet, and are the only mountains in New Spain that rise to the region of perpetual snow, which commences here at 15,000 feet above the level of the sea. Jorullo, the lowest of the six volcanoes, rose suddenly in the middle of a plain, in September 1759, after fearful concussions of the ground, which continued for fifty or sixty days. Near the tropic the Mexican Cordillera divides into three parts. One runs parallel to the eastern coast at the distance of thirty or forty leagues, and terminates in New Leon. Another proceeds in a north-western direction, and sinks gradually as it approaches the Californian Gulf in Sonora. The third or central Cordillera traverses Durango and New Mexico, divides the sources of the Rio Gila from the Rio Bravo del Norte, and dies out before reaching the Rocky Mountains.

In a recent scientific survey of the Rocky Mountains, conducted by Professor Hayden of Yale College, a higher peak has been discovered than was formerly known. Holy Cross mountain was computed to reach 17,000 feet above the sea, or 2000 feet higher than Big Horn (15,000), which has hitherto been supposed to be the highest of the chain. The greatest altitudes on the North American continent are now said to be the following—St Elias (17,850) in Alaska, Popocatepetl (17,884) in Mexico, Orizaba (17,337) in Mexico, Holy Cross (17,000), Rocky Mountains, Big Horn (15,000), and Mount Lincoln (14,300), both in the same chain. The Great Salt Lake of Utah is in 41° N. and 112° W., and has intensely salt waters. It is nearly 300 miles in circumference, and its shores, for a breadth of several miles, are covered with an incrustation of very pure salt. It lies in a basin, which measures about 500 miles each way, and contains much fertile soil.

If we run a line westward across the continent of North America at the latitude of Delaware Bay (38°) the geological formations present themselves in the following order: —1. Tertiary and Cretaceous strata on the shores of the Atlantic 2. Gneiss underlying these strata, and presenting itself on the eastern slope of the Alleghany or Appalachian mountains, but covered in parts by New Red Sandstone; 3. Palaeozoic rocks, consisting of Silurian, Devonian, and Carboniferous strata, curiously bent into parallel foldings, with synclinal and anticlinal axes, the crests of the latter forming the ridges of the Alleghany Mountains, which in this region rise to the height of 2500 feet. Upon these Palaeozoic rocks rest three great coal-fields—the Appalachian, that of Illinois, and that of Michigan, covering a large portion of the space between the Alleghanies and the Mississippi, and embracing collectively an area equal to the surface of Great Britain. From the Mississippi westward to Utah the Palaeozoic rocks occur in great folds, between which are extensive areas of Triassic, Oolitic, Cretaceous, and Tertiary beds. In California the rocks are chiefly metamorphosed secondary strata on which lie patches of Tertiary sediments. In British America there is an enormous development of the Laurentian and Huronian rocks, which are the oldest yet discovered, and occupy most of the country immediately north of the large lakes. Newfoundland and the neighbouring British territories consist of Pre-Silurian, Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous (which includes coal-fields of considerable extent), and Triassic rocks. The area north of about 40° N. is also covered and strewed with glacial drift and boulders.

The Ozark Mountains resemble the Alleghanies in their mineral structure, containing the same rocks from the granite to the carboniferous, and probably upwards to the chalk.

In no single circumstance is the superiority of America over the old world so conspicuous, as in the number and magnitude of its navigable rivers. The Amazon alone discharges a greater quantity of water than the eight principal rivers of Asia, the Yenesei, Indus, Ganges, Oby, Lena, Amoor, and the Hoang-ho and Yang-tse of China. The Mississippi, with its branches, affords a greater amount of inland navigation than all the streams, great and small, which irrigate Europe; and the Plata, in this respect, may probably claim a superiority over the collective water of Africa. But the American rivers not only surpass those of the Old World in length and volume of water,—they are so placed as to penetrate everywhere to the heart of the continent. By the Amazon, a person living at the eastern foot of the Andes, 2000 miles of direct distance from the Atlantic, may convey himself or his property to the shores of that sea in forty-five days, almost without effort, by confiding his bark to the gliding current. If he wish to return, he has but to spread his sails to the eastern breeze, which blows perennially against the stream. The navigation is not interrupted by a single cataract or rapid, from the Atlantic to Jaen, in west longitude 78° where the surface of the stream is only 1240 feet above the level of its estuary at Para. The part of North America most remote from the sea is the great interior plain extending from the Rocky Mountains to the Alleghanies and the lakes, between the parallels of 40° and 50°; but the Mississippi, Missouri, and St Lawrence, with their branches, are wonderfully ramified over this region, and the Missouri is in some degree navigable to the centre of the continent. It is only necessary to cast the eye over a map of South America, to see that all the most sequestered parts of the interior are visited by branches of the Plata and the Amazon. These streams, having their courses in general remarkably level, and seldom interrupted by cataracts, may be considered without a figure of speech, as a vast system of natural canals, terminating in two main trunks, which communicate with the ocean at the equator and the 35th degree of south latitude. Since the invention of steam navigation, rivers are, in the truest sense of the term, Nature’s highways, especially for infant communities, where the people are too poor, and live too widely dispersed, to bear the expense of constructing roads. There is little risk in predicting, that in two or three centuries the Mississippi, the Amazon, and the Plata, will be the scenes of an active inland commerce, far surpassing in magnitude anything at present known on the surface of the globe. The Mississippi is navigable for boats from the sea to the falls of its principal branch the Missouri, 1700 miles from the Mexican Gulf in a direct line, or 3900 by the stream; and the whole amount of boat navigation afforded by the system of rivers, of which the Mississippi is the main trunk, has been estimated as equal to 40,000 miles in length, spread over a surface of 1,350,000 square miles. This, however, is perhaps an exaggeration; a navigable length of 35,000 miles may be nearer the truth.

The Amazon contains many islands, is broad, and in the upper part so deep, that on one occasion Condamine found no bottom with a line 620 feet long. At its mouth, two days before and after the full moon, the phenomenon called a Bore occurs in a very formidable shape. It is a high upright wave of water rushing from the sea, which no small vessel can encounter without certain destruction.

The estuaries of all these great American rivers open to the eastward; and thus Providence seems to have plainly [9:1:675] indicated that the most intimate commercial relations of the inhabitants of America should be with the western shores of the Old World. It should at the same time be observed, that this position of the great rivers of America is but one example of a physical arrangement which is common to the whole globe; for it is remarkable that, in the Old World as well as in the New, no river of the first class flows to the westward. Some, as the Nile, the Lena, and the Oby, flow to the north; others, as the Indus and the rivers of Ava, to the south; but the largest, as the Volga, the Ganges, the Yang-tse, the Hoang-ho, the Euphrates, and the Amoor, have their courses to the east or south-east. This arrangement is not accidental, but depends most probably on the inclination of the primary rocks, which, in all cases where their direction approaches to the south and north, seem to have their steepest sides to the west and the longest declivities to the east. We have examples in the Scandinavian Alps, the mountains of Britain, the Ghauts of India, the Andes, and the Rocky Mountains.

The following table exhibits the lengths, size of the basins, and probable extent of the navigable waters of the greater rivers of America.

Table of Principal American Rivers.
[table]

The latitude and elevation of the land in each country, its position in reference to the sea, and the direction of the prevailing winds, are the chief circumstances which determine the nature of the climate. We have already mentioned that three-fourths of South America lie within the tropics, and the remaining fourth in the temperate zone; but, in both divisions, it might be naturally inferred that a huge wall like the Andes, rising into the atmosphere to the height of two or three miles, and running across the course of the tropical and extra-tropical winds, would exert a powerful influence on the temperature, the humidity, and the distribution of the seasons. This is actually the case; and it is this vast chain of mountains, with its prolongation in North America, which affords a key to the most remarkable peculiarities in the climate of the whole continent. The subject, which has been frequently misunderstood, admits of being explained in a very simple manner.

The trade-winds blowing from the east occupy a zone 60 degrees in breadth, extending from 30° of N. to 30° of S. latitude. Beyond these limits are variable winds; but the prevailing direction in the open sea, where no accidental causes operate, is well known by navigators to be from the west. Now these winds are the agents which transport the equable temperature of the ocean, and the moisture exhaled from its surface, to the interior of the great continents, where it is precipitated in the shape of rain, dew, or snow. Mountains receive the moisture which floats in the atmosphere; they obstruct and lift the aerial currents, and by causing a reduction of temperature, favour precipitation. Rain, accordingly, in all countries falls most abundantly on the elevated land. Let us consider, then, what will be the effect of a mural ridge like the Andes in the situation which it occupies. In the region within the 30th parallel, the moisture swept up by the trade-wind from the Atlantic will be precipitated in part upon the mountains of Brazil, which are but low, and so distributed as to extend far into the interior. The portion which remains will be borne westward, and, losing a little as it proceeds, will be arrested by the Andes, and fall down in showers on their slopes. The aerial current will now be deprived of all the humidity which it can part with, and arrive in a state of complete exsiccation at Peru, where no rain will consequently fall. That even a much lower ridge than the Andes may intercept the whole moisture of the atmosphere, is proved by a well-known phenomenon in India, where the Ghauts, a chain only 3000 or 4000 feet high, divide summer from winter, as it is called; that is, they have copious rains on their windward side, while on the other the weather remains clear and dry; and the rains regularly change from the west side to the east, and vice versa, with the monsoons. In the region beyond the 30th parallel this effect will be reversed. The Andes will in this case serve as a screen to intercept the moisture brought by the prevailing west winds from the Pacific Ocean; rains will be copious on their slopes, and in Chili on their western declivities, but none will fall on the plains to the eastward, except occasionally, when the winds blow from the Atlantic. The phenomena of the weather correspond in a remarkable manner with this hypothesis. On the shore of the Pacific, from Coquimbo, at the 30th parallel, to Amatapu, at the 5th of south latitude, no rain falls; and the whole of this tract is a sandy desert, except the narrow strips of land skirting the streams that descend from the Andes, where the soil is rendered productive by irrigation. From the 30th parallel southward the scene changes. Rains are frequent; vegetation appears on the surface, and grows more vigorous as we advance southward. “At Conception,” says Captain Hall, “the eye was delighted with the richest and most luxuriant foliage; at Valparaiso the hills were poorly clad with a stunted brushwood and a poor attempt at grass, the ground looking starved and naked; at Coquimbo the brushwood was gone, with nothing in its place but a vile sort of prickly pear bush, and a thin sprinkling of gray wiry grass; at Huasco (latitude 28 ½ o ) there was not a trace of vegetation, and the hills were covered with bare sand.”^[1. Hall’s Extracts from a Journal, vol ii. p. 12.] It follows from the principle we have laid down, that in this southern part of the continent the dry tract should be found on the east side of the mountains, and such is the fact. At Mendoza, in latitude 32°, rain scarcely ever falls, and the district along the east foot of the Andes is known to consist chiefly of parched sands, on which a few stunted shrubs grow, and in which many of the streams that descend from the mountains are absorbed before they reach the sea. The whole country, indeed, south of the Plata, suffers from drought; but on the eastern side this is remedied to some extent by winds from the east or south-east, which bring occasional rains to refresh the soil. From Amatapu northward, on the other hand, the west coast is well watered and fruitful; and this is easily accounted for. The line of the coast here changes its direction, and trends to the north-east as far as the isthmus of Panama, where the mountains sink to a few hundred feet in height, and leave a free passage to the trade-wind, which here often assumes a direction from the north-east, or even the north. The exhalations of the Atlantic are thus brought in abundance to the coast of Quito, which is in consequence well watered; while the neighbouring district of Peru suffers from perpetual aridity.

Our principle applies equally to the explanation of some peculiar facts connected with the climate of North America. The western coast of Mexico, as far as St Blas or [9:1:676] Mazatlan, in latitude 23° N., is well watered, because, first, the continent here is narrow; secondly, the table-land of Mexico, which is much lower than the Andes of Chili, is not so effectual a screen to intercept the moisture; and, thirdly, there is reason to believe that a branch of the trade-wind, which crosses the low part of the continent at Panama and Nicaragua, sweeps along the west coast during part of the year, and transports humidity with it. But beyond the point we have mentioned drought prevails. Sonora, though visited occasionally by rains, consists of sandy plains without herbage, where the streams lose themselves in the parched soil without reaching the sea; and even Old California, which has the ocean on one side, and a broad gulf on the other, and ought apparently to be excessively humid, is covered with sterile rocks and sandy hills, where the vegetation is scanty, and no timber is seen except brushwood. This dry region extends as far as 33° or 34° N.; but immediately beyond this we have another change of scene. New California is in all respects a contrast to the Old. It is rich, fertile, and humid, abounding in luxuriant forests and fine pastures; and the other American possessions to the northward preserve the same character. How can we account for this singular diversity of climate, except upon the principle which has been explained, namely, that in all regions where ranges of mountains intersect the course of the constant or predominant winds, the country on the windward side of the mountains will be moist, and that on the leeward dry; and hence parched deserts will generally be found on the west side of countries within the tropics, and on the east side of those beyond them? Our hypothesis applies equally to the country east of the Rocky Mountains. For the space of about 3000 miles along the foot of this chain the surface consists of dry sands or gravel, sometimes covered with saline incrustations, almost destitute of trees and herbage, and watered by streams flowing from the mountains, which are sometimes entirely absorbed by the arid soil. The central and eastern part of the basin of the Mississippi would in all probability have been equally barren had the configuration of the land been a little different in the south. A tract of country extremely low and level extends along both sides of this river; and a portion of the tradewind blowing from the Mexican Gulf, finding its motion westward obstructed by the high table-land of the Cordillera, is deflected to the right, and ascends the valley of the Mississippi and Ohio. This wind, whose course was first traced by Volney, bears with it the humidity of the torrid zone, and scatters fertility over a wide region that would otherwise be a barren waste.

The views on the subject of climate we have been unfolding will enable us to throw some light on an interesting point—the distribution of forests. We are induced to think, that in all countries having a summer heat exceeding 70°, the presence or absence of natural woods, and their greater or less luxuriance, may be taken as a measure of the amount of humidity, and of the fertility of the soil. Short and heavy rains in a warm country will produce grass, which, having its roots near the surface, springs up in a few days, and withers when the moisture is exhausted; but transitory rains, however heavy, will not nourish trees, because after the surface is saturated with water, the rest runs off, and the moisture lodged in the soil neither sinks deep enough, nor is in sufficient quantity to furnish the giants of the forest with the necessary sustenance. It may be assumed that 20 inches of rain falling moderately, or at intervals, will leave a greater permanent supply in the soil than 40 inches falling, as it sometimes does in the torrid zone, in as many hours. It is only necessary to qualify this conclusion by stating, that something depends on the subsoil. If that is gravel, or a rock full of fissures, the water imbedded will soon drain off; if it is clay or a compact rock, the water will remain in the soil. It must be remembered, also, that both heat and moisture diminish as we ascend in the atmosphere, while evaporation increases; and hence that trees will not grow on very high ground, though its position in reference to the sea and the prevailing winds should be favourable in other respects. In speaking of the region of forests, we neither restrict the term to those districts where the natural woods present an unbroken continuity, nor extend it to every place where a few trees grow in open plains.

It is not easy to give a definition that will be always appropriate; but in using the expression, we wish to be understood as applying it to ground where the natural woods cover more than one-fourth of the surface.

The small map of America prefixed will enable the reader to follow our statements with ease. The long black lines show the positions of the chains of mountains; the shading represents the regions of forests; the dense forests being marked by the double shading, and the thinner ones by the open lines. The white spaces represent the lands on which little or no wood grows. The equator and the parallel of 30° on each side are indicated by the horizontal lines marked 0 and 30. The arrows show the direction of the prevailing winds; but it must be remembered that, though the intertropical wind is assumed to have its course right from the east, this is only true at the equator, its direction inclining to north-east as we approach the northern tropic, and to the south-east as we approach the southern. In North America A is the woody region on the west coast, extending from latitude 35° to about 58°, and of unknown breadth. B, the region on the east side of the Rocky Mountains, partly a bare desert, partly covered with grass and dotted with trees. C, the forests of the Alleghany chain, thick on the east and south, and thin on the west; bounded by a curved line passing from St Luis, in Mexico, through Lake Huron, to the mouth of the St Lawrence, in latitude 50° N. The arrow at M points out the direction of the wind, which ascends the valley of the Mississippi, and nourishes the western part of these forests; and the arrow at R that which blows across the isthmus of Panama. D is the table-land of Mexico, graduating on the northwest into the dry plains of Sonora and California, all bare, or nearly bare, of wood. E is the Llanos or bare plains of Caraccas, nearly fenced round with mountains. F G is the long strip of bare dry sands on the west side of the Andes which constitutes Lower Peru and the north part of Chili; and N is Amatapu, its northern boundary. H is the great region of forests which constitutes the basin of the Amazon, and occupies all the rest of Brazil. Near the equator the moisture is so excessive, that after 150 or 200 inches of rain have fallen on the east coast, there is still sufficient humidity in the atmosphere to afford copious showers to all the country up to the Andes, Here, therefore[9:1:677], the Woods reach from side to side of the continent. But as we recede from the equator the humidity diminishes rapidly; and though the continent becomes narrower towards the south, the supply of rain falls off in a still greater proportion, and the forests extend over a much smaller space. At the foot of the Andes the forests extend to 16° or 18° of S. latitude; on the east coast to 25° or probably 30°. K L are the Pampas or open lands of Buenos Ayres, extending on the east side of the Andes from Cape Horn to the latitudes just mentioned. If we divide this region into three parts, the most easterly, refreshed by occasional rains from the Atlantic, is covered with a strong nutritive herbage; the second, which is drier, displays a thin coarse wiry grass; and the third portion, which extends to the Andes, receiving little or no rain, is nearly a desert: all the three are destitute of timber, but the surface of the third is dotted with dwarfish shrubs. I is the southern part of Chili. Here the prevailing winds, which are from the west, coming loaded with the moisture of the Pacific Ocean, produce copious rains to nourish the herbage and the forests. This applies, however, chiefly to the country south of the 35th parallel. From that to Coquimbo, in latitude 30°, the wood is scanty. Beyond 50° on the east coast of North America, and 55° or 58° on the west, very little wood grows, in consequence of the rigour of the climate.

Great misapprehensions have arisen with regard to the climate of America, from comparisons being drawn between the east side of the new continent and the west side of the old. We have already pointed out the influence of winds blowing from the sea in modifying the state of the atmosphere over the land, both as to heat and humidity. When this circumstance is attended to, and when the east and west sides of the old and the new continents are respectively compared with one another, the difference is found to be small, and easily accounted for. In the torrid zone, and on the sea-shore, the temperature of both continents is found to be the same, viz., 82°; but in the interior the difference is rather in favour of America. There is no counterpart in the New World to the burning heats felt in the plains of Arabia and N. Africa. Even in the western and warmest part of the parched steppes of Caraccas, the hottest known region in America, the temperature of the air during the day is only 98° in the shade, which rises to 112° in the sandy deserts which surround the Red Sea. At Calabozo, farther east in the Llanos, the common temperature of the day is only from 88° to 90°; and at sunrise the thermometer sinks to 80°. The basin of the Amazon is shaded with lofty woods; and a cool breeze from the east, a minor branch of the trade wind, ascends the channel of the stream, following all its windings, almost to the foot of the Andes. Hence this region, though under the equator, and visited with almost constant rains, is neither excessively hot nor unhealthy. Brazil, and the vast country extending westward from it between the Plata and the Amazon, is an uneven table-land, blest with an equable climate. At Rio Janeiro, which stands low, and is exposed to a heat comparatively great, the temperature in summer varies from 68° to 82° Fahr., and the mean is only about 74°. Farther north, and in the interior, the Indians find it necessary to keep fires in their huts; and in the country near the sources of the Paraguay, hoar-frost is seen on the hills during the colder months, and the mean temperature of the year falls below 65° or 67°. On the declivities of the Andes, and on the high plains of Upper Peru, the heats are so moderate that the plants of Italy, France, and Germany come to maturity. Lower Peru, though a sandy desert, enjoys a wonderful degree of coolness, owing to the fogs which intercept the solar rays. At Lima, which is 540 feet above the sea, the temperature varies from 53° to 82°, but the mean for the whole year is only 72°. In the plains of La Plata the mean temperature of the year is very nearly the same as at the corresponding north latitudes on the east side of the Atlantic. At Buenos Ayres, for instance, the mean annual heat is 19° ∙7 of the centigrade thermometer (68° Fahr.), while that of places on the same parallel in the Old World is 19° ∙8. The range of temperature is probably greater in the basin of the Plata; but as we advance southwards, the diminishing breadth of the continent makes the climate approximate to that of an island, and the extremes of course approach each other. In the Strait of Magalhaens the temperature of the warmest month does not exceed 43° or 46°; and snow falls almost daily in the middle of winter, though the latitude corresponds with that of England. But the inference drawn from this, that the climate is unmatched for severity, is by no means just, for the winter at Staten Island is milder than in London. In point of fact, the climate of Patagonia is absolutely colder than that of places in the same latitude in Europe; but the difference lies chiefly in the very low temperature of the summer. This peculiarity no doubt results chiefly from the greater coolness of the sea in the southern hemisphere; for beyond the parallel of 48°, the difference of temperature in the North and South Atlantic amounts, according to Humboldt, to 10° or 12° of Fahrenheit’s scale. If we push our researches a step farther, and inquire what is the cause of the great warmth of the Northern Sea, we shall be forced to admit that a very satisfactory answer cannot be given. Something may be due to the influence of the Gulf Stream, a minute branch of which is supposed to carry the waters of the torrid zone to the shores of Shetland and Norway; but such an agent seems too trifling to account for the phenomenon. The sum, then, of the peculiar qualities which distinguish the climate of South America may be briefly stated. Near the equator the new continent is perhaps more humid than the old; and within the tropics generally, owing to its vast forests, the absence of sandy deserts, and the elevation of the soil, it is cooler. Beyond the tropics the heat is nearly the same in the south temperate zone of America and the northern one of the old continent, till we ascend to the latitude of Cape Horn, where we have cold summers and a very limited range of the thermometer.

The mountain ranges of North America form two widely distant highland regions, separated from each other by the vast interior plain, which contains, in its southern slope, the Mississippi with all its tributaries, and the other rivers flowing into the Gulf of Mexico, while its northern part contains the great fresh-water lakes, and many rivers taking a northward course to Hudson’s Bay or to the Arctic seas. The watershed of this plain, dividing the streams that run into the Missouri and Mississippi from those communicating with the Saskatchewan, with Lake Winnipeg, and with Lake Superior, is along a line from west to east nearly coinciding with the 48th parallel of latitude, and has a mean elevation of 1500 feet.

Along the whole of the western side, from near the mouth of the Mackenzie in the Arctic Ocean, and from Alaska on the Pacific shore, to the Isthmus of Nicaragua and Panama, that is, across 60° of latitude from north to south, extends with a grand double curve the continuous length of the Rocky Mountains, and others which prolong the line, having a position in North America similar to that of the Andes in South America, and shutting off, in some parts, a comparatively narrow portion of the continent, with the Pacific shore, from the great central plain. But several minor ranges, branching off or confronting the principal mountain-ridge or backbone of North America, enclose large spaces of a table-land, traversed by the Columbia, the Fraser, and the Colorado rivers, with those which join them, and holding the Great Salt Lake of [9:1:678] Utah in its central basin. The Cascade Mountains of Washington and Oregon, the Sierra Nevada of California, and the Coast Range prolonged through the Californian peninsula, have a general direction from north to south; while the Wahsatch, the Humboldt, the Blue Mountains, the Salmon River, and other ranges, stand rather across the table-land, or obliquely, from west to east. It may be convenient to speak of the former series, regarded altogether, as the general Pacific Coast Range, which we also observe to be continued northward, with some intervals, beyond latitude 60° N. to the peninsula of Alaska, presenting summits of increased height, that of Mount St Elias being above 17,000 feet, and Mount Fairweather nearly 15,000 feet. In the Cascade Range are Mount St Helens, north of the Columbia River, attaining an elevation of 15,750 feet; Mount Hood and Mount Jefferson, about 15,500 feet. The Sierra Nevada, at its northern extremity, where it forms an acute angle with the coast range, displays the lofty terminal peak of Mount Shasta, having an altitude of 14,400 feet. The minor Californian Coast Range nowhere rises to 4000 feet. The main Cordillera or spine of Western North America, which in the British Dominion and in the United States’ territory is called the Rocky Mountains, but which takes the name of the Sierra Madre in Mexico, and in the isthmus, farther south, is split into two lower groups of a volcanic character, attains the height of 16,000 feet in Mount Brown, and 15,700 feet in Mount Hooker, both near the 54th degree of latitude, above the source of the Saskatchewan river; but Fremont, in the Wind River group, between Oregon and Nebraska, is 13,560 feet high, and there are peaks of 10,000 feet or 12,000 feet in Utah and New Mexico. The highest mountains, however, in North America, excelling even Mount St Elias, belong to a volcanic series which crosses the table-land of southern Mexico from west to east, and of which the culminating points are Popocatepetl, 17,884 feet, and Orizaba, 17,373 feet; while Agua, in Guatemala, rises to 13,000 feet. Thus we may remark, at each extremity of the Cordillera, at its north end, towards Alaska, and at its south end, in Central America, it is encountered by a cluster of volcanoes, Mount St Elias being one of this description, which exceed the height of the Rocky Mountains. The spaces enclosed between the main trunk and branches of this immense system of mountains are several hundred miles wide, and their surface is elevated 5000 feet or 6000 feet above the sea-level, as in the Utah lake-basin, the Nevada territory, and the plateau of Anahuac, or southern Mexico, which last has an elevation of 6000 feet to 8000 feet, and has therefore a temperate climate within the tropics.

An outline merely has been given of the western highland region of North America. The eastern highlands of this continent are mainly constituted by the Alleghanies or Appalachian system of mountains, with their dependencies, which are of no great height, the Black Mountain, or Mount Guyot, in North Carolina, being the highest, at 6476 feet; but they extend nearly 2000 miles, from the Gulf of St Lawrence to the Gulf of Mexico, having a general direction from north-east to south-west. The strip of land, one or two hundred miles wide, between these mountains and the Atlantic coast, is of the greatest historical interest, as it includes the seats of all the older English settlements on this continent, which seems destined for the grandest dwelling-place of our nation. North of the Gulf of St Lawrence, through the peninsula that terminates with Labrador between the Atlantic and Hudson’s Bay, the Appalachian system of mountains is continued, or resumed, in a range called the Watchish, only 1500 feet high, but in the severe climate of that region covered with perpetual snow. The Alleghanies, south of the St Lawrence, including the Green Mountains of Vermont and the White Mountains of New Hampshire, are not so much a chain of mountains as a long plateau, crested by several different ridges, and intersected by wide valleys of considerable elevation, but altogether on a much smaller scale than the highlands of Western America. East of the river Hudson the mountains are chiefly granitic, with rounded summits, often covered with turf or moss to the top; they assume a more regular formation in Pennsylvania, Virginia, and North Carolina, but again decline and break into detached groups in approaching their southern extremity in Alabama. Next to the summit in North Carolina, which is named above, Mount Washington in New Hampshire stands pre-eminent, with an altitude of 6428 feet. The scenery of these “White Mountains” is very striking, especially where the Saco river cleaves its way through the barrier of granite by a cutting two miles long, in one place only 22 feet wide, between lofty precipitous walls. It is in the “Green Mountains,” succeeding these to the west, and giving their name in French to the neighbouring State, that the prevalent form becomes that of round humps on a broad base, with firs or shrubs growing on the slopes, and with scanty grass or lichens on the summits. Both these two contrasted groups of New England mountains enter the State of Massachusetts from the north; the Hoosac and Taconic extensions of the Green Mountains rise on the west side, while the White Mountains are continued by those of which Mount Holyoke and Wachusett are the most conspicuous; and between their parallel ranges is the Connecticut river, with the Housatonic, Mount Tom, and Blue Hills to overlook its lower course. These features of the country, though of far less physical importance than the towering peaks of Colorado and California, will always be associated with the genuine traditions of English rural, domestic, and social life, transplanted to the New World in the 17th century, and defended by a long struggle against stern nature and savage men in the early age of the American colonies. The natural boundary separating New England from the great and more modern State of New York is that noble river the Hudson, rising in the Adirondack Mountains, near Lake Champlain and the waters of the St Lawrence, but pouring its beautiful and useful stream directly south, to the greatest of American commercial ports and cities. This river passes close by the Catskill and Shawangunk Mountains, from which is continued the general distribution of the eastern American highlands along the Atlantic states, but with a more westerly declination from the coast, running through Pennsylvania, West Virginia, the borders of Tennessee, and North Carolina, the upper parts of Georgia and Alabama. It is in Virginia that the Alleghanies have their greatest breadth, which is about 150 miles. They rise highest in North Carolina and Tennessee, and subsequently keep up a distinct line of position, across the cotton-growing States, between those of the Atlantic seaboard and those of the Lower Mississippi. This circumstance, it may be remarked, has had most important effects on the political and military events of late years, in the results of the attempted secession of the slaveholding States from the Union. Another feature of physical geography, which probably conditioned the earlier stages of that momentous civil struggle, in the disputes relating to the Missouri compromise and to the admission of Kansas as a free-soil State, is the existence of the Ozark range of mountains. These stand in the middle of the great Mississippi valley, stretching across from northern Texas to Arkansas and the confluence of the Missouri with the Mississippi. By the elevation they give to the soil, in latitudes between 30° and 40°, as well as by the raised table-land of New Mexico and Arizona farther west, the [9:1:679] area of United States’ territory suitable for cotton plantations and for slave labour was so far limited, and confined to the shores of the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic seaboard. At the same time, in the latitudes north of these, between 40° and 50°, the whole vast prairie region from the Ohio to the Rocky Mountains was adapted to the growth of corn, while it had such continuity and uniformity of surface, and was so pervaded by the grand riversystem of this middle plain of North America, that it could not well undergo political division. The entire West being thus secured to the Union, and the better part of the South being thus rescued from the curse of Negro slavery, by the moulding hand of nature in planning the distribution of mountain ranges and the level ground all over this continent, we may consider that the political and social destinies of the great English Republic, vindicated in the civil war from 1861 to 1865, were predetermined in the formation of the land.

The North American continent affords an interesting study of the geological changes and adjustments, by which the mighty work of preparation for what promises to be a noble development of humanity was slowly effected in the remote epochs of the past. The oldest sedimentary rocks anywhere found on the globe are those which underlie the whole of Canada, New Brunswick, and Newfoundland, the Labrador peninsula, and the country north of Lake Superior, perhaps also the less explored regions of the far north-west towards the Arctic Sea. This series, named the Laurentian, from the St Lawrence river, is perceived to exist in Europe only in a few scattered instances, in the Hebrides, and in Norway or Sweden. In North America it occupies the most extensive areas; the thickness of its beds is estimated by Sir William Logan at 30,000 feet; it rises to hills or mountains 4000 feet high, and in the deep gorge of the Saguenay river, forms perpendicular cliffs of 1500 feet. Only one fossil animal, which has been called the Eozoon Canadense, has been discovered to have left its trace in this most ancient bottom of the primeval ocean; it was one of the Foraminifera, which covered its gelatinous body with a thin crust of carbonate of lime, having numerous holes or pores for the emission of its filament-members, with which to feel and to feed outside. Next to the Laurentian, but with a vast unknown interval of time, comes the Huronian or Lower Cambrian series. It is suggested by geologists that, as the vast level bed of the Laurentian sea was cracked by internal changes of the earth’s density, these cracks threw up certain ridges along the surface of the present continent, which laid a foundation for the principal mountain ranges we have described. At the borders and extremities of these mountain ranges, it is evident that there were intense volcanic eruptions, producing great quantities of lava and conglomerate, basalt, greenstone, and other formations resulting from igneous action. The northern shores of Lakes Huron and Superior exhibit results of this kind; but it is in the table-lands between the Rocky Mountains and the west coast ranges, as in the singular lava beds near the Klamath, on the frontier of Oregon and North California, that volcanic forces have made their strongest marks on the earth. On the eastern side also of the grand Cordillera, between the sources of the Missouri and of the Yellowstone rivers, is a wonderful region of boiling springs or geysers, of sulphur beds and other natural curiosities, which have recently been described by Dr Hayden, of the United States’ Government Survey. To speak more generally of the local arrangement of different geological formations, it may be remarked that crystalline rocks are spread over the western parts of North America, from Alaska to Nicaragua, and over the most northern parts, also including Greenland; but some of later date are found in the eastern or Appalachian range, consisting of felspathic gneiss and quartz rocks, mingled with talcose and chloritic schists. The Palaeozoic formations occupy that middle part of the continent which lies between the Rocky Mountains and the great lakes, as well as the shores of Hudson’s Bay, and some portions of the Atlantic coasts. With reference to the Lower Silurian or Siluro-Cambrian period, it is abundantly illustrated by the Trenton and associated limestones, which can be traced over 40° of longitude, their beds consisting entirely of débris of coral, shells, and crinoids, from the shallow inland sea, teeming with animal life, that once filled the whole level space between the Alleghanies and the RockyMountains, separated by these ridges from the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and sheltered from the cold Arctic currents by the northern Laurentian highlands. This space, which is now the central plain of North America, comprising the prairies and the Mississippi valley, was then a coral sea with archipelagos of volcanic isles, resembling that of Australasia in the South Pacific. The next formation succeeding the Silurian presents immense deposits of sandstone and shale from the muddy waters troubled by subterranean motions; this is the Devonian formation, which in America has been called the Erian, on account of the great development of such beds south of Lake Erie. The deposits of this period in the western continent are stated to be 15,000 feet in thickness. They include the cliff limestones, studded with calcareous corals of great size and beauty of shape, noticed by Sir Charles Lyell at the falls of the Ohio, near Louisville; these limestones are estimated to extend, as an ancient coral reef, over 500,000 square miles of the American middle plain. In the State of New York and in Western Canada there is the corni-ferous limestone, in which the imbedded corals have been replaced, in the cavities they once filled, by flinty hornstones which present the perfect coral forms, as though cast in a mould. In the Carboniferous age the great internal sea of the continent was slowly changed into swampy flats and shallow lakes or creeks, and gradually filled with a rank vegetable growth, afterwards buried under later marine deposits and pressed into the existing coal-beds. Of this period there are very extensive developments throughout the eastern half of the great middle plain to the Alleghanies. This portion of America seems to have been land, covered with the forests of that period, while the western half of the middle plain, a northward extension of the Gulf of Mexico, was still under water. As the eastern half of North America, between the Mississippi and the Atlantic, was thus in the Carboniferous era well raised out of the sea, it exhibits no traces of the succeeding Permian age, such as we find in Europe. The earliest periods also of Mesozoic time have failed to leave any record here, but their formations appear towards the western range of mountains in what was the bed of a Mediterranean Sea. It is, however, the Cretaceous system, with its characteristic greensand, its sands, clays, marls, and soft grey limestones, that occupies most space in Western America, between the meridians of 97° and 112°. These strata, overlaid sometimes by those of the Tertiary periods, extend through the country up the Missouri, the Platte, the Arkansas, and the Red River, to the Rocky Mountains; they also form parts of the plains enclosed by different mountain ranges beyond the Cordillera. Along the eastern side of the Appalachians there is a broad belt of the Cretaceous formation, stretching from the Delaware across the upper parts of Virginia, Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama. Among the fossil animal remains discovered in this formation in North America, which are enumerated in a separate list, one of the most remarkable is that of the Mosasaurus, a combination of the serpent with the lizard [9:1:680] form, sometimes 80 feet in length, and of aquatic habits. The Tertiary deposits, including the boulder clay, prevail chiefly along the seaward districts, from Long Island, above New York, to the peninsula of Florida, and around the shores of the Mexican Gulf, and likewise on the Pacific shore from Lower California to Vancouver Island, also in some detached instances, as in Nebraska, in the midst of the interior plain. The newer Pliocene is met with in the southern part of Maine, and on the shores of Lake Champlain. The drift formation lies mostly north of 40° latitude. Alluvial deposits are of great amount from the large rivers and lakes, especially in the delta of the Mississippi, which has an area of 13,600 square miles, and must, by Sir Charles Lyell’s reckoning, have taken 67,000 years for its composition, at the rate of the bringing down of solid matter by that mighty river.

The mineral products of North America are of unequalled richness and variety. Gold is abundant, to a proverb, in California, and likewise in Nevada and Montana. It is also found in British Columbia, Mexico, Central America, and Canada, and sparingly in Virginia and South Carolina. Silver is obtained from Mexico in larger quantities than from any other country; it is supplied also by California and by Honduras, and a vein of this metal is worked in Newfoundland. Great masses of almost pure copper are found in the Huronian rock strata, the north and east shores of Lake Superior being the richest of copper-mining regions; while New York State and Indiana possess a share of the same metal, and it is found among the western mountains in different countries from British Columbia to the isthmus. The iron ores of Pennsylvania, and those of Canada, including New Brunswick, are of the greatest importance; the former are rendered more available by their occurring close to the beds of bituminous coal, giving materials for the manufacturing industry of Pittsburg; while anthracite coal is obtained from the eastern districts of Pennsylvania. It is estimated that one-third of the total area of this State is occupied by coal-fields, which can scarcely be exhausted. Lead is found in Wisconsin, Illinois, and Missouri, in New York State, in Canada, in California, and in Central America, as well as quicksilver; white zinc is got from Arkansas and New Jersey; both Canada and Mexico produce tin. Reverting to the subject of coal, as having an intimate economic connection with all metallic wealth, it should be observed that the united area of all the coal-fields in the United States is estimated at 190,000 square miles, exceeding twentyfold those of Europe. The chief of these coal-fields are, first, the Appalachian, extending from the Susquehanna, in Pennsylvania, to the Tuscaloosa, in Alabama, along the west side of the Alleghany Mountains; the area of this coal-field is 70,000 square miles, and its greatest thickness 2500 feet; secondly, the coal-field of Michigan, about the centre of that State; thirdly, the extensive coal-field between the Ohio and the Mississippi, across the States of Indiana and Illinois; lastly, the Iowa and Missouri coal-field, which occupies a large space in the very centre of the continent. Coal is found also in Nova Scotia, in British Columbia, and Vancouver Island, and wherever the Upper Palaeozoic strata prevail in the geological structure. But in the vast extent of British American territory north-west of Lake Superior, around Lake Winnipeg and up the Saskatchewan river, even as far as the Peace river, in latitude 56° N., it may be expected that manufacturing as well as agricultural prosperity will result from the use of immense stores of natural wealth existing in the soil of that long-neglected land, which is now proved to have a climate not more severe than the inhabited provinces of Canada. The iron and copper, more especially of the Canadian Dominion, will employ and enrich, in all probability. at some future period, a nation that may become greater in material resources than the most powerful kingdoms of Europe. In view of these prospects from the working of the useful metals, by the aid of that most useful product of the earth which supplies heat and mechanical force to the service of human industry, we may regard the Californian gold-fields as a matter of secondary importance. They have indeed been surpassed by the productiveness of those in Australia and New Zealand.

Nine-tenths of North America lying under the temperate zone, the climate follows a different law from what is observed in the southern peninsula, and presents more striking contrasts with that of the best known parts of the Old World. The long narrow region now denominated Central America, which connects the two great divisions of the continent, stretching from Panama to Tehuantepec, has in general a very humid atmosphere; but, for a tropical country, it must be only moderately hot, as every part of it is within a small distance of the sea. At Vera Paz the rains fall during nine months of the year. Mexico is hot, moist, and unhealthy on the low coasts; but two-thirds of its area, comprising all the populous districts, consist of table-land, from 5000 to 9000 feet in height. In consequence of this singular configuration of its surface, Mexico, though chiefly within the torrid zone, enjoys a temperate and equable climate. The mean heat at the capital, which is 7400 feet above the sea, is 62½ o , and the difference between the warmest and coldest months, which exceeds 30° at London, is here only about 12°; but the atmosphere is deficient in moisture, and the country suffers from drought. Beyond the parallel of 24° N. the western shores are hot and arid.

In the extensive region lying between the parallels of 30° and 50° N., which comprehends three-fourths of the useful soil of North America, we have three well-marked varieties of climate, that of the east coast, the west coast, and the basin of the Mississippi. On the east coast, from Georgia to Lower Canada, the mean temperature of the year is lower than in Europe by 9° at the latitude of 40°, and by 12½° at the latitude of 50°, according to Humboldt’s calculation. In the next place, the range of the thermometer is much greater than in Europe, the summer being much hotter and the winter much colder. At Quebec the temperature of the warmest month exceeds that of the coldest by no less than 60½ o of Fahr.; while at Paris, which is nearly under the same latitude, the difference is only 31°. In the third place, the climate undergoes a more rapid change in America as we proceed from south to north, a degree of latitude in the middle of the temperate zone producing a decrease of annual temperature of 1° ∙13 Fahr. in Europe, and of 1° ∙57 Fahr. in America. The comparison is greatly to the disadvantage of America when made in this form; but when the east coasts of the two continents are compared, the case is altered; the Old World is found to have no superiority over the New, for Pekin has still colder winters and warmer summers than Philadelphia, which is under the same latitude. It is the west coast of the new continent which ought to exhibit the climate of Europe; and from the observations made, we have reason to believe that it is quite as mild and equable. At the mouth of Columbia river, in latitude 46½ o N., it appears that the mean heat of the warmest month was about 62° Fahr., of the coldest about 36°, and of the whole year 51°. Now the place is under the same latitude with Quebec, where the snow lies five months, and the mean temperature during the three winter months is 18° below the freezing point. This single circumstance marks emphatically the contrast in the climate of the east and west coasts of North America. But the mouth of Columbia river is also under the same parallel with Nantes at the mouth of the Loire; and we have, therefore, good grounds to conclude that the west [9:1:681] coast of America, in the middle latitudes, has nearly as mild and equable a climate as the west coast of Europe. The climate of the great central valley, or basin of the Mississippi, has a considerable affinity to that of the east coast. It was long a matter of dispute in what the difference between the two consists, but this seems at last to have been clearly settled by the meteorological registers kept at the military posts of the United States. From a comparison of four of these registers, from posts near the centre of this great valley, with others kept on the Atlantic coast in the same latitudes, it appears that the extremes of heat and cold in the basin of the Mississippi are from 5° to 6° higher and lower than on the coasts of New England. The proportion of fair weather to cloudy is as 5 to 1 in favour of the east coast. The climate of the interior, therefore, exhibits in still greater excess those extremes of temperature which distinguish the eastern coast of this continent from the western, and from the shores of Europe. The fourth region of extra-tropical America includes the parts beyond Mount St Elias on the west coast, and, in the interior, the plains extending from the 50th parallel to the Polar Seas. The intensity of the cold in this tract of country is scarcely equalled by anything that is known under the same parallels in Northern Asia. The northernmost spot in America where grain is raised is at Lord Selkirk’s colony, on Red River, in latitude 50°. Wheat, and also maize, which requires a high summer heat, are cultivated here. Barley would certainly grow as far north as Fort Chippewyan, in latitude 58¾ o , where the heat of the four summer months was found by Captain Franklin to be 4° higher than at Edinburgh. There is even reason to believe, that both this species of grain and potatoes might thrive as far north as Slave Lake, since the spruce fir attains the height of 50 feet three degrees farther north, at Fort Franklin, in latitude 65°. These, however, are low and sheltered spots; but in this dreary waste generally, it will not be found practicable, we suspect, to carry the arts of civilised life beyond the 60th parallel; and the desirable country, capable of supporting a large population, and meriting the name of temperate, can scarcely be said to extend beyond the 52d parallel. At 65° the snow covers the ground in winter to the depth of only two feet, but small lakes continue frozen for eight months. The sea is open only for a few weeks, fogs darken the surface, and the thermometer in February descended in one instance to minus 58°, or 90° below the freezing point. At Melville Island, under the 75th parallel, such is the frightful rigour of the climate, that the temperature of the year falls 1° or 2° below the zero of Fahrenheit’s scale. It is a peculiarity in the climate of America, that beyond the parallel of 50° or 52°, it seems to become suddenly severe at both extremities. At the one, summer disappears from the circle of the seasons; at the other, winter is armed with double terrors.

The zoology of America is especially interesting, on account of the contrast which exists between the faunas of the north and south portions of the continent—a contrast which is especially exhibited in the case of the Mammalia. The zoological province which naturalists mark off as constituted by South America and part of Central America has been termed the neotropical region, and the area which has the nearest relationship to this is the Indian region. As regards South America, the Andes have the highest value as zoological boundaries; next to them in importance are the rivers, and then the confines of the forest region. The Quadrumana are well represented, and are especially characteristic of the forest region which principally prevails in the western half of the continent. None are known to occur on the west side of the Andes south of Guayaquil. The sub-order Platyrhina is peculiar to South America, and so far as research has yet extended, it is not known even to have existed on any other area. On the other hand, no catarhine or lemurine Quadrumana have yet been found in South America. Some of the lower forms of monkey appear to have some affinity with the Lemuridae, which occur in India, Africa, and Madagascar. There are two families, viz., the Cebidae and Hapalidae, all the members of which are strictly arboreal in habits. Some of these monkeys are the most highly developed tree-climbers known, and in many cases they rarely if ever descend to the ground; and since the monkeys of South America have never been seen to swim, it might be expected that the broad streams of the continent effectually limit the distribution of certain monkeys. The largest species is Lagothrix Humboldtii, so that as a whole the American monkeys are smaller than those of Asia and Africa. As they are the most powerful of arboreal Mammalia, they rule the forests, and this may in part account for the scarcity of squirrels in this region. The Cebidae have a wide range, extending from the south of Mexico to the Uruguay. They include the highest forms of American monkey, and its most specialised representatives are those which have the best adaptation for life in trees, as may be exemplified by Ateles, with its long limbs and prehensile tail. This latter organ serves all the purposes of a fifth hand; the under surface is bare and provided with tactile papillae, so that a monkey not only holds by, but also feels with it. It is as mobile and flexible, and in its way as useful to this genus of monkey as is the trunk to the elephant. The genus includes numerous species, the estimate of different naturalists varying from 8 to 40, but about 10 species have been well established. Most of them occur in Brazil and the Guianas; but each species generally has circumscribed limits. Thus A. paniscus occurs in the north-east corner of the continent, between the Rio Negro and the Amazon. On the south side of the Amazon its place is taken by another species, A. marginatus. A. Bartlettii occurs on the Upper Amazon. Brachyteles is represented by a single species in South-East Brazil. Several species of Lagothrix have been described, although perhaps all are but varieties of but one species. L. Humboldtii is confined to the Upper Amazon, west of the Rio Negro, and in some of the contiguous valleys of the Orinoco basin. Mycetes has six species, ranging from Guatemala to South Brazil. Μ. seniculus occurs on the north side of the Lower Amazon; Μ. caraya on the Upper Amazon; and Μ. belzebuth is the species which occurs near Para, and south of the Lower Amazon. All the above genera have prehensile tails, with bare under surfaces. Nyctipithecus, with three or four species, occurs in the upper portions of the Rio Negro, Amazon, and Orinoco basins. Callithrix ranges over the same ground, but also extends into South-East Brazil. Chrysothrix occurs throughout the northern part of the region. The genus Pithecia (including Brachyurus) is represented by about 12 species in the Amazon basin. P. irrorata is confined to the south bank of the Upper Amazon; another species only occurs on the north side to the west of the Rio Negro. P. satanas is the species east of the Rio Negro, and there is a species limited to the south side of the Upper Amazon. The family Hapalidae, or marmosets, has about 30 species, belonging to the genera Hapale and Midas, which range throughout the forests of South America. One species, H. oedipus, occurs in Costa Rica, but this is the northernmost limit of the family. It seems that the distribution of the monkeys is restricted to the areas clad with continuous forests, so that the absence of monkeys in the Pampean, Andisian, and Peruvian sub-regions is mainly due to the absence of continuous forests. It is also noticeable that the sub-orders, families, and genera extend over the greater portion of the Brazilian sub-region; whereas in [9:1:682] many instances this sub-region is parcelled out into districts by the larger streams, which are characterised by distinct species. Hence it is probable that the continuousness of the forest area has lasted throughout the duration of those species, but not so long as the genera have existed; and that those species which occur on both sides of the Amazon, Rio Negro, and other large rivers, originated at an earlier period than those restricted to one side. The want of means of communication with North America would account for the absence of monkeys in that region. Our space will not allow of our dwelling so fully on the other orders, but we may notice that the arboreal habit is strongly marked in many, and that the strictly arboreal groups are frequently represented in river-bounded areas by distinct species. It often happens that genera, both of vertebrates and invertebrates, which are elsewhere terrestrial, are represented in the Amazonian forests by arboreal species.

The Carnivora do not present so marked a feature as regards distribution as the monkeys. The families Felidae, Canidae, Mustelidae, and Ursidae are represented; but the Hyaenidae and Viverridae are absent, unless Bassaris of Mexico be referred to the latter family. The Felidae comprise two groups, one formed of species which are uniformly coloured, the other of those which are striped or spotted. Felis onca, the jaguar, is the largest feline animal of this region, and ranges from La Plata to Louisiana, and on both sides of the Peruvian Andes. The puma or F. concolor is known everywhere from Patagonia to as far as 50° or 60° N., a range from north to south of about 110°, which is probably greater than that of any other mammal. F. payeros occurs on all the pampas of the southern portion of South America. F. mitis and F. macrura belong to South-East Brazil; F. tigrina and celidogaster to the Amazon basin; while F. pardalis, F. eyra, and F. yagouaroundi range from Brazil to Texas. The Canidae family is represented by the genera Icticyon and Canis. The former comprises but one species, which is confined to Brazil, viz., I. venaticus, which is an aberrant form between dogs and badgers. The dogs comprise C. jubatus, C. cancrivorus, C. vetulus, C. fulvicaudus, C. azaroe, C. magellanicus, and one or two other species. The Mustelidae are not abundant, there being only a few species of each of the sub-families Mustelinae, L utrinae, and Melinoe; and among others Mustela frenata; two species of Galictis, a genus only found in this region; Lutra chilensis and braziliensis; and several species of Mephitis belonging to the sub-genus Thiosmus. Of Ursidae there occur Ursus ornatus in Peru, and perhaps Ursus frugilegus ; Procyon cancrivorus, Nasua, and Cercoleptes. The last two genera are characteristic of South America. In this order the species, with the exception of a few which range into North America, are restricted to this area; but only four of the eleven genera are peculiar, the others ranging not only into North America, but also into the Old World. The latter genera do not form a prominent feature in the fauna, and the species have probably migrated from North America in comparatively recent times from a geological point of view.

In the order Artiodactyla the sub-order Ruminantia is represented by a few species only of Cervus, belonging to the neotropical sub-genera Furcifer, Coassus,and Blastocerus, and even these only occur sparingly in the open tracts. There is nothing to represent the enormous herds of Antelopes and Bovidae, which are so characteristic of North America and portions of the Old World. Auchenia, however, is a characteristic genus frequenting the Andes, and is interesting on account of its being the only genus of Ruminants which is confined to South America. It is isolated and far distant from the other members of the family Camelidae, which are now special to Asia; but, as we shall presently find, the gap in distribution and structure is supplied by the extinct species of North America. The characteristic genus Dicotyles is the sole representative in South America of the sub-order Omnivora and of the family Suidae, a family which is restricted (naturally) to the Neotropical, Aethiopian, and Indian regions. Another remarkable genus is Tapirus, which represents in this region the elephants and rhinoceroses of the Old World. Until recently, the tapirs of Sumatra and the Malay Archipelago were considered to belong to the same genus, but Dr Gray has proposed that the latter be ranked in a distinct genus, Rhinochoerus. There are several species of South American tapirs, viz., T. americanus, T. villosus, T. Laurillardii, T. Roulinii, and perhaps one or two others not determined. An allied form exists in the isthmus of Panama, namely Elasmognathus Bairdii, which is considered as the type of a distinct sub-family. There are no true Proboscideans in this region. The order Sirenia is represented by the genus Manatus, of which three or four species occur in the Amazon and other large rivers. This genus is remarkable for its distribution, since species belonging to it frequent the freshwater streams of the opposite coast of Africa. Several species of dolphins and porpoises occur in the larger rivers; some of them range up almost to their sources, and are strictly river species, being unknown in the adjoining seas. The presence of these cetaceans, together with the distance of the shores (several miles) and the high waves, impart to some portions of these rivers a more or less oceanic aspect. The order Bruta is abundantly represented in this region, of the fauna of which it constitutes the most marked peculiarity. Marsupialism is not a prominent feature in this region, but its presence is important, because it now occurs nowhere else out of the Australian region. It should be observed that the connection is stronger with the extinct marsupial fauna of Palaearctic regions than with the living one of Australia.

The fossil and living mammalia of this region seem to indicate that at present our knowledge of the extinct faunas is very fragmentary. This is shown in various ways. None of the remains can be definitely assigned to an older period than the Post-Pliocene. The region was essentially the same as at present, zoologically, the same characteristic groups of platyrhine apes, rodents, cats, dogs, edentates, and opossums being represented; while the catarhine apes, Insectivora, oxen, rhinoceroses, and other groups were excluded, or at any rate are not known to have existed in it, so that its isolation from the other zoological regions must have commenced before the Post-Pliocene period. The extraordinary development of large forms allied to the sloths and ant-eaters; the restriction of the Toxodontia amongst the Post-Pliocene mammals, and of the subungulated Rodents among the living mammals to this region,—these and other facts would lead the palaeontologist to believe that the area must have been inhabited by mammals during the periods which preceded the Post-Pliocene, as far back, perhaps, as the Miocene or Eocene. The Toxodontia include the forms of Pachyderms most nearly allied to the Rodents, while the subungulated Rodents are those of the order which approach nearest to the Pachyderms. As both these groups occur here, and here only, we may reasonably expect to find genera partaking of the general features of both orders in beds of an earlier geological age in South America. The principal genera and species found fossil in this region are the following. In the Argentine Confederation we have—

Macrauchenia patachonica. Felis longifrons.

Glyptodon spinicaudus. Canis protalopex.

clavipes. avus.

tuberculatus. Mephitis primaeva.

pumilio. Ursus bonaerensis.

clavicaudatus. Myopotamus bonaerensis.

clavatus. antiquus, asper. Ctenomys bonaerensis.

elongatus. Lagostomus augustidens.

Some of these also occur in Brazil, where species have also been found belonging to the genera Callithrix, Cebus, Protopithecus, Chlamydotherium, Coelogenys, Colodon, Dasypus, Equus neogaeus, Equus principalis, Euryidon, Heterodon, Hoplophorus, Myrmecophaga, Nesodon, Pachy-therium, and Xenurus. Remains of many of these genera have also been found on the banks of the Rio Negro in Uruguay, and those of some, such as Mastodon, Equus, Auchenia, &c., in Ecuador. As space forbids our dwelling upon the points of interest which these fossil forms present, we pass on to the lists of the extinct faunas of North America.

The oldest species yet found in North America belongs to Dromatherium, and was found in the Triassic beds of Virginia. Then nothing is known until we come to the Tertiary deposits which were formed in lakes along the base and in the midst of the Rocky Mountains and neighbouring ranges, and in the marine beds which lie nearer the present sea margin. The following lists are given by Dr Leidy,^[2. Jouτn. Acad. Nat. Sci. Philadelphia, vol. vii. 1869.] who considers the oldest beds in Nebraska, which rest on the Cretaceous series, as of Miocene age. They contain Titanotherium prouti, Lophiodons, and several other forms which would induce us to regard them as Eocene. However, we follow his lists. The Miocene species are—
[table]

Since this list was published numerous genera and species have been discovered in Wyoming and other districts in the far west from what appear to be the older or Eocene group of beds. Amongst these the most remarkable is the large Dinoceras mirabilis, an animal which had three pairs of horns, and which was intermediate in character between the Proboscideans and the Perissodactvles. There are also several generalised forms in the foregoing lists, which present a fauna with numerous remarkable features, which we can only briefly allude to. It is quite distinct in character from the present South American fauna, and yet, like it, it has a strong Asiatic facies; at the same time it resembles in many points the older Tertiary fauna of Europe. The occurrence of rhinoceroses, camels, and musk-deer, is noticeable; but its great feature is the abundance of oreodonts (which family is not known elsewhere) and of equine forms. The Pliocene fauna consists of the following genera and species :—
[table]

Here it is observable that, while this fauna has a general resemblance to that of the preceding period, most of the genera are distinct. Several existing genera make their appearance, as also a number of forms which appear to have migrated from South America, and after a temporary estab∙
[9:1:684]

lishment to have disappeared. One remarkable feature is the abundance of horses, which is such that North America may be regarded as the land of horses during the Pliocene and Post-Pliocene period.

The existing mammals of North America must now be considered. We can only refer to a few of the more conspicuous species here. South America has numerous families peculiar to itself, but North America has none which are not also represented in South America. There are numerous representatives of the Canidae or dog family, such as the prairie, Mexican, and maned wolves, and several foxes, of which the Arctic, common American, cross, and silver foxes are of high commercial value on account of their furs. Amongst the cats are three or four species of lynx, which afford valuable furs. The beaver, though abundant in some places, is, like the bison, fast diminishing before the encroaching steps of the colonists. The grizzly, the black, and the polar bears are common in the more mountainous and colder regions of the continent, and are much hunted by the fur traders. Racoons and Virginian opossums are prevalent in the south portion of the United States. The Rocky Mountain goat reigns supreme amidst the rocks in inaccessible fastnesses of the Rocky Mountain range; while the rein-deer, the elk, and the wapiti give a character to the mammalian fauna of the more level districts. Further details respecting the mammals of North America will be found under the names of the separate countries; and those who wish for still fuller information may consult the works of Lord, Small, Müller, Harlan, and Allen on the mammals of various regions, The Quadrupeds of North America by Audubon and Bachman, the articles by Gilpin in the publications of the Institute of Natural Science at Halifax, Adams’ Field and Forest Rambles, The North-West Passage by Viscount Milton and Dr Cheadle, Morgan’s work on the Beaver, and the numerous reports issued by exploration expeditions.

The birds of America are very numerous in almost every great family. The researches of Wilson, Charles Lucien Bonaparte, Audubon, Richardson, Dekay, Blakiston, Cassin, Gundlach, Lord Lawrence, Sclater, Salvin, and Baird, have beautifully illustrated the ornithology of North America; while those of Azara, Humboldt, Swainson, Waterton, Edmonstone, Darwin, Landbeck, Philippi, Cassin, &c., have thrown great light on that of South America. The North American species of birds already described amount to nearly 700; the species of South America are over 2300; so that we may fairly estimate the ornithology of America to include upwards of 3000 species. The fossil remains deserve particular notice. It is very probable that the footprints on the older secondary rocks of North America are those of birds. A large number of remarkable genera found in the Cretaceous rocks have recently been described by Professor Marsh and others.

The serpents of America are very numerous, and include amongst others, the following genera :—Tortrix, Calamaria, Coronella, Xenodon, Heterodon, Lycodon, Coluber, Herpetodryas,Psammophis, Dendrophis, Dryophis, Dipsas, Tropidonotus, Homalopsis, Boa, Elaps, Trigono-cephalus, Crotalus.

Of these the genera Heterodon and Crotalus or rattlesnake are entirely peculiar to America, and the latter are by far the most deadly of serpents. The reptilia of North America have been well described by Dekay and Holbrooke.

The North American saurians belong to the genera Crocodile, Alligator, Anolis, Skink, Agama, Tropidolepis, Ophisaurus, Leptophis. Of the Ranidae there are Rana, Bufo, and Hyla.

The North American and Asiatic regions form a zoological kingdom, according to Dr Strauch, which is characterised by the prevalence of Emydes and by the presence of Trionychides. In the North American region there are 44 species distributed over four sub-regions—viz., the northwest part, which lies west of the Rocky Mountains; the north-east part, which lies east of them; the south-east part and the south-west part, which embraces Central America. South America and Australia together form another kingdom, characterised by the prevalence of Chelydes, and the total absence of Trionychides. There are about 35 species in the South American region.

The multitude of fishes in South America is extraordinary, and still more so is the marvellous variety of form which they exhibit. A large number of species have very circumscribed ranges, so that not only does each river basin have a distinct fauna, but a number of distinct faunas occupy different portions of the same river, as is well exemplified in the Amazons, Tocantins, Rio Negro, and other rivers, where most of the fishes at stations a few hundred miles apart are for the most part specifically distinct. Professor Agassiz, in his scientific journey through Brazil, collected about 2000 species from the Amazon basin only. In fishes, as in other classes, there is a remarkable difference between the faunas of North and South America, and in this class also North America has much in common with Europe and North Asia. The sturgeons abound in North America, but are absent in South America, where the corresponding group is the Goniodonts; the Siluroids are abundant in both portions of the continent; the perches are numerous throughout North America, but none occur in South America, where, however, they are represented by the Chromids. The Cyprinoids are abundant in North America, but absent in South America, where we have the allied group of Cyprinodonts. The Characines of South America represent the Salmonidae of North America, each group being confined to its own portion of the continent. There are several other small families present in South America, such as the Erythrinoids, Gymnotines, and others.

In the meagre outline of American vegetation which it is possible to attempt here, we shall more or less strictly adhere to the principle laid down by Schouw, viz., that in constituting a botanical region, at least one-half of the species and one-fourth of the genera should be peculiar to it. We shall therefore divide the horizontal range of the vast continent into zones, commencing with the Arctic, and proceeding towards the Antarctic Circle.

In the Arctic Region or Region of Saxifragaceoe, as near to the Pole as man has yet penetrated, is found the red snow plant (Protococcus nivalis), penetrating the snow itself, sometimes to the depth of 12 feet, and covering for miles with its crimson tints the cliffs and ice-floes of the Polar Sea. Greenland is botanically distinguishable from Arctic America proper, inasmuch as it produces heath (Calluna vulgaris), which, it is somewhat remarkable, is nowhere to be found on the continent.

The most remarkable of the sub-arctic lichens is that known as Tripe de Roche, which has often preserved the lives of famished “trappers,” who, but for its sustenance, must have perished of hunger. The Saxifrages which distinguish. this region vary in species, and sometimes in genera, from those of Europe, but, generally speaking, there is a strong resemblance, which amounts almost to identity, as the Arctic shores are approached.

Emerging from the region of Saxifragaceoe, we find 1 ourselves in that of the Asters and Solidagos, extending to the parallel of 36° N. This region not only produces many species of aster and solidago, but also a great variety of oaks and firs, and numerous species of Vaccinium.. Among the oaks of Canada and the United States are, the lime oak (Quercus virens), the laurel oak (Quercus laurifolia), the black oak (Quercus tinctoria), the white or iron oak [9:1:685] (Quercus alba and Quercus obtusiloba), and the scarlet oak (Quercus coccinea). None of these, in regard to the quality of their timber, can stand comparison with the British oak, though some of them are very valuable.

The western or Californian and Oregon districts of this region are in many respects distinct in character. Pole- moniaceoe abound; also Eschscholtzia californica, species of Platystemon, Nemophila, Gilia, Collinsia, Clarkia, Bar-tonia, and Eutocha. Coniferae also exist in abundance, some of them possessing great botanical interest, such as Abies Douglasii, Pattoniana, nobilis, amabilis, grandis, lasiocarpa, Pinus Lambertiana, Sabiniana, insignis, Jeffreyi, ponderosa, monticola, californica, Fremontiana, Coulteri, flexilis, Thuja gigantea, Sesguoia gigantea, Juniperus dealbata and occidentalis, and Castanea chrysophylla. Pinus ponderosa predominates in the forests of Upper Oregon, and along with it occur Abies balsamea, canadensis, Douglasii, nobilis, and alba. Vivid colours mark the basaltic region of Upper Oregon. Rhododendron macrophyllum is found in Vancouver Island. Barley, oats, rye, wheat, buckwheat, and maize, along with the common fruit-trees and culinary vegetables of the temperate regions, are cultivated.

The region of Magnolias lies between parallels 30° and 36°, embracing the southern portion of North America. Nearly seventy species are known to exist. Cycadaceae, Anonaceae, Sapindaceoe, Zingiberaceae, Melastomaceae, Cac-taceae, and numerous other tropical forms, show themselves.

The forest trees display either broad shining foliage like the Liriodendron and Aesculus, or pinnated leaves like the Acacia and Robinia. They are, moreover, decked with magnificent blossoms. Rice, sugar-cane, and cotton are the special objects of culture in this region.

The region of Cactuses and Peppers includes Mexico, Guatemala, and South America to the Amazon (to an elevation of 5000 feet above the sea-level), as also Guiana, certain parts of Peru, and New Granada. The leaves of the plants of the isthmus of Panama are covered with hair and tomentum, while greenish and yellow flowers predominate. The included portion of South America produces Mauritia flexuosa, the Murichi or Ita Palm, and Victoria regia. The vegetable-ivory palm (Phytelephas macrocarpa) is a native of Columbia and Peru. Yams, plantains, chocolate, sugar, coffee, cocoa-nut, &c., are cultivated in this region.

The Mexican highlands, rising over 5500 feet above the sea-level, produce Pinus religiosa, Pinus apulcensis, Pinus H artwegii, Pinus Montezum ae , and Taxodium distichum. European grains are cultivated with success.

The region of medicinal bark trees (Cinchonas) embraces the Cordilleras between parallels 5° N. and 20° S., where the elevation ranges between 5000 and 9600 feet. Tn the lower parts of this region coffee, maize, and potato are cultivated.

The region of Calceolarias and Escallonias is, generally speaking, coextensive with the preceding, but at an elevation greater than 9600.

The West Indian region is marked by the prevalence of ferns and orchids, and has a vegetation intermediate between that of Mexico and the north of South America.

We next come to the region of Palms and Melastomas, which lies to the east of the Andes, between the Equator and the Tropic of Capricorn. Here the luxuriance of vegetable life is almost startling to European eyes. The forest trees of Brazil tower to an almost incredible height, while the very underwood is composed of Palms, Melastomaceae, Myrtaceae, Crotons, and Tree Ferns. In the treeless belts are found Heliconias, Dorstenias, and tall grasses. Immense Compositae, Vernonias, arborescent Solanums, and species of Fuchsia, Solandra, Lasiandra, Laurus, Ficus, and Cassia abound. The trees are covered, stem and branch, with Ferns, Araceae, Tillandrias, Orchids, Cactuses, Pepero-mias, Gesneras, and innumerable other epiphytic plants.

The region of arborescent Compositoe, extending from the Tropic of Capricorn to lat. 40° S., embraces Southern Brazil, La Plata, and Chili. The distinctive features of the Upper Cordilleras reappear here; Calceolarias and Escallonias abound. Thuja tetragona, Podocarpus chiliana, Thuja chilensis, and Chili pine (Araucaria imbricata), are native to this region, the last-named being a hardy conifer, extend ing along the Chilian Andes from 37° to 40° S. In the neighbourhood of Rio Janeiro is found Araucaria brazi-liana. Wheat, vine, peach, and many European plants are cultivated to great perfection in this region.

The Antarctic region comprehends the Strait of Magalhaens, Tierra del Fuego, and the Falkland Islands. Many European, and more especially British, genera appear in this region, and species of Saxifraga, Gentiana, Arbutus, Primula, and other Arctic and North Temperate forms are common. In Fuegia the evergreen beech (Fagus Forsteri), the deciduous beech (Fagus antartica), and Drymis Win-teri, correspond to the birch, oak, and mountain ash of Scotland. The Fuchsia is a native of Fuegia. Among shrubs may be mentioned Chiliotricum amelloides, Veronica elliptica and decussata, Empetrum rubrum, and Pernettya empetrifolia; among ferns, Lomaria alpina and Magel-lanica; and among lichens, Usnea melaxantha.

Northern America, though its vast forests have now been exposed for centuries to the axe of civilised man, is still one of the best wooded regions of the world. Among the principal forest-trees are the pine, oak, ash, hickory, red-beech, Canadian poplar, chestnut, black walnut, maple, tulip-tree, and white cedar.

Central America produces extensively mahogany, pimento, sarsaparilla, vanilla, Peruvian balsam, and many other valuable woods and drugs.

Nearly two-thirds of the surface of South America are still covered with gigantic forests, which must ultimately disappear, like many of those in the north, before the combined efforts and necessities of commerce and agriculture. The most distinctive and valuable forest-trees of South America are the greenheart and the mora. The cow-tree, which yields a juice very like milk in its properties, is also a remarkable product of this region.

Maize is by far the most important farinaceous product of the New World. It was the only grain which the earliest European settlers found cultivated, to some extent, by the natives. For nutrition it is inferior to wheat, but it is much more prolific, and is suited to a greater variety of soils. Tobacco is also indigenous to America, whence its use has extended over the whole world. Among roots, the potato, which we also owe to America, is without a rival. Millet, tapioca, arrow-root, cocoa, copaiva, cinchona, jalap, sassafras, nux-vomica, the cochineal plant, the agave or American aloe, and the pine-apple are also indigenous to the continent.

It is impossible here to do more than touch on the vast subject of the botany and the indigenous vegetable products of the New World. For fuller information, in addition to that contained in articles in the present work that treat of the geographical distribution of plants, the reader is referred to the numerous valuable American works of such authors as Beck, Bigelow, Breckenridge, Brown, Carson (Medical Botany), Darby, Darlington (Agricultural Botany), Asa Gray, Harvey (Algae), Ravenel, Sprague, Strong, Torrey, &c. An extended description of the forest trees of North America will be found in the great work of Michaux and Nuttall, The North American Sylva.

The origin, history, languages, and condition of the American nations present ample materials for speculation; but before touching on these subjects, the question presents [9:1:686] itself, What is the total of the indigenous population? Humboldt, in 1823, estimated the number of Indians at 8,610,000. Bollaert estimated the number existing in 1863 as follows :—
[table]

It is probable that these numbers have been diminished: the latest official returns for the United States’ territories, in 1872, estimate the Indian population at 300,000.

The indigenous population of America presents man under many aspects, and society in various stages, from the regular but limited civilisation of Mexico and Peru, to savage life in its most brutal state of abasement. At one extremity of the country we find the pigmy Esquimaux of four feet and a half in height, and at the other the Patagonian standing above six feet. In complexion the variety is great, and may be said to embrace almost every hue known elsewhere on the face of the earth, except the pitchy black of the Negro. About one-half of all the known languages belong to America; and if we consider every little wandering horde a distinct community, we have a greater number of nations here than in all the rest of the world. Amidst all this diversity philosophers have thought they were able to discover certain general characters, sufficiently marked to distinguish the American nations from those of the old continent. It is foreign to our purpose to inquire whether the varieties of form, stature, and complexion, in the human species, are modifications produced by external causes operating differently on distinct portions of the progeny of one primitive pair, or whether several races were originally created, and have given birth, by their mixture, to the amazing varieties we witness. We assume the former opinion as true, because the probabilities seem to be in its favour; but the phenomena present themselves to us in the same light in whichever way they originated.

Physiologists are not at one in their accounts of the characteristics of the aborigines of the new world, nor are they agreed as to whether they should be considered one race or several. Blumenbach places them all under one class, except the Esquimaux. Bory St Vincent divides them into four races, or five if we include the Esquimaux, under the following designations:—1. The Colombian, which comprehends the tribes formerly inhabiting the Alleghany Mountains, Canada, Florida, the eastern coasts of Mexico, and Central America; and the Caribs, who occupied the West India Islands and Guiana. 2. The American, embracing the tribes which occupy all the other parts of South America east of the Andes, except Patagonia. 3. The Patagonian race, inhabiting the southern extremity of the continent. 4. The Neptunian, inhabiting the western coasts of both divisions of the continent, from California to Cape Horn, and which he considers as essentially the same with the race spread over the Malay Peninsula and the Indian Archipelago. With this race are classed the Mexicans and Peruvians. By another writer the species are reduced to two, the Colombian and the American; the former including all the North American tribes, with the Caribs, the Mexicans, and Peruvians, and other inhabitants of the Cordillera; and the latter the Brazilian Indians and Patagonians. Neither of these systems, when tested by facts, is very satisfactory. Dr Prichard thinks that the mutual resemblance among the American nations has been exaggerated by some writers; yet it is certain that there is more of a common family character in their organisation than in that of the indigenous population of Asia or Africa. “The Indians of New Spain,” says Humboldt, “bear a general resemblance to those who inhabit Canada, Florida, Peru, and Brazil. We have the same swarthy and copper colour, straight and smooth hair, small beard, squat body, long eye, with the corner directed upwards towards the temples, prominent cheek-bones, thick lips, and expression of gentleness in the mouth, strongly contrasted with a gloomy and severe look. Over a million and a half of square leagues, from Cape Horn to the river St Lawrence and Behring’s Straits, we are struck at the first glance with the general resemblance in the features of the inhabitants. We think we perceive them all to be descended from the same stock, notwithstanding the prodigious diversity of their languages. In the portrait drawn by Volney of the Canadian Indians, we recognise the tribes scattered over the savannahs of the Apure and the Carony. The same style of features exists in both Americas.”

On the authority of Dr Morton, the most natural division of the Americans is into two families, the Toltecan and the American; the former of which bears evidence of centuries of half-civilisation, while the latter embraces all the barbarous nations of the New World, with the exception of the Polar tribes, which are evidently of Mongolian origin. In each of these, however, there are several subordinate groups, which may be distinguished as the Appalachian, the Brazilian, the Patagonian, and the Fuegian. The Appalachian branch includes all the nations of North America, except the Mexicans, together with the tribes of South America north of the river Amazon and east of the Andes. In this race the head is rounded, the nose large, salient, and aquiline; the eyes dark brown, with little or no obliquity of position; the mouth large and straight; the teeth nearly vertical; and the whole face triangular. The neck is long, the chest broad but rarely deep, the body and limbs muscular, and seldom disposed to fatness. In character these nations are warlike, cruel, and unforgiving; they turn with aversion from the restraints of civilised life, and have made but little progress in mental culture or the useful arts. The Brazilian branch is spread over a great part of South America, east of the Andes, including the whole of Brazil and Paraguay, between the River Amazon and 35° S. latitude. Their physical characteristics differ but little from those of the Appalachian branch; they possess, perhaps, a larger and more expanded nose, with larger mouths and lips. The eyes are small, more or less oblique, and far asunder; the neck short and thick; the body and limbs stout and full, even to clumsiness. In character, also, they differ little. None of the Americans are less susceptible of cultivation; and what they are taught by compulsion seldom exceeds the humblest elements of knowledge. The Patagonian branch includes the nations to the south of the Plato, as far as the Strait of Magalhaens, including also the mountain tribes of Chili. They are chiefly distinguished by their tall stature, handsome forms, and indomitable courage. The Fuegians, who call themselves Yacannacunnee, rove over the sterile wastes of Tierra del Fuego, which is computed to be half the size of Ireland, and yet their whole number has been computed as not exceeding 2000. The physical aspect of the Fuegians is altogether repulsive. They are of low stature, with large heads, broad faces, and small eyes. Their chests are large, their bodies clumsy, with large knees, and ill-shaped legs. Their hair is lank, black, and coarse, and their complexion a decided brown, like that of the more northern tribes. Their expression of face is vacant, and their mental operations are to the last degree slow and stupid; they are almost destitute of the usual curiosity of savages, caring little for anything that does not minister to their present wants.
[9:1:687]

The American race is distinguished by the form of the skull, which, except in its greater length, resembles the Mongol type. The cheek-bones are prominent, but not so angular, as in the Mongol head; the occiput is rather flat, the cavity for lodging the cerebellum small, the orbits large and deep. The nose is generally aquiline, but in some tribes flat, and the nasal cavities are large. Compared with the head of the Negro, that of the American is broader, and the teeth are less prominent: when placed by the side of the Caucasian head, it is seen to be smaller in size, less rounded and symmetrical, and less developed in the part before the ear. The skull is generally thin and light. There are, however, many deviations from this typical form. The Carib skull and the Araucanian are large; the Peruvian small, and singularly flattened behind, so as to present a short line from the forehead to the occiput.

The colour of the Americans, though it includes a considerable diversity of shade, is more uniform than that of the inhabitants of Asia or Africa; and, what is more remarkable, its varieties do not bear any visible relation to the temperature of the climate. A brownish yellow, or copper colour, as it has been called, pervades nearly all the numerous tribes from the Arctic Ocean to Cape Horn, but still with many different degrees of intensity. The eastern nations of Chili have but a slight tinge of the brown colour, and the Boroanes are still whiter. On the north-west coast, from latitude 43° to 60°, there are tribes who, though embrowned with soot and mud, were found, when their skins were washed, to have the brilliant white and red which is the characteristic of the Caucasian race. But within the tropics, the Malapoques in Brazil, the Guaranis in Paraguay, the Guiacas of Guiana, the Scheries of La Plata, have tolerably fair complexions, sometimes united with blue eyes and auburn hair; and, in the hot country watered by the Orinoco, Humboldt found tribes of a dark, and others of a light hue, living almost in juxtaposition. It is remarkable, too, that the nations whose colour approaches nearest to black are found in the temperate zone, namely, the Charruas of the Banda Oriental, in latitude 33° S., and the Cochimies, Pericus, and Guay-curus, spread over the peninsula of California. These people have skins of a very deep hue, but are not absolutely black; and they have neither the woolly hair of the Negroes, nor their social and good-humoured disposition. The Charruas, especially, are distinguished by a high degree of that austerity and stern fortitude which are common to the American nations. The Caribs and some Brazilian tribes have the yellowish hue of the Chinese, and the same cast of features. Among the nations dwelling on the west side of the Alleghanies, and near the northern lakes, there is also a considerable variety of complexion; but the brown or copper shade is found more or less in them all. It may be said, then, of the American nations, that, with the exception of two or three tribes on the north-west coast, who probably arrived from Asia at a later period than the others, the two extremes of complexion, the white of Northern Europe and the black of Ethiopia, are unknown amongst them; and that, when compared with the Moors, Abyssinians, and other swarthy nations of the Old World, their colour inclines less to the yellow, and more to the reddish brown.

Long, black, lank hair is common to all the American tribes, among which no traces of the frizzled locks of the Polynesian, or the woolly texture of the African Negro have ever been observed. The beard is very deficient, and the little that nature gives them they assiduously root out. A copper-coloured skin has been also assumed by most writers as a characteristic distinction of the Americans; but their real colour is in general brown, of the hue most nearly resembling that of cinnamon; and Dr Morton coincides in opinion with Dr M'Culloch, that no epithet derivable from the colour of the skin so correctly designates the Americans as that of the brown race. There are, however, among them occasional and very remarkable deviations, including all the varieties of tint from a decided white to an unequivocally black skin. That climate has a very subordinate influence in producing these different hues must be inferred from the fact that the tribes which wander in the equinoctial regions are not darker than the mountaineers of the temperate zone. The Puelches, and other tribes of the Magellanic regions, beyond 55° S. latitude, are darker than the Abipones, Mocobies, and Tobas, who are many degrees nearer the equator; and the Botocudos are of a clear brown colour, sometimes approaching nearly to white, at no great distance from the tropic; while the Guiacas under the line are characterised by a fair complexion; the Charruas, who are almost black, live at the 30th degree of S. latitude; and the still blacker Californians are 25° north of the equator. Everywhere, indeed, it is found that the colour of the American depends very little on the local situation which he actually occupies; and never, in the same individual, are those parts of the body which are constantly covered of a fairer colour than those which are exposed to a hot and moist atmosphere. Children are never white when they are bom, as is the case among even the darkest of the Caucasian races; and the Indian caciques, who enjoy a considerable degree of luxury, and keep themselves constantly dressed, have all parts of their body, except the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet, of the same brownish-red or copper colour. These differences of complexion are, however, extremely partial, forming mere exceptions to the general tint which characterises all the Americans, from Cape Horn to Canada. The cause of such anomalies is not easily ascertained; that it is not climate is sufficiently obvious; but whether or not it arises from partial immigrations from other countries remains yet to be decided.

The Americans of indigenous races might also be divided into three great classes distinguished by the pursuits on which they depend for subsistence, namely, hunt ing, fishing, and agriculture. The greater number of them are devoted to hunting; the fishing tribes are not numerous, and are wholly destitute of the spirit of maritime adventure, and even of fondness for the sea. A few tribes were strictly agricultural before the arrival of Europeans, but a much greater number have become so since. Many tribes regularly resort to all these modes of subsistence, according to the seasons; employing the spring in fishing, the summer in agriculture, and the autumn and winter in hunting.

The intellectual faculties of this great family appear to be decidedly inferior, when compared with those of the Caucasian or Mongolian race. The Americans are not only averse to the restraints of education, but are for the most part incapable of a continued process of reasoning on abstract subjects. Their minds seize with avidity on simple truths, but reject whatever requires investigation and analysis. Their proximity for more than two centuries to European institutions has made scarcely any perceptible change in their mode of thinking or their manner of life; and, as to their own social condition, they are probably in most respects exactly as they were at the earliest period of their national existence. They have made few or no improvements in constructing their houses or their boats; their inventive and imitative faculties appear to be of very humble capacity, nor have they the smallest taste for the arts and sciences. One of the most remarkable of their intellectual defects is the great difficulty they find in comprehending the relations of numbers; and Mr Schoolcraft, the United States Indian agent, assured Dr Morton that this deficiency was one cause of most of the misunderstanding in respect to treaties entered into between the United States Government and the [9:1:688] native tribes. The natives sell their land for a sum of money, without having any conception of the amount; and it is only when the proceeds come to be divided that each man becomes acquainted with his own interest in the transaction. Then disappointment and murmurs invariably ensue.

Every unwritten tongue is subject to continual fluctuations, which will be numerous and rapid in proportion as the tribe using it is exposed to frequent vicissitudes of fortune, and the individuals composing it have little intercourse with one another. When the population of one of these societies increases, it splits into several branches; and if these have little intercourse, the original language divides by degrees into as many dialects. These smaller societies subdivide in their turn with the same effects; and, in such continual subdivisions, the dialects of the extreme branches deviate farther and farther from one another, and from the parent tongue, till time, aided by migrations and wars, producing mixtures of different hordes, obliterates all distinct traces of a common origin. The cause of these changes becomes more obvious when we reflect on the principles which give stability to a language. These are—1. The abundant use of writing; 2. The teaching of a language as a branch of education; 3. Frequency of intercourse among all the people speaking it; 4. The existence of an order of men, such as priests or lawyers, who employ it for professional purposes; 5. Stability of condition in the people, or exemption from vicissitudes and revolutions; 6. A large stock of popular poetry, which, if universally diffused, may almost become a substitute for writing. All these conditions were wanting (with some trifling exceptions) in the whole of the wandering tribes of America. The great multiplication of languages, therefore, proves two things—first, that the people are in a low state of savage life; and, secondly, that they have been for many ages in this condition; for time is a necessary element in the process of splitting human speech into so many varieties.

Among the seven or eight millions of American aborigines, it is estimated that there are as many languages spoken as among the seven or eight hundred million inhabitants of the Old World. Just as there is a marked physiological resemblance attaching to all the New World tribes, so judged by the evidence of language, the native American is sui generis, having no connection, except the most remote, with the rest of the human family. The few corresponding words in Old and New World languages, which are not of an imitative character, bear the stamp of fortuitous coincidence rather than that of common origin. Vater, in his Linguarum, Totius Orbis Index, estimated the number of American aboriginal languages at about 500, and Balbi at 423, of which 211 belonged to North, 44 to Central, and 158 to South America. In the absence of certain data, it may be safe to set down the number of native American languages at about 450.

Throughout the whole of these runs a thread of connection. They are all characterised by polysynthesis, as Duponceau calls it, or holophrasm,, to adopt the phraseology of Dr Lieber. Holophrasm is a process more or less common to every language at a particular stage of its development. We have glimpses of it in most of the Turanian group of languages, and it appears, in a faint degree, in the Basque; but it belongs to a very large proportion of the languages of America, so extremely numerous, and many of which have nothing else in common. This diffusion of a peculiar and common character over materials so dissimilar has been plausibly accounted for by the supposition of a community of origin in the tribes, whether few or many, which peopled the continent. As no person has the full command of all the vocables in his native language, individual terms must be continually dropping out of dialects preserved by oral communication; and new ones will be introduced as new wants and new objects solicit attention. But during the gradual change which thus takes place, the new words will be combined and modified according to the rules which belong to the genius of the spoken dialect with which they are incorporated; and thus it may happen that the grammatical forms of an ancient language may live, while its materials perish. The changes of structure which present themselves in the history of European languages, it must be remembered, took place in progressive communities. Among nations like the American Indians, whose barbarism, we may suppose, remained almost stationary, the forms of speech might be more permanent, though its substance was in a state of slow but constant mutation. But even were this community of origin admitted, it cannot be looked on as entire and absolute among the American nations.

Analysis and generalisation are processes that distinguish the languages of reflective and civilised races. “Nothing,” says Schoolcraft, “could apparently be further removed from the analytical class of languages than the various dialects spoken by the Indians of America, who invariably express their ideas of objects and actions precisely as they are presented to their eyes and ears, i.e., in all their compound associations.” To “encapsulate” words, as Dr Lieber expresses it, “is the striking feature of all these languages, and hence a word will consist sometimes of seven or eight syllables, each one conveying one individual idea, like a set of boxes each one contained in the other.” This common feature of American languages is both psychologically and philologically of the greatest interest. Of all the groups of American languages, the various dialects of the Algonquin stock furnish the most inviting field for the philologist. It is from the Algonquin, therefore, that we draw the follow ing examples of the process of syllabical agglutination :—

Thus, waub is the root of the verb to see, and of the word light. Waubun is the east or sunlight, and inferentially place of light. Aub is the eye-ball; hence, aiaub = to see, to eye. Waub itself appears to be a compound of aub and the letter u<, which is the sign of the third person. Waubuno is a member of a society of men who continue their orgies till daylight. The simplest concrete forms of the verb to see are as follow :—

Ne waub = I see.

Ke waub = Thou seest.

O waub = He or she sees.

But all this is vague to the Indian mind until the verb is made transitive, and the class of objects acted on is thereby shown. The Indian order of thought, moreover, requires that the object should generally precede the verb, e.g — Inine ne wau bum au = man, I see him. Wah kie-gun ne ne wau bun daun = house, I see it.

Such examples show the tendency of these languages to accretion. The verb is made to include within itself, as it were, the noun, pronoun, and adjective. “Declension, cases, articles, are deficient,” says Bancroft, “but everything is conjugated. The adjective assumes a verbal termination, and is conjugated as a verb; the idea expressed by a noun is clothed in verbal forms, and at once does the office of a verb. .... Then, since the Indian verb includes within itself the agent and the object, it may pass through as many transitions as the persons and numbers of the pronouns will admit of different combinations; and each of these combinations may be used positively or negatively, with a reflex or a causative signification. In this manner changes are so multiplied, that the number of possible forms of a Chippewa [9:1:689] verb is said to amount to five or six thousand; in other words, the number of possible variations is indefinite.” The formidable array of syllables arises partly from the fact, that there are some sixteen modes of forming the plural of nouns represented in the verb by sixteen corresponding modifications. Nouns are divided, as in the Dravidian languages of South India, into animate and inanimate.

The best account of those peculiarities, as well as the best general distribution of the American languages, are given by Professor Whitney of Yale College, in his work on Language and the Study of Language, pp. 346-351 :—

“The conditions of the linguistic problem presented by the American languages are exceedingly perplexing, for the same reason as those presented by the Polynesian and African dialects, and in a yet higher degree. The number, variety, and changeableness of the different tongues is wonderful. Dialectic division is carried to its extreme among them; the isolating and diversifying tendencies have had full course, with little counteraction from the conserving and assimilating forces. The continent seems ever to have been peopled by a congeries of petty tribes, incessantly at warfare, or standing off from one another in jealous and suspicious seclusion. Certain striking exceptions, it is true, are present to the mind of every one. Mexico, Central America, and Peru, at the time of the Spanish discovery and conquest, were the seat of empires possessing an organised system of government, with national creeds and institutions, with modes of writing and styles of architecture, and other appliances of a considerably developed culture, of indigenous origin. Such relics, too, as the great mounds which are scattered so widely through our western country, and the ancient workings upon the veins and ledges of native copper along the southern shore of Lake Superior, show that other large portions of the northern continent had not always been in the same savage condition as that in which our ancestors found them. Yet these were exceptions only, not changing the general rule; and there is reason to believe that, as the civilisation of the Mississippi valley had been extinguished by the incursion and conquest of more barbarous tribes, so a similar fate was threatening that of the southern peoples: that, in fact, American culture was on its way to destruction even without European interference, as European culture for a time had seemed to be during the Dark Ages which attended the downfall of the Roman empire. If the differentiation of American language had been thus unchecked by the influence of culture, it has been also favoured by the influence of the variety of climate and mode of life. While the other great families occupy, for the most part, one region or one zone, the American tribes have been exposed to all the difference of circumstances which can find place between the Arctic and the Antarctic oceans, amid ice-fields, mountains, valleys, on dry tablelands, and in reeking river-basins, along shores of every clime. Moreover, these languages have shown themselves to possess a peculiar mobility and changeableness of material. There are groups of kindred tribes whose separation is known to be of not very long standing, but in whose speech the correspondences are almost overwhelmed and hidden from sight by the discordances which have sprung up. In more than one tongue it has been remarked that books of instruction prepared by missionaries have become antiquated and almost unintelligible in three or four generations. Add to all this, that our knowledge of the family begins in the most recent period, less than four hundred years ago; that, though it has been since penetrated and pressed on every side by cultivated nations, the efforts made to collect and preserve information respecting it have been only spasmodic and fragmentary; that it is almost wholly destitute of literature, and even of traditions of any authority and value; and that great numbers of its constituent members have perished, in the wasting away of the tribes by mutual warfare, by pestilence and famine, and by the encroachments of more powerful races—and it will be clearly seen that the comprehensive comparative study of American languages is beset with very great difficulties.

“Yet it is the confident opinion of linguistic scholars that a fundamental unity lies at the base of all these infinitely varying forms of speech; that they may be, and probably are, all descended from a single parent language. For, whatever their differences of material, there is a single type or plan upon which their forms are developed and their constructions made, from the Arctic Ocean to Cape Horn, and one sufficiently peculiar and distinctive to constitute a genuine indication of relationship. This type is called the incorporativc or polysynthetic. It tends to the excessive and abnormal agglomeration of distinct significant elements in its words; whereby, on the one hand, cumbrous compounds are formed as the names of objects, and a character of tedious and time-wasting poly-syllabism is given to the language—see, for example, the three to ten-syllabled numeral and pronominal words of our western Indian tongues; or the Mexican name for ‘goat,’ kwa-kwauh tentsone, literally ‘ head-tree (horn)-lip-hair (beard),’ or ‘the horned and bearded one’—and, on the other hand, and what is of yet more importance, an unwieldy aggregation, verbal or quasi- verbal , is substituted for the phrase or sentence, with its distinct and balanced members. Thus, the Mexican says, ‘ I-flesh-eat,' as a single word, compounded of three elements; or if, for emphasis, the object is left to stand separate, it is at least first represented by a pronoun in the verbal compound; as, ‘ I-it-eat, the flesh ;’ or, ‘ I-it-him-gives the bread, my son/ for ‘ I give my son the bread.’

‘ ‘ The incorporative type is not wholly peculiar to the languages of our continent. A trace of it (in the insertion, among the verbal forms, of an objective as well as a subjective pronominal ending) is found even in one of the Ugrian dialects of the Scythian family, the Hungarian; and the Basque, of which we shall presently speak more particularly, exhibits it in a very notable measure. It is found, too, in considerably varying degree and style of development in the different branches of the American family. But its general effect is still such that the linguist is able to claim that the languages to which it belongs are, in virtue of their structure, akin with one another, and distinguished from all other known tongues.

“Not only do the subjective and objective pronouns thus enter into the substance of the verb, but also a great variety of modifiers of the verbal action, adverbs, in the form of particles and fragments of words; thus, almost everything which helps to make expression forms a part of verbal conjugation, and the verbal paradigm becomes well-nigh interminable. An extreme instance of excessive synthesis is afforded in the Cherokee word-phrase wi-ni-taw-ti-ge-gina-li-skaw-lung-ta-naw-ne-li-ti-se-sti, ‘ they will by that time have nearly finished granting [favours] from a distance to thee and me.’

“Other common traits, which help to strengthen our conclusion that these languages are ultimately related, are not wanting. Such are, for example, the habit of combining words by fragments, by one or two representative syllables; the direct conversion of nouns, substantive and adjective, into verbs, and their conjugation as such; peculiarities of generic distinction—many languages dividing animate from inanimate beings (somewhat as we do by the use of who and what), with arbitrary and fanciful details of classification, like those exhibited by the Indo-European languages in their separation of masculine and feminine; the possession of a very peculiar scheme for denoting the degrees of family relationship; and so on.

“As regards their material constitution, their assignment of certain sounds to represent certain ideas, our Indian dialects show, as already remarked, a very great discordance. It has been claimed that there are not less than a hundred languages or groups upon the continent, between whose words are discoverable no correspondences which might not be sufficiently explained as the result of accident. Doubtless a more thorough and sharpsighted investigation, a more penetrating linguistic analysis and comparison—though, under existing circumstances, any even distant approximation to the actual beginning may be hopeless—would considerably reduce this number; yet there might still remain as many unconnected groups as are to be found in all Europe and Asia. It is needless to undertake here an enumeration of the divisions of Indian speech: we will but notice a few of the most important groups occupying our own portion of the continent.

“In the extreme north, along the whole shore of the Arctic Ocean, are the Eskimo dialects, with which is nearly allied the Greenlandish. Below them is spread out, on the west, the great Athapaskan group. On the east, and as far south as the line of Tennessee and North Carolina, stretches the immense region occupied by the numerous dialects of the Algonquin or Delaware stock; within it, however, is enclosed the distinct branch of Iroquois languages. Our southeastern states were in possession of the Florida group, comprising the Creek, Choctaw, and Cherokee. The great nation of the Sioux or Dakotas gives its name to the branch which occupied the Missouri valley and parts of the lower Mississippi. Another widespread sub-family, including the Shoshonee and Comanche, ranged from the shores of Texas north-westward to the borders of California and the territory of the Athapaskas; and the Pacific coast was occupied by a medley of tribes. Mexico and Central America, finally, were the home of a great variety of tongues, that of the cultivated Aztecs, with its kindred, having the widest range.”

For further information regarding the aboriginal languages of America, the reader is referred to the researches of Balbi, Gallatin, Vater, and Schoolcraft; to Lewis H. Morgan’s Tables, with accompanying text and forms, vol. xvii. of the Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge (1871), entitled “Systems of Consanguinity and Affinity of the Human Family,” and to an invaluable work, The Literature of American Aboriginal Languages, by Dr Ludewig, edited by Nicolas Trübner, 1858.

Though any attempt to reduce the American population under a few general classes, either on physical or [9:1:690] ethnographical grounds, would be idle, we may notice one or two of the most remarkable nations or families.

All the northern coast of the continent is tenanted by the Esquimaux, a dwarfish race, rarely exceeding five feet in height. Their territories commence near Mackenzie’s River, in 68° N. lat., and extend to the Arctic Ocean. They occupy all the northern Archipelago, the shores of Hudson’s and Baffin’s Bays, of Labrador, and of Russian America round by Behring’s Straits, to the peninsula of Alaska. They live entirely by fishing, the whale and the seal being their most common food; they inhabit skin tents during their short summer, and in winter caves or houses built with snow in the shape of domes, within which a single rude lamp is kept perpetually burning. They are crafty and dirty, but appeared to Captain Franklin more intelligent and provident than the northern Indians. There is a wide diversity in their dialects, which still display decided marks of identity in their roots.

The north-west coast of Alaska, from Cook’s Inlet to the 48th parallel, is inhabited by four tribes, of whom the Kaluschi are the most remarkable. These people are distinguished from all the native races of America by having as fair a complexion when their skins are washed as the inhabitants of Europe; and this distinction, accompanied sometimes with auburn hair, has been considered as indicating an origin different from that of the copper-coloured tribes who people all the rest of the continent.

The Indians of the east coast belong almost entirely to three stems; and, before the arrival of the English colonists, occupied both sides of the Alleghany Mountains, from the Gulf of Mexico to Canada and New Brunswick. 1. The Delaware or Algonquin Indians, comprehending the Ottogamies, Shawnees, Narragansets, Chippeways, Knisteneaux, Delawares, and other nations, to the number of thirty or forty, were spread over the space between the Mississippi and the Atlantic, as far north as Hudson’s Bay, and all spoke dialects of one language. 2. The Iroquois, often called the “Five Nations,” and the “Six Nations,” but comprehending 15 tribes or more, among whom were the Mohawks, Oneidas, Hurons, and Senecas, all spoke dialects of one language. They lived on the south side of the great lakes, and finally obtained a complete ascendency over the Algonquin race. 3. The Florida Indians, including the Creeks, Seminoles, Choctaws, Chickasaws, Natches, and Mobiles. Tribes belonging to these three families (with the Wocons and Catawbas) occupied nearly all the region east of the Mississippi, from the Gulf of Mexico to Hudson’s Bay, comprising more than a million of square miles. The Catawbas alone, however, are said to have included 20 tribes, and nearly as many dialects. The Powhattans were a confederacy of 33 tribes, comprehending 10,000 persons. It is probable that when the English settlers landed in the country, the region mentioned was inhabited by a quarter of a million of Indians, divided into many tribes, and speaking dialects belonging to half a dozen radically distinct languages.

These nations have the virtues of savage life—a high sense of honour, according to their perceptions of duty, mutual fidelity among individuals, a fortitude that mocks at the most cruel torments, and a devotion to their tribe which makes self-immolation in its defence easy. On the other hand, they treat their wives cruelly, and their children with indifference. The apathy under the good and ill of life which the Stoic affected, is the grand element of the Indian’s character. Gloomy, stern, and severe, he is a stranger to mirth and laughter. All outward expression of pleasure or pain he regards as a weakness; and the only feeling to which he ever yields is the boisterous joy which he manifests in the moment of victory, or under the excitement of intoxication. He is capable of great exertions in war or the chase, but has an unconquerable aversion to regular labour. He is extremely improvident; eats enormously while he has abundance of food, without thinking of the famine which may follow; and, when liquors are supplied to him, will continue drunk for days.

Most of the Indians of North America believe in the existence of a supreme being, whom they call the Great Spirit; and of a subordinate one, whose nature is evil and hostile to man. To the latter their worship is principally addressed; the Good Spirit, in their opinion, needing no prayers to induce him to aid and protect his creatures. They generally believe in a future state, in which the souls of brave warriors and chaste wives enjoy a tranquil and happy existence with their ancestors and friends, spending their time in those exercises in which they delighted when on the earth. The Dakotas believe that the road to these “villages of the dead” leads over a rock with an edge as sharp as a knife, on which only the good are able to keep their footing. The wicked fall off, and descend to the region of the Evil Spirit, where they are hard worked, and often flogged by their relentless master.

Polygamy is allowed; and a number of wives is considered as adding to a man’s consequence. Marriage customs differ in different tribes, but in every case the presenting of gifts to the father of the intended wife is an essential feature of the transaction, and shows that the wife is considered as procured by purchase. Deformed children, and lame or decrepit old persons, are destroyed sometimes; but the practice is uncommon. Incest and unnatural vices are practised in some tribes, but they are always viewed as matters of reproach. The Indian funerals are conducted with much decorum. The deceased is dressed in his best clothes, and laid in a grave, in a vertical, horizontal, or inclined position, according to his own previous directions, with his moccasins, knife, money, and silver ornaments beside him, and a small quantity of food near his head. It is usual to mark the graves with a post, on which figures are carved expressive of the nature of the pursuits and achievements of the deceased.

Some nations of Indians wear little or no clothing; but the general dress of the men in the temperate and cold parts of the country, previous to the arrival of the Europeans, consisted of three articles: a cloak of buffalo-skin hanging from the shoulders, a piece of skin used as an apron, and a pair of moccasins or loose boots, made of undressed skin also. The women wore a long robe of the same material, which was fastened round the waist; but among the tribes living near the whites, coarse woollens are now frequently substituted for the hides of wild animals, except for the moccasins. The habitations of the Indians are huts or cabins, generally of a circular form and small size, but sometimes of 30 or 40 feet in diameter, formed by stakes fixed in the ground, and covered with the bark of trees. Sometimes the spaces between the stakes are filled up with twigs, grass, and mud, and the roof is covered nearly in the same way. A hole in the top serves for the escape of the smoke, and the skins of wild beasts form the beds and seats. When they go to a distance to hunt, they erect for temporary use large tents, which are covered with skins. On the west side of the Mississippi, where the ground is open, many of the tribes make use of horses, which are seldom employed amidst the woods covering the territories east of that river. The custom of painting their bodies is nearly universal. They introduce the colours by making punctures on their skin; and the extent of surface which this ornament covers is proportioned to the exploits they have performed. Some paint only their arms, others both their arms and legs, others again their thighs; while those who have attained the summit of warlike [9:1:691] renown have their bodies painted from the waist upwards. This is the heraldry of the Indians, the devices of which are probably more exactly adjusted to the merits of the persons who bear them than those of more civilised countries. Besides these ornaments, the warriors also carry plumes of feathers on their heads, their arms, or ancles. Their arms were the tomahawk, the war-club, knife, the bow and arrow, but now they have muskets.

Each tribe is governed by a chief and council, who are elective; but in matters of importance the whole warriors are consulted; and Mr Keating informs us that questions are not decided by the votes of a majority, but the resolution adopted must have the consent of every individual warrior. Their assemblies are conducted with much formality and decorum. The eldest chief commences the debate, which is often carried on by set speeches, abounding in bold figures and metaphors, and bursts of a rude but impassioned eloquence. The young are permitted to be present and to express their approbation by cries, but not to speak. In their wars the object commonly is, to secure the right of hunting within particular limits, to maintain the liberty of passing through their accustomed tracts, and to guard from infringement those lands which they consider as their own tenure. War is declared by sending a slave with a hatchet, the handle of which is painted red, to the nation they intend to break with. They generally take the field in small numbers. Each warrior, besides his weapons, carries a mat, and supports himself till he is near the enemy by killing game. From the time they enter the enemy's country, no game is killed, no fires lighted, or shouting heard, and their vigilance and caution are extreme. They are not even permitted to speak, but must communicate by signs and motions. Having discovered the objects of their hostility, they first reconnoitre them, then hold a council; and they generally make their attack just before daybreak, that they may surprise their enemies while asleep. They will lie the whole night flat on their faces without stirring, and, at the fit moment for action, will creep on their hands and feet till they have got within a bow-shot of those they have doomed to destruction. On a signal given by the chief warrior, which is answered by the yells of the whole party, they start up, and, after discharging their arrows, they rush upon their adversaries, without giving them time to recover from their confusion, with their war-clubs and tomahawks. If they succeed, the scene of horror which follows baffles description. The savage fury of the conquerors, the desperation of the conquered, the horrid yells of both, and their grim figures besmeared with paint and blood, form an assemblage of objects worthy of pandemonium. When the victory is secured, they select a certain number of their prisoners to carry home: they kill the rest in cold blood, take their scalps, and then march off with the spoil. The prisoners destined to death are soon led to the place of execution, where they are stripped, have their bodies blackened, and are bound to a stake. In this situation, while the burning faggots embrace his limbs, and the knives of his revengeful enemies are inflicting a thousand tortures, it is common for the warrior to recount his exploits, boast of the cruelties he has committed upon his enemies, and to irritate and insult his tormenters in every way. Sometimes it happens that this has the effect of provoking one of the spectators to dispatch him with a club or tomahawk. Sometimes the male adult prisoners are given as slaves to women who have lost their husbands in the war, and by whom they are often married. The women taken are distributed among the warriors; the boys and girls are considered as slaves.

Nearly all the Indian tribes raise maize, beans, and pumpkins, by the labour of their women, but only to a small extent, and as a resource against famine, their chief reliance being upon the chase. The buffaloes which wander over the prairies of the west, in herds of tens of thousands, are their great support; but deer, bears, and in time of need otters, beavers, foxes, squirrels, and even reptiles, are devoured.

The Toltecan family embraced the civilised nations of Mexico, Peru, and Bogota, extending from the Rio Gila in 33° N. latitude along the western shore of the continent to the frontiers of Chili; and on the eastern coast, along the Gulf of Mexico, in North America. In South America, on the contrary, this family chiefly occupied a narrow strip of land between the Andes and the Pacific Ocean, bounded on the south by the great desert of Atacama. Farther north, however, in New Granada, were the Bogotese, a people whose civilisation, like their geographical position, was intermediate between that of the Peruvians and the Mexicans. But, even before the Spanish conquest, the Toltecan family were not the exclusive possessors of the regions which we have assigned to them; they were only the dominant race or caste, while other tribes of the American race always constituted a large mass of the population. The arrival of the Spaniards reduced both classes alike to vassalage; and three centuries of slavery and oppression have left few traces of Mexican and Peruvian civilisation, except what may be gleaned from their history and antiquities. These nations can no longer be identified in existing communities; and the mixed and motley races which now respectively bear the name, are as unlike their predecessors in moral and intellectual character, as the degraded Copts are unlike the ancient Egyptians. It is in the intellectual faculties that the great difference between the Toltecan and the American families consists. In the arts and sciences of the former we see the evidences of an advanced civilisation; their architectural remains everywhere surprise the traveller and confound the antiquary. Among these are pyramids, temples, grottoes, bas-reliefs, and arabesques; while their roads, aqueducts, and fortifications, and the traces of their mining operations, sufficiently attest their attainments in the practical arts of life.

The origin of the populations of America is a problem which has yet to be solved. It is known that in Europe man was in existence at a very remote period; and there are facts which lend some support to the view that man has also been a denizen of America for ages. Thus there have been found portions of the human skeleton and fragments of human handiwork, associated with the bones of mammals which now have no existence, under circumstances which imply great antiquity. In most instances, however, it is not certain that such relics are of the age of the deposit in which they have been found. Human skeletons and bones in a fossilised state, or associated with bones of extinct mammals, have been found at Guadaloupe, in Missouri, near Natchez, at New Orleans, in the coral reef of Florida, near Charleston, in California, in Orchilla, at Petit Anse, and in Kansas. Some of these are referred to a very distant period. Thus the conglomerate in which the remains occur in the Florida reef is estimated by Agassiz to be 10,000 years old; but, what is still more amazing, the skeleton found by Dr Dowler beneath four buried . forests in the delta near New Orleans, is said to be 50,000 years old, and the remains from California were found in a deposit beneath Table Mountain, which deposit was formed in an old river of the Post-Pliocene, or Pliocene period. At any rate, when this deposit was formed there was a river valley here, down which an overflow of volcanic matter was poured. Since that time denudation has been so great, and the volcanic matter so hard, that the sides of the valley have been swept away, leaving the valley bottom with its protecting[9:1:692] cover standing up far above the level of the neighbouring country. Articles made by man also occur under conditions indicating great antiquity. Thus along the coast of Ecuador there are volcanic deposits which belong to the period of volcanic activity preceding the present, which may probably be referred to the Post-Pliocene period. This matter is arranged in terraces, and in one of these terraces, now 24 miles from the coast and 150 feet above the sea, Mr Wilson has found beneath the vegetable mould, beds of clay with sand and gravel which contain fragments of pottery. These beds, it is believed, were deposited beneath the sea, implying an elevation of 150 feet since their formation. On the coast there is a pottery-containing stratum, which has been followed for 80 miles, and patches of a similar bed occur over a further distance of 200 miles. These facts, taken in conjunction with what we learn from the traditions and histories of numerous nations, as also the characters of the present natives, render it highly probable that man existed in America long before the origin or arrival of the civilised communities to which allusion will be presently made. The histories of these communities generally agree that civilisation was introduced by persons who first appeared as strangers amidst the people already in possession of the country. Hence the question has a twofold aspect, viz., the origin of the earliest uncivilised as well as that of the earliest civilised tribes. It is possible, as the traditions suggest, that people have arrived from various quarters and at various times. As yet we have little positive evidence to rely upon, and caution is required in drawing conclusions from resemblances in customs or religion. For instance, to take one remarkable case. Amongst tribes living high up the Amazon basin there are customs which correspond with those in Borneo. In both areas we find blow-pipes for discharging arrows; large houses inhabited by several families and similarly constructed; baskets and bamboo boxes of almost identical form and construction; and the smoke-dried heads of enemies hung up in the houses. In one tribe on the Amazon the throwing-stick is used, and not the blow-pipe, which is employed by all the surrounding tribes; the throwing-stick is also used by the Esquimaux, the Andaman Islanders, and the Australians. On the Amazon an arrow or spear is used for catching turtle, which has the barb loosely attached to the shaft, so that when the turtle disappears the shaft floats on the surface and indicates its movements and position. The Australians catch turtle in precisely the same way. Again, many other customs are common to the Americans and tribes living in areas far remote from them, with which they have no apparent direct relationship. If these analogies were always proofs of affinities, then we might infer, as has been done, that America was first peopled by emigrants from the opposite shores of Africa, W. Europe, E. Asia, and Polynesia.

In the great valley of the Mississippi and its mighty tributaries, the Ohio and Missouri, are the remains of the works of an extinct race of men, who seem to have made advances in civilisation far beyond the races of red men discovered there by the first European adventurers. These remains consist chiefly of tumuli and ramparts of earth, enclosing areas of great extent and much regularity of form. Some of them recall the barrows of Europe and of Asia, or the huge mounds and ramparts of Mesopotamia, as displayed at Babylon and Nineveh; while others remind us of the ruined hippodromes and amphitheatres of the Greeks and Romans. In that part of North America the barrows are usually truncated cones; but in advancing farther south, they often assume the figure of four-sided pyramids in successive stages, with flattened tops, like the Teocallis, or temples of Mexico and Yucatan. They have been accurately described, and many of them delineated in the Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge, from the researches of Messrs Squier and Davis.

The barrows and ramparts are constructed of mingled earth and stones; and from their solidity and extent, must have required the labour of a numerous population, with leisure and skill sufficient to undertake combined and vast operations. The barrows often contain human bones, and the smaller tumuli appear to have been tombs; but the larger, especially the quadrangular mounds, would seem to have served as temples to the early inhabitants. These barrows vary in size, from a few feet in circumference and elevation, to structures with a basal circumference of 1000 or 2000 feet, and an altitude of from 60 to 90 feet, resembling, in dimensions, the vast tumulus of Alyattes near Sardis. One in Mississippi is said to cover a base of six acres. The ramparts also vary in thickness, and in height from 6 to 30 feet, and usually enclose areas varying from 100 to 200 acres. Some contain 400; and one on the Missouri has an area of 600 acres. The enclosures generally are very exact circles or squares, sometimes a union of both; occasionally they form parallelograms, or follow the sinuosities of a hill; and in one district, that of Wisconsin, they assume the fanciful shape of men, quadrupeds, birds, or serpents, delineated with some ingenuity, on the surface of undulating plains or wide savannahs.

These ramparts are usually placed on elevations or hills, or on the banks of streams, so as to show that they were erected for defensive purposes, and their sites are judiciously chosen for this end. The area enclosed, therefore, bears no proportion to the relative labour bestowed on such ramparts: thus, in Ohio, an area of not more than 40 acres is enclosed by mounds of a mile and a half in circumference; and on the Little Miami, in the same state, is found an enclosure fully four miles round, that contains an area of about 100 acres. These remains are not solitary and few, for in the state of Ohio they amount to at least 10,000.

The enclosures in the form of animals are more rare than those now noticed, and seem nearly confined to Wisconsin. One of these represents a gigantic man with two heads, the size of which may be estimated, by the body being 50 feet long, and 25 feet across the breast. Another on a slope near Bush Creek, represents a tolerably designed snake, with an oval ball in its mouth; the undulating folds of its body and spiral of its tail extending to a length of 700 feet. The forms of quadrupeds and birds are also characteristically represented in these works. Those that have been explored contain human bones; but, though the Indians deposit their dead within them occasionally, they have no tradition of their having belonged to their ancestors. The most probable supposition respecting them is that of Mr R. C. Taylor, that each was the sepulchral monument of a different tribe, who have all disappeared from America.

The question immediately suggests itself, to what people must we ascribe those vast works? They can scarcely be the works of the ancestors of the red men discovered by Europeans in North America. Neither can we ascribe them to the early Greenland and Iceland colonists, who seem never to have passed westward of the Alleghanies. We can scarcely attribute them to the somewhat apocryphal advent of the Welsh Madoc. Can their authors be the people obscurely mentioned in the Icelandic sagas, as the inhabitants of New Iceland?

A curious tradition of the present Iroquois records, that when the Lenni Lenapi, the common ancestors of the Iroquois and other tribes, whose language is still widely spread among the Indians, advanced from the north-west to the Mississippi, they found on its eastern side a great nation more civilised than themselves, who lived in fortified towns and cultivated the ground. This people at first granted the Lenni Lenapi leave to pass through their territories to seek [9:1:693] an eastward settlement, but treacherously attacked them while crossing the river. This conduct gave rise to inveterate hostilities, that terminated in the extermination or subjugation of their opponents, and the establishment of the red men in those regions. This not improbable, though imperfect, account of such rude communities, where neither letters nor hieroglyphics existed, is probably all that we shall ever learn of the people who executed those works that now excite our surprise.

As we advance southward we find proofs of still greater refinement on the table-land of Anahuac or Mexico; and on descending into the humid valleys of Central America, the peninsula of Yucatan, and the shores of Honduras, we find striking remains of the semi-civilisation of the races that inhabited those countries before the Spanish invasion. The barbarous policy of Cortez and other invaders was to eradicate every trace of the former grandeur of the native races, and thereby to inure them to a degrading servitude. The systematic destruction of the native works of art and gorgeous buildings in Mexico was relentlessly carried on for ages, to the infinite regret of the modern ethnographical inquirer. Little positive information on these subjects can be gleaned from the early Spanish historians of the conquest; and it was not until the publication of Humboldt’s Researches that Europe knew anything of the state of the Great Mexican pyramid, or of the wonderful remains of Palenque and Papantla.

In the middle of the last century, however, some Spanish adventurers penetrated with difficulty the dense forests of the Mexican province of Chiapas, in which they discovered the remains of an ancient city, of which all memory had been lost, and to which they gave the name of Palenque, from a poor adjacent village. Stimulated by their report, the Spanish Government some years afterwards despatched two intelligent travellers to explore those wilds; but the report of Del Rio and Du Paix, from the commotions that agitated Europe and convulsed Spain, remained unpublished until a few years ago. It has since appeared, with very interesting designs of the ruins they explored. Our knowledge of such remains, however, has been greatly enlarged by the labours of an enterprising North American traveller, Mr Stephens, given to the world in four volumes, entitled Incidents of Travel in Central America, Chiapas, and Yucatan, 1838, and Incidents of Travel in Yucatan, 1842. This gentleman discovered, in the almost impenetrable forests of those regions, the remains of no less than 44 towns, some of them with extensive and highly decorated structures. These exhibit walls of hewn stone, admirably put together with mortar, often enriched by sculptures in bold relief, and hieroglyphical inscriptions, exactly resembling the Aztec MSS. in the museums of Europe, and in the publications of Humboldt; well executed vaulted roofs, and obelisks covered with mythic figures and pictorial or hieroglyphical inscriptions. These curious remains have been concealed for ages by a luxuriant tropical vegetation, so dense that they seem to have been unknown to people living within half a mile of their site.

The most conspicuous ruins are those of temples and palaces, which almost invariably have a pyramidal form, in several stages, with wide intervening terraces, the ascent to which is by grand flights of steps. The chambers in those buildings have generally a length disproportioned to their width, they have no windows, but receive their light from the doors, just as the rooms do at this day in Barbary and some other eastern countries. The apartments are in two parallel rows, a narrow corridor or series of chambers runs along the front, and the apartments behind this receive their light only from the front rooms into which they open. Yet these interior apartments are often richly decorated with sculptures, ornamented with stuccos, and gaily painted red, yellow, white, and black.

The ruins of Palenque, as may be seen in the researches of Humboldt, have the characters just mentioned. They are covered with hieroglyphics, and sculptures in relief, with ornamental cornices. The largest building stands on a terrace, faced with stone, measuring 310 by 260 feet; the building itself is 200 by 180 feet; its walls are 25 feet high. The stone has been originally covered with painted stucco; fronts the east, and contains 14 doors, separated by piers ornamented with stucco figures. In this building some of the figures are erect, while others sit cross-legged, in what we term the oriental fashion; one statue, 10½ feet high, was found at Palenque; and two fragments of two torsos and a head were also discovered that exhibited a severe but fair style of sculpture, that recalls something of the early style of Greek art.

The ruins at Copan, in Honduras, are of vast extent. Here a pyramidal structure remains, with an elevation of 150 feet measured along its slope, and this appears to be a principal temple, included with several smaller structures within a sacred enclosure, in the manner of the temples of ancient Egypt. On its walls are many skulls of a quadru-manous animal, well executed in high relief; a large figure of a baboon was discovered among the ruins, bearing no inconsiderable resemblance to the cynocephalus of the Egyptians. Here also several sculptured obelisks occur, from 11 to 13 feet in height, and from 3 to 4 feet wide, which, as well as the walls of the temple, were highly ornamented with sculptures in bold relief.

The similarity between the ruins at Copan and Palenque, and the identity of the hieroglyphic tablets in both, show that the former inhabitants of Chiapas and Honduras had the same written language, though the present Indians of those provinces do not understand each other.

At several places, but more especially at Uxmal, in Yucatan, are very magnificent ruins of the same kind. Here are found sculptured obelisks, bearing on their principal face the figure, probably, of some deity, with a benignant countenance represented in full, and the hands applied to the breast. The other sides of the obelisks are covered with hieroglyphical tablets, proving that the same race once inhabited the plains of Honduras and the tableland of Anahuac. The principal building at Uxmal seems to have been a very magnificent pyramid in three stages or terraces, faced with hewn stone, and neatly rounded at the angles. The first terrace is 575 feet long, 15 feet broad, and 3 feet high, serving as a sort of plinth to the whole the second terrace is 545 feet long, 250 feet wide, and 20 feet high; the third terrace is 360 feet long, by 30 feet wide, and 19 feet in height. From the centre of the second terrace, the upper part is gained by a vast flight of well-constructed steps 130 feet wide. This leads to the temple, the façade of which is no less than 322 feet long, but has not had a greater elevation than 25 feet; yet its grandeur is enhanced by the rich sculpture that covers the upper part above a fillet, or cornice, that surrounds the whole building at about half its elevation. The interior consists of two parallel ranges of chambers, 11 in each row. The front apartments are entered by 11 doorways, enriched with sculpture, which gives sufficient light to those rooms; but the posterior row receives no light except what enters by their doors from the exterior rooms. The roofs here, unlike those of Palenque and Copan, are not stone arches, but are supported on bearers of a very hard wood, that must have been brought from a distance of some hundred miles, and these beams too are covered with hieroglyphics. The flat roof of this building has been externally covered with a hard cement. In a building placed on a lower level is a rectangular court, which has been once wholly paved with well-carved[9:1:694] figures of tortoises in demi-relief. These are arranged in groups of four, with their heads placed together; and from the dimensions of the court, this sala de las Tor-tugas must have required 43,660 of such carved stones for its pavement.

The ruins of Chichen, also in Yucatan, extend over an area of two miles in circumference. One of the best preserved buildings with an ambit of 638 feet, is constructed in three terraces, which gave it an apparent altitude of 65 feet. The buildings here, on the second terrace, have the façades highly sculptured, both above and below the horizontal fillet; and the doorways are enriched with mouldings, and truss -like ornaments supporting a drip-stone. The staircase here is 56 feet wide. The front apartments are 47 feet long and only 9 wide. There are three doors in the front, and in the central apartment are nine niches. The roofs are stone arches; and all has been once painted of various colours. A curious adjoining structure consists of two parallel stone walls, 274 feet long, and 30 feet apart. The walls are 30 feet thick. It has been conjectured to have been connected with the celebration of some public games, like the paloestrae of the Greeks.

In several of the ruins now noticed are found buildings to which there is no access. They have doorways, but these seem to have been walled up when the buildings were erected. Their use is unknown; they are named casas cerradas, or “shut up houses.” Their interior does not differ from the other apartments above described.

It is worthy of notice, that the builders of those cities took great pains to supply them with one of the prime essentials of human comfort—abundance of good water, by means of wells and cisterns of excellent construction.

The remains in all the 44 ancient towns visited by Stephens have a similar character; so that we can have no hesitation to ascribe them to the same nation, or to kindred races of men, who had certainly attained no inconsiderable civilisation, although unacquainted with the use of iron, or even of bronze. Many of these towns are repeatedly referred to in the native histories, and it is almost certain that a large proportion of them were founded and inhabited by the Tutul-Xius, Nahoas, and other tribes speaking the Nahuatl tongue. In not a few instances the dates and the names of the founders have been preserved.

It has been generally admitted by physiologists, that the temperate regions of the globe are best fitted to de-velope all the powers of our nature; and it is a fact in accordance with this opinion, that among the aborigines of America, civilisation followed very closely the chain of the Andes, and was found either upon their sides or the table-land of their summits, where the elevation of the ground moderates the heat of the tropical sun, and produces a climate analogous to that of Central and Southern Europe. This civilisation did not exist merely at the two distant and isolated points of Mexico and Peru, but presented itself at intermediate places, and may be said to have formed a continuous line from lat. 35° N. to lat. 35° S, with few interruptions, except at those parts where the mountainous chain disappears, or sinks down to a trifling elevation. Some large buildings near the Rio Gila, in lat. 33° N., with fragments of porcelain, indicate the existence of a people there who had some knowledge of the arts. These were most probably a branch of the Aztecs or Toltecs, who afterwards occupied Mexico, as the annals of that country tell. Though some pursued their march southward, it may be reasonably supposed that a part remained in the district; and the Indians living here, who cultivate corn, weave cloth, and live in villages consisting of houses built of solid materials, sometimes two stories in height, may either be their descendants, or have borrowed from them the improvements they possess. Next in order as we proceed southward, are the various nations of Mexico, of whose condition we shall speak by and by. In Chiapa were the Zapotecs, in Yucatan the Mayas, in Guatemala the Quiches and Kachiquels, all nearly as much advanced in civilisation as the Mexicans, and probably of the same primitive stock. From this point, where the Andes lose their elevation, or break into isolated cones, no distinct traces of civilisation appear till we enter the southern continent. Here were found the Muyscas or Moscas, on the table-land of Bogota, a nation consisting of several tribes, who worshipped the sun and practised some of the useful arts. To these succeeded the nations of Peru, living under the Incas, whose dominion extended from the equator to the 35th degree of S. latitude. Beyond this boundary were the Chilian tribes, who, though inferior to the Peruvians, had made some advances beyond the rudeness of the savage state. It is proper to mention that some of the nations named were extinct before the arrival of the Spaniards; but the degree of civilisation they had attained is attested by the monuments they have left behind them. There were no other tribes in the new continent which had made any progress in social improvement. We would not except the Guaranis of Brazil, and a few others, who derived their subsistence chiefly from agriculture, but were in other respects savages. We place among the exceptions, however, the extinct race of the Allegewis, or whatever was the name of the people, who erected the military works existing between the Ohio and the northern lakes; but they also, it must be remembered, inhabited a temperate climate, though not a mountainous country. It may be affirmed, then, as a general proposition, that from 35° of N. to 35° of S. latitude, the sides and summits of the Andes were the exclusive seats of American civilisation. We admit that some of the tribes in Chiapa, Oaxaca, and Yucatan, inhabited low districts; but they were still near the Cordillera, and may be fairly considered as offsets from the nations dwelling upon it. The fact is important, as marking the effect of climate on the active energies of our species. There is no doubt that, with the improved arts of modem times, civilisation can subsist under the burning sky of the torrid zone, but not in such vigour as in countries which enjoy a more moderate temperature. Perhaps it will be found that the moral and physical powers of man attain their highest perfection in those regions where he is accompanied by wheat and the vine. The zone occupied by the former extends from the 30th to the 57th or 58th parallel; and within the tropics the corresponding climate is found on the flanks or summits of mountains, from 4500 to 10,000 feet above the level of the sea.

It is remarkable that the Mexican annals reach to a very remote date, although they were preserved merely by picture-writing. We do not pretend to enter into the question as to the authenticity of the records themselves, and their correctness. It is enough that they have received credit from Humboldt, Vater, and other men of learning and judgment. From the annals thus preserved, of which further details will be subsequently given, we learn that at the earliest dawn of history the Quinames were in possession of the country, that civilisation was introduced by strangers coming from the east, and that several nations belonging to one race migrated in succession from the north· west, and settled in Anahuac or Mexico. The Toltecs, it is stated, left their original seat, far to the west, in 544 of our era, and after a long journey invaded Mexico, then occupied by wandering hordes, in 648. This people, who penetrated to Nicaragua, if not to South America, were nearly destroyed after the lapse of some centuries; but were followed by the Chichimecs, a half savage tribe, about 1120, and these a few years aftenvards by the Anahautlels, [9:1:695] or seven tribes, including the Acolhuans, the Tlascaltecs, and the Aztecs or proper Mexicans. All these people spoke dialects of one language, and had similar arts, customs, and institutions. The town of Mexico or Tenochtitlan was founded in 1325, and the series of Mexican kings which commenced in 1352 was continued through eight monarchs to Montezuma. The monarchy was small at first, and passed through many vicissitudes; but it was gradually enlarged, especially by the policy and enterprise of the later princes of the line. When Cortes arrived, it embraced what are now the provinces of Vera Cruz, Oaxaca, Puebla, Mexico, and part of Valladolid, a surface of 130,000 square miles; but within this were comprehended three small independent states, Tlascala, Cholullan, and Zapeaca. The pastoral state, which forms the intermediate stage between savage and civilised life, had never existed in Mexico; for the native wild ox had not been tamed, and the use of milk as food was unknown. The Mexican nations derived their subsistence from agriculture, which, however, was conducted in the rudest manner, with very imperfect instruments. They cultivated maize, potatoes, plantains, and various other esculent vegetables. They raised cotton, and understood the art of spinning and weaving it into cloth, of a texture which excited the admiration of the Spaniards. They had no iron, but showed considerable skill in fashioning the gold, silver, and copper, found in a native state, into domestic utensils and ornamental articles. In some of their buildings the stones were hewn into regular forms, and accurately joined; and from the ruins of the palace of Mitla, in Oaxaca, still existing, it appears that they had the art of designing ornaments like arabesques, in paste, with great neatness, and attaching them to the walls; but solid structures of masonry evincing any considerable skill are extremely rare in the country. Their carvings in wood were tolerably well executed, but the figures were disproportioned and uncouth. The same remark applies to their hieroglyphical drawings, which were far inferior in taste and design to those of the Hindoos, Japanese, and Thibetians. For paper they employed sometimes the large leaves of the aloe, sometimes cotton cloth, or the skins of deer dressed. Their books consisted of strips or webs of such materials, composed of pieces neatly joined, one or two feet broad and twenty or thirty long, which were divided into pages by folding them in a zig-zag manner; and two pieces of thin deal attached to the outermost folds served as boards, and gave these manuscripts, when closed, an appearance very much like our old folios in wooden binding. The written language of Mexico contained a few real hieroglyphics or symbols, purely conventional, to designate such objects as water, earth, air, day, night, speech, and also for numbers; but it was essentially a system of picture-writing in which objects were represented by coloured figures having a resemblance more or less exact to themselves. With all its necessary imperfections, this instrument was familiarly employed to a prodigious extent in deeds and instruments for effecting the transmission and sale of property. The government kept couriers for conveying intelligence from all parts of the empire; and the capital was watched and cleaned by a sort of police establishment. This is the bright side of Mexican civilisation. On the other hand, it must be kept in view, that the Mexicans had no tame animals, no made roads, no money to serve as a universal medium of exchange in commercial transactions. The government was originally a perfect feudal monarchy, in which all power was monopolised by a numerous nobility and the priesthood. The great mass of the people were serfs, attached to the soil, and transferred with it from owner to owner by descent or purchase. The peasants or slaves of a nobleman were allowed a certain portion of land, which they cultivated in common for their subsistence: the rest of their labour belonged to their lord. The country swarmed with beggars, and thousands were swept off every few years by famine. As among the ancient Egyptians and the Chinese, immutable custom, regulating every act of civil and common life, chained up the course of improvement, and spread a languid monotony over society. The crown was elective, and the powers of the monarch small, till the privileges of the nobles were destroyed by the policy and ambition of Montezuma. The religion of the Mexicans breathed a savage spirit, which degraded them, in a moral point of view, far below the hordes of wandering Indians. Their deities, represented by mis-shapen images of serpents and other hideous animals, were the creation of the darkest passions of the human breast, of terror, hatred, cruelty, and revenge. They delighted in blood, and thousands of human sacrifices were annually offered at their shrines. The places of worship, called Teocallis, were pyramids composed of terraces placed one above another, like the temple of Belus at Babylon. These were built of clay, or of alternate layers of clay and unburnt bricks, but in some cases faced with slabs of polished stone, on which figures of animals are sculptured in relief.^[3. Robertson was mistaken in believing that the Teocallis were in all cases mere masses of earth, without masonry. See Humboldt’s Researches, vol. i. p. 111, English translation.] One or two small chapels stood upon the summit, enclosing images of the deity. The largest known, which is composed of four stories or terraces, has a breadth of 480 yards at the base, and a height of 55. These structures served as temples, tombs, and observatories; and it is remarkable that their sides are always placed exactly in the direction of the meridian. This leads us to the most interesting fact connected with Mexican civilisation, we mean the perfection of their calendar. The civil year was composed of 365 days, divided into 18 months of 20 days, and 5 supplementary days. The Mexicans had besides a ritual or religious year for the regulation of their festivals; and, by means of a cycle of 52 years, and a very-complicated method of computation, the religious and civil periods were connected with one another, and the civil year was made to correspond with the natural by the intercalation of 13 days at the end of the cycle. The month was divided into four weeks of five days, but each day of the month had a distinct name; and Humboldt has given strong reasons for believing that these names were borrowed from an ancient zodiac formed of 27 or 28 lunar houses, which was made use of from the remotest antiquity in Tartary, Thibet, and India. The calendar of the Mexicans bespeaks a degree of scientific skill, and an accuracy of observation, which are not easily reconciled with their semi-barbarous habits, their general ignorance in other things, and the recent date of their civilisation according to their own account. It is here, indeed, and not in their language, that we find distinct traces of their connection with Asiatic nations. The character of the Mexicans is probably the same at this day as before the conquest, which, we are disposed to think, made less change in the situation of the people than is often supposed, though it annihilated the rank and privileges of the nobles. The Mexican Indian is grave, suspicious, and taciturn; quiet and placid in his external deportment, but rancorous in his spirit; submissive to his superiors, harsh and cruel to those beneath him. His intellect is limited, and chiefly developes itself in imitative labours and mechanical arts. Slow, cautious, and persevering, he loves, both in his acts and thoughts, to travel in a beaten track. The people, though speaking many different languages, have nearly the same physical character. The Mexicans have olive complexions, narrow foreheads, black [9:1:696] eyes, coarse glossy black hair, and thin beards. They are of the middle size, and well-proportioned in their limbs. A person with any defect or deformity is rarely seen amongst them. They are healthy, and live to an advanced age, when life is not shortened by drunkenness. The Toltec and Aztec races, when they established themselves in the country, diffused their own language partially from the Lake of Nicaragua to the 37th parallel. They reclaimed, by degrees, many of the neighbouring savage tribes to a settled mode of life, and spread a feeble degree of civilisation over a mixed mass of nations, speaking, according to Clavigero, 35 languages, of which Humboldt tells us that 20 still exist. The Aztec language is one of the most copious and polished of the American tongues, and abounds in words of the immoderate length of 12 or 15 syllables. It is uncertain what was the number of subjects over whom Montezuma ruled. The ruins in the valley of Tenochtitlan, on which the capital stands, show that it must have been more populous before the conquest than now; but the population at present is diffused over an incomparably wider space; and, upon the whole, there are no good grounds for believing that the number of civilised Indians was much greater when Cortes landed, than in 1803, when it amounted to 2,000,000.

The civilisation of Mexico, as well as of Peru, owed its existence to a single cause,—the patient, submissive, and superstitious character of the people, which fitted them to be beasts of burden, under an aristocracy of priests and nobles, who were led, perhaps, partly by influences from abroad, partly by the instinct of self-interest, to devise means for holding the mass of the community in subjection. Many of the nations which continued savage, such as the Algonquins and Iroquois, were probably equal to the Mexicans in intellect; but their propensity to superstition was less, and their energy of character was too great to permit of their being enslaved by their chiefs. It is chiefly in the variety of their primitive character that we must seek for the cause of the diversity of manners and institutions we find among the American nations.

The ancient empire of Peru, more extensive than that of Mexico, embraced the whole sea-coast from Pastos to the river Maule, a line of 2500 miles in length. Its breadth is uncertain; but as it included both declivities of the Andes, it must have extended in some cases to 500 miles, and the entire surface of the empire probably exceeded 500,000 square miles. It is plain, however, from the imperfect history of the Incas which has been preserved, that within this space there were many districts where their authority was feeble, and others inhabited by tribes which were entirely independent. One part of the country, besides, consisted of a sandy desert, while the most elevated tracts were uninhabitable from cold. It must not therefore be supposed that the capacity of the country to support population was commensurate with the extent of its surface. Still the magnitude of the Peruvian empire, in the midst of an immense multitude of independent savage communities, so extremely minute, that a hundred of them might have been planted without crowding in one of its provinces, is an extraordinary phenomenon. The creating and maintaining of such an empire is a proof that the Peruvians had made no trifling progress in the useful arts and in the science of government. To keep in subjection so many remote provinces, there must have been an efficient military force, rapid means of communication, considerable revenues, and an organised magistracy capable of understanding and executing the plans of rulers, who had sufficient political skill and knowledge of human nature to adapt their institutions and arrangements to the wants, habits and character of a great variety of dissimilar nations, spread over a territory reaching as far as from Lisbon to the banks of the Volga. It is clear that the ruling tribe, which was able to extend its dominion, and to a considerable extent its language, over a space of 2500 miles, must have possessed a marked superiority of some kind over the hordes that surrounded it. We must remember, besides, that the Peruvians lay under the disadvantage of being destitute of even such an imperfect instrument of communication as the hieroglyphic language of the Mexicans, and that they were extremely deficient in military spirit. Indeed, it is one of the most singular facts connected with the history of America, that by far the largest empire it contained was formed by the most unwarlike people in it. The dominion of the Incas was founded entirely on policy, superstition, and the arts. It could only be by the intelligence and skill which civilisation developes, that the Peruvians conquered tribes superior to themselves in courage; and it was by policy and superstition that the Incas tamed the rudeness of savage tribes, and held distant countries in subjection. Robertson justly observes, that the Peruvians “had advanced far beyond the Mexicans, both in the necessary arts of life, and in such as had some title to the name of elegant.” In two points only were they inferior; in their calendar or mode of computing time, and in their want of such a substitute for writing as the Aztecs possessed in their hieroglyphics.

Agriculture was conducted with greater care and success in Peru than in Mexico. The lands capable of cultivation were divided into three shares. One was consecrated to the service of religion, the erection of temples, and the maintenance of priests; the second was set apart as a provision for the support of the government; and the third and largest share, which was reserved for the people, was parcelled out, not among individuals, but among the hamlets and villages, according to the number and rank of the inhabitants; and a new division was made every year to meet any change that might arise in the circumstances of the parties. The members of each little community went to the fields under overseers, and cultivated the land by their joint labour. The produce was distributed among the families and individuals according to their wants, while the evils of famine were provided against by storing up the corn in granaries. The Peruvians having no draught animals, and no ploughs, turned up the earth with wooden mattocks; but their skill and care were exemplified in irrigation, which they practised extensively, and in their employing as manure guano, or the dung of sea birds, which abounds on the islands near the coast. Their masonry was superior to that of the Mexicans. Like the ancient Egyptians, they understood mechanics sufficiently to move stones of vast size, even of 30 feet in length, of which specimens are still existing in the walls of the fortress of Cuzco. They had the art of squaring and cutting blocks for building with great accuracy; and they did not effect their purpose, as Robertson supposes, merely by chipping the stones, or rubbing them together so as to fit the surface of the one to that of the other, without regard to symmetry of form. It is now known that they had hard chisels, made of copper, with a mixture of G per cent. of tin,—a proof of considerable skill in the working of metals. With these they hewed the stones into parallelopipeds, which were disposed in “courses as regular,” says Humboldt, “as those of Roman workmanship.” They are joined with such nicety, that the line which divides the blocks can scarcely be perceived; and the outer surface is in some cases covered with carving. The palaces or lodges of the Incas, of which there are many remains, had doors with slanting sides like the [9:1:697] Egyptian; sloping roofs, which, it is supposed, were covered with rushes or stone slabs; no windows, but niches symmetrically distributed.^[4. See Humboldt’s account of the ancient buildings of Calio and Cunnar, vols. i. and ii. of his Researches.] Ancient stone structures, which are so rare in Mexico, are pretty abundant in Peru,—a fact for which we can only account by the difficulty with which the Mexicans erected buildings, in consequence of their inferiority in the art of masonry. The architecture of the Peruvians, like everything else connected with their social state, displays a remarkable uniformity, not only of style, but of plan. “It is impossible,” says Humboldt, “to examine a single edifice of the time of the Incas, without recognising the same type in all the others which cover the ridge of the Andes, along an extent of 450 leagues.”

The ancient public roads of Peru are justly considered as striking monuments of the political genius of the government. One of these extended along the sides of the Andes from Quito to Cuzco, a distance of 1500 miles. It is about forty feet broad, and paved with the earth and stones which were turned up from the soil; but in some marshy places it is formed, like the old Roman roads, of a compact body of solid masonry. A tolerably level line is preserved, by filling up hollows, cutting down small eminences, and winding round the sides of large ones. At proper distances tambos or storehouses were erected, for the accommodation of the Inca and his messengers. A similar road was made along the coast in the low country. Fissures a few yards in breadth were passed by bridges formed of beams laid horizontally; and an invention, at once bold and ingenious, afforded the means of crossing deep ravines, or the channels of rivers, which happened to intersect the route. This consisted of a suspension bridge, perfectly analogous in its principle to those with which we are familiar. It was formed of half a dozen of cables of twisted osiers, passed over wooden supports, and stretched from bank to bank; then bound together with smaller ropes, and covered with bamboos. Humboldt passed over one of these pendulous bridges, of 120 feet span; and Mr Miers crossed one of 225 feet span, over which loaded animals might travel. In low grounds the rivers were crossed on rafts with a mast and sail, which, by a particular contrivance, could be made to tack and veer. In this respect the Peruvians were a stage in advance of all the other American races, who had nothing superior to the canoe with paddles. The Peruvians manufactured a rude species of pottery: they understood the art of spinning, and, in an imperfect degree, that of weaving. They procured native gold by washing the gravel of rivers; and silver, and perhaps copper, by working veins downward from the outcrop. They knew how to smelt and refine the silver ore; and they possessed the secret of giving great hardness and durability to copper by mixing it with tin. Their utensils and trinkets of gold and silver are said to have been fashioned with neatness and even taste. On the other hand, they had no money, no knowledge of iron or glass; and they were ignorant of the mode of mortising or joining beams, and of casting arches. They had no animals fitted for draught; but the llama, a small species of camel, which they had tamed, was employed to some extent as a beast of burden.

The political organisation of Peru, which was artificial in a high degree, reminds one, in some of its features, of the old system of the Saxons in England, but bears a more general resemblance to that of the ancient Egyptians. The mass of the people were in a state of servitude, except a small number, who were free; above these in rank were the Curacas, or chiefs of districts, who formed a sort of nobility; and above the whole, the family of the Incas, the members of which, by intermarrying only with themselves, formed a numerous and distinct caste. For the purposes of police and civil jurisdiction, the people were divided into parties of ten families, like the tithings of Alfred, over each of which was an officer. A second class of officers had control over five or ten tithings, a third class over fifty or a hundred. These last rendered account to the Incas, who exercised a vigilant superintendence over the whole, and employed inspectors to visit the provinces as a check upon maladministration. Each of these officers, down to the lowest, judged, without appeal, in all differences that arose within his division, and enforced the laws of the empire, among which were some for punishing idleness, and compelling every one to labour. It is probable that the tithings and hundreds, as in England, would lose their numerical signification in course of time, and become mere local allotments. In the hamlets and villages a person mounted a tower every evening, and announced where and how the inhabitants were to be employed next day. The taxes were paid in the produce of the fields, and magazines for receiving them were established in every district. Such is the account given by Acosta and Garcilasso of the civil institutions of Peru, which may be correct with regard to the oldest possessions of the Incas near Cuzco, where their power had been long established; but it is not probable that such a complicated system was ever fully in operation in the more distant parts of the empire.

The government of Peru was a theocracy. The Inca was at once the temporal sovereign and the supreme pontiff. He was regarded as the descendant and representative of the great deity the sun, who was supposed to inspire his counsels, and speak through his orders and decrees. Hence even slight offences were punished with death, because they were regarded as insults offered to the divinity. The race of the Incas was held sacred. To support its pretensions, it was very desirable that it should be kept pure and distinct from the people; but human passions are often too strong for the dictates of policy; and though the marriages of the family were confined to their own race, the emperor, as well as the other males of the blood royal, kept large harems stocked with beauties drawn from all parts of the empire, and multiplied a spurious progeny, in whom the blood of the “children of the sun” was blended with that of the “children of the earth.” Among a simple-minded and credulous people the claims of the Incas to a celestial origin seem to have been implicitly believed. They were blindly obeyed, and treated with a respect bordering on adoration, by the nobles as well as the common people. The Peruvians worshipped the sun, the moon, the evening star, the spirit of thunder, and the rainbow, and had erected temples in Cuzco to all these deities. That of the sun, which was the most magnificent, had its walls covered with plates of gold. The sacrifices consisted of the objects most prized by the people, of grain and fruits, of a few animals, and of the productions of their own industry. Sabianism, as it is the most rational of all the forms of idolatry, is also generally the most mild; and doubtless this results from the tendency which it has to fix the thoughts on the marks of beneficence and wisdom which are displayed in the works of nature. The Peruvian temples were accordingly never polluted, like those of Mexico, with the blood of human victims; and the Incas even went farther, and signalised their zeal against such horrid rites, by suppressing them in all the countries they conquered. Though their history exhibits some bloody deeds, the general character of their government [9:1:698] was the reverse of cruel. The severe punishments prescribed by their laws were rarely inflicted, and rebellion was scarcely known in their dominions. The Inca not only assumed the title of the father of his people, but the vices as well as the merits of his government sprung partly from the attempt made to construct the government on the model of paternal authority, and partly from the blending of moral and religious injunctions with civil duties. Hence the idle pretension of the state to reward virtuous conduct, as well as to punish crimes; hence too the plan of labouring in common, the extinction of individual property, the absurdities of eating, drinking, sleeping, tilling, building, according to fixed universal rules; in fine, that minute and vexatious regulation of all the acts of ordinary life, which converted the people into mere machines in the hands of an immense corps of civil and religious officers. Such a system may have served to reclaim some tribes from the savage state; but it must have stifled the seeds of improvement, and left the mass of the people more stupid and imbecile than it found them. The government was as pure a despotism, probably, as ever existed; but its theocratic character, no doubt, helped to mitigate the ferocity of its spirit. Superstition and force are the two bases on which tyranny rests in all countries; and in proportion as it is firmly seated on the one, it stands less in need of the support of the other. The Inca had so completely enslaved the minds of his subjects, and the apparatus he wielded for directing and controlling their acts was so perfect, that he was able in a great measure to dispense with those terrific examples of cruelty and bloodshed, by which the pure military despot operates on the fears of those who live under his authority.

This system of the Peruvian monarchs, by which the people were kept in a state of perpetual tutelage, merits the greater attention, because it is precisely that which the Jesuits employed, in Paraguay and other districts, to reduce the natives to a settled mode of life; and it seems, in fact, to be the only method by which a semblance of civilisation can be introduced amongst the American nations. Two things must be supposed to account for its prevalence: first, a certain amount of timidity, passiveness, and superstition, in the body of the people, implying weak passions, but not necessarily smallness of intellect; and, secondly, a few minds of a higher class, to give an impulse to the rest, and to control and regulate their acts. In the case of Peru, did these ruling intellects spring from the body of the people, and, after striking out new lights in morals and legislation for themselves, devise a complex and artificial system for establishing their power over the minds of the rest, by the help of superstition and force? or were they strangers from another country, and imbued with the principles of a higher civilisation? If we may believe the Peruvian annals, the latter was the case. About the year 1000 of our era, or perhaps a century later, Manco Capac, with his wife and sister Mama Ocello, appeared as strangers on the banks of the lake Titicaca. They were persons of majestic appearance, and announced themselves as “children of the sun,” sent by their beneficent parent to reclaim the tribes living there from the miseries of savage life. Their injunctions, addressed to a people who probably worshipped the god of day, were listened to by a few, who settled around them, and founded Cuzco. By degrees, other tribes were induced to renounce their wandering habits. Manco Capac instructed the men in agriculture and the arts, and Mama Ocello taught the women to spin and to weave. Laws, institutions, and religious rites, were added. The form of a civilised society arose, which was gradually extended by persuasion or conquest,—-the Incas having always planted their arts and religion wherever they established their authority. Huayna Capac, the twelfth in succession from the founder of the dynasty, occupied the throne when the first party of Spaniards visited Peru in 1527, and the empire was then still in a state of progress. There is, however, little doubt that some advance in civilisation had been made in times before the Incas.

Such is the account which the Peruvians give of the origin of their civilisation, which we should be disposed to reject as a fable, if there were not peculiar circumstances which give it some credibility. First, their institutions, taken in the mass, do not present what may be called the American type. The mild and paternal character which they display, the injunction to “love one another” raised to the rank of a positive precept, the preference of the useful arts to war, all breathe a spirit, not only foreign to the genius of the American tribes, but exactly opposed in character to anything which a native self-taught legislator was likely to produce. Secondly, the artificial and systematic form of the Peruvian institutions renders it improbable that they were developed by the natural action of political causes, but strongly favours the idea, that they were framed by a few designing heads, as an instrument to tame and govern a patient, feeble, and credulous people of rude or savage habits. A small number of Jesuits were led, by a sagacious study of the savage character, to devise a system extremely similar in its nature, which worked admirably. These missionaries were the Manco Capacs of Paraguay; and, like the Incas, might, in the course of two or three centuries, have extended their theocracy over as large a space as Peru, if their situation had permitted them to employ force. Thirdly, a million of native Peruvians yet survive, the living descendants of those who built the temples of Cuzco; and their extreme stolidity, apathy, and feebleness of character, sufficiently testify that the chances were nearly as great against a legislator like Manco Capac arising amongst them, as against the Jews in the time of Augustus producing a being like Jesus Christ. They have the weakness and passiveness which fit them to receive an impression from superior directing minds; but they discover no trace of the intelligence, energy, and originality which must have been united in the persons who planned and carried into effect the political system of the Incas. We admit that oppression may have degraded their character, but it cannot have entirely changed it.

If, then, the civilisation of Peru was exotic, whence was it derived? To us it appears most probable, that the legislators of Peru were either Chinese, or persons who had received at second-hand a knowledge of the arts and institutions of China; and our opinion is grounded on traits of resemblance in the manners, laws, arts, and institutions of the two nations, which, in our opinion, are too numerous, striking, and peculiar, to be the effect of chance. We shall mention some of the most prominent.

1. The first and most obvious resemblance is in the singularly artificial frame of society in both countries. In China, as in Peru, the legislation is directive as well as punitive, and is distinguished by that minute and elaborate system of regulation, inspection, and control, which interferes with the most trifling actions of ordinary life, and reduces the mass of the people to the condition of automata, moved and guided in everything by the rulers. China, says Mr Barrow, is a great school, in which the magistrates are the masters, and the people the scholars. It might be more correctly compared to a large monastic establishment, in which each person has his place and his duty assigned to him, and all his acts directed by superiors, whose wisdom and authority he is not permitted to question. The Chinese have the same immense multitude [9:1:699] of civil officers which the Peruvians had, and the same chain of subordination from the emperor down to the petty constable. In China this system was undoubtedly the growth of many centuries; but it was too artificial to occur to the thoughts of a cacique, educated amongst a tribe of savages on the sides of the Andes. 2. In China as in Peru, the emperor assumes the title of the “father of his people;” and his government is modelled upon this figure of speech. He affects to be sprung from progenitors who descended from heaven like the children of the sun, and he unites the character of supreme pontiff with that of temporal prince. There are vestiges, too, of the worship of the heavenly bodies in China.^[5. See accounts of the temples at Pekin dedicated to the heavens, the north star, the moon, the earth, &c., and of the festival kept at the summer solstice, like the grand solar festival in Peru.] 3. The Chinese emperor extends an ostentatious patronage to agriculture, by celebrating an annual festival in its honour, on which occasion he proceeds to the field in great pomp, and takes a part in the labour of cultivating the ground with his own hands. This singular custom existed in Peru, where the Incas went through an annual ceremony perfectly similar. How foreign was such an institution to the spirit of the American tribes! 4. In China agriculture is in a rude state, and exhibits proofs of intelligence and skill only in two things—the use of manures, and a laborious system of irrigation. Precisely the same circumstances characterised the agriculture of Peru. 5. The internal taxes of China, like those of Peru, are paid in kind (maize, rice, silk, cotton, &c.), and stored in public magazines or granaries. 6. The Chinese government maintained public roads, even in those provinces where neither carriages nor beasts of burden were used, of course for the use of pedestrians, and storehouses or places of refreshment were built upon them at proper distances. The Peruvians constructed roads on precisely the same plan, and for the same purposes; and this was done by no other people in America. 7. The Chinese do not inter the bodies of the dead, but lay them on the ground and raise a tumulus or conical heap of earth over them. Such was also the practice in Peru. The only barbarously cruel rite practised in Peru, that of immolating the Inca’s domestics at the obsequies of their master, was brought into China by the Tartars. Its existence is an anomaly in each case, for the genius of both nations was peaceful and mild. 8. The architecture of the Chinese displays little taste, but is distinguished by two peculiarities—the power shown of cutting and moving immense masses of stone, and the uniformity of style which pervades their structures, of every size and description. “All the buildings,” says Mr Barrow, “from the meanest hut to the viceroy’s palace, are upon one plan.” Humboldt remarks the same adherence to a single model among the Peruvians, and the walls of Cuzco show that they were acquainted with the method of moving stones of prodigious size. The Chinese were fond of covering their walls with carving, and examples of the same practice occur in Peru. If any of the Peruvian buildings had remained entire with their roofs on, it would perhaps have been found, that the type or primary architectural form employed in the two countries was not very dissimilar, and some allowance should be made for the circumstance, that Peru must have borrowed her models from China 700 or perhaps 1000 years ago. 9. The Peruvians made coarse pottery, and all the world knows that this is an art in which the Chinese excel. The Peruvians were the only American nation who had made any progress in the art of fusing and alloying metals, in which the Chinese have long been distinguished by their skill. 10. The

Peruvians had dramas and dramatic spectacles. Whence could a people so uninventive have derived the idea of such entertainments, if not from China, where they have been long familiar to the people? There were mimics and buffoons in Mexico, but nothing, we believe, to which the term drama could be applied. 11. But perhaps the most remarkable coincidence is found in an invention entirely confined to the two countries. We have described the suspension bridges made of ropes, employed by the Peruvians in crossing deep ravines. Now, it is singular that bridges of the very same description, some of chains, and some of ropes, are found in the south of China, and nowhere else except in Thibet, which has interchanged arts and customs with China from time immemorial. This single fact we would consider as a proof of communication between the two countries. The Peruvians made their ropes of twisted osiers, and the Chinese had ropes also of this description. 12. From what people nearer than the Chinese could the Peruvians borrow the idea of rafts with a mast and sail? These rafts, supporting covered huts, may be considered as literal copies of some that are used in China; and the peculiar mechanism employed in lieu of a rudder is no doubt borrowed from the paddles attached to the Chinese boats, fore and aft. 13. The Chinese in ancient times made use of quipus or knotted cords to facilitate calculation. Is it not probable that this invention had passed from them to the Peruvians, the Mexicans, the Kaluschi, and other American nations who employed it? It would be easy to trace similar analogies in many other customs, laws, and institutions of the two nations. Both had nunneries or religious societies of women, who lived under a vow of celibacy; both had a class of literary men (the Haravecs and Amautas, or poets and philosophers, in Peru), patronised by the government; both divided the year into twelve months, and placed the beginning of it in January (a coincidence the more remarkable, as the year of the Mexicans and other northern nations consisted of 18 months); both were strangers to the use of milk, cheese, and butter.^[6. Sir John Barrow is our authority for this fact, which is the more remarkable, as the Mongols, the neighbours and conquerors of the Chinese, had the use of all the three articles immemorially.] These facts may suffice, for we have not room for lengthened inquiries, neither are we anxious to press our argument beyond its proper limits. Our position is, not that the Peruvians are descended from the Chinese, but simply that Peru had been inoculated with civilisation by persons who derived their ideas from China. If it be asked why these persons did not import from China the use of letters, the method of casting arches, and many other arts practised there, our answer is, that no individual, and still less any casual assemblage of individuals such as the purposes of trade or navigation might bring together, possesses a knowledge of every art and science which exists in his country. How many men are there in England at this day, who could not even carry the knowledge of the alphabet to another country? We must remember, too, that all the arts existing in China do not exist in every province of it, and have not always existed in those provinces where we now find them.^[7. The uniformity and unchangeableness of customs in China have evidently been much exaggerated. The empire is formed of an assemblage of small states, conquered one after another, each of which must have had its peculiar laws, manners, and superstitions; and common sense tells us, that to blend these into one perfectly homogeneous mass, must have required a much longer period than has elapsed since the empire attained its present magnitude. It would be easy, too, to find instances of the Chinese having changed their customs, both in matters of business and matters of domestic economy·] As to the means of communication, it is evident that the tradewind renders Peru almost unapproachable from Eastern Asia, between the parallels of 30° N. and 30° S. latitude.
[9:1:700]

But beyond these limits the west winds prevail, and hence China, in point of facility of access, is nearer to Peru than the Society or Marquesas Islands. The Chinese have long exposed themselves to the casualties of a maritime life, in vessels of large size, provisioned for many months; and at this day they perform voyages of 3000 or 4000 miles, to Ceylon and Polynesia.

The Quichua language, or that of Peru, was spread, by the care of the Incas, over all the countries which they conquered, so far at least as to be understood, if not spoken, by the great variety of tribes subject to their sway. It is understood at present as far as Santiago del Estero, 1200 miles of direct distance south-east from Cuzco. This single fact proves both the long duration of their power, and the efficiency of their internal administration. It is said to be the most rich, polished, and harmonious of the South American languages, abounding in vowel sounds, but wanting those corresponding to the Spanish consonants b , d , f, g, l, x, v. Like all the other American tongues, it wants terms for abstract and universal ideas, such as time, space, being, substance, matter, body, and even such as virtue, justice, liberty, gratitude. There are five dialects of the Quichua, which are spoken in Peru proper, and in Quito, New Granada, and a considerable part of La Plata, and not only by the aborigines, but by many Spaniards of the higher classes. The Peruvians had no alphabetic writing. They possessed a very rude species of hieroglyphics, of which little use was made, and the quipus or knotted cords of various colours, which last were originally employed simply as aids to calculation, but latterly as records of facts, laws, &c. Each quipu required a verbal commentary. About ten years ago a copy of an old MS. was discovered, which contained an account of the Maya alphabet of Yucatan —the only alphabet yet known to have existed in America.

The Peruvians of the aboriginal Quichua race are of a copper colour, with a small forehead, the hair growing on each side from the extremities of the eye-brows; they have small black eyes, a small nose, a moderately sized mouth, with beautiful teeth; beardless chin (except in old age), and a round face. Their hair is black, coarse, and sleek, the body well proportioned, the feet small, the stature rather diminutive. Their intellectual qualities, according to Μ. Ulloa, are of the lowest order. The most prominent trait in their character is an imperturbable and incurable apathy. Though half-naked, they are as contented as the Spaniard in his most splendid raiment. Gold and silver have so little influence over them, that the greatest recompense will not induce them to perform the slightest service voluntarily. Neither power nor dignity moves them, and they receive with the same indifference the office of alcalde and that of executioner. They are habitually slow in their motions, and extremely indolent. When employed at any piece of labour, if the master withdraws his eye for a moment, they cease to work. They are timid, shy, secretive, and always grave, even in the dances, which are their favourite pastime. The love of intoxicating liquors is deeply rooted in their nature. They prepare a fermented beverage called chicha from maize, by a process known to them before the conquest, and at their festivals drink till their senses fail them, day after day. This vicious habit, however, is common to all the American nations, and is confined to the men, for the women are in general strictly sober. The Peruvians are a gentle and mild people; they are fond of their dogs, and breed up hogs, geese, and chickens, for which they have so tender a regard, that they will often neither kill nor sell them. Their huts, says Mr Stevenson, consist of stones laid upon one another without any cement or mortar, thatched over with long grass or straw, affording no defence from either the wind or the rain. One small room contains the whole family; their bed a sheep-skin or two; their furniture one or two earthen pots. The principal food of the Peruvians is maize; but they raise also potatoes, wheat, beans, tornatos, yucas, pumpkins, and other vegetables. Christianity, imposed upon them dogmatically, by priests who take no pains to enlighten them, has scarcely gained admission to their understandings, and has no hold on their affections. They attend divine service from the dread of chastisement, and give an outward assent to whatever they are taught, but without any real religious impression being made upon their minds. They meet death with the same stupid indifference as the ordinary accidents of life, and rather decline than seek the assistance of a priest in their last hours. It ought not to be forgotten, however, that the intellectual torpor which the Peruvians display may be attributed in part to the deadening and debasing effects of three centuries of brutal oppression. They still cherish in secret a strong veneration for their ancient faith and their native government, which displays itself even in the large towns. The story of Manco Capac (whom, since numbers of our countrymen appeared in Peru, they affect to call an Englishman) and Mama Ocello, the wealth, power, and beneficence of the Incas, are still fresh in their memories, and are handed down from father to son with a degree of fond admiration which three centuries of humiliation and misfortune seem only to have rendered more intense. The barbarous murder of the Inca Atahualpa by Pizarro is annually represented in the form of a tragedy. “In this performance,” says Mr Stevenson, “the grief of the Indians is so natural, though excessive, their songs so plaintive, and the whole is such a scene of distress, that I never witnessed it without mingling my tears with theirs. The Spanish authorities have endeavoured to prevent this exhibition, but without effect. The Indians in the territory of Quito wear black clothes, and affirm that it is mourning for their Incas, of whom they never speak but in a doleful tone.”

The oppression of the mita, or forced labour in the mines, with the introduction of the small-pox and the use of spirituous liquors, has destroyed prodigious multitudes of the Indians since the conquest. What their number was before that event it is impossible to tell; but, judging from the extent of the Inca’s dominions, he probably had not less than three or four millions of subjects. A pretended Spanish account, assigning a population of eight millions to Peru shortly after the conquest, is known to be fictitious. An official estimate in 1862 made the number of Indians in Peru amount to 1,600,000, being three-fourths of the entire population.^[8. In this account of the Peruvians we have chiefly followed Garci-lasso, Acosta, Frezier, and Ulloa, of whose statements a copious digest is given by Prevost in the 13th volume of his Histoire Générale des Voyages. We have also taken some facts from Humboldt’s Researches, Balbi’s Ethnographical Atlas, and W. B. Stevenson’s Narrative of Twenty Years’ Residence in South America, a useful work, although the author has shown rather too great an anxiety to exalt the character of the Indians.]

In Chili there were several tribes who possessed nearly all the arts known to the Peruvians, but were distinguished from them by a finer physical constitution and an unconquerable spirit. When the Spaniards arrived, Chili, according to Molina, was inhabited by fifteen tribes independent of each other, who were spread over the country on both sides of the Andes, from latitude 30° to the Strait of Magalhaens. They all spoke dialects of one language, which is described as rich, harmonious, abounding in compound words, and having, like the other American tongues, very complicated grammatical forms. It has no affinity to the Quichua or Peruvian. The inhabitants of the plains are a stout people, of middle stature; those [9:1:701] of the mountains are tall; and one tribe, the Tehuels or Patagonians, surpass in size every other nation in the world. All the tribes inhabiting the plains, except those of the extreme south, now make use of horses. The complexion of the Chilian tribes is, like that of the other American nations, a reddish brown; but one tribe is said to be of a clear red and white. They do not paint their bodies. The Chilians lived partly by hunting, but chiefly by agriculture, before they had any intercourse with Europeans. They cultivated maize, magu, guegen, tuca, quinoa, the potato, pumpkins, and some species of pulse; and to these they added, as food, the flesh of the biz-cacho, and of the llama or Araucanian camel, of whose wool they are said to have manufactured cloth. Like the Peruvians, they understood the use of manure, practised irrigation with considerable skill, and turned up the ground with a wooden spade or mattock. They boiled their grain in earthen pots, or brayed it into meal after roasting it in hot sand; of the meal they made puddings or bread, which they knew how to leaven, and various species of fermented drink. They had gold, silver, copper, tin, and lead, procured probably by washing; but they seem to have had few or no edge-tools of metal, those found being almost always of basalt. They made baskets and mats, extracted salt from sea-water, and were able to give various dyes to their cloths. They used quipus or knotted cords for calculation, and, according to Mr Stevenson, for the transmission of intelligence and for recording events. They lived in villages formed of houses standing at a distance from one another, under hereditary chiefs, but whose power was limited. It is remarkable that the Chinese mode of catching wild ducks on the rivers, by covering the fisher’s head with a gourd, was practised in Chili.

The Araucanians, the most intelligent, improved, and warlike of the Chilian tribes, occupy about 200 miles of the sea-coast, between the 37th and 39th parallels. They are of ordinary stature, but vigorously formed; bold, hardy, hospitable, faithful to their engagements, generous to a fallen enemy, ardent, intrepid, and enthusiastic lovers of liberty. Their vices are drunkenness, and a contempt of other nations, springing from pride. Their government, in the regularity of its form and its sub-division of authority, has an outward resemblance to the Peruvian; but the spirit of the two systems differs as widely as the genius of the two nations. Araucania contains four tetrarchies, under four toquis or princes, who are independent of one another, but confederated for their joint security against foreign enemies. Each tetrarchy is divided into five provinces, ruled by five chiefs called apo-ulmen; and each province into nine districts, governed by as many ulmen, who are subject to the apo-ulmen, as the latter are to the toquis. These various chiefs (who all bear the title of ulmen, as our nobility of all orders are barons) compose the aristocracy of the country. They hold their dignities by hereditary descent in the male line, and in the order of primogeniture. The supreme power of each tetrarchy resides in a diet or great council of the ulmen, who assemble annually in a large plain, like the Poles and Germans in old times; but as the people are all armed, and have a high love of liberty, no resolution of the diet is of any avail if it has not their hearty concurrence. The chiefs, indeed, are little more than leaders in war; for the right of private revenge, which is fully admitted, limits their authority in judicial matters; and they receive no taxes. Their laws are merely primeval usages. The Araucanians can raise altogether 6000 or 7000 men, besides a body of reserve. When war is declared by the great council, messengers bearing “arrows dipt in blood” are sent to all parts of the country to summon the men to arms. Unlike many barbarous nations, which are immovably attached to their ancient customs, the Araucanians were not slow in copying the military arts and tactics of the Spaniards. Their troops now consist of infantry and cavalry; the former armed with pikes or clubs, the latter with swords and lances. The infantry are formed into regiments of ten companies, each company containing a hundred men. When they take the field, they carry parched meal with them for provisions; they station sentinels, send out scouts, and have advanced guards preceding their main body. When necessary for their security, they dig ditches, and plant stakes along their sides, and throw up mounds of earth. They advance to battle in lines, well formed, and fight with intrepidity. Their history affords a brilliant example of what a brave nation, animated by an enthusiastic love of liberty, can accomplish under the greatest disadvantages. After resisting the best troops and the best generals of Spain for two hundred years, they at last compelled their proud enemies to acknowledge their independence. The Araucanians were indebted for their success to a deliberate species of courage, to which even the bravest of the North American tribes are strangers; and they combined with it a degree of sagacity and intelligence which led them to adapt their mode of fighting to the new circumstances in which they were placed. Experience having taught them the inefficiency of their old missiles when opposed to musket balls, they soon laid aside their bows, and armed themselves with spears, swords, or other weapons fitted for close combat. Their practice was to advance rapidly within such a distance of the Spaniards as would not leave them time to reload after firing. Here they received without shrinking a volley, which was certain to destroy a number of them, and then rushing forward in a close column, fought their enemies hand to hand. In this way they gained many victories, and impressed the Spaniards with such a respect for their courage that an individual of that nation made their achievements the subject of an epic poem. Combining the moral, intellectual, and physical qualities of the Araucanians, they were certainly the finest native race in the New World. They had nearly all the germs of civilisation which belonged to the Mexicans and Peruvians, without the ferocity of the former, the apathy of the latter, or the slavish habits common to both; and without having their minds stupified by that grovelling superstition which the rulers of these two nations seem to have considered as the only secure foundation of their authority. In true courage, in manliness and energy of character, they take precedence of all the American nations.

The Araucanians believe in a supreme being, and in many subordinate spirits, good and bad. They believe also in omens and divination, but they have neither temples nor idols, nor religious rites; and discover upon the whole so little aptitude for the reception of religious ideas that the Catholic missionaries who have settled among them have had very little success in imbuing their minds with a knowledge of Christianity. They believe in a future state, and have a confused tradition respecting a deluge, from which some persons were saved on a high mountain. They divide the year into twelve months of 30 days, which have significant names, and add five days by intercalation. They esteem poetry and eloquence, but can scarcely be induced to learn reading or writing. Chess, a game of oriental origin, is said to have been known among them from time immemorial; and it may be further observed, that the numbers 5 and 9, employed in their geographical and civil divisions, are favourite numbers in China.

The other Chilian tribes are all much behind the Arau∙
[9:1:702]

canians in civilisation; but some, as the Puelches and the Tehuels, surpass them in strength and stature. Part of them live on horse flesh, part by keeping sheep and cattle, and part by hunting. Some of these tribes paint their faces. With regard to the height of the Patagonians, Μ. Lesson, an eminent French naturalist, has collected the authorities on the subject in a note published by Balbi in his Ethnographical Atlas; and they appear to us to remove every rational doubt as to the fact of a race of men existing there whose average stature is about six feet, and among whom men seven feet high are perhaps more frequently to be met with than among an equal number of men in any other country. They have large heads, but their hands and feet are small, and they are not strong in proportion to their tall stature. They ride on horseback, and hunt the huanaco or the ostrich with a sling, which they cast so as to entangle the animal’s legs. They dwell in tents, and lead a wandering life.

Of the numerous nations that inhabited Brazil there is only one to which we can afford any special notice in this article. The Guaranis have at one time formed a numerous people, which seems to have been spread over a larger surface than any other now existing in America. Tribes, or remnants of tribes, whose relationship to the Guaranis is attested by the strong evidence of their language, are found diffused over the wide space between the Orinoco and the embouchure of the Plata, or more than the half of South America. They are met with among the Andes of Peru, in the province of Chiquitos, in Matto Grosso, in Paraguay, in Minas Geraes; and the Omaguas, in the republic of Ecuador, who, from their nautical habits, and the influence they obtained on the upper part of the Amazon, have been called the Phoenicians of the new world, are believed to be of the same race. They constituted the bulk of the native population of Brazil when the Portuguese gained possession of it, but were divided into many distinct tribes, quite independent of one another, and living, not in contiguity, but mixed with other nations. They are of low stature, two inches shorter than the Spaniards, according to Azara; of a square form, fleshy, and ugly. Their colour has a strong shade of the copper red, while that of the other Brazilian tribes inclines generally to the tawny or black. Their character, like their physical form, resembles that of the Peruvians. They are patient, torpid, silent, downcast in their mien, mild, and passionless. Nearly all the Indians whom the Portuguese have civilised or converted belong to this race. It is difficult to account for their dissemination through the southern continent, amidst nations much more brave and powerful than themselves. May we suppose that, like the subjects of the Incas, they had been at one time the dominant tribe of an extensive empire, which derived its force from union and civilisation? But if such a state did exist, its date cannot be very ancient; for the identity or close resemblance of the dialects spoken by the scattered portions of the Guaranis shows that their dispersion from a common point did not happen at a very remote period.^[9. Dr Prichard’s Researches, vol. ii. p. 487.] Yet no memorial of its existence survives, either in traditions or monuments. The supposition, therefore, that the Guarani tribes are the remnants of a once powerful and united people, is scarcely admissible; and Azara thinks it more probable that they have crept gradually from north to south. Their dispersion is the more remarkable, as they are not a wandering but an agricultural people. They live in the woods, or in small open spaces in the forests; cultivate maize, beans, gourds, yams, mandioc; and eat also wild honey, and the flesh of monkeys and various small quadrupeds.

The Indians whom the Jesuits civilised and collected into communities in the celebrated settlements of Paraguay belonged chiefly to the nation of the Guaranis. These missionaries are said to have borrowed the plan of the theocracy which they established here from that which the Incas had introduced into Peru. There is no doubt that the spirit of their system was the same; and, considering that they were precluded from any other means of extending and supporting their authority than persuasion, their success was remarkable. The settlements were commenced about 1610, and were gradually extended over the country watered by the Parana and Uruguay, between the 27th and 30th degrees of south latitude, till the order of the Jesuits was suppressed in 1767. The plan of the government may be called parochial, for it was administered entirely by the parochial clergy. The Indians were collected into villages. Each village had its church and its curate, who was assisted by one, two, or more priests, according to the number of Indians under his charge. The curate and assistant priests were nominated, not by the Spanish authorities, but by the father superior, also a Jesuit, who exercised a vigilant superintendence over the whole. Indians were appointed in each village with the titles of regidors and alcaldes; but they were merely instruments in the hands of the curate and his assistants, in whom all power was lodged. The curate gave his whole attention to religious offices, saying mass in the church, and visiting the sick; while the assistant priests managed all secular matters, directing the labour of the Indians who cultivated the ground, and training others to the crafts of the weaver, mason, carpenter, goldsmith, painter, and sculptor; for the fine arts were by no means neglected. Private property did not exist. The produce of the labour of the community was stored in magazines, from which each family was supplied according to its wants, special provision being made for aged persons, widows, and orphans. The surplus was sold by agents at Buenos Ayres, and the proceeds employed in paying the taxes to the king, in procuring ornaments for the churches, and various articles which the colonists could not manufacture for themselves. The religious instruction was of the most simple kind; but the service of the church was conducted with a well-trained choir, a pompous ceremonial, and every accessory calculated to strike the senses. The punishments were mild; and they were always accompanied with such admonitions as a parent would address to a child whom he was chastising. Crimes, in truth, were rare. The Indians, who regarded their spiritual chiefs with the veneration due to beneficent beings of a superior order, scarcely felt humbled in confessing their misdeeds; and offenders may have solicited correction, as Raynal says, for the quieting of their consciences. The incursions of the Portuguese compelled the Jesuits to take means for repelling force by force. All the male Indians of the proper age were accordingly armed with muskets, and disciplined as a militia. In 1732, according to Dobrizhoffer, the thirty villages or parishes under the care of the missionaries contained a population of 141,000 souls. The Jesuits had another establishment of the same kind among the Chiriguas, a branch of the Guaranis, in the province of Chiquitos, containing 30,000 or 40,000 Indians; a third, of smaller size, in the province of Moxos; a fourth in California; and probably others. After the suppression of the order, all these were committed to the care of friars of other descriptions; and we believe they have universally fallen into a state of decay. The social system established in Paraguay was the most effectual ever contrived for reclaiming the Indians from their savage mode of life; but even its success shows how hopeless the attempt is to raise the American tribes to [9:1:703] the rank of thoroughly civilised nations. The Jesuits were able to introduce settled habits and a slight knowledge of religion and the arts among the Indians only by means of the personal ascendancy they acquired over them. It was a few superior minds gaining the respect and confidence of a horde of savages, then employing the influence they acquired to lead them as children; giving them such portions of instruction as taught them to trust implicitly in their guides, working alternately on their fears, their pride, their kind affections, but never fully revealing to them the springs of the machinery by which they were governed. The incurable indolence of the savages rendered it necessary to prescribe the labour as task-work, and to carry it on under the constant inspection of the missionaries. The plan of cultivating the ground in common, and of storing the produce in magazines, out of which the wants of each family were supplied, was resorted to as a check upon their improvident habits. In short, the eye and the hand of the missionaries were everywhere; and the social system was held together entirely by their knowledge and address. When these were withdrawn, the fabric soon fell into ruins, and the Indians relapsed into their idolatry and savage habits.

To complete our general view of the aboriginal races, a few particulars remain to be mentioned. Many of the tribes who inhabit the Pampas of South America make use of horses. Dobrizhoffer enumerates eight equestrian tribes in the province of Chaco, on the west side of the river Paraguay, who are generally distinguished by tall and vigorous forms, and a bold and active character. The Abipones and Mbayas are the most celebrated of these. The woods of Brazil are too dense for equestrians; but horses are used by a few hordes in the great plain of the Mississippi and in the north of Mexico. The American tribes in general either kill their prisoners or adopt them; but a few retain them as slaves, and compel them to work. The Guaycurus of Brazil are an example. The food of different tribes is extremely various. Maize, beans, pumpkins, and mandioc are raised in small quantities by some; natural fruits, berries, bulbous roots, and bananas are gathered by others. Those who dwell on the sides of rivers live greatly on fish; in the plains, buffaloes, horses, and sheep are killed. In the forests of Brazil, monkeys, pigs, armadillos, pacas, agoutis, and tapirs are the favourite food; but birds, turtles, deer, and the coati are also taken; and in an emergency the Indians do not scruple to feed on serpents, toads, and lizards, the larvøe of insects, and other disgusting substances. Salt is used where it can be easily obtained, and some season their food with capsicum. Some roast their meat, others boil it; and not only several savage tribes, but even the civilised Peruvians, ate their flesh raw. The Ottomaques, a tribe near the Orinoco, eat a species of unctuous clay; this strange diet, which no doubt owed its introduction to the stern monitor famine, is not extremely rare in Brazil, and Captain Franklin found the same food in use among an Indian tribe near the Frozen Ocean. The clay is stated by that traveller to have a milky and not disagreeable taste. A great proportion of the tribes in Brazil and the basin of the Orinoco, and some in other parts of America, indulge in the horrid banquet of human flesh. Shame, in our sense of the term, is nearly a stranger to the breasts of these savages. In the warm regions of Brazil men and women go entirely naked, except in the neighbourhood of the Portuguese settlements, where some wear a band of cloth round the loins. In such situations, where the want of shelter is little felt, their dwellings are often nothing more than a sort of arbour formed by interlacing the open space between two or three trees with twigs, and covering it with leaves so as to form a screen on the windward side, while it is left entirely open on the other. The manufacture of bows and arrows, war-clubs, baskets, mats (which, swung from a tree, serve them both as seats and hammocks), and in some cases a coarse pottery, comprises the sum of their practical skill in the arts. It has long been the practice of bands of Portuguese, consisting chiefly of outlaws and vagabonds, to make marauding expeditions among the Indians living near the great rivers, and to carry them off and sell them clandestinely for slaves. This infamous trade is carried on in despite of the orders of the government, which has issued many decrees for the protection of the Indians, and, besides employing missionaries to convert them, enjoined the governors of provinces to furnish them with hoes and other agricultural implements. Wherever the negroes are introduced in great numbers, as in the Capitanias of Santo Paulo and Rio Janeiro, and in the whole of the West India islands, the aborigines rapidly disappear, the former being more intelligent, more tractable in their habits, and more active and industrious. The negroes are indeed a superior race to the Indians; and the existence of one or two hundred blacks, as slaves, among some thousands of the Cherokees, does not detract from the accuracy of this opinion. Missions for the conversion of the Indians have been supported for more than two centuries by the governments of Spain and Portugal. They are thinly spread over those parts of Mexico, La Plata, Peru, Brazil, and Colombia, which are still occupied by the savages; but there are extensive districts in all these provinces in which they have never been established, owing to the fierce character of the tribes, or the remote and inaccessible nature of the country. A mission consists in general of one or two friars or priests, who settle among the savages, learn their language, and, besides teaching them the elements of Christianity, always endeavour to instruct them in the more simple and useful arts, and to train them to settled habits. We believe that many of these establishments have been abandoned, owing to the failure of the funds with which they were supported; and that the success of the others has been extremely trifling. The late revolutions in those countries, by liberating the Indians from their ancient state of tutelage under the whites, have in many cases broken up the little settlements which the missionaries had formed. This has been the result even in Brazil, where the political changes have been least felt.

Owing to the fanaticism of the Spaniards a large proportion of the manuscripts of the natives were destroyed, so that now we are unable to acquire so full and accurate a history of the more civilised nations as we might otherwise have done. The literature which still exists, together with the numerous remains of cities, temples, roads, bridges, and other works of art, testify to the general truth of the historical narratives. However obscure they may now be, or however difficult the reconciliation of statements, it seems clear they have been founded on facts. As in the case of other histories, there is much error and tradition, mingled with truth, which renders their correct interpretation difficult. Amongst some of the nations we know that historians were appointed by the government, and that such historians were severely punished if they ventured to tamper with the truth wilfully. The best connected account of these histories, so far as concerns the nations of Central America, is that given by the Abbé Brasseur de Bourbourg.^[10. Histoire des Nations civilisées du Mexique et de l' Amérique centrale, durant les siècles antérieurs à Christophe Columb. 4 tomes. 8vo. 1857-59.] If we credit the native accounts, the earliest traces of civilisation originated in Yucatan and the neighbouring districts, a region which is amongst the most fertile in the New World.
[9:1:704]

It is stated that many centuries before the Christian era, Votan, the oldest of the American legislators, established himself in the region watered by the rivers Tabasco and Usumasinta. It is near the sources of this latter river, in the highlands of Vera Paz, that cities of civilised Indians still exist, according to travellers who have recently visited the adjoining districts. However this may be, this river was the principal highway into the interior of Central America for the earliest civilised tribes, as it is now for the existing natives. Near the mouths of the rivers mentioned the ground is scarcely above the level of the sea, and is for the most part a recent alluvial formation. During the rainy season it is covered with water, and all intercourse between village and village takes place by water. Just where the land acquires a slight rise, Palenque, said to be the oldest city in Central America, was founded. At this time, according to the tradition, the low land was occupied by a lake. Votan, it seems, came from some foreign land, and found the whole of the country from Darien to California occupied by a barbarous people, who used the skins of wild beasts for clothing, caverns and huts made with branches for shelter, and wild fruits and roots, with raw flesh, for food. Votan announced to these people a knowledge of the Supreme Deity, who was at first worshipped as the God “of all truth.” At first no temples or altars were dedicated to him, and it was not until long after that Nezahualcoyotl erected a teocalli, or “house of God,” as it means in the Mexican language, and dedicated it “to the unknown God.” At a later period the religious ideas were considerably debased. In Votan’s time there seems to have been but one language prevalent over a large area, and this language was probably the Maya, which is the stock of many of the languages formerly in use among the natives, and is still the language of Yucatan. The people apparently formed tribes differing somewhat in manners, the most prominent of which tribes are referred to as the Quinames or giants. Votan and his companions arrived in large ships, wore long flowing garments, and spoke the Nahuatl language. These strangers married the daughters of the country, and established a settled form of government. According to one document, the year 955 B.c. is assigned to these events; but it is quite impracticable to give any trustworthy fixed date. Votan, it is said, wrote an account of the origin of the Indians, and of their immigration into America. He attempted to prove that they were the descendants of Imos, of the race of Chan, or the serpent. Votan made four voyages to his original country, and described the route he followed. On one of these voyages he visited the dwelling of the thirteen serpents, as also the ruins of an old building which had been erected by men for the purpose of reaching heaven. The people who lived in its vicinity told him it was the place where God had given to each family its particular language. Allusion is also made by him to certain mysteries like those of Egypt and Greece, of which traces were still discoverable amongst the civilised nations of America. On returning from his first voyage to his native country he found the people at Palenque had attempted to usurp his authority and overturn his power. Thereupon he parted his monarchy into four divisions. One of these had for its capital the town of Tulha, the ruins of which may be seen near Ocosingo in Chiapa. Votan also is the reputed founder of Tsequil, which was aftenvards called Ghowel, and the site of which is now occupied by a suburb of Ciudad Real. Some time, possibly not many years, after Votan, Zamna appeared in Yucatan. He introduced the Maya civilisation, founded the town of Mayapan, and called the country Maayha, or land without water, a term well applied to the extremity of the peninsula of Yucatan, where rivers are almost absent. Mayapan was once the capital of Yucatan, and in Zamna's time the sea covered the country to within a short distance of it. He lived to a great age, and during the later years of his life dwelt on the sea-coast, and was buried at this place. The spot became the site of a large temple erected to his honour, which was visited by pilgrims from great distances. A town sprung up around it called ltzamal, which is believed to correspond with the modern Isamal, now about 30 miles distant from the sea. The region to seaward is reported to be geologically very recent as land, and the remarkable absence of names of any antiquity in a country where almost every locality has its appellation is some confirmation of the traditions. The architectural character of the oldest towns also lends some support to the considerable antiquity claimed for them. The forest-covered ruins of Mexico and Central America present so many different architectural styles that it seems very probable they were built at different periods and by different people. Those which appear to be the oldest, and which are most uniform in style, are the substructures in Mayapan, some of the buildings in Tulha, many of those in Palenque, and others which occur in the country of the Lacandons.

The names of the successors to Votan are mentioned, but without details. One of the last of the dynasty was Chinax, in whose reign mention is made of the Nahuatl people. Not long after his death, this people, who were called Nahoas or Toltecs, obtained the dominion of the country, and the throne was occupied by Nahoa princes. They originally came from Huehue-Tlapallan (but where this country was situated is not known), having been induced to leave it in consequence of a revolution. This event seems to have occurred shortly before the Christian era. The journey to America from their native country was a long and painful one, and indicates that seas and lands intervened between them. The traditions report it to be in the far east, and that the first comers filled seven ships and disembarked at Tampico, near the mouth of the Panuco. The leader of the band bore the title of Quetzalcohuatl, and was the first known by that name. They then coasted along the shore as far as Tamoanclia, which place was evidently somewhere near the mouth of the Tabasco. In this district there was a tradition in the time of the Spaniards that twenty illustrious chiefs from the east landed there many centuries before, who had long flowing garments and large beards, of whom the principal was Cukulcan, a name which has the same meaning as Quetzalcohuatl. Quetzalcohuatl and his comrades soon obtained possession of the capital of the country, Xibalba, which is believed to be the same as Palenque. Their success induced others of the Nahoa nation to join the first colonists, and their power gradually spread over a large portion of Central America. The strangers, however, met with considerable resistance from the princes of Xibalba, who compelled the Nahoa to leave their country and disperse themselves over the surrounding region. This dispersion is stated to have occurred in a.d. 174. Before this date, the lunar calendar, so prevalent among the civilised nations of America, was introduced. It was one of these parties of Nahoa that established itself in Mexico, and founded many of the more important cities. They were called Olmeques, and were led by Olmecatl and Xelhua. The latter was one of Quetzal-cohuatl’s companions, and was once shipwrecked along with him. In order to commemorate his delivery he erected the great pyramid of Cholullan. Before the arrival of the Olmeques the valley of Mexico was inhabited by the Quinames or giants, and they continued to dwell in the mountains around for centuries after they had been driven from their native valley. The Totonacs, Mixtecas, and Othomis were the contemporaries, or possibly the [9:1:705] predecessors, of the Olmeques. The first mentioned people erected the pyramids of the Teotihuocan, or the City of the Gods, near Mexico. These tribes spoke a language quite distinct from the Nahuatl. The Totonacs placed the cradle of their race at Chicomoztoc, which was said to be far to the north; but the Othomis seem to have been in possession of the land from time immemorial. According to the traditions of the Quiches and other nations of North America, they originally came from Tulan. They allude to several places of this name. One was in the region of the setting sun and beyond the sea; and another, from which the Quiches came, was also in the direction of the setting sun and was apparently situated in California. In the descriptions given of the migrations from the more distant Tulan, which seem to have occurred at frequent intervals, each migration consisting of a moderate number of people, the difficulties and hardships are prominently noticed. They pointedly allude to the intense cold, to the long dark night, and to the sterility of the country, which allusions seem to point to travels in Arctic regions. The travellers were reduced to such extremities as to be obliged to suck juicy woods in order to sustain life. The name Chichimecs, which means suckers of maguey, given to the invading hordes from the north, may have some connection with this traditional fact. Chicomoztoc has been identified by some with the extensive ruins near the Rio Gila, in California. The history of these early nations is somewhat obscure, but it may be gathered from the preserved records that the worship of the sun and the practice of human sacrifice had nearly or wholly superseded the earlier and purer religions. Towards the end of the 7th century we first hear of the Chichimecs invading Mexico from the north. This name is a general one given to all invading hordes from the north, and is similar to that of barbarians applied to the people who invaded the Roman empire. The first invasion was by the Chichimecs-Culhuas, headed by Mixcohuatl Mazatzm. They commenced their march, or rather progress, from Chicomoztoc about 635, and reached the valley of Mexico about 40 years after. After many years’ fighting the Toltec empire was established in about 686; and from this period we enter upon more detailed and trustworthy historical ground. At first the government of the Toltecs was republican and theocratical, but it soon became monarchical, and Nauhyotzin was elected the first king. The most illustrious of his successors was Topiltzin Ceacatl Quetzalcohuatl, during whose reign the Toltec empire arrived at its most flourishing condition. According to tradition, the Toltecs were taller and of larger build than the existing Indians, were great runners, and were as white as Europeans. They carried many of the arts to a high state of perfection, such as weaving, building, jewelling, and making ornaments with the feathers of birds. There were astrologers and poets, sorcerers and philosophers and orators. They were well acquainted with the medical properties of plants, and were in the habit of recording in books their observations on diseases. Quetzalcohuatl’s reign was for the most part one of prolonged peace, but this peace was disturbed by the religious party who advocated human sacrifice, a practice which he used every effort to abolish. The rebellion becoming very formidable, Quetzalcohuatl left the country with a few chosen attendants, and founded a new Toltec empire on the plain of Huitzilapan, which corresponds with the one on which La Puebla now stands. This occurred in 895. The town of La Puebla stands on the site of the old Huitzilapan, and at the time of Quetzalcohuatl’s arrival it was said that the pyramids of Cholullan had existed from time immemorial, and had been built by the giants. According to this legend, the country was inhabited by giants, all but seven of whom were either destroyed by a great inundation or turned into fishes. These seven took refuge in a cave, and when the waters abated, one of them, named Xelhua, went to Cholullan, and built the famous pyramid to commemorate his escape. Quetzalcohuatl built a temple here, which he dedicated to the “creator of light,” and around this temple sprang up Cholullan, or the “town of the exile.” His disciples carried the Toltec civilisation into Oaxaca. After having reigned at Cholullan about ten years, during which period his subjects enjoyed all the blessings of peace, he was attacked by enemies again. Huemac had ascended the throne which he had vacated, and being jealous of Quetzalcohuatl’s power and prosperity, he suddenly resolved to march with his army against Cholullan. In order that the town might be spared the horrors of a siege, Quetzalcohuatl informed his priests of his intention to leave the place and to visit other countries. Accordingly he proceeded to the mouth of the Coatzocualco river, then entered a boat with four companions, and nothing more was heard of him. Huemac finding his enemy had escaped, wreaked his vengeance on Cholullan, and took up his residence there with a view to subjugating the surrounding districts. He also re-established the practice of human sacrifice. During Huemac’s absence from his kingdom of Tulan, Nauhyotl was elected king in his stead. A battle took place between the rivals, which resulted in the defeat and subsequent death of Huemac and the establishment of Nauhyotl’s power. His reign lasted for fifteen years, and as he was one of Quetzalcohuatl’s disciples, he governed according to similar principles, so that the reign was a prosperous one. His death occurred in 945. After this a series of disasters broke over the country, and these, with constant civil war, weakened the power of the empire in Anahuac. This soon became known to other nations, and led to the Chichimecs-Teotenancas leaving their homes in Texas and New Mexico to make an irruption upon the valley of Mexico. This occurred between 1041 and 1047. The internal discord continued, and the disorder was increased by the uprising of the sect of Ixcuinames, the devotees of which practised the most abominable rites. In the midst of this corruption another horde of barbarians, the Teo-Chichimecs, poured down from the north, and took possession of the country. The Toltec power rapidly declined, and the last king of the empire was Huemac Atecpanecatl, who after his dethronement lived for some years at Chapultepec, and died there in 1070.

According to the Guatemalan traditions, four individuals of the Tutul-Xius, a nation speaking a Nahuatl language, left their country of Tulapan, to the west of Zuyna, in a.d. 174, and arrived the same year at Chacnouitan, which seems to be the name for some place in Yucatan. In 258 another migration of Tutul-Xius occurred, the new colony being established in the province of Zyan-Caan, which is believed to be the district around Chetumal Bay. About the end of the 10th century, it is stated that a venerable personage arrived in Yucatan, called Cukulcan, who retrieved the falling fortunes of the Tutul-Xius. According to the Abbé Brasseur de Bourbourg, this personage was no other than the. Ceacatl Quetzalcohuatl whose departure from the Coatzocoalco river has already been mentioned. After reigning here ten years, he voluntarily abdicated the throne and left the country. According to a Mexican legend he went to Tlapallan, and died there. His successor transferred the capital of the Tutul-Xius from Mayapan to Uxmal, a town which seems to have been founded some centuries before, but which first rose to importance at this period, or near the end of the 10th century. Numerous temples and public buildings were erected, the ruins of which are now so abundantly met with in Yucatan. Artificial ponds or zonotes were constructed; and the number and magnitude of these indicate a large number of [9:1:706] towns as well as a thickly-populated country. At the present day they have all the appearance of being natural ponds, and indeed were long considered to be such, notwithstanding the repeated assertions of the Indians that they had been built by their ancestors, until chance led to the discovery that the muddy floor of one was entirely composed of flat stones, the interstices between which were stopped with a kind of clay not known in the neighbourhood. The centre was occupied by four artificial wells, the walls of which were formed of polished stones. Further research led to the discovery of numerous other zonotes. After the final fall of the Toltec empire there commenced the great movement of the northern tribes towards the south, a movement which continued throughout the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries. The movement consisted of a succession of migrations, and its starting-point appears to have been in New Mexico and California, which region was evidently the seat of a semi-civilised empire. Amongst these invading tribes was one which subsequently rose to high importance. The Aztecs, or Mexicans proper, were living at Atzlan in the 11th century, a country which was surrounded by water, and where their usual occupation was as boatmen and carriers of wood. Other tribes also lived in this region, which is believed to be that of Lower California. The Aztecs commenced their journey towards Mexico in 1090. In 1116 they reached Chicomoztoc, and in 1177 they entered Anahuac. Settlements were gradually established in the valley, towards which peoples of various nations converged from the south as well as the north. The numbers of the Aztecs were slowly augmented by fresh arrivals; but it was not until 1325 that they were able to lay the foundations of Mexico-Tenochtitlan, and thus to inaugurate their assumption of power. In 1464 the empire of the Tutul-Xius was overthrown. The Mexican empire had, however, acquired large proportions, and was conducted with a magnificence and splendour scarcely equalled by any other court in America, and this empire continued up to the time of the Spanish conquest.

The discovery of a continent so large that it may be said to have doubled the habitable world, is an event so much the more grand and interesting that nothing parallel to it can ever occur again in the history of mankind. America had of course been known to the barbarous tribes of eastern Asia for thousands of years; but it is singular that it should have been visited by one of the most enterprising nations of Europe five centuries before the time of Columbus without awakening the attention of either statesmen or philosophers. Iceland was discovered about 860, and colonised by the Norwegians in 874. About 50, or, according to other accounts, 100 years later, the same people planted colonies in Greenland. Into the disputes respecting the situation of these colonies we have not room to enter. Sir Charles Giesecke, a good authority, states that their ruins exist near the southern point of the peninsula. It is obvious that the same adventurous spirit which enabled these northern mariners to discover the southern extremity of the country, would not permit them to stop short without visiting what is now known to be the most habitable part of it—the western coast; and the fact has been established by an inscription in runic characters found on a stone four miles beyond Upernavik, at the 73d parallel, intimating that “Erling the son of Sigvat, and Enride Oddsoen, had cleared that place and raised a hillock on the Friday after Rogation day.” The marking of the date is indistinct, but it is supposed by Professor Rask, the translator, to be either 1135 or 1170; and the runic characters show at any rate that it was anterior to the Reformation, when this mode of writing was prohibited.^[11. Ferussac, Bulletin des Sciences Historiques, Julliet 1828.] Whoever looks at the map of Greenland, and reflects on the fact that the Norwegians must have been ascending through Davis’ Straits as high as the latitude mentioned, annually, perhaps for two or three centuries, will admit that, with half the spirit of enterprise which had carried them so far, the discovery of some portion of the west coast of these straits was almost unavoidable. Now, the position and direction of this coast once known, it required no great effort to trace it southwards to Labrador and Newfoundland. We mention these particulars because Mr Murray, one of the few who have denied the discovery of America by the Norwegians, grounded his disbelief chiefly on the hypothesis that the colonies and the navigation of that people at the period alluded to were confined to the east coast of Greenland.

In 1001 an Icelander, sailing to Greenland, was driven away by a tempest far to the south-west, where he saw a level country covered with wood. The wind abating, he turned his course homeward, and on his arrival gave such a flattering account of the country he had seen as induced Lief, the son of the founder of the Greenland colony, to undertake a voyage thither. Lief and Bjorn, who sailed together, first reached a rocky island, to which they gave the name of Helluland; then a low country, thickly wooded, which they called Markland; and some days afterwards they found trees loaded with fruits on the banks of a river. They spent the winter in the country; and one of them, who was a German, having found wild vines growing, they called it Vinland. They had some intercourse and traded for furs with a people who came in leathern boats, and were called Skroelings, from their dwarfish size. A colony was planted, and remained for many years in the country, the situation of which is indicated by a fact casually mentioned, that the sun remained nine hours above the horizon at the shortest day. This indicates the 41st parallel of latitude; and the actual latitude of Rhode Island, the country which every collateral circumstance would lead us to fix upon as the seat of the colony, is from 41° to 42°. The Skraelings were of course the Esquimaux.^[12. See the curious work of Torfaeus called Vinlandia A ntiqua, Hafn, 1705; and the valuable Antiquitates Americanae, published at Copenhagen in 1887. Also Humboldt’s Cosmos, vol. ii. p. 233, Sabine’s transl. 1848.] The vine appears to be the fox grape ( Vitis vulpina), which grows wild in that part of America. Only a few unimportant particulars respecting the settlement are preserved; but it was probably abandoned or destroyed, like the Greenland colonies, of which it was an offset. The account, though meagre, is distinct and consistent. Its authenticity can scarcely be disputed; and it is almost equally obvious that the country it refers to under the name of Vinland is in the vicinity of Rhode Island. A conclusion resting on such strong grounds scarcely requires to be supported by the high authority of Humboldt and Malte-Brun. That the colony disappeared, and that the discoveries made were not prosecuted farther, are not circumstances which will shake the credit of the narrative in the minds of those who know the numerous reverses which befell the early colonies in New England and other parts of America. The hostilities of the Skraelings was no doubt the principal cause of the abandonment of the colony. The Norsemen describe Vinland as a rich country, with a delightful climate. Helluland, Markland, and Vinland, were no doubt regarded as countries either connected with or similar to Greenland, the flattering descriptions of which, given by the first discoverers were sadly belied by later experience.^[13. Μ. Rafn, a Dane, who was much engaged in researches respecting these early voyages, announced that he had ascertained, from original documents, various facts previously unknown; among others, that America (first discovered in 985) was repeatedly visited by the Icelanders in the llth, 12th, and 13th centuries; that the embouchure of the St Lawrence, and in particular the bay of Gaspe, was their principal station; that they had penetrated along the coast as far south as Carolina; and that they introduced a knowledge of Chris tianity among the natives. The announcement was contained in a letter addressed to a person in Washington, and published in Nile’s Register (Baltimore), in November 1828. But Μ. Rafn afterwards found reason to change his opinion as to the site of the Icelandic colony, and he latterly considered that it was at the mouth of the River Taunton, which falls into the sea in Narraganset Bay, at the north end of Rhode Island.] The interest excited by the obscure accounts [9:1:707] of these countries was probably such as the announcement of a new island eastward of Spitzbergen would produce at the present day. No reasonable doubt can exist, however, that the north-eastern portions of America (considering Greenland as a distinct country) were familiarly known to the Norwegians in the eleventh century.

The obscure allusions of Aristotle, Plato, and Seneca, to a country hid in the Western Ocean, must have derived fresh importance from the discovery of the Canary Isles, Madeira, and the Azores in the early part of the fifteenth century. The love of maritime adventure was excited by these events; and among the active spirits who were attracted to nautical life by the career of distinction which was then opened up, was Christopher Columbus. Our limits do not permit us to enter into details respecting this great man, an outline of whose life will be found under the proper heading. He had received a learned education, and the study of the geographical systems then in vogue impressed him with a strong conviction that a voyage to India by a course directly westward was quite practicable with the degree of nautical science which his contemporaries possessed. From the old and imperfect maps of Ptolemy he was led to believe that the parts of the globe known to the ancients embraced 15 hours, or 225 degrees of longitude, which exceeds the truth by more than one-third. The discovery of the Azores on the west side had lengthened the space by one hour; and the accounts gleaned by Marco Polo in Asia induced him to think that the isles connected with this continent stretched out so far to the eastward that their distance from Europe could not be great. Columbus was, however, without the fortune necessary to fit out ships; and when he attempted to interest some of the princes of those times in his project, he encountered neglects and difficulties which would have exhausted the patience of any mind less ardent than his own. At length, after many delays and discouragements, Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain supplied him with three small vessels, two of them only half-decked; and in this little armament, accompanied by 120 men, he set sail from the port of Palos on the 3d of August 1492. He proceeded first to the Canary Isles, where he was detained three weeks in repairing one of his vessels. On leaving these isles he entered on a region of ocean where all was mystery. The trade-wind, however, bore him steadily along, and the labour of the ships proceeded cheerfully, till the increasing length of the voyage, the failure of prognostics which had from time to time kept alive the hopes of the crew, and various circumstances interpreted by their superstition as evil omens, produced a mutinous spirit, which all the address and authority of Columbus would not have been able to quell had the discovery of land happened one day later than it did. Columbus, says Humboldt, on sailing westward of the meridian of the Azores, through an unexplored sea, sought the east of Asia by the western route, not as an adventurer, but according to a pre-conceived and steadfastly-pursued plan. He had on board the sea-chart which the Florentine astronomer Toscanelli had sent him in 1477. If he had followed the chart, he would have held a more northern course, along a parallel of latitude from Lisbon. Instead of this, in the hope of reaching Zipangu (Japan), he sailed for half the distance in the latitude of Gomera, one of the Canary Islands. Uneasy at not having discovered Zipangu, which, according to his reckoning, he should have met with 216 nautical miles more to the east, he after a long debate yielded to the opinion of Martin Alonzo Pinzon, and steered to the southwest. The effect of this change in his course curiously exemplifies the influence of small and apparently trivial events on the world’s history. If Columbus, resisting the counsel of Pinzon, had kept his original route, he would have entered the warm current of the Gulf Stream, have reached Florida, and thence perhaps been carried to Cape Hatteras and Virginia. The result would probably have been to give the present United States a Roman Catholic Spanish population, instead of a Protestant English one, a circumstance of immeasurable importance. Pinzon was guided in forming his opinion by a flight of parrots towards the south-west. Never, says the Prussian philosopher, had the flight of birds more important consequences. It may be said to have determined the first settlements on the new continent, and its distribution between the Latin and Germanic races. It was on the 12th of October that the western world revealed itself to the wondering eyes of Columbus and his companions. What a triumph for this extraordinary man, who had treasured in his breast for twenty years, amidst neglect, discouragement, and ridicule, the grand truth which his own incomparable skill, wisdom, and firmness had now demonstrated in the eyes of an incredulous world! The spot which he first touched was Guanahani, or Watling Island, as was suggested by Munoz in 1793, and proved by Mr R. H. Major in 1870. After spending nearly three months in visiting Cuba, Hispaniola, and other isles, he returned to Spain. He made three other voyages, and in the second coasted along a part of South America, which he rightly judged to be a continent from the volume of water poured into the sea by the Orinoco. But he died ignorant of the real extent and grandeur of his discoveries, still believing that the countries he had made known to Europe belonged to that part of Eastern Asia which the ancients called India. Hence the name of West Indies which the tropical islands and part of the continent have ever since received.

We should extend this article to an unreasonable length were we to describe in detail the discoveries and settlements made by the several nations of Europe in America. We shall therefore confine ourselves to a very brief chronological notice of the more important events.

1495. The first place in which the Spaniards established their power was the large island of Hayti or Hispaniola, which was inhabited by a numerous race of Indians of a mild and gentle character, a third part of whom are said to have perished within two or three years after the Spaniards conquered them.

1497. John Cabot discovered Newfoundland June 24th, and coasted along the shores of North America to Florida.

1498. Columbus first saw the mainland, May 30.

1500. Cabral, a Portuguese, visited the coast of Brazil, and discovered the mouth of the Amazon. It was probably colonised before 1515. In 1500, too, Cortereal touched at Labrador.

1508. Vincent Pinzon is said to have entered the Rio de la Plata. It was in the same year that the Spaniards, finding the aborigines too weak for the labour of the mines in Hayti, first imported negroes from Guinea, and thus laid the foundation of a traffic which continued to disgrace the civilisation of Europe for three centuries.

1511. Diego Columbus conquered the island of Cuba with 300 soldiers, of whom he did not lose one.

1513. Balboa crossed the Isthmus of Darien with 290 men, and discovered the South Sea.

1519. Hernando Cortes sailed from Cuba with 11 ships and 550 men, and landed on the coast of Mexico, which had been discovered in the previous year. The conquest of the empire was finished in 1521 by 950 Spaniards, assisted by a vast number of the Indians of Tlascala.
[9:1:708]

1531. Peru invaded by Pizarro, and conquered in little more than one year, with a force of 1000 men.

1535. Jacques Cartier, a Frenchman, discovers the Gulf of St Lawrence.

1535. Mendoza, a Spaniard, with 2000 followers, founds Buenos Ayres, and conquers all the country as far as Potosi, at which silver mines were discovered nine years after.

1537. Cortes discovers California.

1541. Chili conquered; Santiago founded; Orellana sails from the sources of the Rio Napo down the Amazon to the Atlantic.

1578, New Albion, on the north-west coast of America, discovered by Sir Francis Drake.

1586. The Spaniards found St Thomas’ Island, in Guiana.

1587. Davis’ Straits and Cumberland Islands discovered by John Davis.

1604. De Monts, a Frenchman, founded the first settlement in Nova Scotia, then called Acadie.

1607. After many ineffectual attempts during more than twenty years, the first permanent settlement of the English in North America was made this year, on the banks of the James River, in Virginia.

1608. Quebec founded by the French, who had had a small neglected colony in Canada from 1542.

1611. Newfoundland colonised by the English; a Dutch colony established at Hudson’s River.

1614. New York founded.

1618. Baffin penetrates to the 78th degree of latitude, in the bay which bears his name.

1620. The first English colony established in New England at Plymouth. It was in 1619 that the first negroes were imported into Virginia. They were brought by a Dutch vessel.

1635. A French colony established in Guiana.

1655. Jamaica conquered by the English.

1664. The Dutch colonies on Hudson’s River capitulate to the English.

1666. The Buccaneers begin their depredations on the Spanish colonies.

1682. William Penn establishes a colony in Pennsylvania. La Salle takes possession of Louisiana in the name of the French king.

1698. A colony of 1200 Scots planted at Darien. In the following year the settlement was attacked by the Spaniards, and abandoned.

1733. Georgia colonised by the English.

1760. Canada and all the other French settlements in North America conquered by the English.

We must pause at this point to give a very short account of the colonial system introduced by the principal European nations who occupied extensive tracts of the new world. The English settlements extended from the 31st to the 50th degree on the east coast, and were divided into 15 or 16 provinces. The colonists had carried the love of liberty characteristic of their countrymen with them; and after many struggles with their British rulers, all the provinces, with one or two exceptions, were permitted to enjoy a form of government extremely popular. The executive power was vested in a governor appointed by the king. He was assisted by a council, which sometimes conjoined the functions of a Privy Council and a House of Peers. The people were represented by a House of Assembly, consisting of persons chosen by the freeholders in the country parts, and the householders or corporations of towns. The governor could levy no money without the consent of the House of Assembly: the British parliament, however, claimed, but scarcely ever exercised, the privilege of imposing taxes upon the colonists without consulting them. Against this assumption of power the local legislatures always protested as an infringement of their rights. The vessels of foreign states were not permitted to trade with the colonies; but the colonists were allowed to trade in their own ships with one another, with the mother country, and, to a limited extent, with foreign states. Their taxes, which were always small, were all consumed in defraying internal expenses; and, compared with any other people in the new world, they enjoyed an unexampled degree of commercial and political liberty. It was the growing prosperity of the colonies and the increasing debt of the mother country, which induced the British ministers, for the first time, in 1764, to attempt raising a revenue in America, for purposes not colonial. The experiment was made by imposing a stamp-duty on newspapers and commercial writings. The sum was trifling; but the Americans, far-sighted and jealous of their rights, saw in it the introduction of a principle which deprived them of all security for their property. The people declared themselves against it as one man, in local assemblies, and by petitions and publications of all kinds. The ministers became uneasy, and repealed the tax; but, as a salve to the pride of the mother country, a declaratory Act was passed, asserting her right “to bind the colonies in all cases whatsoever.” The idea of raising a revenue in America was not renounced, but another mode was to be tried. Duties were laid on glass, colours, paper, and tea, and were met by an opposition in the colonies still more zealous and determined. The British ministers, irritated, but wavering in their purpose, dropped all the taxes but that on tea, and commenced at the same time a series of alarming innovations. They closed the port of Boston, changed the charter of the province, placed judges and juries on a footing to render them more subservient to the views of the government, and introduced a strong military force to overawe the people. On the other side, the colonists passed resolutions not to import or consume any British goods, and hastened to supply themselves with powderand arms. Blood was at length shed in April 1775, at the village of Lexington; and in the following year the American Congress published their celebrated declaration of independence. We shall not enter into the details of the war, which was closed in 1782. Suffice it to say that, on the part of the Americans, it rested on high grounds; it was a war to vindicate a principle—for the practical grievance was admitted to be slight; and it was conducted with a regard to humanity of which there are few examples in history.

The Spanish possessions in America before the revolution formed nine distinct governments, all constructed on the same plan and independent of one another. Four of these, of the first rank, were vice-royalties, viz., Mexico, Peru, La Plata, and New Granada; and five were captaingeneralships, viz., Yucatan, Guatemala, Chili, Venezuela, and the island of Cuba. The government was vested in the viceroy or captain-general, who was held to represent the king, and to enjoy all his prerogatives within the colony. But in these countries, as in others where the supreme power is apparently unlimited, it was indirectly restrained by the influence of the courts of justice, corporations, and other public bodies. The royal audiencias or supreme courts, composed of Spaniards nominated by the crown, had extensive judicial powers, and were independent of the viceroys. The cabildos or municipalities, and the fueros or corporations (similar to our guilds), also possessed considerable privileges, which derived security and importance from long prescription. Lastly, the clergy, who were numerous and rich, necessarily possessed great influence among a superstitious[9:1:709] people. The vices naturally inherent in the colonial system existed in full force in the Spanish American dominions. There was tolerable security for all classes except the miserable Indians, who were regarded and treated precisely as beasts of burden, out of whose toil and sufferings a provision as ample as possible was to be extracted, first to supply the wants of the royal treasury, and next to provide for and satisfy the cupidity of a shoal of do-nothing public officers and priests. Edicts were indeed issued for the protection of the Indians, and persons appointed to enforce them; but these were feeble correctives of the evils rooted in the system, and not unfrequently increased their weight. The Indians, after the conquest, were at first slaves; they paid a capitation tax to the crown, and their labour was entirely at the disposal of their lord. This system was modified from time to time; but all the changes introduced down to the revolution did not release them from their state of vassalage. They still continued liable, in a less or greater degree, to the performance of compulsory labour, under the orders of persons against whom they had no protection, This was an enormous grievance; but, what was equally bad, being held incompetent in law to buy or sell, or enter into any pecuniary engagement beyond the value of a few shillings, without the agency of white men, the swarm of public functionaries had an unlimited power of interfering in their concerns, of vexing, harassing, and plundering them, under the forms of law. The memoir of Ulloa, long buried amidst the Spanish archives, with various other documents published since the revolution, depicts acts of extortion, perfidy, cruelty, and oppression practised upon the Indians which have rarely been paralleled. Men rose to affluence in offices without salaries; and the priests rivalled the laymen in the art of extracting money from those whom they ought to have protected. As the sole aim of the Spaniards in the colonies was to enrich themselves, so the government at home made all its acts and regulations subordinate to the grand object of raising a revenue. Spain retained in her hands the whole trade of the colonies, and guarded her monopoly with the most severe penalties. The price of all European commodities was enhanced three, four, or six fold, in America. The colonists were not allowed to manufacture or raise any article which the mother country could supply; they were compelled to root up their vines and olives; and for a long period one colony was not even permitted to send a ship to another. To support such a system it was necessary to keep the people in profound ignorance, and to cherish prejudices and superstition. The schools were extremely few, and permission to establish them was often refused, even in towns where the Spaniards and Creoles were numerous. The importation of books, except books of Catholic devotion, was rigorously prohibited. Even the more grave and dry sciences, such as botany, chemistry, and geometry, were objects of suspicion. And the more effectually to crush all mental activity, natives of America could rarely obtain leave to go abroad, to seek in foreign countries what was denied them in their own. On the other hand, the priests, sharing in the spoil, filled the minds of the people with childish superstitions, as a means of confirming their own power, and employed the terrors of religion to teach them patience under oppression. To create a race of servants devoted to its purposes, the court bestowed all offices, from the highest to the lowest, on natives of the peninsula exclusively. The wisdom of the plan seems questionable, but that it was adhered to with wonderful pertinacity is certain. “It was the darling policy of Spain,” says Mr Ward, “to disseminate through her American dominions a class of men distinct from the people in feelings, habits, and interests, taught to consider themselves as a privileged caste, and to regard their own existence as intimately connected with that of the system of which they were the principal support.” With all those means and appliances, it is extraordinary that Spain should have been able to uphold for three centuries a system in which the interests of so many millions of human beings were so habitually and unrelentingly sacrificed. It was the course of events, much more than its own inherent weakness, which ultimately caused its subversion.

After the seizure of Ferdinand and the elevation of Joseph Buonaparte to the throne of Spain, orders were dispatched to all the colonies with the view of securing their obedience to the new dynasty. The men in office were generally disposed to submit, but the treacherous conduct of the French excited a universal hatred of their cause among the people; and when the regency established in Spain presented the semblance of a patriot government, the loyalty of the Americans blazed forth, and poured large contributions of money into the hands of Ferdinand’s adherents. The weak and suspicious conduct of the regency, however, and its subserviency to the grasping spirit of the merchants of Cadiz, at length alienated the colonists, and roused them to take measures for their own security. But the diversity of views and interests among the colonists rendered the course to be adopted a matter of some delicacy. Ferdinand, being a prisoner, was, politically speaking, a nonentity. Napoleon’s brother was clearly an usurper, odious to, and rejected by, the mass of the Spanish people. The regency, shut up in Cadiz, without troops or revenue, was but a phantom; and the little power it had was so employed as to raise doubts whether its members were not secretly in league with the enemy. In these circumstances, when the only government to which the colonists owed allegiance had fallen into abeyance, the wisest course they could have pursued was to declare themselves independent. This would at once put a stop to the machinations of France, which they dreaded, and prevent the regency from compromising or sacrificing their interests by its weakness or treachery. The Spaniards, however, who occupied all public situations, were averse to a change which they foresaw must lead to the downfall of their power. This was perfectly understood by the other classes; and in the first movements which took place in the different colonies nothing was said derogatory to the supremacy of Spain, though independence was clearly aimed at. By spontaneous efforts of the people “juntas of government” were formed, at Caraccas in April 1809, at La Paz in Upper Peru in July, at Quito in August, at Santa Fe and at Buenos Ayres in May 1810, and at Santiago in Chili in September the same year. In 1810, also, the first insurrection broke out in Mexico. The colonists unluckily had been too long the slaves of superstition and tyranny to be fit for conducting so bold an experiment; and after a struggle, which was generally short, but almost everywhere bloody, the juntas were all put down except in Colombia and Buenos Ayres. But in the stir and tumult of the contest old prejudices had received a shock; and the seeds of political change had struck their roots too deep in the soil to be eradicated. A desultory war was carried on for six years between Buenos Ayres and Upper Peru, with little advantage on either side. At length, in 1817, the former state, which had assumed the style of an independent republic four years before, sent an army across the Andes to Chili, under General San Martin, and defeated the Spaniards at Chacabuco. A second victory, gained at Maipo in April 1818, led to the entire subversion of the Spanish power in this colony. The war was now transferred to Peru, where the Spaniards continued [9:1:710] to lose ground, till the decisive battle of Ayacucho put an end to their power in December 1824. Rodil and Olaveta, with the obstinacy of their nation, held out for some months longer, when every chance of success was gone; but after the surrender of Callao in January 1826, the Spanish flag no longer waved on any spot in the land of the Incas.

In New Granada and Venezuela the struggle was more bloody, variable, and protracted than in any other part of South America. As this portion of the dominions of Spain was comparatively easy of access, and from its central position was in some measure the key to the whole, she made immense efforts for its preservation. No less than ten thousand troops were sent out to it within the course of one year. The patriots, on the other hand, possessed advantages here, in the greater intelligence of the population, and the easy intercourse with the West Indies. From 1809, when juntas were established in Caraccas and Quito, to the surrender of Porto Cabello in 1823, the vicissitudes of the war were numerous and extraordinary. The patriots were repeatedly on the eve of a complete triumph, and as often the state of their affairs seemed nearly hopeless. But the spirit of resistance never was entirely subdued. The cause was rooted in the hearts of the people, and was insensibly gaining ground even during its reverses. To attempt the faintest outline of the military operations would lead us beyond our proper limits. It is enough to state that the decisive victory of Carabobo, gained by the patriots in 1819, gave them an ascendancy which they never afterwards lost; but the Spaniards, according to their custom, continued to maintain the contest as long as they had a foot of land in the country, and were only finally expelled in 1823.

In Mexico the revolutionary movement began at Dolores in 1810, and soon wore a very prosperous appearance; but the weakness or false pride of the Creoles, who were cajoled into the ranks of their oppressors the old Spaniards, armed against the patriots those who should have been their firmest supporters, and by one or two mischances the force of the independent party was ruined in November 1815, when Morelos, their able leader, was taken prisoner and executed. For six years after this period many guerilla bands maintained themselves in the provinces, and greatly annoyed the Spaniards; but they did not act in concert, and no congress or junta professing to represent the Mexican people existed. Even during this interval the desire for independence was making great progress among the population; but the establishment of a constitutional government in Spain in 1820, and its extension to the colonies, gave a new aspect to the affairs of Mexico. The viceroy Apodaca, while outwardly yielding obedience to the new system, was silently taking measures to effect its overthrow; but he mistook the character of the agent he employed. This person, the celebrated Iturbide, turned his own arms against him, proclaimed a constitution under the name of “the three guarantees,” and put an end to the dominion of Spain in 1821, almost without bloodshed. Iturbide, who had nothing in view but his own aggrandisement, called a congress, which he soon dissolved after getting himself proclaimed emperor. His usurpation kindled a spirit of resistance. He was exiled in 1823, made a new attempt on the liberties of his country in 1824, was taken prisoner, and expiated his crimes by a military death within a few weeks after he landed.

Guatemala was the last portion of the American continent which threw off the Spanish yoke. In 1821 the persons in office assembled and formed a junta. Divisions arose, which were fomented by the intrusion of a Mexican army sent by Iturbide. This force, however, was beaten, and an elective assembly called, which declared the country independent, and established a constitution in July 1823. Spain now retains none of her possessions in the new world but Cuba and Porto Rico.

The government of Brazil was conducted by the Portuguese on a system extremely similar to that of the Spanish colonies. The monopoly which the mother country retained of the commerce of the colony was equally rigorous; the restrictions on its internal industry as severe; and the same means were employed to keep the people in a state of pupilage and ignorance. Down to 1806 a single printing-press had never existed in Brazil. In 1807, when the emperor Napoleon had resolved to possess himself of Portugal, and if possible to get the royal family into his power, the king, seeing no other means of escaping from the clutches of his enemy, embarked with his suite in several ships, and sailed for Brazil, where he arrived in January 1808. He was received with joy by the colonists, who anticipated great benefits from his residence, of which they were not disappointed. One by one the fetters of colonial dependence fell off. Within a few months printing-presses and newspapers were established, the ports were opened to the trade of all nations, and the people were invited and encouraged to prosecute all those branches of internal industry from which they had till now been interdicted. To crown and secure these advantages, Brazil was declared an independent kingdom in 1815, subject to the crown of Portugal, but entitled to its separate administration and its own laws. The revolutionary spirit pervading the Spanish colonies now found its way into Brazil, and produced an insurrection at Pernambuco in 1817. It was soon subdued, but received a new impulse from the constitutional systems suddenly introduced into Spain and Portugal in 1820. To quiet the popular feeling, it was announced that the Portuguese constitution would be extended to Brazil. Before this had been done, however, the old king had sailed for Europe, leaving his son Dom Pedro to rule in his absence. The people now discovered, or believed, that the object of the king was to degrade Brazil again to the rank of a colony, and to restore the old system in all its rigour. Meetings were held, and resolutions adopted to maintain the independence of the country at all hazards; and the patriots, gaining confidence by degrees, called loudly for the establishment of a legislature, and besought Dorn Pedro to put himself at the head of the independent government. Ambition or policy induced Pedro to listen to the solicitation: in 1822 he was proclaimed emperor, and had his own title and the independence of Brazil acknowledged by his father three years afterwards. A representative system was at the same time introduced. An unlucky war now arose with Buenos Ayres, which weakened both countries; but it was at length terminated in 1828 by the recognition of the disputed territory as an independent state under the title of the Banda Oriental.

Having finished this brief notice of the series of revolutions which broke the fetters of America, we shall now give a very short sketch of the new political order of things which has arisen out of these changes, referring for a detailed account of the several states to the articles appropriated to them in the different volumes of the present work.

America, with its islands, embraces at present (1874) twenty-one independent states, and various colonies belonging to six European powers. The former are—1. The United States of North America; 2. Brazil; 3. Mexico; 4. Venezuela; 5. Colombia; 6. Ecuador or Quito; 7. Peru; 8. Bolivia or Upper Peru; 9. Chili; 10. La Plata, or the Argentine Republic; 11. Uruguay; 12. Paraguay: [9:1:711] 13. Patagonia; 14. Costa Rica, 15. Mosquitia; 16. Guatemala; 17. Honduras; 18. Nicaragua; 19. San Salvador; 20. Hayti; 21. San Domingo. The colonies belong to Britain, Denmark, Sweden, Holland, France, and Spain. Patagonia, is merely the geographical name of a district of Chili, occupied by independent tribes of Indians; Mosquitia, or the Mosquito coast, is a small Indian state ruled by a native king; and Hayti is a negro republic proclaimed in 1867. For detailed accounts of these various states and colonies we refer to the articles under the proper heads. At present we must confine ourselves to a brief notice of the more important ones.

The United States were colonised a century later than Spanish America; but their brilliant and rapid progress shows in a striking light how much more the prosperity of nations depends on moral than on physical advantages. The North Americans had no gold mines, and a territory of only indifferent fertility, covered with impenetrable woods; but they brought with them intelligence, industry, a love of freedom, habits of order, and a pure and severe morality. Armed with these gifts of the soul, they have converted the wilderness into a land teeming with life and smiling with plenty; and they have built up a social system so pre-eminently calculated to promote the happiness and moral improvement of mankind, that it has truly become the “envy of nations.” The republic is bounded on the north by Canada, on the south-west by Mexico, and on the other sides by the sea. At present (1874) it consists of thirty-seven states, with one district and eleven territories, which latter will be converted into states as soon as each acquires a sufficient population. The extent of the country, including the Indian lands stretching west to the Pacific Ocean, over which it claims a right of pre-emption, embraces 3,603,844 square miles of land. The agriculture of the United States partakes to some extent of a tropical character. The sugarcane is cultivated in Louisiana, Florida, and other states as far north as the latitude of 31 ½°. Cotton is raised in all the south-east states S. of the 37th parallel, and tobacco chiefly in the middle states. Wheat succeeds in the middle and northern states, and maize thrives in every part of the Union. Agriculture is conducted with considerable skill; but the “high farming” practised in England would not pay in America, where money is of much value and land of little. Scarcely any portion of the soil is rented in the United States: the farmers are almost universally proprietors; and λvhen their property is extensive, which rarely happens, it is soon broken into small occupancies under the law of equal division. The advance the Americans have made in manufactures may be judged of from the fact that in 1870, according to the census then taken, there were upwards of 35,000 operatives employed in 969 cotton factories, and 77,870 in 1938 manufactories of woollen goods. The iron industries gave employment to upwards of 140,000hands, the iron produced in the country reaching nearly two millions of tons. In the useful arts generally America is on a level with France and England. The internal commerce of the United States is conducted with extraordinary spirit. The amount of capital expended on roads, canals, harbours, bridges, and other public works, is very great. The length of the lines of railway open for traffic now exceeds 70,000 miles, and is rapidly increasing. The extent of the foreign trade of the country, and the amount of its shipping, place it next to Great Britain in the list of commercial nations.

The population of the United States in 1870 was by census 38,558,371

In 1800 it was 5,308,483

Increase in 70 years 33,249,888

Since 1800 the rate of increase has been remarkably uniform at nearly 3½ per cent. per annum. In 1871 the number of immigrants was 346,938, of whom 198,843 migrated from the British Isles, 107,201 from Germany, 6030 from China, and the remainder from British North America, Sweden, Norway, France, Austria, Italy, Switzerland, Denmark, and Russia.

Slaves were first introduced in 1619. In 1775 slavery was abolished in Rhode Island; in 1780. Massachusetts abolished it; then numerous northern states followed, and in December 1865 slavery was abolished throughout the United States. By subsequent amendment of the constitution all negroes were admitted to all the privileges of citizenship. Thus it was enacted on March 30, 1870, that “no discrimination should be made in the United States among the citizens of the United States in the exercise of their elective franchise, or in the right to hold office in any state, on account of race, colour, nativity, property, education, or creed.” Every person born or naturalised in the United States is recognised to be a citizen thereof.

The American government is a pure representative democracy in which the people are recognised as the fountain of all power; and the sole object of all its mechanism is to give effect to their deliberate opinions. The federal government and the governments of the separate states are constituted on the same plan. The legislature consists in every case of two bodies, a House of Representatives chosen for one or two years, and a Senate for a period varying from two years to six—all chosen by popular election, except in the case of the Federal Senate, which is elected by the legislatures of the thirty-seven states. The President holds his office for four years, but is occasionally re-elected for four years more.

The characteristic facts in the condition of America are the non-existence of titles, of privileged classes, of corporations in our sense of the term, of a landed aristocracy, of mendicity except to a very limited extent, and of an endowed church; the cheapness and efficiency of its government, the universality of education, the omnipresence of its periodical press, the high feeling of self-respect which exists in the very humblest classes, and the boundless spirit of enterprise which pervades all classes of society. The higher classes are less polished than in England, the middle are perhaps less carefully instructed; but the American people, taken collectively, are at least as well educated and have as much intelligence and manliness of character as any other nation in the world.

In 1867 the territory formerly known as Russian America was purchased by the United States, and called Alaska. It occupies the north-west corner of the continent, and extends along the coast as far south as Mount Elias, where it is bounded by British Columbia and the southern end of Prince of Wales Island, in 54° 40' N. It comprises an area of about 570,390 square miles. Furs and fish are the most valuable commodities. Sitka is the capital. It is situated on an island in 57° 2' 45" N. and 135° 17' 10" W. It has a population of over 2000 persons. The Yukon river, which is about 2000 miles long, flows through the territory.

British North America is bounded on the south by the United States, on the north by the Arctic Ocean, and on the west by Alaska. In 1867 the provinces of Ontario (formerly Upper Canada), Quebec (formerly Lower Canada), Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Manitoba (formerly Hudson’s Bay Territory), and British Columbia, were united under the title of “The Dominion of Canada,” while Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island still remained independent. The executive power is vested in the sovereign of the British empire, but is carried out by a Governor-General and Privy Council. The Parliament consists of a Senate and a House of Commons. The senators are nominated for life [9:1:712] by the Governor-General, and are 75 in number. The members of the House of Commons are elected by the people in the proportion of one member for each 17,000 souls. The seat is retainable for five years, and each member is allowed a salary and travelling expenses. Ottawa is the capital of the Dominion. According to the latest census, taken on April 3, 1871, the area and population of the several provinces are as under :—
[table]

In 1871 the Dominion had 2854 miles of railway open, 1173 miles in preparation, and 3000 miles for which concessions had been granted by the government. A line has been projected to extend from Lake Superior to the Pacific Ocean.

Brazil is the largest state in South America, and enjoys the greatest combination of natural advantages. It is bounded on the south, west, and north, by La Plata, Paraguay, Uruguay, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, and Guiana. Embracing an area of 3,100,000 English miles, it is nearly as large as Europe, and is capable of supporting a much greater population. Its climate is probably cooler and more salubrious than that of any other extensive tropical country; and every part of its soil is rich and fruitful, as its magnificent forests and the exuberance and boundless variety of its vegetable productions attest. Its commencal advantages are admirable. No country in the new world has the same facilities for carrying on intercourse with Europe and with all its neighbours. The Amazon, with its numerous branches, the Parana, the Tocantins, the St Francisco, and other streams, supply the most remote parts of the interior with easy means of communication with the sea. Brazil possesses iron, copper, and probably all the other metals; but her mines of gold and diamonds are remarkably rich. Her most valuable productions for exportation are cotton, sugar, coffee, hides, tobacco, vanilla, dyewoods, aromatic plants, timber, &c. Her commerce is much greater than that of all the Spanish colonies put together. The Brazilians are lively, irritable, hospitable, but ignorant, superstitious, and rather inclined to indolence. Their acquisition of independence in 1822, however, worked like a charm, and produced an extraordinary change in their industry, opinions, and modes of thinking. There are numerous schools, but although the education is gratuitous, they arc not well attended. The advance literature has made will be allowed to be great when it is remembered that printing was unknown in the country in 1807. According to the constitution introduced by Dorn Pedro, the legislature consists of a Senate of 52 members, who hold their places for life, and a House of Congress of 107, elected by the people for four years; upon the acts of both of which bodies the emperor has a negative. The members of the lower house are chosen by elections of two stages. The householders of a parish meet and appoint one elector for every thirty of their number, and the electors thus chosen meet in districts and choose the deputies. The members of both houses receive salaries. The executive power is invested in the emperor assisted by a ministry and a council of state.

The population of Brazil amounted to 3,G71,558, according to returns published in 1818, and procured probably for the purpose of taxation. This was exclusive of the wandering Indians. Tn 1823 it was estimated at 4,000,000 by Humboldt. Μ. Schaeffer carries it to 5,700,000, and an estimate for 1867 makes it 9,858,000, comprising 8,148,000 free persons, and 1,674,000 slaves. The census taken in 1872 gives a population of 10,095,978, including 1,683,864 slaves.

Brazil, unlike the Spanish American provinces, has remained, subject to its ancient sovereign; and its government, from being colonial, has become imperial and independent, without any violent revolution. The result has been greatly in favour of the peace and prosperity of the country. See Brazil.

The portion of South America next to the isthmus includes the states of Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador. From 1820 till 1831, when a separation took place, it formed one state under the name of Colombia; which name has recently been assumed by the republic long known as New Granada. The territories of these three states are bounded on the south by Peru, on the south-east and east by Brazil and Guiana, on the other sides by the sea, and embrace an area of 1,020,000 square English miles. The soil is fruitful and the climate salubrious, except along the coast and in a few other low situations. The eastern part consists chiefly of the llanos or steppes of the Orinoco, which are very hot; the western, of the mountain ridges of the Andes, which support tracts of table-land where the blessings of a temperate climate are enjoyed, and the cerealia of Europe can be successfully cultivated. The tropical vegetation extends to the height of 4000 feet; from 4000 to 9000 is the region where wheat, barley, and leguminous plants thrive. Above the level of 9000 feet the climate becomes severe; and at 15,700 feet vegetation ceases. The situation of Colombia is highly favourable for commerce. It has excellent ports on both seas; and being mistress of the isthmus of Panama, it has superior facilities for establishing a communication from the one to the other. The Orinoco and the Amazon afford the inmost districts of Venezuela and Ecuador the advantages of water carriage to the ocean. The Cassiquiari, an intermediate channel, by which the Orinoco bifurcates or connects with the Amazon (a remarkable hydrographical phenomenon), is within the limits of Venezuela. The territory contains much gold and silver—the former in alluvial deposits: it has mines of copper and mercury also, with platinum, iron, and coal. Its tropical productions are similar to those of Brazil; but it has as yet cultivated few articles for foreign markets, and its exports are inconsiderable. The civilised population of this country is chiefly located in the districts near the coast, and in the high valleys or table-land of the Andes. Its amount, according to the Statesman's Year-Book. is—
[table]

It is always of importance to know in what proportions the different races are blended, but on this subject we have only approximate data. In Colombia the whites form about half of the population, the Indians about one-third, and the negroes about one-tenth, the remainder being of mixed blood. In Venezuela the whites form about one-third, the Indians about one-thirtieth, and Zamboes (from Indians and negroes) about one-half. In Ecuador the proportions are, roughly—whites one-sixth, Indians nearly one-half, negroes one-thirteenth.

All the three states are republican. See Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador.

The Argentine Republic, or La Plata, is, in point of natural advantages, the second state of importance in South [9:1:713] America. It is bounded on the west by Chili; on the north by Bolivia; on the east by Paraguay, Brazil, Uruguay, and the sea; and on the south by Patagonia. It embraces an area of 515,000 square miles if we include Tucuman, Salta, Santiago del Estero, and Jujuy, which scarcely acknowledge its authority. Nearly the whole territory of this republic consists of open plains destitute of timber, called pampas, extending from the Atlantic and the river Paraguay to the Andes. The eastern part of these plains exhibits a vigorous growth of herbage, intermixed with a forest of gigantic plants, 9 or 10 feet high, which have been called thistles, but are now known to be artichokes; in the middle they are covered with grass; and the western division, which extends to the foot of the Andes, consists of barren sandy plains, thinly sprinkled with shrubs and thorny trees. The openness and dryness of the country, however, render it healthy; and by the Parana, the Paraguay, and their branches, it possesses a great extent of natural inland navigation. It has mines of gold, silver, copper, lead, and probably iron; but its mineral riches have been greatly diminished by the separation of Potosi, Cochabamba, La Paz, and other provinces now forming part of Bolivia. The force of this republic lies almost entirely in the wealth, intelligence, and commercial spirit of its capital, Buenos Ayres, which contains 150,000 souls, including a large proportion of foreigners. A small number of estancias, or grazing farms, are sparingly diffused over its boundless plains, the proprietors of which keep multitudes of horses and mules, flocks of sheep, and vast herds of cattle; the latter being chiefly valued for their skins. These people are a bold, frank, hardy, half-civilised race, who live isolated in the wilderness, and scarcely acknowledge any government. The census of 1869 gives a total population of 1,736,922. See Argentine Republic; and for the two small states formed out of the north-eastern portion of its territory, see Paraguay and Uruguay. Entre Rios, formerly a separate state, is now a province of La Plata.

Chili extends along the coast of the Pacific from 24° to 56° of south latitude: its length is 2270 miles; its breadth varies from 40 to 200; and its surface, exclusive of Arau-cania, which has an area of 88,000 sq. miles, is estimated at 130,977 English square miles. The country consists properly of the western slope or declivity of the Andes, for the branches of the mountains running out in tortuous directions from the main trunk reach to the sea-shore. It enjoys an excellent and healthful climate; severe cold is unknown in the inhabited parts, and the heat is seldom excessive. The useful soil bears a small proportion to the entire surface of the country, consisting merely of the bottom of the valleys. It has rich mines of gold, silver, and copper in the northern provinces; but very few of them can be worked in consequence of the absolute sterility of the adjacent country. Its two northern provinces, occupying 450 miles of the coast, are nearly perfect deserts. The soil continues extremely dry, and yields nothing without irrigation, till we reach the latitude of 35°; and it is believed that not one-fiftieth part of the country is fit for cultivation. But south of the river Maule the land is covered with fine timber, and bears crops of wheat and other grain without the aid of any other moisture than what is supplied by the atmosphere. This is in truth the fine and fruitful part of Chili; and the project was once entertained of selecting its chief town, Conception, for the seat of the government. Chili has no manufactures, and is unfavourably situated for commerce. It has no navigable rivers, while its mountainous surface is an obstacle to the formation of roads; but nevertheless it has now upwards of 500 miles of railway opened. A representative constitution was established in Chili in 1833. An enumeration dated 1869 makes the population, exclusive of Araucania (with 70,000 aborigines), 1,938,861. See Chili.

Peru may be regarded as a continuation of Chili, consisting of the western declivities of the Andes, from the 4th to the 22d degree of south latitude, with the addition of a considerable tract on the east side of the mountains, between the 4th and 15th parallels. There are few countries in the world which have a more singular physical character than the western part of Peru. It is a belt or zone of sands, 1240 miles in length and from 70 to 600 in breadth, with inequalities of surface which might be called mountains if they were not seen in connection with the stupendous background of the Andes. This long line of desert is intersected by rivers and streams, which are seldom less than 20 or more than 80 miles apart, and on the sides of which narrow strips of productive soil are created by means of irrigation. These isolated valleys form the whole habitable country. Some of the large rivers reach the sea; the smaller are either consumed in irrigating the patches of cultivated land or absorbed by the encompassing desert, where it never rains, where neither beast nor bird lives, and a blade of vegetation never grew. No stranger can travel from one of these valleys to another without a guide, for the desert is trackless; and the only indications of a route are an occasional cluster of bones, the remains of beasts of burden that have perished. Even experienced guides, who regulate their course by the stars, the sun, or the direction of the wind, sometimes lose their path, and they almost inevitably perish. Of a party of 300 soldiers thrown ashore by a shipwreck in 1823 on one of these desert spaces, nearly a hundred expired before they reached the nearest valley. Ignorance and wonder have been busy with this singular region: legends are current, which tell that descendants of the ancient Peruvians have lived in some of these mysterious valleys, hid from the knowledge of their merciless invaders, since the days of the Incas. We have no reason to believe that more than one acre in a hundred of maritime Peru will ever be available for the sustenance of mankind. The country has two advantages—its mines of the precious metals, and a temperate and delightful climate, in consequence of the absence of rain and the fogs which intercept the solar heat. It can never be rich in the proper sense of the term, or make much progress in the improvements which depend upon a dense population. Like Chili, it has no navigable rivers—and nature has deprived it of the means of forming good roads. There are indeed few countries in the world whose natural advantages have been so much overrated as Peru; and it requires little sagacity to discover that its future career cannot correspond with its past celebrity. The districts east of the Andes, which have a hot climate accompanied with a rich soil, will ultimately be the most valuable part of the country; but their secluded situation and want of communication with other countries must keep them long in a backward state. The government is republican. Peru comprehends a surface of 502,760 square miles; the capital, Lima, contained in 1862 a population of 121,370. In that year a rough calculation was made which gave 3,199,000 as the entire population of the republic. It was also estimated that the proportions of races were :—
[table]

Bolivia, or Upper Peru, lies eastward of Lower Peru, and is bounded on the south by the Argentine Republic, and on the north and east by Brazil. It is of an irregular form, and comprehends a space of 473,300 square miles. The climate is pleasant and healthful, the soil is generally dry, and in the eastern parts, as well as the elevated table-land, its aridity produces barrenness. Nature, however, as a compensation for its other disadvantages, has bestowed upon it some of the richest mines in the world. The country was erected [9:1:714] into an independent state only in 1826, and named Bolivia in honour of its liberator Bolivar. It has a small strip of barren territory on the shores of the Pacific Ocean, between the 22d and 25th parallel; but it is, properly speaking, entirely an inland country, and more deficient in the means of communicating with foreign nations than any other state in America. See Bolivia.

Guatemala or “Central America” originally occupied all the narrow part of the continent from the 83d to the 94th degree of west longitude, extending 800 miles in length, and covering a space of 130,000 square miles. The surface of the country is hilly, and in most parts mountainous; the climate warm and very moist. The mineral wealth of the country is not great; but this is compensated by the richness of its soil and its excellent commercial position. It was a federal republic, but its five provinces have now become independent states. Humboldt estimated the population of the five states at 1,600,000. According to a statement furnished to Mr Thomson, a former British envoy by the government, it; was 2,000,000; while the most recent of the estimates made by the resident officials give a total of 2,335,019, viz.
[table]

The proportions of the different races have been estimated as follows :—

Mexico is the most populous and powerful of all the new states erected in America since the commencement of the present century. Previous to the war with the United States it embraced an area of 1,600,000 square miles, which was reduced to 1,030,442 by the cession of the northern provinces in 1848. About three-fourths of the surface consists either of mountains or table-land, raised from 5000 to 10,000 feet above the sea. Owing to this extraordinary elevation, even those parts of the country which lie within the torrid zone (the low ground on the coast excepted) enjoy a dry, cool, and salubrious atmosphere; but this advantage is counterbalanced by the insufficient supply of moisture and the rapid evaporation resulting from the same cause, which render the soil generally rather arid, and in many parts absolutely barren; by the smallness of the rivers and the almost entire absence of inland navigation; and by the obstacles which the steep and rugged ascents from the coast present to land-carriage. The republic is, besides, almost destitute of ports on the Atlantic side. Mexico is extremely rich in the precious metals; and there are few regions upon which nature has lavished so great a variety of vegetable productions, or where plants fitted to the coldest and the hottest climates may be seen so nearly, in juxtaposition. The low ground on the east coast is admirably adapted for raising sugar; and no country is more favourably situated for growing the other great articles of West India produce—coffee, cotton, cocoa, indigo, and tobacco. The raising of bread-stuffs— as they are termed by the Anglo-Americans—wheat, maize, and barley, with potatoes, the cassava root, beans, pumpkins, fruit, &c.—for domestic consumption, will necessarily be the chief branch of industry on the table-lands. The mines have never employed above 30,000 labourers; and their superior productiveness depends chiefly on two circumstances—the great abundance of the ore, which is only of poor quality, and the comparative facility with which they can be worked owing to their being generally situated in fertile districts, where provisions, wood, and all materials can be easily procured.

Mexico has had her full share of the ignorance and superstition which belonged to Spain; and these evils, with her internal dissensions and her rapacious, immoral, and intolerant clergy, are great obstacles to her improvement. That excessive inequality of fortune which corrupts both extremes of society has been nowhere in the world more prevalent than in Mexico. Individual proprietors possessed immense tracts of land and boundless wealth, while all the great towns swarmed with beggars, and thousands fell a sacrifice to famine from time to time. The Mexican constitution, which is federal and almost a literal copy of that of the United States, was established in 1824. The distinction of castes, which was maintained in the greatest rigour under the colonial system, has now disappeared, and power and office are open, not only legally but practically, to men of all colours. The African blacks formed an extremely small proportion of the Mexican population at all times; and since the revolution slavery has ceased. The number of inhabitants was estimated at 6,800,000 by Humboldt in 1823, and classed as follows:—
[table]

Mr Ward states that very few of the whites, so called, are free from a mixture of Indian blood; and now when the odious distinctions founded on complexion are abolished, they readily acknowledge it. Mr Ward estimated the population at 8,000,000 in 1827. In 1869 that of Mexico with its present boundaries was stated to be 9,176,082. See Mexico.

Hayti, called formely Hispaniola and St Domingo, was a colony belonging partly to France and partly to Spain till 1791, when the blacks rose in arms, killed a number of whites, and expelled the rest. The attempts of England in 1793, and of France in 1801, to conquer the island, both failed, and Hayti has at length been acknowledged as an independent state by all the great powers, including France. The island, which contains about 28,000 square miles, is remarkably fertile; but its climate, like that of the West Indies generally, is rather unhealthy. The population, which before the revolution was estimated at 600,000, is now said to amount to 900,000 or 1,000,000, and it is almost entirely composed of blacks and mulattoes. The island formed one state till 1844, when the eastern or Spanish portion revolted, and established its independence. It is now the republic of “Dominica,'' ruled by a president, while the western portion, retaining the name of Hayti, was formed into an empire under Faustin I.; but in 1867 a republican constitution was proclaimed. After long negotiations, the French government agreed in 1838 to acknowledge the independence of Hayti on condition of the latter paying 60,000,000 of francs by small annual instalments continued for 30 years. The money was destined chiefly to indemnify the French proprietors who were chased from the island in 1791. Nothing has been paid of late years.

The multifarious nature of the subject prevents us from attempting any description of the West India colonies, insular and continental. The islands have been variously denominated, but the most convenient division seems to us the following :—1. The Great Antilles, comprehending Cuba, Hayti, Jamaica, and Porto Rico; 2. The Small Antilles, extending in a semicircle from Porto Rico to the coast of Guiana; 3. The Bahama Isles, about 500 in number, of which, however, only a small number are inhabited.

The British colonies are 18 in number, viz., 16 insular— Jamaica, Antigua, Barbadoes, Dominica, Grenada, Montserrat, Nevis, St Kitts, St Lucia, St Vincent, Tobago, [9:1:715] Tortola, Trinidad, Bahamas, Bermuda, Falkland Island; and 2 continental— British Guiana and Honduras. The colonies contained a population of 1,228,967 in 1871, of whom probably four-fifths were persons of colour.

The Spanish colonies are Cuba and Porto Rico. Cuba has an area of 45,883 square miles, and in 1867 the population was 1,414,508. Porto Rico has an area of 3530 square miles, and in 1866 a population of 646,362 persons. In 1867 there were upwards of 700,000 slaves in these two colonies.

In August 1872 the Spanish government issued a decree ordering that arrangements should be made for the gradual emancipation of the slaves; and in December 1872 a bill was laid before the Spanish Cortes for the abolition of slavery in Porto Rico in 1873; so that probably slavery will soon be extinct throughout the whole of America.

The French colonies in the West Indies include Martinique, Guadaloupe, and some smaller isles; and on the continent, Guiana. According to a recent authority the population of these colonies was 318,934.

The Dutch have Surinam on the continent, with the islands of Curaçoa, St Eustatius, and St Martin.

In 1870 the population of the islands was 35,482, and of Surinam 59,885, occupying an area of 2812 geographical square miles. Slavery has ceased since July 1863, when the Dutch government compensated the owners for 44,645 slaves.

The Danes have the small islands of Santa Cruz and St John, containing a population of 24,698 in 1860, of whom most are freed slaves, and St Thomas, which had in the same year a population of 13,463. St Bartholomew, another of the Lesser Antilles, belongs to Sweden.

The problem of making a grand highway for travel and traffic from the Atlantic to the Pacific, either across the breadth of the American continent or by taking advantage of the narrow isthmus that joins its northern to its southern portion, has been the subject of many schemes since its western as well as its eastern shores have been inhabited by enterprising nations, skilled in commerce and in mechanical arts. It is interesting to remark that, whereas the hope of sailing to India by a westward route was the motive which guided the navigators of the 15th century to the discovery of America, the means of internal communication for this part of the earth, and the geographical exploration of its remote extremities, have been more recently advanced by the desire of finding a path in this direction to the Asiatic resorts of mercantile activity. Arctic voyagers were at first invited to the icy seas of high latitudes by the dream of a north-west passage to China and the East Indies. It was a passage by sea from the Atlantic to the Pacific which Sir John Franklin went to seek in his last expedition in 1845, but which Captain Maclure effected in 1856, though by an opposite course from Behring’s Strait to Baffin’s Bay. But it is scarcely possible that this route along the north coasts of America should ever be habitually frequented by mariners going to and fro between the two oceans. At the opposite extremity of the continent arrangements have lately been made to substitute a shorter way to the Pacific for that round Cape Horn by improving the navigation of the Strait of Magalhaens, which separates Tierra del Fuego from the south portion of the mainland. The project of cutting a canal through the central American isthmus has often been discussed. There can be no doubt of the practicability of a system of inland navigation from the Atlantic coast by the river San Juan to Lake Nicaragua, and thence by a canal to the neighbouring Lake Managua or Leon, with a short artificial channel of exit to the Pacific. A different route, of combined river and canal navigation, has more recently been proposed, which would cut off the whole of the isthmus from the body of South America—entering the uppermost part of that mainland by the river Atrato from the Gulf of Darien, ascending this river 150 miles, then following up the course of the Napipi or the Bajaya, tributaries of the Atrato—crossing the coast range of hills by a canal with several locks, and descending to the Pacific either in Limon Bay or in the Gulf of Cupica. But these projects could be adapted only to the admission of vessels of smaller size than such as in the present day are commonly employed for commercial traffic between distant regions of the world. In spite of the grand example of the Suez Canal, it seems likely that, in a country tolerably productive of wealth and capable of supporting population, the more profitable means of providing for a through traffic will be found in railroads, which serve also for the accommodation of intermediate districts. In this class of undertakings North America has of late years displayed a wonderful degree of active enterprise. The line of 60 miles from Aspinwall, near Chagres, across the neck of land, which is there so narrow, to Panama, on the Pacific side, though situated in the territory of a Spanish republic, was constructed by citizens of the United States, expressly for the traffic between New York and San Francisco. But since that first opening of a gateway of communication with California, Australia, or China, for the travellers and merchandise of the Atlantic states or of Europe, the whole breadth of the continent where it widens, in latitudes between 35° and 45° N., all belonging to the United States, has been traversed by a continuous railroad system. The middle link of this system is the Union Pacific Railway, 1600 miles long, from Omaha, on the Missouri, in the state of Nebraska, through that state, up the course of the Platte river, and through Wyoming, Idaho, Utah, and Nevada, crossing the summits of three great mountain ranges from 7000 feet to 8250 feet high, and meeting the Central Pacific Railway of California. This line was through a barren desert for several hundred miles, in the arid uplands of Idaho and the salt plains of Utah; but its construction has served to bring the commercial cities of the Atlantic and of the Pacific within six or seven days’ journey of each other. Three or four rival projects of railways across the width of the United States, or extensions of the existing railway system westward from the Mississippi and Missouri, have been taken up with some promise of their realisation. The one which offers the greatest advantages is that designed to ascend the long and broad valley of the Arkansas river, and to cross the Rocky Mountains with a southerly inclination into New Mexico, opening up the Rio Grande and San Juan country, which is said to be very rich, and thence passing on to the Grand Cañon of the Colorado, and to the Nevada mining district. Near the northern frontier of the United States territory, where it borders on the British Dominion of Canada, another continental line from east to west is now in progress—that is, from the western extremity of Lake Superior, through Minnesota, Dakotah, and Washington, to Puget Sound, just below Vancouver Island. But the work of this kind that will be most interesting to many of our readers is that undertaken in 1871 by the government of the Canadian Dominion. By the extension of the Dominion beyond the Rocky Mountains to include British Columbia, and the incorporation of the vast territories of the Hudson’s Bay Company, nearly the whole of North America above the 49 th parallel is united in one grand British colonial province, and the Canadian Pacific Railway will do much to promote a compact union between the widely-scattered communities of Her Majesty’s subjects on this great continent. The line will proceed from a port on the northern shore of Lake Superior, westward to the Red River settlement, near Lake Winnipeg, now forming the province of Manitoba; and will thence be conducted up the valley of the river Saskatchewan to the foot of the Rocky [9:1:716] Mountains, which it will cross by the Yellowhead Pass, to descend along the Thomson and Fraser rivers, in British Columbia, till it finally reaches the coast of the Pacific Ocean, possibly connecting Vancouver Island with the mainland by a bridge over the narrowest part of the straits. In connection with the Grand Trunk and other railways of Canada, supplemented by the Intercolonial Railway between Lower Canada, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia, this new western line will afford the most direct and expeditious means of transit across North America, and will probably become the favourite route for mails and passengers and light traffic from Europe to China. It will open a country which abounds in mineral wealth, especially of iron, coal, and copper; while the Saskatchewan valley, and the belt of fertile soil lying at the base of the Rocky Mountains (where the climate, as far north as Fort Dunvegan on the Peace river, is not more severe than that of Toronto, though in latitudes beyond 56° N., nearly thirteen degrees above that place), are capable of sustaining an agricultural population. The progress of railroad construction in North America, stimulating and assisting the development of industrial resources with amazing rapidity, is a feature of high importance in the most recent phases of the world’s civilisation. Its average rate of advance in the United States alone, during the five years preceding January 1873, was nearly 6000 miles annually of new railway; and the aggregate length of railway lines in the Union, all completed and in actual working, was then computed at 71,000 miles. British America, as we have seen, will not be left deficient of similar appliances for its internal improvement.

A great auriferous deposit was discovered in Upper California in the end of 1847, just before its formal cession to the United States. It is situated in the valley of the Sacramento river, and its principal branch the Joaquin, and is believed to extend over a range of country 200 miles in length, or more. The gold is found in its virgin state in small grains in three different situations— first, in sand and gravel beds; secondly, among decomposed or disintegrated granite; and thirdly, intermixed with a friable talcose slate standing in vertical strata, and containing white quartz, interlaminated or in veins. The largest pieces of gold are found in and near the talcose slate rocks, over which the streams flow; but the finer particles and scales have been carried down by the water to the lowest part of the valleys. It was known before that gold existed in the country; but the wonderful richness of the deposit was only discovered in 1847, in making a mill-race on American Fork, a small branch of the Sacramento. It soon became widely known, and attracted multitudes of persons, first from the neighbouring districts, and by and by from all parts of the world. The population, which was estimated at 15,000 in 1848, had increased to 92,000 in 1850, and in 1870 was found to be 5G0,247.

Humboldt gave the following estimate of the entire population of America in 1823 :—

Bollaert made the foliowine estimate for 1863 :—

What will be the number of the inhabitants of the new continent two or three centuries hence, and of what races will it consist? Setting aside the negroes, tc simplify the question, and the Indians, who will gradually disappear, it is evident that the soil of America is destined to be occupied by two races, who may be designated as the Anglo-Saxon and the Spanish-Indian. In the latter the Indian bluod greatly predominates, for the Creoles or pure progeny of the Spaniards probably do not constitute more than 20 per cent, of the population, while the civilised Indians may amount to 50, and the Mestizoes to 30.
[table]

The population of Spanish and Portuguese America, exclusive of slaves, was in round numbers 20,000,000

The Anglo-Saxon population in America increases at 3 per cent, annually, and doubles its numbers in 25 years.
[table]

A population of 176,000,000 spread over the territories of the United States and Canada would only afford an average of 40 persons to each square mile, about l-7th part of the density which England now exhibits, and could occasion no pressure. But let us suppose the rate of increase after 1925 to fall to 2 per cent., the period of doubling will then be 35 vears.
[table]

Suppose the rate again to decline to 1∣ per cent., which scarcely exceeds that of England and Prussia, the period of doubling will then be 50 years.
[table]

Let us now compare with this the growth of the Spanιsα-Indian population, doubling its numbers in 75 years.
[table]

It hence appears that, supposing both races to have free J space for expansion, the Anglo-Saxon population in 220 t years from the present time will amount to 2816 millions, while the Spanish-Indian population will only have multiplied to 200 millions, or one-fourteenth part of the other. It will be shown by and by, on probable grounds, that the new continent, if fully peopled, could support 3600 millions, and there would consequently be room enough for both; but long before this density is attained the two races will inevitably come into collision. In new settlements, where the best lands are invariably first occupied and the inferior neglected, the population is always thinly diffused. The Anglo-Saxons will therefore crowd to the richer fields of the south, while millions of acres of their own poorer lands are still untenanted; for we may rest assured that before cultivation is extended to the third-rate soils on the north side of the boundary, means will be found to appropriate the first-rate soils on the south side. These may be acquired by purchase like the lands of Louisiana, or by conquest like those of New Mexico and California, but in one way or another they will be acquired. Nearly forty years ago Μ. de Tocqueville calculated that along the great space from the Gulf of Mexico to the Canadian lakes the whites were advancing over the wilderness at an average rate of 17 miles per annum, and that enlightened observer was powerfully impressed by the grandeur and solemnity of this deluge of men, for ever swelling and flowing onward, [9:1:717] to the west, the south, and the north, as “driven by the hand of God.” Since he wrote the rate of progress has perhaps doubled, and every year will quicken its pace. If, then, we take a glance at the state of America at any future period, say 220 years hence (a.d. 2095), we must take the ratio of increase of the two civilised races as the prime element of our calculation. We may assume that the whole continent, from Behring’s Straits and Hudson’s Bay to Cape Horn, will be divided between the two races in some such proportion as their rate of growth indicates—it may be 10, 15, or 20 to 1. Supposing them to maintain a separate existence, the weaker race will probably be driven, like the Welsh before the English, into the mountainous and inhospitable regions. On the other hand, it is possible, and not improbable, that the smaller population may be absorbed into the mass of the greater, be incorporated with it, and adopt its language. The result, like other things in the womb of time, may be modified by causes yet unseen; but in whatever shape it may present itself, there is little risk in predicting that the Anglo-Saxon race is destined by its superior intelligence and energy to rule the New World from end to end. American statesmen now speak of the whole continent as the heritage of their people.

Paradoxical as the fact may appear, we are satisfied that the new continent, though less than half the size of the old, contains at least an equal quantity of useful soil and much more than an equal amount of productive power. America is indebted for this advantage to its comparatively small breadth, which brings nearly all its interior within reach of the fertilising exhalations of the ocean. In the old continent, owing to its great extent from east to west, the central parts, deprived of moisture, are almost everywhere deserts; and a belt round the western, southern, and eastern shores, comprises nearly all that contributes to the support of man. How much fruitful land, for instance, is there in continental Asia? If we draw a line from the Gulf of Cutch (near the Indus) to the head of the Yellow Sea, we cut off India and China, with the intervening Birman empire and the southern valleys of Thibet; and this space, which comprises only about one-fifth of the surface of Asia, embraces five-sixths of its productive power. Arabia, Persia, Central Thibet, Western India, Chinese and Independent Tartary are deserts, with scattered patches of useful soil not amounting to the twentieth part of their extent. Siberia, or Northern Asia, is little better, owing to aridity and cold together. Anatolia, Armenia, the Punjab, and a narrow strip along the western shores of the Pacific Ocean, north as far as the 60th parallel, compose the only valuable agricultural territory beyond India and China. Europe, which is merely the western margin of Asia, is all fruitful in the south; but on the north its fruitfulness terminates at the 60th or 62d parallel. Africa has simply a border of useful soil round three-fourths of its sea-coast, with some detached portions of tolerably good land in its interior. Of the 31,000,000 of square miles which these three continents occupy, we cannot find, after some calculation, that the productive soil constitutes so much as one-third, and of that third a part is but poor.

Now, in estimating the useful soil in America we reject— 1. Most of the region north of the latitude of 53°, amounting to 2,600,000 square miles; 2. A belt of barren land about 300 miles broad by 1000 in length, or 300,000 square miles, lying on the east side of the Rocky Mountains; 3. A belt of arid land of similar extent situated on the east side of the Andes, between 24° and 40° of south latitude; 4. The desert shore of Peru, equal to 100,000 square miles; 5. An extent of 100,000 square miles for the arid country of Lower California and Sonora; and 6. An extent of 500,000 square miles for the summits of the Andes and the south extremity of Patagonia. These make an aggregate of 3,900,000 square miles; and this, deducted from 13,900,000, leaves 10,000,000 square miles as the quantity of useful soil in the New World.

The productive powers of the soil depend on two circumstances, heat and moisture; and these increase as we approach the equator. Now, it appears that the productive or rather nutritive powers of the soil will be pretty correctly indicated by combining the ratios of the heat and the moisture, expressing the former of these in degrees of the centigrade scale. Something, we know, depends on the distribution of the heat through the different seasons; but as we do not aim at minute accuracy, this may be overlooked.
[table]

Thus, if the description of food were a matter of indifference, the same extent of ground which supports four persons at the latitude of 60°, would support 15 at the latitude of 45°, and 100 at the equator. But the food preferred will not always be that which the land yields in greatest abundance; and another most important qualifying circumstance must be considered—it is labour which renders the ground fruitful, and the power of the human frame to sustain labour is greatly diminished in hot climates. We shall therefore consider the capacity of the land to support population as proportional to the third power of the cosine (or radius of gyration) of the latitude. It will therefore stand thus in round numbers :—
[table]

In England the density of population is about 389 persons per square mile; but England is in some measure the workshop of the world, and supports, by her foreign trade, a greater population than her soil can nourish. In France the density of population is about 177; in Germany it varies from 100 to 200. On these grounds, we may assume that the number of persons which a square mile can properly sustain without generating the pressure of a redundant population is 150 at the latitude of 50°, and 26 is the sum which expresses the productiveness of this parallel. Then taking, for the sake of simplicity, 35 as the index of the productiveness of the useful soil beyond 30° in America, and 85 as that of the country within the parallel of 30° on each side of the equator, we have about 4,000,000 square miles, each capable of supporting 200 persons, and 5,700,000 square miles, each capable of supporting 490 person. It follows that if the natural resources of America were fully developed it would afford sustenance to 3,600,000,000 of inhabitants, a number nearly five times as great as the entire mass of human beings now existing upon the globe!
