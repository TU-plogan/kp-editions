AMHERST, a district and city within the Tenasserim division of British Burmah, and within the jurisdiction of the chief commissioner of that province. The District forms a narrow strip of land between the Indian Ocean and the mountains which separate it from the independent kingdom of Siam. It lies in 16° N. lat., 98° E. long., and consists partly of fertile valleys formed by spurs of the mountain system which divides it from Siam, and partly of a rich alluvial tract created by the great rivers which issue from them. The most important of these are the Salween river and the Houng-da-raw Khyoung. The river highways bring down inexhaustible supplies of rice to Maulmain, the chief town of the district, as also of the province of Tenasserim, and the second city in British Burmah. The district comprises an area of 15,144 square miles, of which 346 are cultivated, 4889 are capable of being brought under cultivation, and the remaining 9909 square miles are returned as uncultivable. The population in 1872 numbered 235,738 souls, occupying 38,945 houses, and consisting of 203,774 Buddhists, 15,598 Hindus, 12,279 Mahometans, and 4081 Christians. The town of Maulmain contains 53,653 inhabitants. The rainfall is very heavy, 245 ’ 85 inches being registered inl871-72. The temperature is uniform, but not excessive, and averaged 83° at 2 p.M. throughout the month of May 1871, 80° at 2 P.M. throughout July, and the same at 2 p.m. throughout December 1871.

Amherst Town, situated in the district of the same name, about 30 miles south of Maulmain. It was founded by the English in 1826 on the restoration of the town of Martaban to the Burmese, and named in compliment to the Governor-General of India who projected it. The proclamation inviting the natives to people the town was well adapted to the character and capacities of those whom it addressed. “The inhabitants of the towns and villages who wish to come shall be free from molestation, extortion, and oppression. They shall be free to worship as usual, temples, monasteries, priests, and holy men. The people shall go and come, buy and sell, do and live as they please, conforming to the laws. In regard to slavery, since all men, common people or chiefs, are by nature equal, there shall be under the English government no slaves. Whoever desires to come to the new town may come from all parts and live happy, and those who do not wish to remain may go where they please without hindrance.” Shortly after its settlement the number of houses amounted to 230, and the population to 1200. Large teak forests abound in its neighbourhood, and the timber is exported in considerable quantities. The harbour, though large and capable of accommodating ships of any burden, is difficult of access, and dangerous during the south-west monsoon. Amherst town has been eclipsed by the rapidly rising city of Maulmain, which has absorbed to itself the trade and mercantile enterprise alike of Amherst district and of the Tenasserim province.
