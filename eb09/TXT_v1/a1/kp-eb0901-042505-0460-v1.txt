AIKIN, Lucy, daughter of the preceding, a well-knowm historical writer, was born at Warrington on 6th Nov. 1781. After rendering valuable assistance to her father in several of his later works, she commenced her own. career as an authoress by the publication of several books for the young, the most important of which were the Adventures of Rolando, a translation, and Lorimer, a tale. In 1818 she published her Memoirs of the Court of Queen Elizabeth, the first and best of the series of historical works on which her reputation rests. It was very popular, and passed through several editions. The Memoirs of the Court of King James I. (1822) was highly commended in the Edinburgh Review, which pronounced it “a work very nearly as entertaining as a novel, and far more instructive than most histories.” Her Memoirs of the Court of Charles I. (1833) showed a falling off; and her latest work, the Life of Addison (1843), was declared disappointing by Macaulay in the Edinburgh Review, vol. lxxviii. Miss Aikin died at Hampstead, where she had resided for forty years, on the 29th Jan. 1864. A Life by P. H. le Breton, appeared in a volume entitled Memoirs, Miscellanies, and Letters of Lucy Aikin (Lond. 1864).
