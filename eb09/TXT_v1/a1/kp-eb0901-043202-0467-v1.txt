AJAN (the ancient Azania), a tract which forms the eastern horn of Africa, with a coast-line of about 10°of latitude, from Cape Gardafui nearly to the equator. It extends inland to the territory of the Gallas, but its limits cannot be strictly defined, as this part of Africa has been little explored. The coast towards the south is low and sandy, but northward, near Cape D’Orfui, it becomes high and mountainous, with some fertile valleys interspersed. Cape Gardafui, the most eastern point of Africa, is a bold promontory backed by lofty hills. There are no considerable rivers in Ajan, and the land for the most part is barren. The inhabitants, a tribe of the Somali, carry on a trade with the Arabs in ivory and gum, and the country possesses an excellent breed of horses.
