ALLEINE, Richard, M.A., author of Vindiciae Pietatis, was educated at St Albans Hall, Oxford, where Anthony à Wood states he was entered commoner in 1627, aged sixteen; and where, haring taken the degree of B.A., he transferred himself to New Inn, and continued there until he proceeded Μ.A. He and the like-minded William Alleine were sons of Richard Alleine, rector for upwards of fifty years of Dichet, Somerset. The younger Richard being ordained, became assistant to his venerable father, and immediately stirred the entire county by his burning eloquence. In March 1641 he succeeded to many-sided Richard Bernard as rector of Batcomb (Somerset). He declared himself on the side of the Puritans by subscribing “The testimony of the ministers in Somersetshire to the truth of Jesus Christ” and “The Solemn League and Covenant.” He continued for twenty years rector of Batcomb. On the Act of Uniformity being passed, he cast in his lot with the Two Thousand of the ejected. Upon the Five-Mile Act he removed to Frome Selwood, and preached there and around until his death on December 22, 1681. His works are all of the richest spiritual character, with a wistfulness of appeal that goes right to the heart. His Vindiciae Pietatis (which appeared successively in 1660, 1663, and 1665) was refused licence by Sheldon, and was published, in common with other Nonconformist books, without it. It was rapidly bought up, and “did much to mend this bad world.” Roger Norton, the king’s printer, caused a large part of the first impression to be seized, on the ground of not being licensed, and to be sent to the royal kitchen. Glancing over its pages, he was struck with what he read, and on second thoughts it seemed to him a sin that a book so holy—and so saleable—should be destroyed. He therefore bought back the sheets, says Calamy, for an old song, bound them, and sold them in his own shop. This in turn was complained of against him, and the shrewd publisher had to beg pardon on lus knees before the council-table; and the remaining copies were sentenced to be “bisk’d,” or rubbed over with an inky brush, and sent back to the kitchen for lighting fires. Such “bisk’d” copies occasionally occur still. The book was not killed. It was reissued, with additions, and a contribution by Joseph Alleine, and went forth on a mission which has endured to our day. (Calamy, s.v.; Palmer’s Nonconf. Mem. iii. pp. 167-8; C.
