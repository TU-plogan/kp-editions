AETOLIA, a country of ancient Greece, bounded on the N. by Epirus and Thessaly, on the E. by the provinces of Doris and Locris, on the S. by the Gulf of Corinth, and separated on the W. from Acarnania by the river Achelous. The part w'hich lay westward of the river Evenus, and south of a line joining Thermum and Stratus in Acarnania, was called old Aetolia, the rest of the country new or acquired Aetolia. The country is in general mountainous and woody, but along the coast from the Achelous to the Evenus, and northward to Mount Aracynthus, is a plain of great fertility; while another extensive and fertile plain stretches north from this mountain along the east bank of the Achelous as far as the northern limit of old Aetolia. The Aetolians were a restless and turbulent people, strangers to friendship or principles of honour, and they were consequently regarded by the other states of Greece as outlaws and public robbers. On the other hand, they were bold and enterprising in war, undaunted in the greatest dangers, and jealous defenders of their liberties. They distinguished themselves above all the other nations of Greece in opposing the ambitious designs of the Macedonian princes, who, after having reduced most of the other states, were forced to grant them a peace upon very honourable terms. The constitution of the Aetolian league was copied from that of the Achaeans, and with a view to form, as it were, a counter alliance. The Cleomenic war, and that of the allies, called the Social War, were kindled by the Aetolians with the express purpose of humbling the Achaeans. In the latter they held out, with the assistance only of the Eleans and Lacedemonians, for the space of three years, against the united forces of Achaia and Macedon, but were obliged at last to purchase a peace by yielding up to Philip all Acarnania. In order to regain this province they entered into an alliance with Rome against Philip, and proved of great service to the Romans in their war with him; but being dissatisfied with the terms of peace granted by Flaminius, they made war upon the -Romans themselves. They were speedily overcome, and only obtained peace on very humiliating terms. After the conquest of Macedon by Aemilius Paullus the Aetolians were reduced to a much worse condition; for not only those among them who had openly declared for Perseus, but those who were only suspected to have secretly favoured him, were sent to Rome to clear themselves before the senate. There they were detained, and never afterwards permitted to return to their native country. Five hundred and fifty of the chief men were barbarously assassinated by the partisans of Rome solely on the suspicion of favouring the designs of Perseus. The Aetolians appeared before Aemilius Paullus in mourning habits, and made loud complaints of such inhuman treatment, but could obtain no redress; on the contrary, ten commissioners, who had been sent by the senate to settle the affairs of Greece, enacted a decree, declaring that those who were killed had suffered justly, since it appeared to them that they had favoured the Macedonian party. From this time those only were raised to the chief honours and employments in the Aetolian republic who were known to prefer the interest of Rome to that of their country, and thus all the magistrates of Aetolia became the creatures and mere tools of the Roman senate. In this state of servile subjection they continued till the destruction of Corinth and the dissolution of the Achaean league, when Aetolia, with the other free states of Greece, was reduced to a Roman province, commonly called the province of Achaia. In this state, with little alteration, Aetolia continued under the emperors till the reign of Constantine the Great, who, in his new partition of the provinces of the empire, divided the western parts of Greece from the rest, calling them New Epirus, and subjecting the whole country to the praefectus praetorio for Illyricum. Under the successors of Constantine Greece was parcelled out into several principalities, especially after the taking of Constantinople by the western princes. About the beginning of the 13th century Theodoras Angelus, a noble Grecian of the imperial family, seized on Aetolia and Epirus. The former he left to Michael his son, who maintained it against Michael Palaeologus, the first emperor of the Greeks, after the expulsion of the Latins. Charles, the last prince of this family, dying in 1430 without lawful issue, bequeathed Aetolia to his brother’s son, named also Charles; and Acarnania to his natural sons Memnon, Turnus, and Hercules. But great disputes arising about this division, Amurath II., after the reduction of Thessalonica, laid hold of so favourable an opportunity, and expelled all the contending heirs in 1432. The Mahometans were afterwards dispossessed of this country by the famous prince of Epirus, George Castriot, commonly called Scanderbeg, who with a small army opposed the whole power of the Ottoman empire, and was victorious in twenty-two pitched battles. That hero at his death left great part of Aetolia to the Venetians; but they not being able to make head against such a mighty power, the whole country was soon reduced by Mahommed II. It is now included in the kingdom of Greece.
