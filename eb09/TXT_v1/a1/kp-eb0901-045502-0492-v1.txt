ALBINUS (originally Weiss), Bernard Siegfried, a celebrated anatomist, born in 1697 at Frankfort-on-the-Oder, where his father was professor of the practice of medicine. In 1702 the latter was transferred to a professorship at Leyden, and it was there that Bernard Siegfried commenced his studies, having for his teachers such men as Boërhaave, Bidloo, and Rau. His great ability, especially in surgery and anatomy, was early recognised, and Rau, so justly celebrated as a lithotomist, is said to have seldom performed an important operation without inviting him to be present. Having finished his studies at Leyden, he went to Paris, where, under the instruction of Vaillant, Winslow, and others, he devoted himself especially to anatomy and botany. After a year’s absence, he was, on the recommendation of Boerhaave, recalled in 1719 to Leyden to be a lecturer on anatomy and surgery. Two years later he succeeded his father in the professorship of these subjects, and delivered an address at his installation which was received with universal approbation. Albinus speedily became one of the most famous teachers of anatomy in Europe, his classroom being resorted to not only by students, but by many practising physicians. With little original genius, and no special talent for exposition, he possessed those habits of accurate observation and patient research which are the best qualification for his department of study. The engravings of bones and muscles executed by Wandelaar for the treatise of Albinus on these organs were far superior in clearness and exactness to anything that had previously been produced. In 1745 Albinus was appointed professor of the practice of medicine, being succeeded in the anatomical chair by his brother Frederick Bernard, who, as well as another brother, Christian Bernard, attained considerable distinction. Bernard Siegfried was twice rector of his university, and was an associate of the learned societies of London, St Petersburg, and Haarlem. He died on the 9th September 1770.
