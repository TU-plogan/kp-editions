ALCYONIUS, or Alcionius, Petrus, a learned Italian, born at Venice in 1487 (died 1527). Distinguished as a classical scholar, he was employed for some time by Aldus Manutius as a corrector of the press, and in 1522 was appointed professor of Greek at Florence through the influence of Giulio de Medici. When the latter became pope, under the title of Clement VII., in 1523, Alcyonius followed him to Rome, and remained there until his death. Alcyonius published at Venice, in 1521, a Latin translation of several of the works of Aristotle, which was shown by the Spaniard Sepulveda to be very incorrect. He wrote a dialogue entitled Medices Legatus, give de Hxilio, in connection with which he was charged with plagiarism by his personal enemy, Paulus Manutius. The accusation, which Tiraboschi has shown to be groundless, bore that he had taken the finest passages in the work from Cicero’s De Gloria, and that he had then destroyed the only existing copy of the original in order to escape detection. Two orations on the taking of Rome by Charles V., and another on the knights who perished at the siege of Rhodes, are also ascribed to Alcyonius.
