ALEXANDRIA, a city of Lower Egypt, and for a long time its capital, was situated on the Mediterranean, 12 miles west of the Canopic mouth of the Nile, in 31° 11' N. lat., and 29° 52' E. long. The ancient city was oblong in form, with a length from east to west of 3 to 4, a breadth from north to south of 1, and, according to Pliny, a circumference of 15 miles. Lake Mareotis bathed its walls on the south, and the Mediterranean on the north; on the west was the Necropolis, and on the east the Hippodrome. The city was laid out in straight parallel streets, one of which, about 200 feet wide, ran westward from the Canopic gate to the Necropolis. This street was decorated with magnificent houses, temples, and public buildings, and [9:1:494] was intersected by another of the same breadth and magnificence, running from south to north. Ancient Alexandria was divided into three regions: (1.) The Regio Judoeorum, or the Jews’ quarter, forming the north-east portion of the city. (2.) Rhacotis on the west, occupied chiefly by Egyptians. Its principal building was the Serapeum, or temple of Serapis, containing an image of the god, brought probably from Pontus. A large part of the famous library of Alexandria was placed in the Serapeum. (3.) Bruchewm, the Royal or Greek quarter, forming the remaining and most magnificent portion of the city In the Brucheum were the chief public buildings of Alexandria, the most noted of which was the splendid palace of the Ptolemies, on a peninsula called the Lochias, which stretched out into the Mediterranean towards the east of the city; the library proper, and the museum, a sort of college, with a dining-hall and lecture-rooms for the professors (see Library) ; the Coesarium, or temple of the Caesars, where divine honours were paid to the emperors; and the Dicasterium, or court of justice. An artificial mole, called the Heptastadium, nearly a mile in length, stretched from the continent to the isle of Pharos. Between this mole and the peninsula of Lochias was the greater harbour; on the other side of the mole was the harbour called Eunostos, or Safe Return. The two were connected with each other by two breaks in the mole, crossed by two bridges, which could be raised at pleasure. Within the harbour of Eunostos was an artificial basin called Kibotos, i.e., the Chest, communicating with lake Mareotis by a canal, from which a separate arm stretched eastward to the Canopic mouth of the Nile. On the eastern point of the island of Pharos was the famous lighthouse, said to have been 400 feet high. It was begun by Ptolemy Soter, and finished by his successor, Philadelphus. It cost 800 talents, which, if Alexandrian, is equivalent to £248,000. In the time of Diodorus Siculus (50 b.c.), the population of Alexandria was estimated at 300,000 freemen, with probably at least as many slaves.

The city was founded by Alexander the Great 332 b.c.; but the island of Pharos was from an early period a refuge of Greek and Phoenician sea-rovers, a fact commemorated in the name “Pirates’ Bay,” given to a deep indentation on the north side of the island; and on the mainland was the little town of Rhacotis, subsequently incorporated in the quarter of that name. The architect employed by Alexander was the celebrated Dinocrates, who had acquired a high reputation by rebuilding the temple of Diana at Ephesus. The new city prospered greatly as a centre both of commerce and of learning, particularly during the reigns of the earlier Ptolemies, to whose enlightened liberality, indeed, its literary importance was largely due. But the later monarchs of the house of Lagus were mostly weak and vicious men, under whom the city declined in influence. In 80 B.c. Ptolemy Alexander bequeathed his city to the Romans; but the bequest did not immediately take effect owing to the civil convulsions in Italy, into which Alexandria itself was eventually drawn, and it was not until 30 b.c. that the city submitted to Augustus. It was by him made an imperial city, governed by a prefect appointed by the emperor, while the functions of the Alexandrian senate were suspended, a state of matters which continued until 196 A.D., when Severus restored its municipality.

Alexandria seems from this time to have regained its old prosperity, becoming an important granary of Rome, which, doubtless, was one of the chief reasons that induced Augustus to place it directly under the imperial power. In 215 A.D. the emperor Caracalla visited the city; and, in order to repay some insulting satires that the inhabitants had made upon him, he commanded his troops to put to death all youths capable of bearing arms. This brutal order seems to have been carried out even beyond the letter, for a general massacre was the result. Notwithstanding this terrible disaster, Alexandria soon recovered its former splendour, and for a time was esteemed the first city in the world after Rome. As the power of the Caesars decreased, however, their hold over Alexandria was weakened, and the city itself suffered from internal commotions and insurrections, which gradually destroyed its importance. In 616 it was taken by Chosroes, king of Persia; and in 640 by the Arabians, under Amru, after a siege that lasted fourteen months, during which Herac-lius, the emperor of Constantinople, did not send a single ship to its assistance. Notwithstanding the losses that the city had sustained, Amru was able to write to his master, the caliph Omar, that he had taken a city containing “4000 palaces, 4000 baths, 12,000 dealers in fresh oil, 12,000 gardeners, 40,000 Jews who pay tribute, 400 theatres or places of amusement.” The following story, relating to the destruction of the library, is told by Abulfaragius :—John the Grammarian, a famous Peripatetic philosopher, being in Alexandria at the time of its capture, and in high favour with Amru, begged that he would give him the royal library. Amru told him that it was not in his power to grant such a request, but promised to write to the caliph for his consent. Omar, on hearing the request of his general, is said to have replied that if those books contained the same doctrine with the Koran, they could be of no use, since the Koran contained all necessary truths; but if they contained anything contrary to that book, they ought to be destroyed; and therefore, whatever their contents were, he ordered them to be burnt. Pursuant to this order, they were distributed among the public baths, of which there was a large number in the city, where, for six months, they served to supply the fires. Shortly after its capture, Alexandria again fell into the hands of the Greeks, who took advantage of Amru’s absence with the greater portion of his army. On hearing what had happened, however, Amru returned, and quickly regained possession of the city. About the year 646 Amru was deprived of his government by the caliph Oth-man. The Egyptians, by whom Amru was greatly beloved, were so much dissatisfied by this act, and even showed such a tendency to revolt, that Constantine, the Greek emperor, determined to make an effort to reduce Alexandria. The attempt proved perfectly successful, Manuel, Constantine’s general, capturing the city with inconsiderable loss. The caliph, perceiving his mistake, immediately restored Amru, who, on his arrival in Egypt, drove the Greeks within the walls of Alexandria, but was only able to capture the city after a most obstinate resistance by the defenders. This so exasperated him that he completely demolished its fortifications, although he seems to have spared the lives of the inhabitants as far as lay in his power. Alexandria now rapidly declined in importance. It was captured by Andalusian adventurers in 823; by the Moghrebins in 924, and again in 928. The building of Cairo in 969, and, above all, the discovery of the route to the East by the Cape of Good Hope in 1497, nearly ruined its commerce; and after this we hear little of the city until the beginning of the present century.

Alexandria, the modern city, stands partly on what was the island of Pharos, now a peninsula, but mostly on the isthmus by which it is connected with the mainland. This was originally an artificial dyke connecting the island with the land opposite; but, through the constant accumulation of soil and ruins, it has attained its present dimensions. The principal public and government buildings are on the peninsula. The ancient city was situated on the mainland, adjacent to the modem town, and the extent of the ruins that still exist sufficiently attests its [9:1:495] greatness. The general appearance of Alexandria is by no means striking; and from its situation its environs are sandy, flat, and sterile. It was formerly surrounded by strong turreted walls, with extensive outworks,' but in various parts the walls have lately been destroyed to make way for improvements. In the Turkish quarter the streets are narrow, irregular, and filthy, and the houses mean and ill-built. The Frank quarter, on the other hand, presents the appearance of a European town, having handsome streets and squares, and excellent shops. The streets have been much improved lately by being nearly all paved. The principal hotels, shops, and offices are situated in the Great Square, the centre of which forms a very agreeable promenade, being planted with trees, and well provided with seats. It has also a fountain at each end. In the suburbs are numerous handsome villas, with pleasant gardens. Among the principal public buildings are the palace of the pasha, the naval arsenal, the naval and military hospitals, custom-house, bourse, two theatres, several mosques, churches, convents, &c. There is an important naval school, and a number of other educational institutions. Among the charities worthy of mention is the hospital of the Deaconesses of Kaisersworth. Formerly the town was supplied with water by means of the ancient reservoirs formed under the old city, which are in many cases as perfect now as when first made, 2000 years ago. These were annually filled with water by means of the canal from the Nile, at the time of inundation; but a system of water-works has been formed by a public company, and a constant supply of water is now obtained from the canal at some distance from the town. The principal streets, squares, and railway stations, are lighted with gas.

Few of the remains of the ancient city are now visible. Most of those that were to be seen a few years ago have since disappeared, but frequently in making excavations portions of ancient masonry, broken columns, and fragments of statues are discovered. Among the best known of the ancient relics are the two obelisks commonly called “Cleopatra’s Needles.” They were originally brought from Heliopolis to Alexandria in the reign of Tiberius, and were set up in front of the temple of Caesar. They are of red granite, and covered with hieroglyphics. One is still standing, and is 71 feet high and 7 feet 7 inches in diameter at the base. The other, which is fallen and covered with debris, is in a less perfect state, and not quite so long as the former. It was offered to the English government by Mehemet Ali, but after some consideration was declined. Near the obelisks are the ruins of an old round tower, commonly called the “Roman Tower.” But the most striking of the ancient monuments is the column styled “Pompey’s Pillar.” It stands on a mound of earth about 40 feet high, and has a height of 98 feet 9 inches. The shaft consists of a single piece of red granite, and is 73 feet long and 29 feet 8 inches in circumference. The capital is Corinthian, 9 feet high, and the base is a square of about 15 feet on each side. From an inscription it appears to have been erected in honour of the emperor Diocletian, and it was formerly surmounted by a statue of that monarch. To the S.W. of the city are the catacombs, which served for the burial of the dead, and are formed by excavations in the calcareous rock of which the shore is composed. They are of great extent, and one of the chambers is remarkable for its elegance. The climate of Alexandria is mild and salubrious. The heats of summer are modified by the N.W. winds from the sea, which prevail during nine months of the year, the thermometer seldom rising above 85° Fahr. In winter a good deal of rain falls, and throughout the year the atmosphere is generally moist, being saturated with a saline vapour from the sea.

Alexandria has been mainly indebted for its prosperity to the advantages of its position for trade. It was this that first attracted the attention of its far-seeing founder to the site, and its subsequent history in no way belied his penetration. It soon rose to be the most important commercial city in the world, and the great emporium of trade between Europe and the East. Subsequently its fortunes fluctuated with those of its possessors, but the great blow to its prosperity was the discovery of the route to India by the Cape of Good Hope, and under the Turks it sank into insignificance, numbering only about 6000 inhabitants. Soon after Mehemet Ali became ruler of Egypt he turned his attention to the restoration of Alexandria. One of the most important works that he effected with this view was the opening of the Mahmoudieh Canal in 1820. This was accomplished at a cost of about £300,000, and, for want of proper management, at a melancholy loss of human life. It is about 50 miles in length, with an average width of about 100 feet, and communicates with the Rosetta branch of the Nile at the village of Atfeh. Since Alexandria became the centre of the steam communication between Europe and India, and the principal station on the Overland Route, its progress has been rapid. It has now regular communication with England, Marseilles, Brindisi, Constantinople, &c. In 1851 Mr Stephenson was instructed to form a railway between Alexandria and Cairo, which was accomplished, and the line opened for traffic, in 1856. This was shortly afterwards extended to Suez, and several extensions have since been made to the cotton districts of the Delta. A short line of railway (not belonging to the government) connects the town with Ramleh, a sea-bathing village about 7 miles distant.

Alexandria has two ports, an eastern and a western. The latter, called also the Old Port, is by far the larger and better of the two. It extends from the town westward to Marabout, nearly 6 miles, and is about a mile and a-half in width. It has three principal entrances. The first, or that nearest the city, has about 17 feet of water, but is narrow and difficult of access, and only used by small vessels and boats. The second or middle, which is also the principal entrance, is about a quarter of a mile wide, and has, where shallowest, 27 feet of water. The eastern side of this entrance is marked by buoys, and there are landmarks for guiding to the channel. The third or western entrance has its western boundary about three-eighths[9:1:496] of a mile from Marabout Island, is about half a mile wide, and has from 25 to 27 feet of water where shallowest. Within the harbour ships may anchor close to the town in from 22 to 40 feet of water. Further improvements, in course of construction by a firm of English contractors (at a cost to the Egyptian government of little short of two millions sterling), will eventually render this one of the finest and most capacious harbours on the Mediterranean. Among these are the formation of a breakwater, extending in a south-westerly direction parallel to the shore for 2550 yards south-west of the lighthouse on Cape Eunostos; a mole, springing from the shore, and extending in a northerly direction for 1100 yards, and having a width of about 100 feet; and the construction of nearly 3 miles of quays and wharves, for vessels of the largest size, and with railway connection. The foundation-stone of the breakwater was laid by the viceroy on 15th May 1871. The area of deep water, 30 feet and upwards, enclosed within the outer breakwater, is 1400 acres; the area of 28 feet of water, enclosed by the harbour mole, will be 177 acres. The workshops of the company are at the quarries of Mex, about 3 miles west of the town. In the harbour is a magnificent floating dock, nearly 500 feet long and 100 feet broad. The old lighthouse, on the site of the ancient Pharos, having been found insufficient, a new lighthouse has been erected on Ras-el-teen (1842), bearing a one-minute revolving light, visible at a distance of 20 miles. The eastern or new port, formerly the only port open to Christians, is now little used, being exposed to the northerly gales, and having very limited space for anchorage.

In 1861 the total value of the exports was £2,638,822; and in 1871 this had risen to £10,251,608, of which £7,706,442 was to England. The value of the imports for the latter year was £5,753,020, of which £2,469,026 was from England. The principal articles of export were cotton (£6,402,756), cotton seed (£1,008,278), beans (£753,462), corn (£573,766), sugar (£379,456), gums (£307,932), coffee (£122,110), ivory, wool, linseed, senna, and other drugs. The principal articles of import were manufactured goods (£1,695,870), wool (£307,495), oils (£251,158), wines and liqueurs (£239,944), raw silk, fruits. During that year there entered 1841 sailing vessels and 883 steam vessels with cargoes, and 143 sailing vessels and 54 steam vessels in ballast; and there left 1085 sailing vessels and 843 steam vessels with cargoes, and 797 sailing vessels and 62 steam vessels in ballast. The total tonnage of the vessels that entered was 1,262,602; and that left, 1,267,381. The opening of the Suez Canal will no doubt serve to withdraw a portion of the traffic from Alexandria, but the improvements that are now being made on its harbour, and its direct railway communication with Suez, must still give it certain advantages over the other route, while it must continue to be the great emporium for the rapidly extending trade of Egypt itself.

The population of Alexandria is of a very mixed character, consisting, besides the native Turks and Arabs, of Armenians, Greeks, Syrians, Italians, French, English, Germans, &c. At one time the ancient city is believed to have contained 600,000 inhabitants; but at the beginning of this century the number probably did not exceed 6000. In 1825 this had increased to 16,000, in 1840 to 60,000, and in 1871 to 219,602, of whom 53,829 were foreigners.
