BOCHART, Samuel, a learned writer of the 17th century, specially distinguished as an Oriental scholar, was bom at Rouen in Normandy, May 30, 1599. He was many years pastor of a Protestant church at Caen, and became tutor to Wentworth Dillon, earl of Roscommon, author of the Essay on Translated Verse. While at Caen he particularly distinguished himself by his public disputations with Father Veron, a Jesuit, and celebrated as a polemic. The dispute was held in the castle of Caen, in the presence of a great number of Catholics and Protestants, the duke of Longueville being among the former. In 1646 Bochart published his Phaleg and Chαnaan, which are the titles of the two parts of his Geographia Sacra. His Hierozoicon, which treats of the sacred animals of Scripture, was printed at London in 1675. In 1652, Christina, queen of Sweden, invited him to Stockholm, whither he repaired, accompanied by Huet. On his return to Caen he resumed his duties as a minister of the gospel, married, and was received into the academy of that city. Bochart was a man of profound erudition; he possessed a thorough knowledge of the principal Oriental languages, including Hebrew, Syriac, Chaldaic, and Arabic; and such was his zeal for extending his acquirements, that at an advanced age he wished to learn Ethiopie. He was remarkable for modesty and candour; but so absorbed was he in his favourite study, that he saw Phoenician, and nothing but Phoenician, in everything, even in the words of the Celtic, and hence the prodigious number of chimerical etymologies which swarm in his works. He died at Caen, May 16, 1667. A complete edition of his works was published at Leyden, under the title of Sam.
