BILLITON ", or Blitong, an island of the East Indies*, belonging to the Dutch, situated between Sumatra and Borneo, in lat. 3° S. and long. 108° E. It is of a circular form, about 50 miles in length by 45 in breadth; and has an area, according to Melvill van Carnbée, of 2500 square miles. The weather is subject to rapid changes; but the usual temperature varies from 80° to 87° Fahr. The nights are very cool. The surface in the north is hilly,—Tadjem, the· highest peak, being 3280 feet in height. The sea-coast is inaccessible and surrounded with rocks, and the best harbour is still that at the chief town of Tandjong Padan. The navigation between the island and Borneo is very dangerous. Horses, buffaloes, cattle, sheep and goats, ducks, geese, fowls, and pigeons are the domestic animals of Billiton; and among its wild animals are deer, goats, jackals, monkeys, civet-cats, tiger-cats, and porcupines. The seas furnish a superabundance of fish. On the rocks along the coast are found tortoises, trepang, and edible birds’-nests, which are articles of export. The forests supply wood of [9:3:678] different kinds for shipbuilding, in which the inhabitants are very expert. There are important mines both of iron and tin, the former being used in the island and the latter exported to the Netherlands. The quantity of tin obtained in 1871 was 49,850 picols, or 60,532 cwts. The chief imports are rice, cotton goods, pottery, and cocoa-nuts. The population in 1871 amounted to 19,837, of whom only 59 were Europeans. The natives are of middle height and strongly built, and have expressive features. The island was formerly under the sultan of Palembang, by whom it was ceded to the English in 1812. As no mention was made of it in the treaty between the English and Dutch in 1814, the former at first refused to renounce their possession, and only recognized the Dutch claim in 1824. Till 1852 it was dependent on Banka, but at that date was raised to a sub-residency.
