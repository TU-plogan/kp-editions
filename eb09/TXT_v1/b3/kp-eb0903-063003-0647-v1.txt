It is boundèd on the N. by the state of Gwalior and the British district of Bairsia. on the N.E. and S.E. by the Sâgar and Ner-badâ[9:3:631] territory, on the S.W. by the possessions of Holkâr and Sindhiâ, and on the N.W. by Sindhiâ’s districts and Omatwârâ. Length of the state from E. to W., 157 miles; breadth from N. to S., 76 miles; estimated area, 6764 square miles. The surface of the country is uneven, being traversed by the Vindhya ranges, a peak of which near Raysen is upwards of 2500 feet above sea-level. The general inclination of the country is towards the north, in which direction most of the streams of the state flow, while others, passing through the Vindhyan ranges, flow to the Narbadâ. The population of the state is estimated at 663,656, comprising Hindus, Mahometans, and the Gonds, an aboriginal tribe. Principal crops: wheat, Indian corn, oil-seeds, pulses, opium.

Both have been appointed Knights of the Star of India, and their territory is the best governed native state in India.
