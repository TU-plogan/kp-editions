BILDERDIJK, Willem, a modern Dutch poet, by some considered to be the most eminent that his country has ‘ produced, was born at Amsterdam in 1756. In 1776, after completing a wide course of study at Leyden University, he gained the prize from the Leyden Society of Art for his poem on the Influence of Poetry on States and Governments. In the following year he gained another prize for his poem Love of Fatherland, and in 1779 he translated the Oedipus Tyrannus of Sophocles. In 1786 he left Holland on account of the disturbed state of public affairs, and after residing some time in Germany crossed to England, where he remained till 1806. Returning then to his native country he was received with great favour by the new king Louis Napoleon, who made him president of the recently founded Institute of Holland. He died on the 18th December 1831. His finest poetical works are the Buitenleven, or Rural Life, a free imitation of Delille; De Mensch, similarly taken from Pope; Die Ziekte der Geleerden, the Maladies of the Learned; Die Ondergang der eerste Wereld, the Destruction of the First World. Some of his dramatic and epic poems are also highly esteemed. His second wife, besides some original work, translated the Roderick of Southey, who was very intimate with Bilderdijk, and resided for some time with him.
