BÏRBHÙM, a district of British India, within the Bardwân division, under the lieutenant-governor of Bengal, situated between 24° 23' 10" and 23° 34' 54" N. lat., and 88° 3' 54" and 87° 7' 41" E. long. It is bounded on the N. by the districts of Santal Parganâs and Bhâgalpur; on the E. by the districts of Murshidâbâd and Bardwân; on the S. by the River Ajai, separating it from the district of Bardwân; and on the W. by the districts of the Santâl Parganâs. The census of 1872 returned the area of the district at 1344 square miles, and the total population at 695,921 souls, residing in 2471 villages and 159,904 houses. Pressure of population per square mile, 518; per village, 282; per house, 4 , 3. Of the total population, 576,908, or 82 , 9 per cent., were Hindus; 111,795, or 16Ί per cent., Mahometans; 249 Christians; and 3440, consisting principally of aboriginal tribes, of unspecified religions. The eastern portion of the district is the ordinary alluvial plain of the Gangetic Delta; the western part consists of undulating beds of laterite resting on a rock basis, and covered with small scrub jungle. The Ajai, Bakheswar, and Mor or Maurakshi, are the principal rivers of the district, but they are merely hill streams and only navigable in the rains. Rice, wheat, sugar-cane, pulses, oil-seeds, and mulberry form the agricultural products of the district. The chief manufactures are silk, silk cloth, and lacquered ware. The principal seats of trade are Dubrâjpur, Ilâmbâzâr, Bolpur, Sinthiâ, Purandarpur, Krinnâhâr, Muhammad Bâzâr, and Ahmadpur. The total net revenue of the district in 1870-71 amounted to £97,979; the civil expenditure to £27,278. The land tax forms the most important item of revenue. In 1870-71 it amounted to £73,261, paid by 556 estates, held by 2036 proprietors, under the Permanent Settlement as in other parts of Bengal. The district and municipal police force amounted to 320 officers and men, at a total cost of £5895 in 1871. Besides these there were 8554 men of the village watch, maintained at a total cost of £23,074, paid by service lands and by the villagers. In 1872 Birbhùm contained 604 schools, attended by 9338 pupils, costing £989 to the state for the education of its people.: There are seven principal roads in the district, the total mileage being 191, and the average cost of their maintenance £1784. Thirty-three miles of the East Indian Railway lie within the district. Until lately Birbhum was considered to be the healthiest district in Bengal; but during the past few years epidemic fever has made havoc among the rural population of the eastern portion of the district.

BîrbhÙm, or Suκf, the principal town and administrative headquarters of the district of the same name, is situated in 23° 5 4' 25" N. lat., and 87° 34' 23" E. long. In 1872 it contained a population of 9001, of whom 6746 were Hindus, 2056 Mahometans, 187 Christians, and 12 of unspecified religions. Municipal income of the town in 1871, £483, 18s.; expenditure, £473, 8s.; rate of municipal taxation, Is. 8d. per head.
