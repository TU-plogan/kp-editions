BISHOP, Sir Henry Rowley, musical composer, was born in London on the 18th November 1786. He received his artistic training from Francisco Bianchi, at whose instance, probably, he was employed to write his first work, the ballet of Tamerlan eiBajazd, produced at Covent Garden in 1806. This proved successful, and was followed within two years by several others, of which Caradacus, a pantomimic ballet, written for Drury Lane, may be named. In 1809 his first opera, The Circassian's Bride, was produced at Drury Lane; but by a singular misfortune the theatre was burned down after one performance, and the score of the work perished in the flames. His next work of importance, the opera of The Maniac, written for the Lyceum in 1810, established his reputation, and probably secured for him the appointment of composer for Covent Garden theatre. The numerous works—operas, burlettas, cantatas,incidental music to Shakespeare’s plays, &c.—which he composed while in this position, are now in great part forgotten. The most successful were— The Virgin of the Sun (1812), The Miller and his Men (1813), Guy Maη-nering and The Slave (1816), Maid Marian and Clari, introducing the air of “Home, Sweet Home” (1822). His English adaptations, or rather mangled versions, of Mozart’s Eon Giovanni and Figaro, and Rossini’s ll Barbiere and Guillaume Tell, were certainly no true service to art. It seems almost incredible that a man of Bishop’s undoubted genius should have been so misguided as to suppress the incomparable Figaro overture of Mozart in favour of one of his own. In 1824 Bishop was induced by Elliston to transfer his services from Covent Garden to the rival house in Drury Lane, for which he wrote with •unusual care the opera of Aladdin, intended to compete with Weber’s Oberon, commissioned by the other house. As was to be expected the result was a failure, and with Aladdin Bishop’s career as an operatic composer may be said to close. On the formation of the Philharmonic Society (1813) Bishop was appointed one of the directors, and he took his turn as conductor of its concerts during the period when that office was held by different musicians in rotation. In 1841 he was appointed to the “Reid” chair of music in the University of Edinburgh, but he resigned the office in 1843. He was knighted by the queen in 1842, being the first musician who ever received that honour. In 1848 he succeeded Dr Crotch in the chair of music at Oxford. The music for the ode on the occasion of the installation of Lord Derby as chancellor of the university (1853) proved to be his last work. He died on the 30th April 1855 in impoverished circumstances, though few composers ever made more by their labours. Bishop’s name will live in connection with his numerous glees, songs, and smaller compositions, rather than with his larger works, which are now seldom or never performed in their entirety. His Shake [9:3:790] speare songs and glees are familiar favourites with all vocalists, and genius is discernible in not a few of them. His melodies are clear, flowing, appropriate, and often charming; and his harmony is always pure, simple, and sweet. He was a prominent example of both the strength and the weakness of the native English school, in which the name of Purcell alone stands unquestionably higher than his.
