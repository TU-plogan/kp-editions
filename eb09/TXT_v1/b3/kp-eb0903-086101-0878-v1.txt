BOHEMOND, Marc, one of the leaders of the Crusades, born about 1056, was the eldest son of Robert Guiscard, a Norman, who had obtained by conquest the dukedom of Apulia and Calabria. From 1081 to 1085 he served under his father in a war against the Byzantine emperor Alexander Comnenus, whom he twice defeated, though he had to return to Italy without reaping any substantial fruits of his success. In 1085 his father died, leaving Apulia and Calabria to a younger son, while Bohemond obtained only the small principality of Tarentum. A war between the [9:3:862] brothers followed, from which, however, Bohemond was speedily diverted by the Crusades, which opened up a wider field for his ambition. Accompanied by his cousin Tancred, he led an army of 10,000 cavalry and 20,000 infantry, with which he would have besieged Constantinople had he been able to persuade Godfrey of Bouillon to join him. He took a leading part in the battle of Dorylaeum (1097), and the other engagements of the campaign in Asia Minor. A year later he besieged and captured Antioch, of which he assumed the principality. In 1101 he was defeated and taken prisoner by the Turks. Released, after a captivity of two years, on the payment of a very heavy ransom, he returned to Europe to collect troops. In 1106 he visited France, and married Constance, a daughter of Philip I. With an army levied in France, in right of his marriage, he renewed Avar with Alexius, but being unsuccessful in the siege of Durazzo he was obliged to conclude a peace in 1108. He died at Canossa in Apulia in 1111. (See Gibbon’s Decline and Fall, c. lviii., lx.; and Michaud’s Histoire de Croisades.')
