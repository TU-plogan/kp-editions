BELSHAZZAR, the name of a Babylonian prince mentioned in the book of Daniel. According to the account in the fifth chapter of Daniel, Belshazzar was king of Babylon at the time of the capture of the city by the Medes and Persians, and was slain when the city was surprised during a festival. No ancient historian mentions the name of Belshazzar among the successors of Nebuchadnezzar, and there has been considerable controversy as to the identity of the unfortunate monarch. The successors of Nebuchadnezzar, according to the copyists of Berosus, were as follows :—Evil-merodach, two years, son of Nebuchadnezzar; Neriglissar, or Nergalsharezer, four years, son-in-law of Nebuchadnezzar; Laborosoarchod, nino months, son of Neriglissar; Nabonidus, seventeen years, not of the royal family. Niebuhr and some others identified Belshazzar with Evil-merodach; other scholars with Neriglissar; and a third section, including Ewald and Browne, identified him with Nabonidus. There is no necessity now to argue against these and similar views, as they are set aside by the Babylonian cuneiform inscriptions, which show that Bel-sar-uzur, or Belshazzar, was the name of the eldest son of Nabonidus, the last king of Babylon. In some of his latter inscriptions Nabu-nahid or Nabonidus mentions his eldest son Bel-sar-uzur in such terms as to lead to the impression that the young prince was associated with himself on the throne; and this explains several difficulties between the historians and the book of Daniel with respect to the capture of Babylon. After the defeat of the Babylonian forces Nabonidus fled to Borsippa, while the young prince Belshazzar was left in charge of Babylon, the capital, which was closely besieged by the Medes and Persians. The historians all say that Nabonidus, the last king of Babylon, submitted to the conquerors at Borsippa after the taking of his capital, while the book of Daniel states that Belshazzar was slain on the night of the capture of Babylon. These two statements have been supposed to contradict each other, but we now know that they refer to two totally distinct princes whose fates were quite different. The inscriptions of Nabonidus which mention Belshazzar are found on clay cylinders from Mugheir and other Chaldean sites, and they were first discovered and published by Sir Henry Rawlinson, to whom we owe this rectification in ancient history. One of these passages in a prayer reads: “Me Nabu-nahid, king of Babylon, from sin against thy great divinity, do thou save me, and health and long days numerous do thou multiply. And of Bel-sar-uzur,—my eldest son, the delight of my heart in the worship of thy great divinity, his heart do thou establish, and may he not consort with sinners.” The other texts are after the same form, and give no new details as to Belshazzar,—the account in the fifth chapter of Daniel containing all that is known of his history. The numerous works written on this subject before the discovery of the cuneiform inscriptions are [9:3:554] now of little value; all that is known with any certainty on the matter will be found in Rawlinson’s Great Monarchies, 2d edition, vol. iii.
