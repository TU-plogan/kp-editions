BERGMANN, Torbern Olof, Swedish chemist and naturalist, was born at Catherinberg, West Gothland, in 1735. At the age of seventeen he entered the University of Upsala, and distinguished himself by extraordinary assiduity in study, directing his attention more particularly to the natural sciences. During a residence at home rendered necessary by his weak health, he employed himself in collecting specimens of insects and plants, which he forwarded to Linnaeus, who was much pleased with them. In 1756 he gained great reputation by his memoir on the Coccus aquaticus, which, contrary to the opinion of Linnaeus, he proved to be nothing but the ovum of a certain species of leech. Some years later he was made professor of physics at Upsala, and published numerous scientific memoirs. In 1767 the chair of chemistry and mineralogy having become vacant through the resignation of Wallerius, Bergmann resolved to become a candidate. He had not hitherto devoted special attention to chemistry, but in a very short period by incredible application he produced as evidence of his fitness for the post a paper on the composition of alum, which is still regarded as a masterpiece. He was appointed to the chair, which he held till his death in 1784. In 1776 he had declined an offer from the king of Prussia inviting him to settle in Berlin. Bergmann was an unusually acute and sagacious analytical chemist, and made extensive and constant use of the laboratory. He described very carefully the properties of carbonic acid gas, and gave a valuable analysis of mineral waters. His researches in mineralogy, to which he applied his geometrical knowledge, were even more important, and led the way to Hauy’s discovery and classification. The theory of elective or chemical affinities, which he worked out very fully, has had great influence in the history of chemistry. A collection of Bergmann’s papers was published from 1779 to 1783, Opuscula Physica et Cluemica, 6 vols. They have been translated into French, German, and English.
