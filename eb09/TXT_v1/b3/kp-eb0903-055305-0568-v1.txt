BELSHAM, Thomas, a Unitarian clergyman, was born at Bedford in 1750. He was educated at the Dissenting Academy at Da7entry, where for seven years he acted as assistant tutor. After three years spent in a charge at Worcester, he returned as head of the Davcntry Academy, a post which he continued to hold till 1789, when, having adopted Unitarian principles, he resigned all connection with the institution. He superintended during its brief existence a new college at Hackney, and was then called to the charge of the Gravel Pit congregation, which had been formerly held by the famous Priestley. In 1805 he was appointed to the Essex Street chapel, where he remained till his death in 1829. Belsham’s first work of importance, Review of Air Wilberforce's Treatise entitled Practical View, 1798, was written after his conversion to Unitarianism. His most popular work was the Evidences of Christianity; the most important was his translation and exposition of the Epistles of St Paul. He was also the author of a work on philosophy, Elements of the Philosophy of the Human Mind, 1801, which is entirely based on Hartley’s psychology. Belsham is one of the most vigorous and able writers on the Unitarian side.
