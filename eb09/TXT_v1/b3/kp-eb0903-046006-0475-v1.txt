BEAN, the seed of certain leguminous plants cultivated for food all over the world, and furnished chiefly by the genera Faba, Phaseolus, Dolichos, Cajanus, and Soja. The common bean, in all its varieties, as cultivated in Britain and on the continents of Europe and America, is the produce of the Faba vulgaris. The French bean, kidney bean, or haricot, is the seed of the Phaseolus vulgaris; but in India several other species of this genus of plants are raised, and form no small portion of the diet of the inhabitants. From the genus Dolichos, again, the natives of India and South America procure beans or pulse, of no small importance as articles of diet, such as the D. ensiformis, or sword bean of India, the Lima beans, &c. Besides these there are numerous other pulses cultivated for the food both of man and domestic animals, to which the name beans is frequently given. The common bean is even more nutritious than wheat; and it contains a very high proportion of nitrogenous matter under the form of legumin, which amounts on an average to 24 per cent. It is, however, a rather coarse food, and difficult of digestion, and is chiefly used to feed horses, for which it is admirably adapted. In England French beans are chiefly, almost exclusively, used in the green state; the whole pod being eaten as a table vegetable, or prepared as a pickle. It is wholesome and nutritious; and in Holland and Germany the pods are preserved in salt by almosFevery family for winter and spring use. The green pods are cut across obliquely, most generally by a machine invented for the purpose, and salted in barrels. When wanted for use they are steeped in fresh water to remove the salt, and broiled or stewed; they form an agreeable addition to the diet at a time when no other vegetable may be had. Under the name of carob beans or locusts, the legume of Ceratonia siliqua is cultivated on the shores of the Mediterranean [9:3:461] and used as food for cattle. The shells of the carob bean contain a large proportion of sugar, and are often consumed as a dainty by children. These beans were formerly supposed to be the locusts eaten by John the Baptist, and hence have been called St John’s bread. The Tonka, or Tonquin bean, is the produce of Dipterix odorata, a leguminous seed with a fine odour, used in perfumery and largely for scenting snuff. The Calabar ordeal bean is a highly poisonous leguminous seed. There are also several non-leguminous seeds to which the popular name bean is attached. Among these may be mentioned the sacred Egyptian or Pythagorean bean (Nelumbium speciosum), and the Ignatius bean (probably Strychnos multiflora), a source of strychnine. For the cultivation, &c., of the common bean, see Agriculture, vol. i. p. 360. The ancient Greeks and Romans made use of beans in gathering the votes of the people, and for the election of magistrates. A white bean signified absolution, and a black one condemnation. Beans had a mysterious use in the lemuralia and parentalia, where the master of the family, after washing his hands three times, threw black beans over his head nine times, continuing to repeat the words, “I redeem myself and my family by these beans.”
