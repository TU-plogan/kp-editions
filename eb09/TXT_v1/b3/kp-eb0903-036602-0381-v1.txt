BARCA, a maritime district of Northern Africa, which formerly belonged to Tripoli, but was raised in 1869 to be a separate province immediately dependent on Constantinople. It extends from the Gulf of Sert (the ancient Syrtes) to the Egyptian frontier, between lat. 30° and 33° N. and between long. 20° and 25° E., and has an area of about 60,700 square miles. This territory is traversed from east to west by a mountain chain varying in height from 400 or 500 to upwards of 1800 feet. A great part of Barca, particularly towards the coast, is very fertile, abounding with excellent pasturage, and producing large supplies of corn. The chief town is Bengazi.
