BEDFORD, the county town of Bedfordshire, a municipal and parliamentary borough and market-town, situated in u fertile vale on both sides of the River Ouse, which is here crossed by a handsome stone bridge of five arches. It iβ 50 miles N.W. of London, and has excellent railway accommodation as well as a navigable river. It is a station on the main line of the Midland Railway. The town consists chiefly of one long wide street, intersected by smaller ones at right angles. It is well built, and numerous villas and small streets have been erected on the west side since the opening of the Midland main line in 1868. It has five parish churches, four of which contain architectural features.of interest. St Paul’s has lately undergone considerable restoration, and the tower and spire have been rebuilt. St Peter’s has been enlarged, but the ancient tower remains, in which are to be seen examples of Saxon work. St Mary’s has a fine Norman tower, but the remainder of the church has at different times been restored. St John’s has also been restored, but the original tower remains. St Cuthbert’s is a recent erection in the Norman style. A district church, dedicated to the Holy Trinity, was opened in 1841. There are also Independent, Methodist, Baptist, Roman Catholic, and other chapels. Bedford, in proportion to its size, has more public endowments than any other place in the kingdom, for which it is chiefly indebted to Sir W. Harper, Lord Mayor of London in 1561, who founded here a free school, and conveyed for its support, and for portioning poor maidens, a piece of ground in London, the surplus, if any, to be given to the poor. This ground has gradually risen in value so as now to produce nearly £14,000 annually. It' supports grammar, modern, preparatory, and other schools. Formerly much of this large endowment was appropriated to eleemosynary purposes, which did not tend to the elevation of the character of the people; but since the enactment of a scheme of the Endowed Schools Commission in 1874, the whole amount is expended upon the schools, except a small proportion for the endowment of forty-five alms-houses. The grammar school has eight exhibitions of £70 per annum each, at Oxford, Cambridge, or Dublin. Among the public buildings are the schools, the shire-hall, the jail, the infirmary, the county library and assembly rooms, and the new corn exchange. The commercial prosperity of this town is greatly aided by the works of the Messrs Howard and others, for the manufacture of agricultural implements, &c. There are also manufactures of straw and lace in the neighbourhood. Bedford is governed by a mayor, six aidermen, and eighteen councillors; and it sends two members to parliament. It is exceptionally well provided with sanitary appliances, having a new complete system of sewerage and water-works; and the sewage is conveyed to a farm about a mile from the town and utilized at once for growing crops of grass, roots, and corn. Population in 1871, 16,850.
