BELGÄM [Belgaum], a district of British India in the Bombay Presidency, extending from 15° 30' to 16° 15' N. lat., and 74° to 76° 30' E. long. It is bounded on the N. by the state of Miraj, on the N.E. by the Ralâdgi collectorate, on the E. by the states of Jâmkhandi and Mudhol, on the S. by the collectorates of Dhârwàr and Kânarâ, on the S.W. by the Portuguese territory of Goa, and on the W. by the states of Sâwantwâri and Kolhâpur. The principal rivers, none of which are navigable, are the Krishnâ, flowing through the northern; the Ghâtaprabhâ, through the centre; and the Mâlâprabhâ, through the southern portion of the collectorate. To the N. and E. the country is open and well cultivated, but to the S. it is intersected by spurs of the Sahyâdri range, thickly covered in some places with forest. Area, 4591 square miles. Population, 938,750 souls, or 204 to the square mile; 57 per cent. Hindus, 7 - 5 per cent. Mahometans, 5 per cent. Buddhists, ’ 5 Christians, and Ό1 Parsis. Marâthi and Kanarese are both spoken, the former chiefly in the W. and S. of the district, and the latter in the N. and E. The chief occupation of the people is agriculture, the other industries being spinning and weaving, manufactures in wood and metals, pottery, and shoemaking. There is also a considerable trade in cloth and silk. The principal agricultural products are rice, tawâri, râgi, wheat, bâjra, sugar-cane, barley, and pulses. Tobacco is cultivated to a small-extent. The entire revenue of the district amounts to £233,371, of which £179,321 is derived from the land revenue, and £17,597 from the local fund cess. Of the remainder £15,444 is derived from stamps, £14,996 from excise, assessed taxes yield £2344, and forests £3669. Of a total area of 4591 square miles, 1894 ’ 63 square miles are returned as cultivable, and 1729 - 7, or 37∣ percent, of the [9:3:514] total area, are actually under cultivation. The last settlement of the land revenue was made for a period of thirty years at various times between 1848 and 1864. The total imperial expenditure in the district amounts to <£98,097.
