BHARÄICH, a district of British India, under the jurisdiction of the Chief Commissioner of Oudh, situated between 28° 23' and 27° 4' N. lat, and 82° 11' and 81° 9' Έ. long. It is bounded on the N. by the independent state of Nepâl, on the E. and S.E. by the district of Gondâ. on the S.W. by the district of Bâra Bânki, and on the W. by the districts of Sitâpur and Kheri. Bharâich district consists of three tracts:—(1), in the centre, an elevated triangular plateau, projecting from the base of the Himalayas for about 50 miles in a south-easterly direction—average breadth 13 miles, area 670 square miles; (2), the great plain of the Ghagrâ, on the west, about 40 feet below the level of the plateau; and (3), on the east, another lesser area of depression. The Tarai, or the forest and marshy tracts along the southern slopes of the Himalayas, gradually merge within the district into drier land, the beds of the streams become deeper and more marked, the marshes disappear, and the country assumes the ordinary appearance of the plain of the Ganges. The Ghagrâ skirts the district for 114 miles; and the Rapti, with its branch the Bhaklâ, drains the high grounds.
