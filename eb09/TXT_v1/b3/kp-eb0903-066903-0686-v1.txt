BIJAINAGAR, or Bijanagar, an ancient city in the south of India, once the capital of a great Hindu empire, but now in ruins, situated on the south bank of the Tumbhadrâ River, directly opposite to Annagundi, in 15° 19' N. lat. and 76° 32' E. long. The city has been enclosed with strong stone walls on the east side, and is bounded by the river on the west, the circumference of the whole appearing to be about eight miles. The streets of this city, from 30 to 40 yards wide, can be traced between the immense piles of rocks crowned with pagodas; and one street yet remains perfect. The building of this metropolis was begun in 1336. Between the kings of the principality, of which it was the capital, and the Mahometan sovereigns of the Deccan constant hostility was maintained. In 1564 Ràm Râjâ, the king of Bijainagar, was totally overthrown on the plains of Telikotâ, by a combination of the four Mahometan sovereigns of the Deccan, who immediately marched to the metropolis, which they abandoned to pillage. From that time it has lain in ruins.
