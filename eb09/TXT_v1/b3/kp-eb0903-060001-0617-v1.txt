BERN, or Berne, a canton of Switzerland, situated between 46° 19' and 47° 30' N. lat., and between 6° 50' and 8° 28' E. long. It extends from the French and Alsace frontier south-east through the heart of the Confederacy to Valais, by which it is bounded on the S., while it has the cantons of Basel, Soleure, Aargau, Lucerne, Unterwalden, and Uri on the E., and Vaud, Freiburg, Neufchâtel on the W. Bern is the second largest canton of Switzerland, its surface being estimated at 2562 square miles. The population in 1870 amounted to 506,465, of whom 436,304 were Protestants, and 66,015 Catholics, while 1401 were Jews. German was spoken in 83,693 families, and French in 16,646, the latter language prevailing in the N.W. The canton is naturally divided into three regions, in which the climate varies with the elevation. The southern part, called the Oberland, is for its scenery the most attractive part of all Switzerland. Many of the grandest mountains of the Alpine system—such as the Grimsel, the Finsteraarhorn, the Schreckhorn, the Wetterhorn, the Eiger, and the Jungfrau—lie along the frontier chain, and numerous offshoots and valleys of great beauty stretch northward towards the central part of the canton. This latter district consists for the most part of an undulating plain, interspersed with lesser chains and hills,—the soil being fertile and well cultivated. The north is occupied with the ranges of the Jura system. The principal river in the canton is the Aar, which drains by far the larger proportion of its surface, either directly or by means of its numerous tributaries. Of these, the most important are the Saane, from the S.; the Thiele, which forms the outlet of the lakes of Bienne and Neufchâtel; and the Emme, which gives its name to the beautiful Emmenthal. The northern corner of the canton is divided between the basins of the Rhone and the Rhine. On the upper course of the Aar are the two lakes of Brienz and Thun. The mineral wealth of the country is neither extensive nor varied; but iron-mines are worked, and gold is found in the River Emme. Quarries of sandstone, marble, and granite are abundant. The pastures in the Oberland and the Emmenthal are excellent, and cattle and horses of the best description are largely reared. The latter district also produces cheese of excellent quality, which is exported to Germany and Italy. Fruit is extensively cultivated in the central region and in the neighbourhood of the lakes of Brienz and Thun; the vine is principally grown to the north ®f Lake Bienne. In the forests, which are of considerable importance, the prevailing trees are the fir, the pine, and the beech. The industrial productions of the canton are cotton, woollen and flaxen stuffs, leather, watches, and wooden wares of all kinds. Bern is divided into thirty bailiwicks or prefectures, each with a local administrator. The capital is Bern, and the other chief towns are Bienne or Biel, Thun, Burgdorf or Berthoud, Porrentruy or Pruntruit, and Délémont or Delsberg. The highest legislative authority is the Great Council, the members of which are chosen in proportion to the number of the people; and the executive power is in the hands of a lesser council of nine members, chosen by the Great Council for a space of four years. The educational institutions in the canton comprise a university and two gymnasiums in the capital, and progymnasiums and colleges at Biel, Thun, Burgdorf, Neuenstadt, Porrentruy, and Délémont. There is a deaf and dumb institution at Frienisberg, and a cantonal lunatic asylum at Waldau, about a mile from Bern.

Bern, the capital of the above canton, and, since 1848, the permanent seat of the Government and Diet of the Swiss Confederation. It is situated in 46° 47' N. lat. and 7° 25' E. long., at an elevation of 1710 feet above the sea, on a sandstone peninsula, formed by the windings of the Aar, which is crossed on the south side of the city by an extensive weir, and further down passes under four bridges connecting the peninsula with the right bank. It is one of the most characteristically Swiss towns; some of the streets are broad and regular, the houses being well built with hewn stone; in others a peculiar effect is produced by the presence of lines of arcades down the sides. Prominent among the public buildings is the Federal Council Hall, or Bundes-Rathhaus, a fine structure in the [9:3:601] Florentine style, which was completed in 1∙>857. The upper story is occupied by a picture-gallery of some value. The town-hall dates from 1406, and was restored in ⅛861. Among the ecclesiastical buildings the first place is held by the cathedral, a richly-decorated Gothic edifice, begun in 1421 and completed in 1573, from the neighbourhood of which a splendid view of the Alps is obtained. Educational institutions are very numerous, comprising a university, founded in 1834, which is attended by 250 students, a gymnasium, and a veterinary school. Attached to the university are a botanical garden and an observatory; and there are, besides, a valuable museum, a public library of 45,000 volumes, especially rich in works relating to Swiss history, and several literary and scientific societies. Among the charitable establishments are two large hospitals (the Inselspital and the Bürgerspital), a foundling hospital, two orphan asylums, and a lunatic asylum. Another aeylum was erected in 1854, about 2∣ miles from the city. The penitentiary is capable of containing 400 prisoners. Among other buildings of interest are the granary, which, till 1830, used to be stored with corn in case of famine; the clock tower, with its automatic pantomime; the arsenal, with its mediaeval treasures; the mint; and the Murtner Gate. The most frequent ornament throughout the city is the figure of the bear, in allusion to the mythical origin of the name of Bern; and the authorities still maiutain a bear’s den at municipal expense. Although, properly speaking, not a commercial city, Bern carries on some trade in woollen cloth, printed calico, muslin, silk stuffs, straw hats, stockings, and other articles of home manufacture. The climate is severely cold in winter, owing to the elevation of the situation. The population, which is mainly Protestant, was 36,000 in 1870.

Bern was founded, or at least fortified, by Berthold V. of Zähringen, about the end of the 12th or beginning of the 13th century, and gradually became a refuge for those who were oppressed by feudal exactions in the neighbouring countries. In 1218 it was declared a free imperial city by the Emperor Frederick II. At first its constitution was purely democratic; but in 1293 a legislative body of 200 citizens was appointed, which formed the germ of one of the most remarkable oligarchies in modern European history. The extension of territory, gradually effected by the valour of the Bernese, rendered necessary a more elaborate and rigid organization than that which had sufficed while the limits of the city were almost the limits of the state; and the power of the .nobility at home was strengthened by every new success against the enemies of the city. The blow that decided the fate of Bern was struck at Laupen on June 21, 1339, when Rudolph von Erlach beat the allied army of the neighbouring states. It continued to flourish, and in 1352 joined the Swiss Confederation. A fire destroyed the city in 1405, but it was rebuilt on the same plan. In the 17th century the gradually increasing aristocratic tendency reached its climax. The adoption of new burghers was forbidden, and the burghers proper were carefully distinguished from those who were merely permanent inhabitants of the city; the burghers were divided into th03e capable of holding office in the state and those destitute of that privilege; and the privileged class itself, which, by 1785, numbered only 69 families, was subdivided into a higher and a lower grade. This élite grew more and more exclusive and domineering, and at last became unendurable to their humbler fellow-citizens. In 1748 the discontent made itself evident in a formidable conspiracy, of which the unfortunate Henzi was one of the leaders. The conspiracy was crushed, but the opposition broke out through other channels. At last the French Revolution came to submerge the aristocracy in a general Helvetian republic; and when the flood had passed the ancient landmarks eould not be replaced, though a restoration was attempted with at first an appearance of success. The Liberal party has long been the strongest in the canton, which has at last returned almost to democracy; for, in 1870, the referendum was introduced, by which it is agreed that all laws, after being discussed by the Great Council, shall first receive the sanction of the people before they come into force.
