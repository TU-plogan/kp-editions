BALKH, the ancient Bactra or Zariaspa, was formerly a great city, but is now for the most part a mass of ruins, situated on the right bank of the Adirsiah or Balkh river, in a large and fertile plain 1800 feet above the sea. The modern name is, according to Vambéry, the Turkish batik, or balikh, a city. The ruins, which occupy a space of about twenty miles in circuit, consist chiefly of fallen mosques and decayed buildings of sun-burnt brick. No monuments of pre-Mahometan date have been pointed out, if we except the bricks with cuneiform inscriptions which Ferrier asserts he observed; but nothing like a proper investigation of the site has yet been effected. The antiquity and greatness of the place are recognised by the native populations, who speak of it as the Mother of Cities. Its foundation is mythically ascribed to Kaiomurs, the Persian Romulus; and it is at least certain that, at a very early date, it was the rival of Ecbatana, Nineveh, and Babylon. For a long time the city and country was the central seat of the Zoroastrian religion, the founder of which is said to have died within the walls. From the Memoirs of Hwm Thsang, a Chinese traveller, we learn that, at the time of his visit in the 7th century, there were in the city, or its vicinity, about a hundred Buddhist convents, with 3000 devotees, and that there was a large number of stupas, and other religious monuments. The most remarkable was the Nau Behar, Nava Bihara, or New Convent, which possessed a very costly statue of Buddha. A curious notice of this building is found in the Arabian geographer Yâkût. Ibn-Haukal, an Arabian traveller of the 10th century, describes Balkh as built of clay, with ramparts and six gates, and extending half a parasang. He also mentions a castle and a mosque. El Edrisi, in the 12th century, speaks of its possessing a variety of educational establishments, and carrying on an active trade. There were several important commercial routes from the city, stretching as far east as India and China. In 1220 Genghis Khan sacked Balkh, butchered its inhabitants, and levelled all the buildings capable of defence,—treatment to which it was again subjected in the 14th century by Timur. Notwithstanding this, however, Marco Polo can still, in the following century, describe it as “a noble city and a great.” Balkh formed the government of Λurungzebe in his youth. In 1736 it was conquered by Nadir Shah. Under the Durani monarchy it fell into the hands of the Afghans; it was conquered by Shah Murad of Kunduz in 1820, and for some time has been subject to the Khan of Bokhara.
