BHANDÂRÂ, a district of British India, under the jurisdiction of the Chief Commissioner of the Central Provinces, situated between 20° and 22° N. lat., and 79° and 81° E. long. It is bounded on the N. by the districts of Seonf and Bâlâghât, on the E. by the district of Râipur, on the S. by the district of Chândâ, and on the W. by the district of Nagpur. To the north, north-east, and east, a natural boundary line is marked out by lofty hills, inhabited by Gonds and other aboriginal tribes, while the west and north-west are comparatively open. Small branches of the Sâtpurâ range make their way into the interior of the district. The Ambagarh, or Sendurjhari hills, which skirt the south of the Chandpur parganâ, have an average height of between 300 and 400 feet above the level of the plain. The other elevated tracts are the Balâhi hills, the Kanheri hills, and the Nawegâon hills. The Waingangâ is the principal river in the district, and the only stream that does not dry up in the hot weather,—its affluents within the district being the Bâwanthari, Bâghnadi, Kanhân, and Chulban. There are 3648 small lakes and tanks in Bhandârâ district, whence it is called the “lake region of Nâgpur;” they afford ample means of irrigation. More than one-third of the district lies under jungle, which yields gum, medicinal fruits and nuts, edible fruits, lac, honey, and the blossoms of the mdhua tree (Bassia latifolia) , which are eaten by the poorer classes, and used for the manufacture of a kind of spirit. Tigers, panthers, deer, wild hogs, and other wild animals abound in the forests, and during the rainy season many deaths occur from snake-bites.

Bhandârâ district contains an assessed area of 3148*61 square miles, or 2,015,114 acres, of which 819,922 acres were under cultivation in 1869; 30,845 acres, grazing lands; 550,922 acres, cultivable but not under cultivation; and 613,425 acres uncultivable waste. The census of 1872 gave the total area of the district at 3922 square miles, and returned the population at 564,819 (144 to the square mile), residing in 106,121 houses and 1589 villages. Of the total population, 472,151, or 83*60 per cent., were Hindus; 10,696, or 1*89 per cent., Mahometans; 520 Buddhists or Jains; 61 Christians; and 81,379, or 14*41 per cent., were aboriginal tribes of unspecified religion. The Hindu population is chiefly divided into the following castes:—Brahmans, “Pardesis,” or foreigners (generally Rajputs), Ponwârs, Lodhis, Kunbis, Koris, KalaJs, Telis, Dhimars, Koshtis, Goârâs, and Dhers. The inhabitants are rude and unpolished in their manners, and slothful in their habits. The agricultural products of the district consist of rice, wheat, grain, pulses, peas, sugar-cane, oil-seeds, and cotton; the following being an estimate of the acreage under different crops :— rice, 543,019 acres; wheat, 86,064; other food grains, 147,982; oil-seeds, 27,068; sugar-cane, 12,561; fibres, 197; tobacco, 558; and vegetables, 2128 acres—total, 819,477 acres, or 1280*43 square miles. Iron is the chief mineral product. Gold is also found in the bed of the Son Nadi, but does not repay the trouble of searching for it. Laterite, shale, and sandstone occur all over the district— the largest quarries being near Bhandârâ town, at Korambi, and in the Balâhi hills. Native cloth, brass wrres, pot-stone wares, cartwheels, straw and reed baskets, and a small quantity of silk, form the only manufactures of the district. Cotton, salt, wheat, rice, oil-seeds, hardware, English piece goods, tobacco, silk, dyes, and cattle, are its chief articles of import; and country cloth, tobacco, and hardware its exports. The Great Eastern Road is the only well-raised, bridged, and metalled road in the district; but there are also five or six second-class roads, unmetalled and unbridged, but levelled, and sloped at the crossings of water-courses. The revenue demand for 1868-69 amounted to £40,296, 8s. from land, £5592, 2s. from excise, £3774, 18s. from stamps, £2553, 10s. from forests, £5051, 10s. from assessed taxes—total, £57,268, 8s. The regular police force of 442 men was maintained in 1868 at a cost of £5584,10s., exclusive of the village watch. In 1868 the district contained 38 Government and 78 private schools, affording instruction to 7109 boys and 215 girls. Four towns have upwards of 5000 inhabitants: (1.) Bhandarâ—population, 11,433; municipal income, £486; expenditure, £645,6s.; rate of taxation, 10⅛d. per head; (2.) Tumsal—population, 7367; municipal income, £1305; expenditure, £554, 10s.; rate of taxation, 3s. 6⅛d. per head; (3.) Mohâxf— population, 6183; municipal revenue, £198; expenditure, £244, 2s.; rate of taxation, 7fd. per head; (4.) Pauni—population, 8976; municipal revenue, £174,10s.; expenditure, £233,18s.; rate of taxation, 4|d. per head. Bhandârâ district contains 25 semi-independent chiefships, having an area of 1509 square miles, and a population of 166,005 souls in 1866. These little states are exempted from the revenue system, and only paya light tribute. Their territory, however, is included within the returns of area and population above given. The climate of Bhandârâ is unhealthy,—the prevailing diseases being fever, small-pox, and cholera. Nothing is known of the early history of the district. Tradition says that at a remote period a tribe of men, called the Gaulis or Gaulars, overran and conquered it. At the end of the 17th century it belonged to the Gond Râjâ of Deogarh. In 1738 it was conquered by the Marhattâs, who governed it till the year 1854, when it lapsed to the British Government, the Râjâ of Nâgpur having died without an heir.

Bhandaea, the principal town and headquarters of the district of the same name, is situated on the Waingangâ, about 38 miles east of Nâgpur. The town is kept neat and clean, is well drained, and is considered healthy. In 1872 it contained a total population of 11,433 souls, of whom 9657 were Hindus, 1450 Mahometans, 58 Buddhists and Jains, 54 Christians, and 214 of unspecified religion. For income, &c., see above. The town enjoys a considerable trade in cotton cloth and the local hardware.
