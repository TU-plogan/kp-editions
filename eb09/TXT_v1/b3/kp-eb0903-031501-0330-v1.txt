BANJARMASSIN, a district in the south-east of Borneo, which was incorporated by the Dutch in consequence of the war of 1860, in regard to the succession in the sultanate, which had been under their protection since 1787. It is watered by the river system of the Banjar, and traversed by a chain of mountains that in some places reaches the height of 3000 feet. The district has been divided by the Dutch into the residency of Kween and the sub-residencies of Amuntal and Martapura. The town of Martapura was the seat of the sultan from 1771. The principal productions of the district are gold, diamonds, coal, pepper and other spices, drugs, edible birds’ nests, gum, wax, rattans, &c. The inland portion is covered with forest, while the flat and swampy seaboard is largely occupied by rice-fields. The inhabitants, who are for the most part Dayaks, are roughly estimated from 300,000 to 600,000.

Banjarmassin, the chief town of the above district, also known as Fort Tatas, is situated about 15 miles from the mouth of the Banjar, in lat. 3° 23' S., long. 114° 37' E. The most of the houses are built on piles, as the town is subject to frequent inundations. In 1700 the East Indian Company established a factory here; but the place was found to be unhealthy, and the Company’s servants were finally attacked by the natives, whom they repulsed with great difficulty. The settlement was abandoned. The English again seized Banjarmassin in 1811, but restored it iu 1817. The trade consists in the export of the products of the surrounding country and the import of cloth, Chinese pottery, all kinds of metal goods, opium, tobacco, and salt. The population is of a very mixed character, and is estimated at upwards of 30,000. Of the commercial community the Chinese form a very important portion. The coal mines, discovered in 1846 at Mount Pengaron, to the E., are largely worked by the Dutch.
