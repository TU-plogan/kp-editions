BIRCH, Thomas, historical and biographical writer, and one of the early trustees and benefactors of the British Museum, was born in London, November 23, 1705. He was the son of a coffee-mill maker, and was to have followed his father’s business; but his active mind and ambition of higher pursuits led him into the paths of literature. His parents were members of the Society of Friends, and therefore he had not the advantages of a university training. But by persevering application to study and to teaching he qualified himself for the ministry of the Church of England. In 1728 he obtained a curacy, and in the same year he married. His wife died in the following year. He was ordained priest in December 1731, and was soon after recommended to the favour of Philip Yorke, then attorney-general, afterwards Lord Chancellor and earl of Hardwicke, to whom he owed his successive preferments in the church. His first benefice was the vicarage of Ulting in Essex. In 1734 he was appointed domestic chaplain to the earl of Kilmarnock, who was beheaded for his share in the rebellion of ’45. He afterwards held successively benefices in Pembrokeshire, Gloucestershire, and the city of London. His last church preferment was to the rectory of Depden in Essex, to which he was presented in February 1761. In his latter years he was appointed chaplain to the princess Amelia. His literary attainments procured him election as a fellow of the Royal Society in February 1735, and in the following December he was chosen a member of the Society of Antiquaries. He held the office of Secretary to the Royal Society for thirteen years 1752-1765. From the university of Aberdeen he received the degrees first of M.A., and afterwards (1753) of D.D. The degree of D.D. was also conferred on him about the same time by the archbishop of Canterbury. Dr Birch was engaged in a large number of literary undertakings. His appetite and his capacity for hard work were extraordinary. Besides his diversified labours of compilation and editing, he transcribed many volumes in the library of Lambeth Palace, and carried on an extensive correspondence with literary men. He was an early riser; and amidst all his labours he found time to take part in social enjoyments. He was only in his sixty-first year when he was killed by a fall from his horse in Hampstead Road, January 9, 1766. He bequeathed his books and manuscripts, with part of his pictures and prints, to the British Museum. The rest of his property, in value about £500, he gave to be invested in Government securities, the interest to be applied in augmenting the salaries of the three assistant librarians.

His principal publications were—1. The General Dictionary, Historical and Critical, including a new translation of Bayle, and interspersed with several thousand new lives, in 10 volumes fol., 1734- 1741. 2.
