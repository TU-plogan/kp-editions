BALBI, Adrian, one of the most eminent geographers of modern times, was born at Venice in 1782. In 1820 he visited Portugal, and there collected materials for his well-known work entitled Essai Statistique sur le Royaume de Portugal et d’ Algarve, which was published at Paris in 1822. This was followed by Variétés Politiques et Statistiques de la Monarchie Portugaise, which contains some curious observations respecting that country under the Roman sway, and on the state of literature and the arts. In 1826 he published the first volume of his Atlas Ethnographique du Globe, &c., a work of great erudition, embodying the researches of the most distinguished German philologists and geographers. In 1832 appeared the A brégé de Géographie, which added greatly to the author’s reputation. This work, in an enlarged form, was translated into the principal languages of Europe. Balbi afterwards retired to Padua, where he continued to pursue his favourite science with unabated ardour. Besides those already mentioned, he was the author of several other works in the same department of science. He died on the 14th of March 1848.
