BEECHEY, Frederick William, a distinguished naval officer and navigator, son of Sir William Beechey, R.A., was born in London, in 1796. In 1806, at the age of ten, he entered the navy, and was for several years engaged in active service during the wars with France and America. In 1818 he served under Franklin in Buchan’s Arctic expedition, of which at a later period he published a narrative; and in the following year he accompanied Parry in the “Hecla.” In 1821 he took part in the survey of the Mediterranean coast, under the direction of Captain, afterwards Admiral, Smyth. He and his brother, H. W. Beechey, made an overland survey of the north coast of Africa, of which a full and valuable account was published in 1827. In 1825 he was appointed to the “Blossom,” which was intended to explore Behring’s Straits in concert with Franklin and Parry. He passed Behring’s Straits and penetrated as far as lat. 71° 23' 31" N., and long. 156° 2Γ 30" W., reaching a point only 146 miles west of that reached by Franklin’s expedition from the Mackenzie River. The whole voyage lasted more than three years; and in the course of it Beechey discovered several islands in the Pacific, and an excellent harbour near Cape Prince of Wales. A full narrative of his voyage was published in 1825-28. From 1835 to 1847 Captain Beechey was employed on the coast survey of South America and Ireland. He was then appointed by Government to preside over the Marine Department of the Board of Trade. In 1854 he was made rear-admiral, and in the following year wae elected president of the Geographical Society. He died on the 29th Nov. 1856.
