BINTANG, one of the islands which mark the south side of the Strait of Singapore. The latter is the exit towards China and Siam of the great channel which we call the Straits of Malacca. Bintang lies between 104° 13' and 104° 40' E. long., with a central latitude of 0° 52' N. It has an area of about 440 square miles, and is surrounded by many rocks and small islands, making navigation dangerous. The soil is not fertile, and much of it is swampy. The chief product is gambir, of which upwards of 4000 tons are annually exported, with pepper and some other spices and fruits. The island is a good deal visited by Malay and Chinese traders. The highest hill in it is 1385 feet high, and there are five rivers, but these navigable only by small boats.

Bintang is mentioned by Marco Polo under the name of Pentam, which is not far from the genuine Malay name Bcntan, said to mean a half-moon, and to apply properly to the mountain just mentioned. The name appears on a mediaeval Javanese inscription, as that of one of the numerous kingdoms conquered by the sovereigns reigning at Majapahit, in Java.

After the Portuguese conquest of Malacca (1511), the expelled Mahometan dynasty took up its residence on Bintang, where it long cherished pirates. The island still belongs nominally to the representative of these kings of Malacca, whom we usually style the sultan of Johor, the Dutch the sultan of Lingen. Supremacy is, however, claimed and exercised by the Dutch, whose port of FJιio or Riouw, founded as a rival to Singapore, stands on a small island off the western coast of Bintang.

Bintang, regarded as the residence of the expelled sultans of Malacca, is the Bintâo whereof Camoens speaks as the persistent foe of Portuguese Malacca ·—

“No reino de Bintâo, que tantos danos Tcrä a Malaca muito tempo J citos. ”
