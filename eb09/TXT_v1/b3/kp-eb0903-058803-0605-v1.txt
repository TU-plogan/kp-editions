BERGERAC, the chief town of an arrondissement in the department of Dordogne, in France, situated in a fertile plain, 30 miles S.S.W. of Périgueux, on both banks of the Dordogne, which is here crossed by a fine bridge of five arches and rendered navigable by a large dam. The town is rather poorly built, and, in spite of its age, contains no monuments of antiquarian interest. It is, however, a place of great industrial activity, has a communal college, tribunals of primary jurisdiction and commerce, and a public library; and manufactures paper, iron and copper wares, hats, hosiery, and leather. The wines of the neighbourhood are in good repute, and form an important article in the trade of the town, which is principally carried on with Bordeaux and Libourne. Bergerac owes its origin to the abbey of St Martin, which was founded in 1080, and during the English invasions it played an important part as a fortress. In the 16th century it was a very flourishing and populous place, but most of its inhabitants having embraced Calvinism it suffered greatly during the religious wars. Its fortifications and citadel were demolished by Louis XIII. in 1621, and it was injuriously affected by the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. Population in 1872, 8679.
