BEUDANT, François Sulpice, a French mineralogist and geologist, was born at Paris in 1787, and died in 1862. He was educated at the Polytechnic and Normal schools, and in 1811 was appointed professor of mathematics at the Lycée of Avignon. Thence he was called, in 1813, to the Lycée of Marseilles to fill the post of professor of physics. In the following year the royal mineralogical cabinet was committed to his charge to be conveyed into England, and from that time his attention seems to have been directed principally towards geology and cognate sciences. In the year 1818 he undertook, at the expense of Government, a geological journey through Hungary, and the results of his researches, Voyoge Minéralogique et Géologique en Hongrie, 3 vols. 4to, with atlas, published in 1822, established for him a European reputation. He was about the same time appointed to the professorship of mineralogy in the Paris Faculty of Sciences. His treatises on physics (Traité de Physique, 6th ed., 1838) and on mineralogy and geology (Cours Elémentaire de Minéralogie et Géologie, 1841) were very popular. Beudant also, when holding the post of inspector of the university, published a valuable French grammar.
