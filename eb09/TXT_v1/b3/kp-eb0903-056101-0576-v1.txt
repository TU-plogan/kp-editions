BENEVENTO, a city of Italy, the capital of a province, situated on a hill near the confluence of the Calore and the Sabato, 32 miles N.E. of Naples. The town is surrounded by walls, and was formerly defended by a castle of the 12th century, which now contains Government offices and a prison. It occupies the site of the ancient Beneventum, and is largely built of its ruins. Except Rome, few cities can boast of so many remains of antiquity. Of these the most beautiful and perfect is the arch of Trajan, erected in 114 A.D., 53 feet in height, and consisting of a single arch of Parian marble of the Corinthian order, highly ornamented with basso and alto rilievos, which represent various events in the reign of that emperor. It now forms one of the gates of the city {Porta Aurea). Of the amphitheatre the remains, now known as Grottoni di Mappa, are in a very ruinous condition, and the arena is occupied by houses of a mean description. Benevento is the see of a bishop, and has a cathedral of the 12th century in the Lombardo-Saracenic style, in front of which is an Egyptian obelisk of granite covered with hieroglyphics. Among its other buildings may be mentioned the town-hall, the diocesan seminary, the lyceum, which was formerly a Jesuit college, and several hospitals. The principal manufactures are leather, parchment, and plated goods. A considerable trade is carried on in grain.

Beneventum, or, as it was originally called, Maloeis or Maleventum, seems to have been of Samnite foundation. In 268 B.c. it was colonized by the Romans, who had probably been in possession of it for some time. During the second Punic war two of the most important battles were fought in the neighbourhood. It continued to be a very flourishing city till the close of the empire, and from its position on the Via Appia, it often comes into notice. About 545 A.D. it was sacked by Totila, but before long had recovered its prosperity. Being raised to the rank of a duchy by Alboin, king of the Lombards, it continued in possession of its own dukes till 1053, when the emperor, Henry III., who had rendered himself master of the city, exchanged it with Leo IX. for the bishopric of Bamberg. From that time it continued in Papal possession till 1806, when the Emperor Napoleon I. bestowed it, with the title of prince, on Talleyrand.
