BEAUSOBRE, Isaac de, a learned Protestant writer, of French origin, was born at Niort in 1659, and after studying theology at the Protestant Academy of Saumur, was ordained at the age of twenty-two. He was forced into Holland to avoid the execution of a sentence condemning him to make the amende honorable for having broken the royal signet, which was put upon the door of a church of the reformers to prevent the public profession of their religion. He went to Berlin in 1694, and was made chaplain to the king of Prussia, and counsellor of the royal consistory. He died in 1738, aged seventy-nine, after having published several works, among which may be mentioned—(1.) Défense de la Doctrine des Déformés, sur la Providence, sur la Prédestination, sur la Grâce, et sur Γ Eucharistie (Magdeburg, 1694-8); (2.) A translation of the New Testament, with Notes, jointly with Μ. Lenfant (1718), much esteemed among Protestants; (3.) Dissertation sur les Adamites de Boheme, a curious work; (4.) Histoire Critique de Manichée et du Manichéisme, 2 tom. 4to (Amst., 1734-9), a very learned and valuable work, discussing, as Gibbon observes, “many deep questions of Pagan and Christian theology, and forming a rich treasury of facts and opinions ;” (5.) Several dissertations in the Bibliothèque Britannique. Beausobre had strong sense with profound erudition, and was one of the best writers of his time, and he preached as he wrote, with spirit and ability.
