BIBERACH, a town of Wurtemberg, in the circle of the Danube, a capital of a bailiwick 23 miles S.S.W. of Ulm. It iβ situated on the River Riss, a small tributary of the Danube, partly on level ground and partly on hulls, and still has a somewhat mediaeval appearance from the remains of its ancient walls and towers. Its principal church dates from the 12 th century, and it possesses a hospital with very extensive endowments. The main objects of its varied industry are toys, cloth goods of different kinds, lace, paper, and leather; and there are also bell-foundries and breweries. In the neighbourhood is the watering-place called Jordansbad. Biberach appears as a village in the 8th century, and in the 15th it became a free imperial city. During the Thirty Years’ War it underwent various vicissitudes, and was for a good while held by the Swedes. In 1707 it was captured and put to ransom by the French, Who afterwards, in 1796 and 1800, defeated the Austrians in the neighbourhood. In 1803 the city was deprived of its imperial freedom and assigned to. Baden; and in 1806 it was transferred to Wiirtemberg. Biberach is the birthplace of the sculptor Natter and the painter Neher; and Wieland, who was born at the neighbouring village of Oberholzheim, spent a series of years in the town.
