BEDELL, William, bishop of Kilmore and Ardagh, in Ireland, was born at Black Notley, in Essex, in 1570. He was educated at Cambridge, took orders, and, after leaving the university, settled for some years as clergyman in Bury St Edmunds. He was then appointed chaplain to Sir H. Wotton, English ambassador at Venice. In that town Bedell remained for eight years, acquiring great reputation as a scholar and theologian. He translated the Book of Common Prayer into Italian, and was on terms of closest friendship with Sarpi (Fra Paolo), the famous historian of the Council of Trent. In 1615, some time after his return to England, he was appointed to the rectory of Hornings-heath, in Suffolk, which he held for twelve years. He was then called to the provostship of Trinity College, Dublin, and relinquished that office after two years for the united bishoprics of Kilmore and Ardagh. As bishop he won the respect and love of his people by the uprightness and purity of his conduct. He set himself diligently to reform the abuses of his diocese, and personally undertook the duties generally discharged by the bishop’s lay chancellor. In 1641, when the Protestants were being massacred in the Irish rebellion, Bedell’s house was not only left untouched, but became the place of refuge for many fugitives. In the end, however, the rebels insisted upon the dismissal of all who had taken shelter in his house, and on the bishop’s refusal he was seized and imprisoned with some others in the ruined castle of Loughboughter. Here he was detained for several weeks, and when released, rapidly sank from the effects of exposure on his weakened constitution. He died on the 7th February 1642. His life was written by Burnet.
