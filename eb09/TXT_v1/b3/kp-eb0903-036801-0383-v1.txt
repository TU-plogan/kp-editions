BARCLAY, Alexander, an English poet, was born probably about 1476. His nationality has been matter of much literary dispute, but the evidence on the whole seems to point to the conclusion that, though he spent the greater part of his life in England, he was a native of Scotland. The place of his education is equally doubtful; he studied at one of the great English universities, but at which has not yet been settled by his biographers. He received a benefice from the provost of Oriel College, Oxford, and it might therefore be inferred that he had been a student at that place. But Oxford is nowhere referred to in his writings, whereas Cambridge is mentioned once. He appears to have travelled on the Continent after completing his university course, and on his return received an appointment as chaplain in the collegiate church at Ottery St Mary in Devonshire. He afterwards became a Benedictine monk of the monastery of Ely, and at length assumed the habit of St Francis at Canterbury. Having survived the dissolution of the monasteries, he became successively vicar of Much-Badew in Essex, and, in 1546, of Wokey in Somersetshire; and a few months before his death he was presented by the dean and chapter of Canterbury to the rectory of All-Saints in Lombard Street. As he retained some of his preferments in the reign of Edward VI., it is presumed that he must have complied with the changes of the times. He died at an advanced age in the year 1552, and w as interred at Croydon. Barclay wrote at a period when the standard of English poetry was extremely low; and, as excellence is always comparative, this circumstance may partly enable us to account for the high reputation which he enjoyed among his contemporaries. At the same time his best work, being a comprehensive and easily understood satire on the manners of the times, naturally acquired a wide popularity, and was extensively read. The title given to it was the Ship of Fooles, and it was first printed by Pinson in 1509. The original design, and many of the details, were derived from Sebastian Brandt, a civilian of Strasburg, who in 1494 published a poem entitled Das Narren Schyff, which was so well adapted to the taste of the age that a Latin and a French version appeared in 1497, and another French version in 1498. Barclay professes to have translated “oute of Laten, Frenche, and Doche;” but to the original cargo he has added many fools of English growth. Under the representation of a ship freighted with fools of various denominations, the poet exposes the prevalent vices and follies of the age; and although, as Warton remarks, the poem is destitute of plot and the voyage of adventures, the general design was found to possess many attractions. The w ork is of considerable importance, as giving a clear though by no means pleasing picture of English society and lower class life in the time of Henry VIII., and also as marking a stage in the progress of the English language. Barclay’s vocabulary is essentially that of the people. His other works are— The Castell of Laboure, 1506; The Mirrour of Good Manners, translated from the poem of Mancini De quatuor Virtutibus ; The Egloges; a version of Sallust; an Introduction to Write and to Pronounce Frenche; and some small pieces. A catalogue of all these, with full notice of the little that is known concerning Barclay, and ample bibliographical information, is supplied by Mr Jamieson in the introduction to his edition of the Ship of Fools, Edin., 1874.
