BIRDS PARTIALLY EXTERMINATED.

From Birds which have recently become altogether extinct we naturally turn to those that have of late been extirpated, in certain countries though still surviving elsewhere. Several such instances are furnished by the British Islands. First there is the Crane (Grus communis} which in Turner’s time (1555) was described as breeding in our fens. Then the Spoonbill (Platalea leucorodia}, said by Sir Thomas Browne [9:3:736] (1688) to breed in Suffolk, as it formerly had done in Norfolk. The Capercally (Tetrao urogallus) we know to have frequented the indigenous pine-forests of Ireland and Scotland. In the former it had most likely become extinct soon after 1760, and in the latter not much later. Not a single specimen of the British stock of this bird is known to exist in any museum, but the species has been successfully introduced from Sweden into Scotland during the last forty years, and is now certainly increasing in numbers. The Bustard (Otis tarda), which once tenanted the downs and open country of England from Dorset to the East Riding of Yorkshire, vanished from Norfolk, its last stronghold as a British Bird, in 1838. From other counties it had before disappeared. It is well worthy of note that all the four species just mentioned were protected to a certain degree by Acts of Parliament, but these laws only gave immunity to their eggs and none to the parent-birds during the breeding season, thus shewing how futile is the former when compared with the latter, since there are very many species whose nests from time out of mind have been and are yearly pillaged without any disastrous consequences arising from the practice.^[1. The singular wisdom of the old command (Deut, xxii. 6)—the most ancient “game-law” (using the term in its widest sense) in existence—has here a curious exemplification.]

It would be impossible here to name the many Birds which, once numerous in the British Islands, have now so much diminished as to be rightly considered scarce, or to recount the various causes to which their diminution is due. The persecution of Birds-of-prey seems to have begun with the keepers of poultry, to whom the Kite (Milvus ictinus) and the Hen-Harrier (Circus cyaneus) were a sore trouble,^[2. The Bohemian Schaschek, who visited England about 1461, says he had nowhere seen so many Kites as around London Bridge (BιδZ. Lit. Ver. Stuttgart, vii. p. 40). And the statement is confirmed by Belon (Oδs. ad. fin. Clus. Exot. p. 108), who says that they were scarcely more numerous in Cairo than in London, feeding on the garbage of the streets and even of the Thames. From the same writer (Hist. Nat. Oyseaux, p. 131) it would seem that at that time (1555) they, and Ravens also, were protected by law in the City! The Hen-Harrier’s name is enough to shew what was thought of it in days when it abounded.] but it has been actively followed up by game-preservers, and this to their own cost, as the ravages of the Grouse-disease testify.^[3. In Transbaikalia, the Bearded Vulture (Gypaetus barbatus), which was formerly common, has of late been completely exterminated, through persecution prompted by the desire to obtain its feathers, which are highly valued.—Von Middendorif, Sibir. Reise, iv. p. 851.] To the reclaiming of waste lands, the enclosure of open spaces, and the greater care bestowed on timber trees (by removing those that being decayed are much infested with insects) must, however, be attributed the extermination or Tarification of far more species than the direct action of man has been able to effect.^[4. The extermination from Europe of the Francolin (Francolinus vulgaris) has been treated at some length by Lord Lilford (Ibis, 1862, p. 352) without his being able to assign any cause for the fact.] Still what we lose in one direction we gain in another, and while Birds-of-prey and Wild-fowl are being banished, the smaller denizens of the woodlands, gardens, and arable fields are unquestionably more numerous than ever.^[5. Report from, the Select Committee on Wild Birds' Protection, dec. (House of Commons), 1873. Appendix, pp. 188-193.] The change is, of course, not satisfactory to the naturalist or to the lover of wild scenery, but to some extent it seems inevitable; yet well directed laws for the protection of those birds which suffer worst in the unequal contest may delay their impending fate, and preserve to our posterity the most pleasing features of many a landscape and the grateful opportunities of studying many a curious and interesting species. Thanks, perhaps, to the stronger constitution of most Palaearctic Birds, the votaries of what is called “acclimatization” have obtained little success in these islands, for the exotic specieswhich it has been attempting to introduce have, almost without exception, failed to establish themselves. The efforts made in some British colonies—particularly in Australasia—are unfortunately too likely not to be successful; and, when their own peculiar fauna has been half extirpated, our fellow-subjects at the antipodes will probably have good reason to lament the extraordinary sentiment that has led them to introduce from other countries birds which, in the absence of their natural checks, will be nothing else than a positive nuisance; for so reckless is the manner in which they have been imported, that species possessing few or exceedingly doubtful recommendations to begin with have been carried over in abundance, and some of these cannot fail to become permanent settlers equally with those for the transportation of which the would-be “acclimatizers” might find themselves excused. All, however, in the battle of life will contribute first to the subdual and by degrees to the disappearance of the original inhabitants, which had hitherto constituted a fauna, from a scientific point of view, perhaps the most interesting on the face of the globe.

GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF BIRDS.

It is admitted by nearly all naturalists that the study of the extinct organisms of any country leads the investigator of them to a proper appreciation of its existing flora or fauna; while, on the other hand, a due consideration of the plants or animals which may predominate within its bounds cannot fail to throw more or less light on the changes it has in the course of ages undergone. That is to say that the Distribution of forms in Time is a subject so much connected with the Distribution of forms in Space, that the one can hardly be separated from the other. Granting this as a general truth, it must yet be acknowledged as a special fact, which some of the preceding paragraphs will perhaps have foreshadowed, that in fossil Ornithology we have as yet but scanty means of arriving at any precise results which will justify bold generalization in the matter of aviarian distribution. Remains of extinct forms of Birds are, compared with those of other classes of Vertebrates, exceedingly scarce, and in accordance, therefore, with the prevalent practice of naturalists they have been but little investigated. If we except France and New Zealand—and in the latter no fossil ornithic relics can be assigned to any very ancient epochs—little has been done. The discovery in the former of somewhat early remains of Birds, allied to those which we at present only know as denizens of a tropical region, and the recognition of far later remains of species identical with those that now flourish in arctic lands, merely corroborates what is from numerous sources within the knowledge of every geologist—the vicissitudes, namely, of which that part of Europe has had experience. Though in this quarter of the globe we now have no indigenous Struthious Birds, the former existence of Struthious Birds even in England provee very little, because we know that some of such birds (the species of South-American Rhea, for instance) can maintain themselves in lands which are subject to a climate as fitful, if not as severe, as our own. All that can be justly inferred thence is that Struthious Birds were not formerly confined to their present limits, and possibly that such birds once pervaded the greater part of the earth’s surface. The Archaeopteryx and Odontopteryx from their singularity prove nothing in respect of Geographical Distribution. Perhaps in the whole range of zoology there is no class from the fossil remains of which we learn less as regards the physical history of our planet than we do from the Birds. We, therefore, have to turn to the other side of the question of Distribution, and try to find out whether the [9:3:737] evidence, which is from one point of view so evidently deficient, may not be supplied by inquiry into existing avifauna . and this, in other words, signifies that a knowledge of the Geographical Distribution of living Birds becomes a matter of prime necessity to every one who would intelligently exercise the calling of an ornithologist.

Thus driven to a kind of extremity, the student of Birds, however, cannot but regard with the most lively satisfaction the circumstance that to one of his brethren is due the merit of having first truly pointed out the great Zoogeographical Regions of the globe—a fact not a little surprising w hen w e reflect that the outlines of Distribution laid down in 1857 by Mr Sclater^[6. Journal of the Proceedings of the Linnean Society, Zoology, ii. pp. 130-145. It is much to be regretted that the author of this most valuable essay has never sanctioned its republication in another and improved form. Many of its details, and some of its principles even, are now known to be incorrect, but for the time at which it appeared it was a marvellous production.] had reference only to the most vagrant Class of animals in creation; yet these outlines have, not merely in the main, but to a very great extent in detail, met with the approval of nearly all those zoologists who have since studied the subject in its bearing upon the particular Classes in the knowledge of which they themselves stand pre-eminent.

Without infringing upon what must be deemed the generalities of biological Distribution, it is proper to observe that Mr Sclater’s success is to be attributed to the method in which his investigations were carried on—a method in which he had but few predecessors. Instead of looking at the earth’s surface from the point of view which the geographer would take of it (a point of view which had hitherto been adopted by most writers), mapping out the world according to degrees of latitude and longitude, determining its respective portions of land and water entirely regardless of the products of either element, or adhering to its political divisions—time-honoured as they were,—he endeavoured to solve the question simply as a zoologist should, by taking up the branch of the subject with which he was best acquainted, and by pointing out and defining the several Regions of the globe in conformity with the various aspects of ornithic life which they present. But herein there was at once a grave difficulty to be encountered. Birds being of all animals most particularly adapted for extended and rapid locomotion, it became necessary for him to eliminate from his consideration those groups, be they large or small, which are of more or less universal occurrence,^[7. Not but that even in the most widely-spread groups are contained others—sub-families, genera, or species strictly limited to certain localities. . Some of these will be noticed further on.] and to ground his results on what was at that time commonly known as the order Insessores or Passeres, comprehending the orders now generally differentiated as Passeres (veroe), Picarioe, and Psittaci.

On this basis then Mr Sclater was enabled to set forth that the surface of the globe exhibited six great Regions, each in a marked manner differing from all the rest, though the difference was not always equally important. These Regions he termed respectively the Palaearctic, Ethiopian, Indian, Australian, Nearctic, and Neotropical; and though it is on all accounts better to preserve the names he bestowed on them, it does not seem convenient to follow the order in which he placed them. Thus the Australian Region appears not only to differ more from the others than they do among themselves, but its differences are of a kind which, when its fauna is considered as a whole, suggest a striking peculiarity, namely, that many of the forms of animal life therein found are the direct and not very much modified descendants of types which may very likely at an early period of our planet’s history have predominated over every land, but of types which have since been elsewhere in great part replaced by more highly developed structures. The lower rank in the scale of its most characteristic animals seems to be indisputable, and, therefore, with the Australian Region it appears most proper to begin.^[8. The writer has to acknowledge with hearty thanks the very singular mark of confidence conferred on him by his eminent friend Mr A. R. Wallace, who has allowed him to peruse in manuscript the greater part of a work on the Geographical Distribution of Animals, the early publication of which can hardly fail to place this most interesting subject in the position it undeniably deserves, but a position to which it has never yet attained through the absence of any treatise of like character. The value of the favour thus bestowed upon him the writer cannot overestimate.]

I. The Australian Region is most trenchantly divided from the Indian, which, from a geographical and possibly from a geological point of view, seems to be conterminous with it, by the narrow but deep channel which separates the small islands of Bali and Lombok, and will be found to determine the boundary between two entirely distinct portions of the earth’s surface. Midway along this channel we may draw a line in our imagination, and continue it in a north-north-easterly direction up the Strait of Macassar, dividing the much larger islands of Celebes and Borneo. A considerable interchange of animal forms in the two islands last named is indeed to be observed, and even a slight intermingling of the productions of the two former seems now to be going on; but the inosculation is so much less in degree than that which obtains between any other two Regions, while the characteristic, not to say peculiar, zoological types which occupy either side of this line are so divergent, that it may be fairly considered a harder and faster line than any that can elsewhere be found. Between Bali and Lombok, as above stated, it has been shewn by Mr Wallace to be all but perfect, and in his honour this boundary, as real in the abstract as though it existed in the concrete, has been most justly named after the naturalist and traveller who first saw and recognized its importance—“Wallace’s Line.”^[9. This name was first given by Professor Huxley {Proc. Zool. Soc. 1868, p. 313), but as it is hardly a geographical term, it will accordingly make no appearance on any save a so-called “physical” map. The value of the discovery above mentioned, of which no one had ever dreamt till it was made by Mr Wallace, seems to justify proper notice from chartographers, and it might be well, therefore, to dignify the channel between Bali and Lombok—named on some maps Lombok Strait—by the appellation of “Wallace’s Strait.”] As above indicated, this line becomes less definitive as it proceeds further northward'; and though we know it to pass between the Philippine Islands and Sanguir, and again between the former and the Palau group, its further progress in that direction cannot as yet be set down with precision, though it probably runs to the westward of the Ladrones. But hereabouts we lose sight of it, until we arrive at the Sandwich Islands, to the northward of which it must pass, since for reasons presently to be given at greater length that archipelago must be confined within the Australian Region. Southward from Lombok the boundary of the Region rounds the western coast of Australia, and then strikes off in a south-easterly direction to encompass New Zealand and its dependencies. Arrived here it must be drawn so as to include all of what is commonly known as Polynesia, though the characters of the intermittent chain of islets lying parallel to and just to the southward of the Tropic of Capricorn, and a few scattered reefs to the northward of the equator (between long. 108° and 115° W.), are at present insufficiently determined. After encircling, however, the Low Archipelago and the Marquesas, the boundary trends to the north-west, and includes, as before stated, the Sandwich Islands; but thence its precise direction cannot now be traced, owing to the obscurity which veils the numerous islets of the North Pacific Ocean, which [9:3:738] lie between that group and the coast of Asia. All that can be said for certain is, that it does not comprise the Aleutian Islands, the empire of Japan, or the Loochoos.

Though the characteristic Mammals of the Australian Region are in every way highly remarkable, entirely comprehending as they do one of the three Subclasses (Omitho-delphia) and nearly all of a second (Didelphia'), by far the largest portion of the area it covers is weak if not absolutely wanting in Mammalian life, and the zoological features which mark the Region as a whole are perhaps better exhibited by its Birds than by any other Class of its fauna. This being the case, it may be excusable in this place to dwell longer upon this Region than upon the rest. True it is that we have no Subclass of birds, like the Ornithodelphia among Mammals, which is restricted to the Region; but, on the other hand, the instance of the Didelphia, to which allusion has just now been made, is here almost exactly paralleled by that of the Struthious Birds—the Ratitoe, to call them by the name now very generally applied to them by the zoologists who recognize them as forming one of the two primary divisions or Subclasses, we may term them, of the Class Aves. All the existing Ratitoe (with the exception of the species of two forms, the Ostriches of Africa and South America, belonging to the genera Struthio and Rhea, and comprising at most but five species) are found within the Australian Region and nowhere else. But further, the Ratitoe of the Region are more •widely distributed throughout its area than are the Didelphia, since the former extend from Ceram, in lat. 4° S. and long. 130° E., to New Zealand in lat. 45° S. and long. 175° E., if not a little further, while the Didelphia stop short at lat. 44° S. and long. 155° E.^[10. Of course, as regards polymorphism, no comparison can be made between the Ratitas and the Didelphia, the latter presenting a very great variety and the former a very great sameness of structure and habit, though if it be true, as seems to be most likely the case, that Dinornis and its allies were absolutely devoid of wings, we should in them have a divergence from the normal ornithic type which is altogether unique in the whole Class, and for its singularity might well be set off against the multifariousness exhibited by the Didelphia.] But if we take the birds alone, and compare the two Subclasses into which the existing or recent members of the Class are divided, we find the Australian Region remarkable for its ornithic singularity. The smaller of these two Subclasses, the Ratitoe, contains six very natural groups—which might well be called Orders—including, according to the most exaggerated computation of their number, less than 40 species, while the larger Subclass, the Carinatoe, though perhaps not including more truly natural groups, comprehends some 10,000 species. Now, out of the six groups of this smaller Subclass, four are absolutely restricted to the Australian Region, and these four groups contain all but, at the highest estimate, as above stated, five of the species known to belong to the Subclass; thus we should be able to regard the 35 species of recent Ratitoe of the Region (a number which is clearly far too large) as the proportional equivalent of an avifauna of more than 8000 species (8750).

Leaving, however, such a calculation as this, which indeed cannot as yet be more than an approximation to the truth, we must consider first the remaining ornithic features of the Region as a whole, and then those of its parts. With respect to each of those subjects, it will be evident to every one that a further division is at once incumbent upon us. The prevalent zoological features of any Region are of two kinds—negative and positive. It is therefore just as much the business of the zoogeographer, who wishes to arrive at the truth, to ascertain what groups of animals are wanting in any particular locality (altogether independently of its extent) as to determine those which are forthcoming there.

Of course, in the former case it would be absurd to regard as a physical feature of any great value the absence from a district of groups which do not occur except in its immediate neighbourhood; but when we find that certain groups, though abounding in some part of the vicinity, either suddenly cease from appearing or appear only in very reduced numbers, and occasionally in abnormal forms, the fact obviously has an important bearing. Now, as has been above stated, mere geographical considerations, taken from the situation and configuration of the islands of the so-called Indian or Malay Archipelago, would indicate that they extended in an unbroken series from the shores of the Strait of Malacca to the southern coast of New Guinea, which confronts that of North Australia in Torres Strait, or even further to the eastward. Indeed, the very name Australasia, often applied to this part of the world, would induce the belief that all the countless islands, be they large or small—and some of them are among the largest on the globe—were but a southern prolongation of the mainland of Asia. But. it has been already stated that so far from this being the case a very definite barrier is interposed. A strait, some 15 miles or so in width, and separating the two fertile but otherwise insignificant islands of Bali and Lombok, makes such a frontier as can hardly be shewn to exist elsewhere. The former of these two islands belongs to the Indian Region, the latter to the Australian, and between them there is absolutely no true transition— that is, no species are common to both which cannot be easily accounted for by the various accidents and migrations that in the course of time must have tended to mingle the productions of islands so close to one another. The faunas of the two are as absolutely distinct as those of South America and Africa, and it is only because they are separated by a narrow strait instead of the broad Atlantic that they have become so slightly connected by the interchange of a few species and genera.

Now, first, of the forms of Birds which are prevalent throughout the Indian Region, but are entirely wanting in the Australian, we have at once the Bulbuls (Ixidoe), very characteristic of most parts of Africa and Asia, with the allied group of Phyllomithidoe, which is peculiar to the Indian Region; the widely-spread families of Barbets (Megaloemidoe) and Vultures (Vulturidoe) ; and the Pheasants (Phasianidoe), which attain so great a development in various parts of the Asiatic continent and islands that there must their home be regarded as fixed, though some species are found very far removed from the focus of the family.^[11. The separation of this family from the Tetraonidσs (Partridges and Grouse), though hitherto almost universally recognized, seems to be a very questionable proceeding, and, so far as the present writer is aware, is one that can only be maintained by structural characters, which though patent in their extreme forms, appear to vanish in those which are intermediate {cf. Proc. Zool. Soo. 1868, pp. 300, 301); but for the purposes of this treatise it is of little consequence, since the Tetraonidce are but very feebly represented in the Australian Region.] Some naturalists would add the Einches (Fringiïlidoe), but the real position of the so-called “Finches” of Australia must at present be considered extremely doubtful, and it may prove that they are the direct descendants of the more generalized group whence sprang both the true Fringillidoe and the Ploceidoe, if, indeed, these can justifiably be kept apart. Then, of forms which are but weakly represented, we have the otherwise abundant Thrushes (Turdidoe ^[12. It is almost certain that no satisfactory limits can be laid down between this family and the Warblers (Sylviidoe), but, as in the case mentioned in the last note, the result would hardly be affected by combining the two families, since the Sylviidoe have comparatively few members in the Region now under notice.] ), and, above all, the Woodpeckers (Picidoe), of which some 4 species, or at most 5,^[13. There are said to be Dendrotypes analis in Lombok, Muιelleriρicus fulvus and Yungipicus temmincki in Celebes, Y. moluccensis in the Moluccas, and Y. otarius there or perhaps in the Sunda Islands. It is quito likely, however, that further investigation will add to the number.] out of more than 300, just cross [9:3:739] the boundary and occur in Lombok, Celebes, or the Moluccas, but are absolutely unknown elsewhere in the Region.

Turning to the families which by their presence characterize the Australian Region, we find those which are peculiar to it to be perhaps, if not more numerous, yet more remarkable than the peculiar families of any other Region. Nearly 20 such might here be enumerated. One, the Honeysuckers (Meliphagidoe ^[14. This term is here advisedly used in a restricted sense, excluding the genus Zosterops and its allies, which are often included under it by systematists.] ), is most characteristic, and, abounding in genera and species, extends to almost every part of the region, yet only a single species oversteps its limits, crossing the sea from Lombok to Bali.^[15. This is Ptilotis limbata, a species which is common from Timor to Lombok.] Other peculiar families are much more confined, and, since by their means (as will presently appear) the various subdivisions of the Region may be more clearly marked out, further notice of them may be for the present deferred. But the positive characteristics of the Region as a whole are not its peculiar forms alone; there are at least 4 families which, being feebly represented elsewhere, here attain the maximum of development. Such are the Thickheaded Shrikes {Pachycephalidoe), the Caterpillareaters lflamρephagidae ∖ the Flowerpeckers (Dicandae), and the Swallow-Flycatchers ( Art amid oe). Besides these, 3 or perhaps 4 groups, though widely distributed throughout the world, arrive in the Australian Region at their culmination, presenting an abundance of most varied forms. These are theWeaver-birds (2‰α√cε),and theM0rep0rks(P0dαr7i√ce). if they can be properly separated from the Fringillidae and the Caprimulgidae respectively, but especially the Kingfishers (Alcedinidce) and the Pigeons (Columbidoe), the species belonging to the two last obtaining in this Region a degree of prominence and beauty which is elsewhere unequalled.

Without going into greater detail, the Australian Region may be roughly said to be composed of four Subregions, to which the names of Papua (or New Guinea), Australia proper, New Zealand, and Polynesia may perhaps be attached. The boundaries of some of these Subregions are, as may be expected, not well defined; and, indeed, it is obvious that much must be done in the way of geographical exploration before the investigation of zoologists will mark out their limits with positive accuracy. Especially is this true in respect of the first of these Subregions, which in certain parts shows a complication of characters that for want of space could hardly here be explained, if, indeed, according to our present information, they can be explained at all.

(1.) The Papuan Subregion, the chief province of which is formed by New Guinea and its dependencies, comprises, besides the large and imperfectly-known island whence its name is derived, three other provinces, which may be named the Timorese, the Celebesian, and the Moluccan. The fauna of the Timor group seems to be made up of contributions from Java, belonging to the Indian region, the Moluccas, and Australia. Of nearly 100 genera and 160 species of Land-birds only, which are here found, an equal proportion appears to be related to the Birds of the Indian Region and to those of Australia proper—some 30 genera being distinctly traceable to each. The Indian influence is made evident by the presence of about 27 genera which have crossed the strait from Bali into Lombok. Of these, 12 are known to stop short at Flores, but the inter vening island of Sumbawa has not yet been ornithologically explored, and 13 of them reach Timor. In all there may be, disregarding birds of wide distribution, some 30 species of Indian origin, with nearly· 20 thereto allied, but, on the other hand, more than 60 which are derived from Australia, thus indicating a greater affinity to the latter country. There is one genus of Kingfishers (Caridonax) known only from Lombok and Flores, but no doubt represented in Sumbawa, and a genus of Pigeons (Leucotreron) is almost limited to this group.

The Celebesian province is known to be inhabited by more than 200 species, belonging to about 150 genera. Of the Land-birds, 9 genera and nearly 70 species are absolutely confined to the principal island, but 20 more are found also in the Sula and Sanguir islands, making nearly 90 species peculiar to this Subregion. Of those which are not peculiar, Lord Walden^[16. Transactions of the Zoological Society, viii. pp. 23-118.] estimates that about 55 are of Indian and 22 of Australian origin, the remainder being common to both Regions, and thus the Indian influence is very strong in this quarter, pointing to an immigration from the north and west. Of the less wide genera of Celebes, more than 20 are common to Borneo and Java, and nearly as many to Timor or the Moluccas—again showing a preponderance of Indian over Australian types; but, since the Bornean and Javan species consist of only about one-quarter of those which are characteristic of those islands, while the Moluccan and Timorese genera form nearly one-half, the proportion which has been drawn from the rest of the Australian Region is clearly greater than that which has flowed in from the Indian. The most important family of Meliphagidoe, however, which, as before remarked, is so highly characteristic of the Australian Region, is here represented by a single species only (Mgzomela chlor opterai), and the fact requires due acknowledgment. On the other hand, some 8 Indian families which are very important in Borneo and Java are altogether absent, and the non-appearance of a still greater number of Moluccan forms is also worthy of note. The conclusion at which Mr Wallace arrives from these and some other circumstances is that Celebes, during the existing epoch, has never been united by extensive land with either side, but has received an influx of immigrants from each. Of the genera found in Celebes itself 9 are peculiar, 3 more occur in one other island only, and 1 (which is likely to be eventually discovered in Celebes) is as yet known but in the Sula group-Of these 13 genera peculiar to the Subregion, about one-third are modifications of Australian forms. The Sula Islands show a considerable blending of faunas; out of nearly 40 species of Land-birds, more than one-half are identical with or allied to those of Celebes; but 3 Moluccan genera, unknown to Celebes, occur here.

We have now to consider the Papuan province. The island of New Guinea, which is the centre of the whole Papuan Subregion, has been until lately almost entirely unexplored, and even at the present day its interior has been but scarcely and cursorily visited by civilized foreigners. Yet out of nearly 350 species of Land-birds, belonging to 125 genera, which are known to us from this country, 300 species are exclusively peculiar to it, and 36 genera are either peculiar or only just extending to North Australia. Of the remaining genera, 38 are peculiar to the province, 45 are characteristically Australian, 9 more especially belong to the Malay Archipelago generally, being as much Australian as Indian.’ Only 7 are typically Indian, ¾ut with a discontinuous distribution, while 25 have a wide range. The chief features of the province to be noted are the extraordinary development therein of the Cassowaries [9:3:740] (Casuaìdidae), ^[17. The importance which must be attached to the distribution of Ratite as compared with Carinate birds, to say nothing of the interesting fact that the known number of species of Casuarius has been raised from one to nine in the course of a very few years, makes it advisable here to give a list of the 9 species, with the localities (so far as they have been ascertained) they inhabit, as announced to the Zoological Society of London, 16th February 1875, by Mr Sclater, to whose courtesy the author owes the sight of a proof sheet of the communication :— [table] A species of Cassowary has been said to occur in the Solomon Islands, and if so, one would think it likely to be distinct, but the only example alleged to have come from that group which has been examined proved to be C. bennetti. It would seem not at all unreasonable that in dividing the Papuan Subregion into provinces we should be guided by the distribution of this remarkable genus. In that case, not only would Ceram be annexed to the Papuan province, but the Cape-York district severed from the Australian and added to the Papuan Subregion.] the richness and specialization of the Kingfishers (Alcedinidae), Parrots (Psittaci), and Pigeons (Columbidae), its Birds-of-Paradise (Paradiseidae), Honeysuckers (Meliphay idae), and some remarkable Flycatchers (Muscicapidae). It has several· marked deficiencies compared with Australia, among which are theWarblers (Sylviidae), Babblers (Timeliidae), Finches or Weaver-birds (Fringillidae or P loce idae) —according as we are disposed to treat those groups —certain Parrots (Platycercinae), and Diurnal Birds-of-Prey (Falconùlae), and, above all, íhe Emeus (Dromaeidae). About 9 genera are especially Malayan, and nearly as many more have apparently the same origin, but, curiously enough, are not found in the intervening Moluccan province. Thus it will be seen that the avifauna of New Guinea is pre-eminently that of the Austral·ian Region, and that it has many peculiar devel·opments of Australian types; but that there has also been an infusion of Malayan forms, of which one group is spread pretty uniformly over the whole Archipe1ago, if not beyond it; while another group presents a rare instance of discontinuous distribution—not appearing in an intervening space of 1000 miles across, though that space is full of islands to all appearance habitable by such forms. The birds of Papua are, as a whole, remarkable for their brilliancy of plumage, one-half of the species occurring there being so distinguished, and no 1ess than 12 genera are decorated by the metallic colouring of their feathers. The Birds-of-Paradise, the Racquet-tailed Kingfishers, the 1argest and small·est of the Parrot tribe, namely, Calyptorhynchus and Nasiterna, and the great Crowned Pigeons (Goura) are very characteristic among its productions.

The chief dependencies of New Guinea require some little notice. These are the Aru Islands in the west, and New Britain and New Ireland in the east, with the Solomon Islands as still more distant outliers in the same direction, and the Louisiade group in the south. The first, separated by 150 miles of sea from Papua, has over 100 species of Land-birds, of which, however, about four-fifths have been found also on the mainland; but among those which are peculiar are two of the finest Paradiseidae —one of them belonging to a distinct genus (Cicinnurus)— and there is the very suggestive fact, as asserted, of two species of Casuarius occurring in the group. Of the ornithological features of New Britain and New Ireland not much is known, save that the former is inhabited by a species of Cassowary, and that both are intimately connected with New Guinea. The avifauna of the Solomon Islands is in some degree better understood, and 30^[18. As stated in the preceding note, a Casuarius is said to be found in the Solomon Islands, and, however contrary to expectation, would seem to be of the same species as that which inhabits New Britain.] well-authenticated species of Land-birds, with 1 peculiar Pallus, have been found there. Of those 30, 16, or more than half, are known to be peculiar, while 3 more probably are so: 5 species occur in New Ireland as well; 1 is common also to New Caledonia and the New Hebrides, 1 to the Louisiade Archipelago, and the remaining 4 have a wider distribution in the Papuan Subregion, to which unquestionably the group belongs.

The Moluccan province, completing this Subregion and consisting of many rather widely detached islands, which lie for the most part between those forming the provinces already described, extends probably from Timor-leat in the south to the Sanguir group in the north, and includes the considerable islands of Ceram, Bouru, Gilolo, and Morty. About 200 species of Land-birds are new known from this province, and they may be assigned to over 80 genera. Of the species about 15 are common to the Indian region, but more than twice as many to the Papuan province, and some 140 are peculiar, of which the most significant are the Casuarius of Ceram.^[19. See preceding footnotes.] Of the genera of Land-birds 2 only— Semioptera, a remarkable Bird-of-Paradise, and Lycocorax, an aberrant Crow—are peculiar; but there is also in Gi1olo a brevipennate genus of Rails (Habroptila) to which the same epithet will apply. One genus is common to Ceram and Celebes, and another is found in Australia, whence possibly it is a migrant, while 30 genera are characteristic of the Papuan Subregion, and nearly 40 more, of more or less wide range, are found in and probably derived from New Guinea. Finally, there are some 12 genera which do not occur in New Guinea, and belong wholly or mainly to the Indian Region, but there are only 3 characteristically Indian types met with in the Moluccas, and all of them are there represented by distinct and well-marked species. The avifauna of the Moluccan province is therefore thoroughly that of the Papuan Subregion, and is no less clearly derivative from that of New Guinea, but not fewer than 11 forms of Birds-of-Paradise (Paradiseidae), with more than 12 other characteristically Papuan genera, are wanting, and therefore, in Mr Wallace’s opinion, it would seem as though the province is not a fragment of any old Papuan territory, a supposition supported by the fact that most Moluccan birds are very distinct from their representatives in New Guinea. Amongst the most characteristic forms are the scarlet Brush-tongued Parrots (Lorius and Eos), found, it is believed, in every island of the group, but not in the Celebesian or Timorese provinces. One species of Eos from Siau and Sanguir intimates that those islands belong to the province. Eclectus, another scarlet Parrot, but belonging to a different family, also is equall·y characteristic with the Parrots j ust mentioned. As a rule, the birds of the Moluccan province are larger and more conspicuous than the allied species from neighbouring parts.

On the whole, the avifauna of the Papuan Subregion presents some very remarkable features, but most of them must be here briefly treated by way of summary. Unquestionably its most distinctive characteristic is to be found in the presence of the Birds-of-Paradise (Paradiseidae), which are almost peculiar to it; for, granting that the Bower-birds (Chlamydera and others) of Australia should be classed in this family, it must be admitted that they are very abnormal, or perhaps, to take firmer ground, that they are far less highly specialized than the beautiful and extraordinary forms which are found, and found only within very restricted limits, in the various islands of the Subregion. It would be easy, if space allowed, to dwell at length on the many points of interest with respect to those wonderful birds, though in truth we know but little of them.
[9:3:741]

(2.) The Australian Subregion is limited to the great insulated continent which bears that name, with its appendage Tasmania or Van Diemen’s Land, and possesses, on the whole, a very homogeneous fauna—so much so, indeed, that at present it would be almost impossible to subdivide it into provinces. Influenced in the north by its proximity to the rich and varied Papuan Subregion,^[20. The Peninsula of Cape York possesses a Casuanus, as already noticed, and other grounds are not -wanting for the supposition that has been entertained that zoologically it belongs to the Papuan Subregion.] its ornis rapidly becomes modified towards the south. Out of some 630 species or more, nearly 490 are Land-birds, and not more than one-twentieth of them are found elsewhere, so that its peculiar species bear a greater proportion to the rest than is the case in the Papuan Subregion. Though the western, and especially the north-western, parts of the country, which have been as yet but imperfectly investigated, will no doubt yield more results on further examination, it is already evident that the greatest animal wealth of Australia lies towards the east. The western portion seems to have but 2 peculiar genera (one of questionable value)—a nocturnal Parrakeet (Geopsittacus), and a Weaver-bird (Emblema), which is apparently not very far removed from others of the same group. In the north, as already stated, there is a considerable admixture of genera from the Papuan Subregion, which do not proceed beyond the tropic, and of these Casuarius is a striking example. The genus Xerophila, of uncertain affinity, is confined to South Australia; and the extreme limits of the Subregion, that is Tasmania, possess in addition only 1 genus, Eudyptes, belonging to the marine family of the Penguins (Spheniscidoe), which inhabit generally the sub-antarctic seas; but the Land-birds, which are few in number, are specifically identical with those of Australia proper. This is even the case with the Emeu (Dromoeus), and the import of this fact is as significant^[21. Its significance is increased by the fact that the Emeu of West Australia is distinct from that of the east. The Emeu is extinct in Tasmania.] as would be a corresponding example drawn from the class Mammalia, since, in regard to means of locomotion, birds incapable of flight are on a par with terrestrial mammals. As a whole, Australia is rich in Parrots (Psittaci), having several very peculiar forms; but Picarians (Picariae) of all sorts— certain Kingfishers (Alcedinidac), perhaps, excepted—are few in number, and the Pigeons (Golumbidce) are also comparatively scarce. Australia, however, possesses two extraordinary families of abnormal Passeres — the Lyre-birds (Menuridce) and the Scrub-birds (Atrichiidce)— which, so far as is at present known, stand by themselves, though it is possible that the latter have a somewhat distant ally in the genus Orthonyx, or even in the South-American family Pteroptochidae. The number of peculiar or characteristic genera of Passeres is, however, too great to be here enumerated; and there are many singular forms of Golumbidce. Among the more curious forms of Land-birds other than those may be especially remarked Lipoa among the Gallinoe (Megapodiidoe), and Tribonyx among the Grallae (Rallidce), while Pedionomus is a form referred by some systematists to the first and by others to the second of those Orders. The presence of a Bustard (Eupodotis) presents a curious example of interrupted distribution, since none of that family (Otididoe) are found nearer than India.

(3.) The Polynesian Subregion, though so vast, extending as it does from one tropic to the other throughout ninety degrees of longitude (from long. 140° E. to long. 130° W.), at that part· of the earth’s surface where degrees of longitude are broadest, possesses generally a very uniform avifauna. It may possibly be partitioned into four or five provinces; but if so, the products of the first of them, containing the Palau^[22. Dr Finsch is understood to be especially engaged on the birds of this group of islands, to our knowledge of which he and Dr Hartlaub have already contributed much.] (commonly called Pelew), the Caroline, and most likely the Ladrone Islands, are at present too imperfectly known for any useful results to be drawn from them. Then we have the New Hebrides and New Caledonia forming another province: after which comes the third, or Central-Polynesian province, comprising the Fijian, Tongan, and Samoan groups; next the numerous clusters from Cook’s Islands to the Marquesas, including the Society Islands and the whole of the Low Archipelago, which may perhaps form a fourth province; and lastly, the Sandwich or Hawaiian Islands. The first of these provinces (so to call them) possesses in the Palau Islands a Reed-VVarbler, which seems to form a peuliar genus (Psamathia), while another kindred form belongs to the widely-spread genus (Acrocephalus) that our own English bird does, and occurs there, and there alone, so far as we know, throughout the whole Subregion.^[23. It is, however, found in Australia, and even in the south of that country.] The like may be said of a Goatsucker (Caprimulgus). 1 other typically Polynesian genus is found; 1 is common to the Papuan, and 1 to the Malayan (Indian) Subregion. The second province shows some transition from the Papuan to the Australian Subregion. Out of 30 genera of Land-birds, 18 are typically Australian, 13 are also Polynesian: about 5 go no further to the eastward. 3 species of Apionis, a genus of uncertain affinity, but generally classed with the Starlings (Stumidoe), seem to link this province to the Central-Polynesian, and a very remarkable and apparently very generalized form of Grallae — the Kagu (Rhinochetus) r which seems to have half-a-dozen scattered alliances—is peculiar to New Caledonia. From the third province only some 50 genera and some 150 species of Land-birds are known. A species of Cuckow (Eudynamis taitensis) ranges over the whole of this as well as the next district so far as the Marquesas, as also does perhaps an abnormal Warbler (Tatare). On the other hand, the Samoan group has in the Manu-mea or Tooth-billed Pigeon (Didunculus) a form which alone makes a distinct family of Columbae ;^[24. It is possible, however, that Otidiphaps, which is supposed to come from New Guinea, may also belong to the Didunculida , .] and another island of thesame group, Savai, produces a mos peculiar brevipennate Water-hen (Pareudiastes), which it deemed worthy of generic separation from Gallinulas The fourth province, which (if it may be recognized as such) may be called the Eastem-Polynesian, comprehends, as above stated, the countless islands which surround the Low Archipelago. Respecting these we have little precise information—two meagre lists of birds from Hua-heine, one of the Society group, and a catalogue obviously not complete of those of the Marquesas, appearing to furnish nearly all our available material. The latter group possesses a rather remarkable Pigeon, said to be peculiar to it, but perhaps also found in the former; and though closely allied to Garpophaga, it has been elevated to generic rank under the name of Serresius. The last province is that of the Sandwich Islands, which, notwithstanding that their ornithology has never been thoroughly worked out, seem to present some conspicuous differences from any other; and it is almost a matter of opinion whether, small as is the known avifauna of the group, it should not be regarded as constituting a separate Subregion rather than as a province of Polynesia. The ascertained Land-birds are but 18 in number. Of these 3 are Birds-of-prey, and 1 of them, the Pandion ( ? ) solitarius of Cassin, is only known in collections by a unique specimen. The other 2 are widely-distributed [9:3:742] species of Owls (Strigidoe). There are no Psittaci or Picαrwe. The Passeì'e3 consist of 15 well-established species, all peculiar to the group, and belong to 10 generic forms, only 1 of which, the cosmopolitan Corvus, is known to occur elsewhere. The remainder are restricted to the Hawaiian Islands, and may be referred to 2 families—one the almost universally distributed Flycatchers (Mu sci ca p id ae), and the other the Honeysuckers {Meliphαgidce), which, as has been said before, are preeminently characteristic of the whole Australian Region; but it is to be observed that the most of the species are remarkable for the extraordinary form of their bill, so tlιat they may ultimately be found to constitute a special section of the family, if they be not considered to form a distinct one (Drepanidae). There are also two peculiar species of Water-birds—a Coot (Fulica αlai), and the well-known Sandwich-Island Goose (Bernicla sandνicensis), which has been very commonly domesticated in Europe. The Hawaiian Archipelago has thus a larger proportion of peculiar genera and species than any other group in the Subregion, from which fact Mr Wallace infers, and no one can doubt the truth of the observation, the great antiquity of its isolation.

(4.) The New-Zealand Subregion, however, is, and to all appearance long has been, more isolated still, probably, indeed, longer isolated than any other portion of the globe. Beside the three larger islands, known in the aggregate as New Zealand, numerous satellites belong to the Subregion, as Lord Howe’s, Norfolk, and Kermadoc Islands, with the Chatham, Auckland, and Macquarrie groups. At the highest estimate the Subregion contains about 150 existing species of ’ birds, of which more than 60 are Landbirds, belonging to about 34 genera, 16 of the latter being peculiar, and there may be some 5 genera of Water-birds, making 21 in all. Of the others 4 are widely spread, but the rest (9 in number) are characteristically those of the Region. Most of the genera occurring elsewhere are here represented by peculiar species, but then 5 are common to Australia. Some 7 or 8 are also allied to Australian species, and there are 4 Australian and l Polynesian species. Therefore every degree of similarity to Australia is to be found. Of peculiar genera it will suffice to say that 2 (Myiomoira and Miro) belong to the Warblers (SyI viidoe), 1 genus (Τumagra) perhaps comes under the Babblers (TimelUxlae), and 2 genera (Xenicus and Acaηthositta) may be referred to the Creepers (Ceríhiidae). The Paridae have 1 genus (Certhiiparus), and the MeliphagùRR 3 genera (Prosthxmadura, Pogonornis, and Anthornis). The Starlings (Sturnidae) are represented by Callaeas, Creadion, and the very abnormal—or perhaps it would be better to say generalized— Heterolocha. An entire and very distinct family (Strigopidce) of Parrots is certainly peculiar, and it may probably be justifiable to regard the genus Nestor as constituting a second. There is also an Owl, which has been usually considered the type of a genus (Sceloglaux) ; and the Rallidae present two very remarkable forms—the Wood-hens (Ocydromus) and the Takahe (Notornis), the last almost, if not quite, extinct. The widely-spread family of Plovers (Charadñülae) have two not less singular generic developments— 'Thinomis and the extraordinary Wrybill, Anarhynchus. Among the Ducks (Anatidae), Hymenolaemus is a very curious form; and, finally, among the Ratitae we have the whole family of weird-looking Kiwis (Aptery-gidce), represented by three or four species, which are totally unlike any other existing birds. In all, there is a wonderful amount of specialization, though perhaps in a very straight line from generalized forms; but the affinity to Australian or Polynesian types is in many cases clearly traceable, and it cannot be supposed but that these last are of cognate origin with those of New Zealand. A very long period of isolation must have been required to produce the differences so manifestly to be observed, but a few forms seem at rare intervals to have immigrated, and tlιis immigration would appear to be kept up to our own day, as shewn by the instance of Zosterops lateralis, which is said to have lately made its first appearance, and to have established itself in the country, as well as by the fact of two Cuckows, the widely-ranging Endynami·s taitensis and Chrysococcyx lucidus, which are annual visitors.

The most extraordinary ornithic feature of New Zealand, however, is unquestionably the former existence of the gigantic birds of the families Dinomithidae and Palaptery-gidae, with a few other contemporary forms. These,however, having been already mentioned there is no need to dwelí further upon them. As a whole, the avifauna of New Zealand must be regarded as one of the most interesting and instructive in the world, and the inevitable doom which is awaiting its surviving members cannot but excite a lively regret in the minds of all ornithologists. This regret is quite apart from any question of sentiment; if it were otherwise, it could not be defended against that sentiment which prompts our colonial fellow-subjects indiscriminately to stock their fields and forests, not only with the species of their mother-country, but with all the fowls of heaven, whencesoever they can be procured. The regret we express arises from the thought that just as we lament our ignorance of the species which in various lands have been extirpated by our forefathers, so our posterity will want to know much more of the present ornis of New Zealand than we can possibly record; for no one nowadays can pretend to predict the scope of investigation which will be required, and required in vain, by naturalists in that future when New Zealand may be one of the great nations of the earth.

II. The Neotropical Region, though presenting certain affinities to the Australian, and the only one which can be said to be zoologically allied to it, is yet almost as distinct in its character therefrom as it is geographically distant Excepting towards its northern limits, where it meets and inosculates with the Nearctic Region, the boundary of the Neotropical Region is simple enough to trace, comprehending as it does the whole of South America from Cape Hom to the Isthmus of Panama and all Central America, and reaching in North America to somewhere about the twenty-second parallel of north latitude; besides including the Falkland Islands to the south-east,^[25. It may even be questionable whether Tristan da Cunha, though lying nearer to the African coast, should not be referred to the Neotropical rather than to the Ethiopian Region. On this lone spot but four species of Land-birds are known to occur, all of which are peculiar —two of them even generically. One is a Finch (Grilhαgrα insularis), belonging, it is true, to a genus very well represented in Africa; but the second (Νesospiza acunhae) is the type and sole member of a genus which, whether it be considered a Finch or a Bunting, is said by Dr Cabanis, its describer, to have unquestionable similarity to some South American forms {Joum. für Om. 1873, p. 154). The third bird is a Thrush (ΝesotiΜa eremita), like the last, peculiar both in species and genus to the island, and apparently having no relation to anything Ethiopian; while the fourth is a peculiar species of brevipennate Water-hen (Gallinula nesiotis), which may have been derived from either continent.] and the Galapagos under the equator to the west, as well as the whole of the Antilles or West-India Islands up to the Florida Channel, which separates them from the peninsula of that name. Though over none but the remotest corners of this sufficiently large area is the supreme Class of animals formed (as we have found it to be the case throughout by far the greater portion of the Australian Region) by the Birds, yet they here play a part of very great importance, owing to the comparatively scanty number of Mammalian types. Among these last, however, there are two remarkable groups—the Pedimana, containing the only members of the Subclass Didelphia which occur at the present day [9:3:743] out of the Australian Region, and the Edentata, an Order which, though found also in Africa and India, attains in South America the summit of its development in variety and number of forms; and we cannot adduce any examples of Orders or Suborders from the Class Aves, the circumstances of which will exactly match those of these three groups of Mammalia. The nearest approach, perhaps, is made in one way by the South-American Ratite birds, of which one entire group, consisting of at most three species (Rheidoe), is peculiar to the region, and thus to some extent parallels the case of the Pedimana; but while these last also invade the Nearctic Region, the formerare not even spread over the whole of continental South America, being limited to its colder portion. Moreover, so far as Orders have been generally understood and accepted by ornithologists among Carinate Birds, there is no one of wide range which can compare with the overwhelming development of the Edentates in the Neotropical Region. On the other hand, it must be observed that the Region claims all the Tinamous (Tina- midoe) — the Dromoeognathoe of Professor Huxley—which, if we were to follow his arrangement established on palatal characters, it would seem necessary to regard as the equivalent of an Order; and also a single very remarkable form (Oρisthocomus), which he has satisfactorily shown to be so unlike every other that it can only be conveniently classed by itself.^[26. To recognize these Orders, Crypturi and Opisthocomi, however, it becomes logically necessary to recognize many other groups in like manner, and thus to raise the number of Orders in the whole Class to at least two dozen, or nearly four times as many as most ornithologists have been usually willing to admit, a proceeding which naturally lowers the differential standard, and renders a comparison between “Orders” of √lres and “Orders* of Mammalia or Reptilia almost impossible.] Of these forms the Tinamidoe certainly, and Opisthocomus probably, are of comparatively low developmental rank, in that respect resembling certain characteristic Australian groups; but the similarity between the avifaunas of the two Regions seems to be further borne out by the same fact being observable of other South-American families, forming what may be called the lower Suborders^[27. The term “Suborder” should very possibly not be used here, at least in a technical sense. The Passeres seem to be properly divisible into two great groups—one containing the genus Menura, the other all the rest, except most likely A trichia, which there is some reason to suppose may be found to form a third group. Whenever these groups shall receive names, they ought to be regarded as Suborders, but in the meantime, with this explanation, perhaps no harm will follow from calling the sections Polymyodae (the Oscines of some writers), Oligomyodoe, and Tracheophonoe “Suborders.”] of Passeres, to which the names of Oligomyodoe and Traclieophonoe have been attached, and these, if not altogether originating in the Neotropical Region, are without doubt therein most abundantly produced. The significance of this fact is enhanced when we remember that, as has been said before, to consider rightly the problem of the distribution of birds, we must in the main rely on the Passeres, as affording on the whole the surest ground for our investigations. Now, taking the latest, nay, the only, complete list of Neotropical birds—that published by Messrs Sclater and Salvin^[28. Nomenclator Avium Neotropicalium, &c., Auctoribus P. L. Sclater et O. Salvin. Londini; 1873.] in 1873, we shall see that there are 8 Passerine families peculiar to the Region, of which 3 belong to the Tracheophonoe, 4 to the Oligomyodoe, and 1 only to the Polymyodae or Oscines. Or, if we look to the entire number of species given in that work as inhabiting the Region, we find it to be 3565. Of these, 1997, or a good deal more than half, belong to the Order Passeres — a large proportion truly, but one that (from other causes not germane to our present investigation, and therefore to be just now disregarded) need not especially excite our wonder. But the characteristic nature of the avifauna of the Region is more clearly brought out when we learn that of the 1997 species just mentioned, 1070 only belong to the higher Suborder (Polymyodae), leaving 927 to the two lower Suborders (Oligomyodoe and Tracheophonoe) ; or to speak in round numbers, out of 2000 species of the highest Order of birds, a little more than one-half belong to its highest section, while nearly one-half belong to its two lower sections. This is a state of things which exists nowhere else on the globe; for, except in Australia, where a few but uncertain number of purely indigenous and peculiar non-polymyodous Passeres are found, and in the Nearctic Region whither one family of Oligomyodoe has evidently been led by the geographical continuity of its soil with that of the Neotropical Region, such forms do not occur elsewhere. Accordingly their disproportionate prevalence in South America and its neighbouring lands points unerringly to the lower rank of the ornis of the region as a whole, and therefore to the propriety of taking it next in order to that of the Australian Region, the general fauna of which is admittedly the lowest in the world. It is believed that much the same result would follow from a similar examination of other Orders, especially the Picarioe; and Professor Huxley has urged with his wonted perspicuity the alliance of the two Regions just named, basing his opinion in great measure on the evidence afforded by the two sections into which the true Gallinoe are divisible, the Peristeropodes and the Alectoropodes, the former composed of the families Alegapodiidoe, almost wholly Australian, and the Cracidoe, entirely Neotropical, but citing also other weighty evidence in favour of his conclusion.^[29. Proceedings of the Zoological Society, 1868, pp. 294-319.]

Leaving, however, this matter as in some degree hypothetical, though its probability can hardly be denied, we have as genera, families, or perhaps even larger groups a great many very remarkable forms which are characteristic of or peculiar to the Neotropical Region in part, if not as a whole. Of families we find 23, or maybe more, absolutely restricted thereto, besides at least 8 which, being peculiar to the New World, extend their range into the Nearctic Region, but are there so feebly developed that their origin may be safely ascribed to the southern portion of America. First in point of importance comes the extraordinarily beautiful family of Humming-birds (Trochilidoe) , with nearly 120 genera (of which only 5 occur in the Nearctic Region), and more than 400 species. Then the Tyrants (Tyrannidae), with more than 70 genera (8 of which range into the northern Region), and over 300 species. To these follow the Tanagers (Tanagridoe), with upwards of 40 genera (only 1 of which crosses the border), and about 300 species; the Piculules (Dendrocolaptidoe), with as many genera, and over 200 species; the Ant-Thrushes (Formicariidoe), with more than 30 genera, and nearly 200 species; together with other groups which, if not so large as those just named, are yet just as well defined, and possibly more significant, namely, the Tapaculos (Ptero- ptochidoe), the Toucans (Rhamphastidoe), the Jacamars (Gal- bulidoe), the Motmots (Momotidoe), the Todies (Todidoe), the Trumpeters (Psophiidoε), and the Screamers (Pala- medeidoe) ; besides such isolated forms as the Seriema (Cariama) and the Sun-Bittern (Eurypyga).

Having thus briefly indicated some of the chief characteristic and for the most part generally distributed forms of the Neotropical avifauna, we have next to consider the separation of the Region into Subregions and provinces. Herein we find far greater difficulty than we had to encounter in treating of the preceding (the Australian) Region, the geographical peculiarities of which marvellously lend themselves to its comparatively easy partition, while the isolation of its several portions contributes in an extraordinary[9:3:744] degree to the process. But compared with the remaining Regions of the globe, the Neotropical, as it will be essayed to show in the sequel, presents, perhaps, no greater difficulty in this respect than others do. The Subregions (one excepted), however, cannot be said to be well defined, for no natural boundaries are to be found for them, and we must trust solely to the presence or absence of certain forms of Bird-life in marking out their limits. This is, of course, the most proper zoological method of proceeding, but in some cases it tends to make the divisions rather more than less arbitrary, and in all cases dependent upon the amount of investigation which has been bestowed on the several districts. The physical features of the continent of South America are very varied, and cannot be said to assist us much or at all in our task. The proximity of its southern extremity to an ocean wherein at one season of the year floating ice abounds, gives that portion a rigorous climate, and the presence of the grand chain of the Andes, the highest save one in the world, prolongs beyond the equator those characteristics of a mountainous or even an alpine tract, which override any that are commonly associated with degrees of latitude. This range, the great Cordillera, has also a remarkable effect first on the climatological properties of the whole country, and then on its vegetation, which, of course, acts directly on its animal inhabitants. Running as the Andes do pretty nearly longitudinally, and lying near the western coast of the continent, the warm, moist winds from the Atlantic sweep across its eastern and wider portion, unimpeded in their course by any considerable high land, till they are attracted by the summits of the giant range, and, precipitating their fertilizing showers on its lofty slopes, supply the brimming floods of some of the largest rivers of the world. Westward of the chain is in great part a desert, at least down to lat. 10° S., though much of this was, prior to the conquest of Peru by the Spaniards, carefully irrigated and highly luxuriant. A few other arid tracts are found, but compared with most other continents the proportion of desert-land is small, and the valleys of the majestic rivers which roll their course to the Atlantic are clothed with the most extensive virgin forests in the world. To these varied physical conditions seem due the chief differences which are observable in the avifauna of the component parts of the South-American continent, which, rich as it is beyond that of all other countries in genera and species, displays yet a considerable uniformity in its larger groups of Birds.

The Subregions into which that portion of the earth at present under consideration can be most conveniently separated seem to be six in number—four of them included within the continent of South America, and two lying beyond its limits.^[30. In arriving at this conclusion the author wishes to acknowledge the kind assistance he has received from his old friend Mr Salvin, F.R.S., whose long-continued study of American, and especially Neotropical, forms of birds has placed him in the front rank of authorities on the ornithology of the New World.] But the confines of these continental Subregions, as has been above hinted, are of the vaguest. It is doubtful whether any amount of local knowledge will ever justify the zoogeographer in drawing an absolute line of demarcation between any two of them. At present our information certainly does not permit us to do more than indicate the general direction of such boundaries; not that we believe that their existence may not be legitimately assumed. Beginning with the apex of the continent, we have a Subregion, extending from Cape Horn to somewhere north of Bahia Blanca on its eastern coast, whence its boundary runs in a north-westerly direction, passing to the eastward of Mendoza, and then northward along the eastern and higher slopes of the Andes until it crosses the equator, and, after trifurcating on either side of the valleys of the Magdalena and its confluent the Cauca, returns along the western slopes of the lofty Cordillera, until it trends seaward and reaches the Pacific coast of South America somewhere about Truxillo, in lat. 7° S. This Subregion, for a reason presently to be given, may be called the Patagonian, though its northern extremity lies so far removed from its eponymic territory. Next we have what may be called the Brazilian Subregion, marching with the foregoing until somewhere near Potosi in Bolivia, whence it turns to the north-east, and, avoiding the watershed of the Amazons, strikes, perhaps, the Paranahyba, through or along which it makes its way to the Atlantic. Then comes the enormous basin of the Amazons—the Mediterranean of South America, as the dwellers on its banks fondly call it—which, though forming an important part of the Brazilian Empire, seems undoubtedly to be a distinct Subregion from that to which this last name has been applied, and may justly be denominated the Amazonian. Yet, be it remembered, that, its peculiarities not being observable on the higher tributaries of the mighty river, its upper waters must be regarded as draining land which belongs to the fourth Subregion—of which more immediately. Continuous to the south-ward with the Brazilian boundary the western frontier of the Amazonian Subregion seems to turn off before the eastern confines of the Patagonian Subregion are reached, and, leaving a space intervening, it pursues a generally northward course, at a lower level, on the western bank of the Huallaga, and crossing the great stream whence it derives its name, in somewhere about long. 77° W. and lat. 5° S., it pursues its way towards the mouth of the Orinoco. The fourth and last Subregion of South America includes all that is left of the continent, and perhaps may be most fitly named the Subandean.^[31. In some respects it corresponds with what has been commonly called the “Columbian” Subregion; but that name, having been used in a special and more restricted sense, might give rise to some misunderstanding. As will be seen, it comprehends far more than the former United States of Columbia.] This begins in the south with the narrow slip of land before mentioned as intervening between the comparatively low-lying Amazonian Subregion and that portion of the Patagonian which runs along the lofty Peruvian ' Andes, and is believed to extend from the frontiers of Bolivia to the table-land of Ecuador, rounding, on the one hand, the forked extremity of the Patagonian Subregion to the westward until it meets the Pacific at Truxillo, stretching over 500 miles of sea to the Galapagos Islands, under the equator, and, on the other hand, following the Amazonian boundary to the Atlantic, while it comprehends the islands of Trinidad and Tobago, as well as those which lie on the northern coast of South America. Besides portions of the states already named, it includes Nueva Granada and Venezuela till it reaches the Central-American Subregion in the Isthmus of Panama. This fifth Subregion stretches on the west northward about as far as Guaymas on the east coast of the Gulf of California, and on the east to the Rio Grande, which forms the boundary of Mexico and Texas, but the Nearctic Region dips down along the central table-land till near Queretaro, a little to the northward of the city of Mexico, and thence southward along the higher ridges to an almost indefinite extent. The sixth Subregion is composed of the Antilles, with the important exception of Trinidad and Tobago, and its limits being capable of easy geographical circumscription, further consideration of them may be for the present deferred.

The difficulty of distinguishing these several Subregions is indeed very great; and it is not only possible, but highly probable that even in a few years further exploration will enjoin a large amount of rectification of their frontiers. It [9:3:745] must be remembered too that where, in the preceding paragraphs, “lines” of demarcation have been spoken of, such lines are in truth tracts of country often from one to two hundred miles in breadth, and in most cases there is no hope that the boundaries will ever attain any great degree of precision. Some advance of knowledge in this direction will no doubt accrue as the elevation and contour of hills and table-lands become more accurately laid down; but at first the effect of this increase to our information will certainly be to complicate matters, by shewing the existence within one Subregion of spurs, isolated spots, or enclosed areas belonging to another, and as yet unsuspected. Still the amount of light thrown on the Neotropical Region by the persevering labours of the eminent ornithologists before named, seems to deserve being brought to a focus; and accordingly the following summary is now offered in the hope that some of the characteristics of the avifauna of the Region may thereby be more readily comprehended.

Of the families of Birds peculiar to the Neotropical Region —twenty-four in number, according to Messrs Sclater and Sιlvin—the distribution may be tabulated as follows :—
[table]

This table will serve to shew the close alliance of the four middle Subregions to one another in their most remarkable forms, and, at the same time, the singularity displayed by the Patagonian and Antillean Subregions; while it will also make evident that no family peculiar to the Region is found in all its Subregions.

(1.) The Patagonian Subregion, lying chiefly at the southern extremity of the continent·, seems to present the greatest affinity to that in which the Australian avifauna reaches its climax This is shewn not only by the prevalence in it, alone of all the Neotropical Subregions, of the Ratitoe, which wander over its solitudes, and the Penguins (Spheniscidoe), which haunt its shores; but by the low, generalized, and peculiar forms like Thinocorus and Attagis among the widely-varying Limicoloe, and the Pteroptochidoe (though some few species of this family occur elsewhere in South America) among the Passeres. The family of Plantcutters {Phytotomidoe) is almost peculiar, only just intruding upon Southern Brazil. Of the more characteristic families of Birds of the New World, some 3 only (Dendroco- laptidoe, Formicariidoe, and Trochilidoe) shew themselves in any great abundance, while but 2 other3, which are feebly represented, occur within the ill-defined limits of its southern province, Patagonia,—the rest of its terrestrial, and still more of its littoral or maritime, avifauna consisting of families, or groups of families, which are nearly cosmopolitan. On the pampas of La Plata we find the number of characteristic Neotropical forms much increased, but still the poverty of the Argentine ornis is of the most marked kind when compared with the wealth of the more fertile tracts which lie on its northern and eastern frontiers. In La Plata we have but 2 other familes (fTyrannidoe and Palamedeidoe) coming under this category that are at all well developed. Mniotiltidoe, Vireonidoe, and Coerebidoe do not appear at all, and Tanagridoe but in small numbers. As has been said already, the Subregion extends northward along the chain of the Andes, and with this extension it seems proper to take in their arid and barren western slopes as well as a portion of the tract lying between that range and the sea, so as to include Chile and a considerable slice of Peru. But even by so doing we gain but little. No more of the characteristically Neotropical forms mount these lofty ascents in any multitude, nor are we able to add any forms of very wide distribution. However, throughout the whole Subregion many genera, and species without number, which are absolutely peculiar, occur, and thus aid in stamping the quality of the tract. Indeed, the very presence of the Struthious family Rheidoe, with its two or three species, would serve alone to do this; and as its headquarters are in Patagonia, that country becomes of sufficient importance to give its name to the Subregion of which it forms at most but a moiety.

Entering more into details, we find the Patagonian Subregion possessing about 46 genera of birds not found elsewhere in South America. Of these 30 are strictly Landbirds—3 belonging to the family Emberizidoe, 1 to Icteridoe, 5 to Tyrannidoe, 8 to Eendrocolaptidoe, 4 to Pteroptochidoe, 3 to Trochilidoe, 1 to Psittacidoe, 1 to Ealconidoe, 1 to Columbidoe, 2 to Tinamidoe, and 1 to Rheidoe. Of the rest there are 3 genera of Charadriidoe (as restricted), 1 of which (Eudrornias) is doubtfully identical with a genus of the Old World; 2 genera of the peculiar family Thinoco~ ridoe; Chionis, an antarctic form; 2 genera of Scolopacidoe, one peculiar, the other (Rhynchoea) rather widely spread over Australia, India, and Africa; 2 genera of Anatidoe, both peculiar; 2 genera of Laridoe, one peculiar, the other belonging to subpolar seas; 1 genus of the cosmopolitan Podicipedidoe ; and 3 genera of Spheniscidoe, a family limited to the Antarctic or Subantarctic Ocean. But further into particulars want of space forbids our going, save to remark on a very peculiar and instructive case offered by Eustephanus, a genus of Trochilidoe. Of this section of Humming-birds there are three known species— one, E. galeritus, found in Chile, evidently its mothercountry, but also occurring from 400 to 600 miles from the mainland on both of the chief islets of the little Juan Fernandez group—Masatierra and Masafuera; but each of these limited spots has besides its own peculiar species of the genus—the former E. femandensis and the latter E. leyboldi. This alone would present nothing at all unparalleled elsewhere; but it is curious that while both sexes of the more widely-ranging E. galeritus have a green plumage, the males of the other two have a brilliant red colour, and generally resemble each other, though the females of each differ more decidedly. Supposing, as we may justly do, that all these species have descended from a common ancestor, Mr Sclater has shewn^[33. Ibis, 1871, pp. 180-183.] the probability that E. galeritus represents the appearance of the parental stock that in bygone times colonized the Juan-Fernandez cluster, of which E. femandensis, now peculiar to Masatierra, and the most aberrant from the original form, is the progeny of the earliest settlers, and E. leyboldi, confined to Masafuera, is the descendant of a later immigration, while, still more recently, E. galeritus has found its way to both islets, and in each yet possesses its normal characters.

Passing over, as not affording anything especially remarkable, the chain of islands, from Chiloe to Cape Horn, in which the range of the Andes plunges into the Southern Ocean, though alongside of it lie Tierra del Fuego and its satellites, which form an important adjunct to the South-American continent, our attention is turned to the Falklands, an interesting and considerable group of islands situated over 200 miles to the north-east of the historic Strait of Lemaire. Here we find 18 species of Land-birds— 7 belonging to the order Accipitres and 11 to Passeres. Of [9:3:746] these some 5 species are peculiar—2 belonging to Phrygilus (Emberizidoe), 1 to Cinclodes (Dendrocolaptidce), 1 to Muscisaxicola (Tyrannidee), and 1 to Milvago (Falconidoe). Of Water-birds there is a peculiar species of Cldoephaga (Anatidoe), and there are, or until recently were, about half-a-dozen species of Penguins (Spheniscidoe), some of which, though not resorting exclusively to these islands, may be fairly regarded as finding there their chief breedingquarters. Of the ornithology of South Georgia, a group of islands lying some 1300 miles east of Staten Island, and nearly in the same latitude, and doubtless belonging to the Patagonian Subregion, as well as of the South Shetlands, no particulars are available.

(2.) The Brazilian <Siiδr<¾rion has only recently had removed from it the valley of the Amazons and its tributaries. The boundaries, so far as they can be traced, have been already given. This Subregion is not characterized by the presence, of any family of Birds peculiar to it alone, but among those families which are found in only two Subregions of the Neotropical Region it possesses 3 in common with the Patagonian,— Phytotomidoe, Cariamidoe, and Rheidoe, — the first and last only in its southern districts, and 1 in common with the Central-American— Oxyrhamphidoe. Of the peculiarly Neotropical families occurring in three Subregions only, it has but 1, Pteroptochidoe, the range of which is shared by the Patagonian and the Subandean. When we come to families of four Subregions, we find the Brazilian invaded by the almost cosmopolitan Sylviidoe, which also inhabit the Subandean, Central-American, and Antillean, and possessing in common with the Amazonian, Subandean, and Central-American not fewer than 8— Pipridoe, Momotidoe, Galbulidoe, Bucconidoe, Rhamphastidoe, Cracidoe, Heliornithidoe, and Parridoe— the last of which is, however, widely distributed in other regions, besides, Pala- medeidoe, which occurs also in the Patagonian, Amazonian, and Subandean Subregions. The chief justification for considering the Brazilian Subregion apart from the Amazonian is perhaps to be sought in the presence within the limits of the former of 5 families, Sylviidoe, Oxyrhamphidoe, Phytotomidoe, Pteroptochidoe, and Cariamidoe, which are not found in the latter, while on the other hand, 5 families, Capitonidoe, Opisthocomidoe, Eurypygidoe, Psophiidoe, and Oedionemidoe, ^[34. The propriety of considering the Stone-Curlews to form a family distinct from the other Plovers (Charadriidoe) is very questionable.] inhabit the latter without occurring in the former; add to which the fact, that of the families found in only two of the Neotropical Subregions not one is common to the Brazilian and Amazonian.

In this Subregion we have 42 peculiar genera, 1 belonging to Sylviidoe, 4 to Tanagridoe, 2 to Emberizidoe, 3 to Tyrannidoe, 2 tu Pipridoe, 5 to Cotingidoe, 6 to Dendroco- laptidoe, 3 to Formicariidoe, 2 to Pteroptochidoe, 7 to Trochi- lidoe, 2 to Caprimulgidoe, and 1 to each of the families Piculoe, Momotidoe, Galbulidoe, Psittaddoe, and Tinamidoe. The number of peculiar species is, however, far too great to be here enumerated. There are no islands of any importance belonging to this part of South America.

(3.) The Amazonian Subregion, comprehending the valley of the Amazons and its affluents (except their elevated sources among the Andes) as well as the right bank of the Orinoco and, of course, the intervening country, has been but lately separated from the preceding, and the reasons for here considering it distinct have just been briefly stated. They are not, indeed, those which first prompted the division, which was established mainly, if not entirely, on account of the peculiarity of most of the species of Birds^[35. Cf. . Sclater and Salvin, Proceed. Zool. Soc. 1867, pp. 593-596.] found λvithin its ill-defined borders as before given; but on whichever ground we proceed we may be pretty sure that its separation is justifiable. We have here 2

families peculiar— Opisthocomidoe —already mentioned as forming almost a distinct Order, but composed of a single species, the Hoactzin, and ÙidPsophiidoe or Trumpeters, now a-days regarded as distant allies of the Cranes (Gruidoe), but presenting many remarkable and unique features. This family also contains but one single genus, including some half-dozen species, the respective range of each appearing, singularly enough, to be separated by rivers. Amazonia possesses no family in common with but one other Neotropical Subregion, but it shares 3 with the Central-American and Subandean. These are Capitonidoe, Eurypygidoe, and Oedicnemidoe, of which the second only is peculiar to the Region, the first and last being widely distributed. The families which it shares with three other Subregions have been already enumerated, as well as those which by their presence or absence distinguish it from the Brazilian Subregion. The peculiar genera remain to be pointed out. These are but 27 in number: 2 belong to Icteridoe, 3 to Pipridoe and Cotingidoe respectively, 2 to Dendrocolaptidoe, Ί to Formicariidoe, 2 to each of Trochilidoe and Galbididoe, 1 to Ardeidoe and Palamedeidoe, 2 to Cracidoe and the genera Opisthocomus and Psophia before mentioned. There is another genus also which is worthy of remark, Chenalopex, belonging to the Anatidoe, not found elsewhere in the New World, but common to the Ethiopian Region. Space will not admit of our entering further upon the consideration of the ornithic peculiarities of Amazonia, but perhaps it may be said to form the most self-contained Subregion of the whole continental area of which we are now treating, and we may expect that with the progress of zoological exploration its boundaries may be laid down with tolerable precision. There are no islands which can bo attached to Amazonia.

(4.) The Subandean Subregion, from what has been previously indicated of its extent, will be readily seen to offer the most varied conditions of existence of any part of the Neotropical Region, and we shall not therefore be surprised to find its ornis at once rich and remarkable. It might perhaps now, and some day probably will, be broken up into two or more provinces, not to say separated into distinct Subregions, but the means for such partition are at present wanting. Yet there is only one family of Birds peculiar to it, the Steatomithidoe, composed of a single species, the Guacharo or Oil-bird (Steatomis caripensis), confined to a very few localities in its eastern portion. In common with Central America, but not elsewhere met with in the Region, it has of Neotropical families Cinclidoe and Alaudidoe, though the latter of these two widely-ranging families is but poorly represented by a single species (Otocorys chrysoloema), apparently the survivor of an old population (all, or nearly all, of which has perished), stranded, as it were, on the high lands of Columbia. Those families which it possesses that are common to but two other Neotropical Subregions have already been named, and it will be enough to repeat that 1 of them extends to the Patagonian and Brazilian, and the remaining 3 to the Amazonian and Central-American. In like manner have been enumerated the families which are also found in but three other Subregions—1 it has in common with the Amazonian, Brazilian, and Patagonian; 8 with the Central-American, Amazonian, and Brazilian; while 1 of these (Parridoe) is also found in very distant parts of the world, and 1, also a family of extremely wide range, with the Brazilian, Central American, and Antillean Subregions.

The genera peculiar to the Subandean Subregion are exceedingly numerous, amounting to no fewer than 72. These may be apportioned as follows: 1 to Troglodytidoe, 4 to Coerebidoe, 10 to Tanagridoe, 5 to Emberizidoe, 1 to Icteridoe, 2 to Tyrannidoe and Pipridoe respectively, 3 to Cotingidoe, 1 to each of Dendrocolaptidoe and Formicariidoe, [9:3:747] 38 (!) to Trochilidoe, 1 to the peculiar family Steatornιth. idoe, and 1 to Picidxe, Strigidoe, and Cracidoe respectively-The enormous differential development of the peculiarly New-World family Trochilidoe calls for some remark, and is only approached (as will presently be seen) by that which has occurred in Central America. The habitat of some of these forms of Humming-birds, whether genera or species— and the latter are wonderfully numerous—is extremely restricted. That of Loddigesia mirabilis, long since described from a still unique specimen in the Loddiges collection, is Chachapoyas in northern Peru, and though possibly more pains has been taken to discover it and compass the capture of other examples than has been the case with any other Bird, it has not been again met with. Its haunts may, therefore, be safely presumed to be especially confined. Two species of Oreotrochilus (0. chimborazo and 0. pichin-chce) have their abode almost limited to the slopes of the lofty mountains whence they take their name, and nearly as much may be said of others. The Tanagers (Tana-gridβe) —birds of varied form, and generally of exquisite plumage—also frequent this Subregion in great force, and among them there is here found, perhaps, the greatest amount of differentiation, both generic and specific.

Of the hundreds of other curious ornithological characteristics of the Subregion which might easily be cited, no more can here be given, but a brief notice of the avifauna of its extreme points seems to be required. It has now been for some time fully admitted by all competent authorities that the islands of Trinidad and Tobago, which the geographer might be inclined to class with the Antillean chain, must be regarded as being truly portions of the South-American continent, detached in comparatively recent times, and even now only separated from Venezuela by a comparatively shallow sea. Neither of these islands has a single peculiar species,^[36. Trinidad has about 350 species—one of them {Psittacula cingulata) -was thought to be peculiar, but Mr Salvin informs the writer that it has lately been procured in Guiana. The nearest approach, perhaps, to peculiarity is in a Thrush, which was originally described as being specifically distinct, under the name of Turdus xanthoscelus, but its claims to that consideration are now disallowed.] and except, perhaps, some stragglers from the north, not one which is not also found on the nearest mainland, though, of course, many inhabitants of the neighbouring continent do not pass either the Dragon’s or the Serpent’s Mouth, as the two narrow channels which cut off Trinidad from South America are called. We may presume that the various islands, Margarita, Curaçao, and Oruba, which He off the northern coast of Venezuela, also belong to this Subregion, though scarcely anything is known of their animal products.

Very different from this state of things is that which obtains at the opposite extremity of the Subregion. The interesting group of volcanic islands known as the Galapagos present not merely a large number of peculiar species, but 4 peculiar genera of Land-birds; 1 of these, Certhidea, belongs to the Ceerebidoe, and the other 3, Geospiza, Camarhynchus, and Cactomis, seem to come into the family Emberizidoe. ^[37. A very considerable amount of uncertainty, which at present cannot be removed, though it produces some confusion, appertains to the right position of many of the New-World forms of so-called Buntings (Emberizidoe) and Finches (Fringillidoe). The writer is fully inclined to believe that the distinctness of these two families, which among forms of the Old World has long been recognized, and that almost without difficulty, can be fairly established, since it seems to rest on good osteological characters; but the American genera have not yet been sufficiently examined to allow of many of them being allotted without much doubt. This uncertainty will most likely in time be removed, unless—and such a probability cannot be denied—some of the New-World forms turn out to be so much generalized as to fill up the gap which now presents itself between the two groups as observed in the Old World. Meanwhile, the consequent inconvenience is unavoidable.] It was Mr Darwin who first drew attention to the remarkable ornis of this archipelago, and here it was, as he has told us, that there dawned upon him from its consideration that theory of “Natural Selection” which has transformed the whole aspect of biology, and, whether wholly or partially accepted, has placed the science upon a new and higher pedestal. Later researches, indeed, have shown the nonexistence of some of the peculiarities which this eminent observer believed, on what was then good evidence, he had determined; but these refer to the restricted distribution of several of the species among the different islands, and are not of any such importance as to affect his general results, while doubtless, had his visit to this “little world within itself,” as he appropriately calls it, been of longer duration, he would have become aware of these minor facts. The strictly-speaking Land-birds of the Galapagos seem to be some 30 in number, of which about 26 are Passeres. Among these, 1 only, Oolichonyx oryzivorus (belonging to the family Icteridoe), and obviously a straggler, is identical with a species of the mainland, while 2, a Dendroeca (Λfniotiltidce), and a Progne (Hirundinidoe), have been by some considered to be distinct species, by others but local races,—which means, of course, that from one cause or another isolation has not yet modified them so as to depart greatly from their congeneric continental forms,—but the remaining 23 (?) are peculiar, and, what is especially worthy of notice, no fewer than 18 (Î), or nearly three-fourths of the whole number, belong to the four peculiar genera. There is also a peculiar species of Buzzard, agreeing closely in every habit and even in tone of voice with the carrion-eating Polybori, and originally described as the type of a distinct genus under the name of Cracirex galapagoensis. Apparently, too, there is a distinct and peculiar Barn-Owl {Aluco punctatissimus), but alongside of it we have the widely-spread Short-eared Owl {Asio accipitrinus), though examples of this last are said to present in these islands sufficient difference to justify the bestowal upon them of a distinct specific name. Among Water-birds, the Rallidoe and Ardeidoe furnish, the former one and the latter two, species not known elsewhere. A remarkable fact, also, is the asserted existence of a peculiar species of Flamingo (Phoenicopterus glyphorhynchus), seeing that most of the birds of this genus have a very extended distribution. A Penguin also (Spheniscus mendiculus) is at present only known from the Galapagos; but considering the range of other forms of this family (Spheniscidoe), we should, perhaps, be premature in as yet pronouncing it a peculiar species, though the existence of a Penguin at all under the equator raises a presumption that such may be the case. There is, however, one feature in the avifauna of these islands which should not be overlooked. Notwithstanding that the Galapagos are here placed as forming an outlying portion of the Subandean Subregion, the fact must not be concealed that their omis seems to have no very special or intn⅛ate relation thereto. All that can be averred of it is that it is American. In the subregion just named, as has been above shown, the Trochilidoe attain their maximum of development, yet no Humming-birds are found in this archipelago. So also with the Tanagridoe, of which there are abundant Subandean representatives, the Dendrocolaptidoe, Formicariidoe, and other characteristic Neotropical families. In the Galapagos none of them are found. It is true that the presence of a species of the South-American genus Pyrocephalus, and of a genus of the Neotropical family Coerebidoe, m&y be a set off on the other side; but on the whole, it seems quite likely that the relations of this isolated, equatorial province (for so it is entitled to be deemed) are as near to the north as to the south, if not nearer, and it is quite possible that, having its ornithological characters only in view, future zoogeographers may think fit to ally it to the former rather [9:3:748] than the latter. But the affinities of its Reptilian fauna point to a connection, however remote in point of time, with South America, and accordingly the Galapagos are here left in that Region to which they have been commonly assigned.

(5.) The Central-American Subregion is the next to be considered, and in treating of it we become aware of a disturbing force which renders impossible the laying down for it of anything like a definite frontier. This disturbing force is the entrance, as before intimated, of a Nearctic fauna which runs along the backbone, so to speak, of the Subregion to an unknown but variable extent; for part of this Nearctic fauna ebbs and flows according to the season of the year, in winter possibly creeping down the mountainsides, and being strongly reinforced by immigrants from the north, but in summer retiring northward and perhaps upward, so as to occupy only the most lofty ridges. Yet that two Subregions here unite and inosculate is certain; but in considering the Central-American avifauna, we have to guard ourselves against this periodic stream of northern immigrants, and cannot deal with it precisely in the same way as we have done those Subregions further removed from the influence which is here so strongly manifested. In Centι⅛J America, though its ornis is of the richest, we find not a single peculiar family of Birds, and those which it, to a more or less limited extent, shows with the other Subregions of the Neotropical Region have been already named, except the Ampelidoe, a small but widely-ranging family of the northern hemisphere, which it has in common with the Antillean Subregion. 5 other families, however, Paridoe, Sittidoe, Certhiidce, Laniidoe, and Meleagridae, belonging also to the Nearctic Region, occur here. Of genera which are not found elsewhere in the Region, it seems to have 93, but 47, of just more than half, of them are also found in the Nearctic Region; and therefore to obtain anything like a true notion of the Central-American ornis, it will be necessary to keep the two categories apart. Taking first those which are absolutely peculiar, we have 2 belonging to Turdidoe, 1 to Troglodytidae, 2 to Mniotiltidoe, 1 to each of Vireonidoe, Ampelidoe, and Tanagridoe, 3 to Emberi- zidoe, ^[38. See preceding footnote.] 1 to Icteriàae, 2 to Corvidoe and Tyrannidoe respectively, 1 to Cotingidoe, 2 to Formicariidoe, 19 to Trochi- lidoe, 2 to Momotidoe, 1 to each of Trogonidoe, Cuculidae, and Psittacidoe, 2 to Cracidae, and 1 to Tetraonidoe. Then, taking those not found elsewhere in the Neotropical Region, but inhabiting the Nearctic, we have, as occurring in Central America, 1 belonging to Turdidoe, 2 to Syl- viidoe, 3 to Paridoe, 1 to each of Sittidoe and Certhèidae, 2 to Troglodytidae and Mniotiltidoe respectively, 1 to Laniidoe, 2 to Ampelidoe, 14 to Emberizidae, 1 3 to Fringillidoe, 2 to Icteridoe, 1 to each of Tyrannidoe, Trochilidoe, Piddoe, and Cuculidae, 2 to Strigidoe and Anatidoe respectively, 1 to each of Columbidoe and Melea- gridoe, 2 to Tetraonidoe, and 1 to Charadriidoe.

Nicely balanced as these numbers are, they shew a result which might well have been expected from the physical and geographical configuration of the country, while the numbers of other families peculiar to the Neotropical Region, though shared by some of its Subregions, as already given, prove incontestably the propriety of including Central America with that Region; and this would come out even more plainly did our limits permit of the investigation being extended to species, though so many northern forms here find their winter-quarters. It remains to remark that almost the only island of any importance belonging to the Subregion is Socorro, the largest of a small group lying to the westward of Mexico in lat. 18° 30' N., and long. 1 ll 0 W. Here out of 9 species of Land-birds, 4 have been described as peculiar, 2 others are elsewhere known as occurring only on the Très Marias, a little group some 250 miles nearer the mainland, and 1 is regarded as a local race of a continental species, leaving but 2 (both Birds-of-prey) which cannot be deemed autochthonous. The still more remote Cocos Island, lying in lat. 5° 33' N., and long. 87° W., from which one peculiar species of Coccyzus (Cuculidae) is known, may belong just as likely to the Subandean as to the Central-American Subregion.

(6.) The Antillean is the only one of the Neotropical Subregions the precise boundaries of which can be definitely laid down; and it is in many respects one of the most suggestive and interesting, comparatively small though it be. Extending from Cape San Antonio de Cuba in the west to Barbadoes in the east, its greatest length is only about 1700 miles, and from Abaco, one of the Bahamas, in the north to Grenada in the south, it does not cover 15 degrees of latitude, while within these limits the proportion of land to water, being less than 98,000 square miles, is very inconsiderable. The unbroken chain of islands which are commonly known as the “West Indies ”—though that term rightly includes not only all of the “Spanish Main,” but an indefinite extent of coast lying both north and south of the ancient dominions of the Catholic King in the New World—forms, geographically, a second line of connection between the two halves of the American continent, separated from the great western isthmus by the deep waters of the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, and at once suggests a former communication by land with Yucatan at the one extremity and with Venezuela at the other, to say nothing of a possible junction with Florida. Yet, as will presently be shewn from a consideration of the peculiar forms of Bird-life which have grown up along the chain, any such communication, if it ever existed, must have been exceedingly remote in point of time; for narrow as are the channels between Cuba and the opposite coast of Central America, between the Bahamas and the south-western peninsula of North America, and between Grenada and Tobago (the last belonging zoologically, as has been already demonstrated, to South America), the fauna of the Antillean chain, instead of being a mixture of that of the almost contiguous countries, differs much from all, and exhibits in some groups a degree of speciality which may be not unfitly compared with that of oceanic islands. Except such as are of coral formation, the Antilles are hilly, not to say mountainous, their summits rising in places to an elevation of 8000 feet, and nearly all, prior to their occupation by Europeans, were covered with luxuriant forest, which, assisting in the collection and condensation of the clouds brought by the trade winds, ensured its own vitality by precipitating frequent and long-continued rains upon the fertile soil Under such conditions we might expect to find an extremely plentiful animal population, one as rich as that which inhabits the same latitudes in Central America, not many degrees further to the west; but no instance perhaps can be cited which shows more strikingly the difference between a continental and an insular fauna, since, making every allowance for the ravages of cultivation by civilized man, the contrary is the case, and possibly no area of land so highly favoured by nature is so poorly furnished with the higher forms of animal life. Here, as over so large a portion of the Australian Region, we find Birds constituting the supreme class—the scarcity of Mammals being accounted for in some measure as a normal effect of insularity.

Glancing at the entire chain, we may first set aside the Bahamas, a succession of emerged coral-reefs founded on, and to the south and east surrounded by, shoals or banks, broken only here and there by deeper channels; and then by drawing a line to the south of the islands of St Croix [9:3:749] and St Bartholomew, we find that this line divides the chain into two groups of distinct character—that lying to the southward and eastward, almost identical with the “Windward Islands” of some geographers,^[39. In the language of others, the “Windward Islands” begin'with Martinique and so continue to Trinidad, while the remainder of the Lesser Antilles, lying eastward of Porto Rico, are called the “Leeward Islands.” Other authorities name all the smaller islands so far as St Thomas “Windward Islands,” and those further westward the “Leeward.” Creoles appear to apply these terms relatively to then-own habitation, just as the dweller on the bank of a river speaks of “up stream” and “down stream” with sole reference to the position he occupies on the margin; and it might be wished, though that were vain, that the use of terms so little definite should be abandoned.] which, excepting Antigua and Barbadoes, are almost entirely volcanic, while no direct trace of recent volcanic action is known in the group lying to the northward and westward. These three divisions, however natural in appearance, can hardly be affirmed to form as many zoological provinces, owing to the absolute dearth of information respecting many of them, and the insufficient amount which has been received of the remainder. Taking the whole of the Antillean Subregion, the Bahamas, Cuba, Jamaica, St Croix, St Thomas, Sombrero, St Bartholomew, Guadeloupe, Dominica, Martinique, and St Lucia are the only islands of the ornithology of which we have anything more than what may be called a casual account; and hence, though valuable observations respecting some of the rest have been placed on record by travelling naturalists, any attempt to separate the Subregion into proper provinces would necessarily be of the crudest kind, and here cannot be made, though doubtless such provinces will eventually be defined with precision.

Still enough is known of the Birds of this Subregion to enable us to draw some conclusions, though certain of them seem especially likely to be overset by further investigation. It is inhabited by some 41 families, 1 of which (Todidoe) is not found elsewhere, 2 more (Coerébidoe and Cotingidoe) are confined to the Neotropical Region, 8 (Mniotiltidoe, Vireonidoe, Tanagridae, Icteridoe, Tyrannidoe, Trochilidoe, Cathartidoe, and Aramidae) are common to that and the Nearctic Region, but are peculiar to the New World, and 30 are of much more general distribution, but 2 of these (Trogonidae and Fregatidoe) are not found in the Nearctic Region, and, as the above numbers show, there is no family common to that Region and the Antillean Subregion without also occurring in other parts of the Neotropical Region. On the whole, therefore, the affinity of the Subregion to the Neotropical rather than to the Nearctic Region is fully made out. About 140 genera are found in the Antilles, of which 30 are peculiar to it, being a considerably larger proportion than is elsewhere found in the Neotropical Region. Of these 30 genera, which are all Land-birds, 4 belong to Turdidoe, 1 to each of Mniotiltidoe, Vireonidoe, Ampelidoe, and Coerébidoe, 2 to Tana- gridoe and Emberizidoe respectively, 1 to each of Icteridoe and Tyrannidoe, 5 to Trochilidoe, 1 to Caprimulgidoe, 2 to Picidoe, 1 to Todidoe, 2 to Trogonidae, Cuculidae, and Strigidoe respectively, and 1 to Columbidoe. ^[40. This genus {Starnomas) has been said, however, to occur in the Florida Cays, but the statement seems doubtfuL] Besides these, 21 more, which it is perhaps unnecessary to particularize, do not exceed the limits of the Neotropical region, while 5 others, belonging respectively to the families Cypselidae, Fregatidoe, Anatidoe, Columbidoe, and Rallidoe, occur both here and elsewhere in that Region without reaching the Nearctic except as stragglers. Perissoglossa, belonging to the family Mniotiltidoe, is the only genus common to the Nearctic Region and the Antillean Subregion without occurring elsewhere in the Neotropical Region, all the remaining Antillean genera inhabiting both North and South America. The distribution of some of the peculiar genera merits a little attention, for 19 out of the 30 are confined to a single island, or nearly-connected group of islands. Thus, Cuba has 6 believed to be restricted to its soil; Jamaica, 7; Hispaniola, 2; and the so-called “Windward Islands,” probably 4; while none are known to be absolutely limited to the Bahamas, to Porto Rico, or the Virgin Islands. It is possible, indeed, that Hispaniola and Porto Rico, if as well explored a3 Cuba and Jamaica have been, might tell a very different story.

Pursuing the subject further, and entering, so far as space will allow, upon a consideration of details, we find that there are of Land-birds about 200 resident species, and nearly 90 which are not resident, but migratory. These last belong to about 55 genera, of which some 40 have no resident insular representatives, while those migrants pertaining to genera which possess permanent residents are nearly all as much Neotropical as Nearctic in character. Most of these, so far as is known, visit Cuba only, where over 80 are recorded as occurring, while but 30 reach Jamaica. The number, however, in the island last named, and in others, would most likely be not inconsiderably increased did competent observers but exist, though the fact that a well-known species like the Humming-bird of eastern North America (Trochilus colubris) does not seek its winter-abode in any of the islands except the Bahamas and Cuba, tends to lessen the force of such a supposition, and points to our actual knowledge being not very far wrong. Among the more interesting of peculiar forms is one genus of Turdidoe (Mimocichla), which is represented by 4 distinct species, found in the Bahamas, Cuba, Jamaica, and Hispaniola respectively. Another genus of the same family (Margarops) has a species ranging from Hispaniola to the Virgin Islands, and a second species inhabiting Martinique and St Lucia only, these two islands possessing at the same time a third and peculiar genus (Rham-phodnclus), containing but a single species, common to both, while they also have another genus (Cinclocerihia), a distinct species of which inhabits either island, though a third species of the same is found in Guadaloupe and Nevis. The genus Certhiola, belonging to the Coerébidoe, is remarkable in that it occurs in nearly every island except Cuba; but what seems to be still more extraordinary is that the species found in the Bahamas (C. bahamensis), and there alone in the whole Subregion, also occurs in Cozumel, an island off the coast of Yucatan, though Cuba intervenes. The distribution of Spindalis, one of the Tanagridae, resembles that of Mimocichla, above noticed, only that here Porto Rico also has its distinct representative species. Of the peculiar genera of Humming-birds, Eulampis has 2 species—one ranging from St Lucia t» Nevis, but the second extending northward to St Thomas. Aithurus, a very remarkable form, is restricted to Jamaica, while Mellisuga is common to that island and Hispaniola— each of these genera consisting of but one species only, and the last is the smallest known bird. Orthorhynchus seems to have 3 species, one extending from St Thomas to Dominica, a second (perhaps barely separable) common to Martinique and St Lucia, and a third to St Vincent and Barbadoes; and, finally, Sporadinus has one species in Cuba and at least one of the Bahamas, a second species in Hispaniola, and a third in Porto Rico. Of genera of Humming-birds, which are not confined to the Antilles, Lampomis, a widely-ranging genus, has two species peculiar to Jamaica and Porto Rico respectively; while a third extends from Hispaniola to St Thomas. Calypte, which has two species in Mexico, has a third peculiar to Cuba, while Doricha is represented in two of the Bahamas (New Providence and Inagua) by as many distinct species; the other three described species of the form inhabiting Central America, and none, so far as known, occurring in [9:3:750] Cuba; and thus we have afforded us another case of interrupted generic distribution somewhat like though not quite so extraordinary as that of Certhiola already noticed. In all, about 17 species of Trochilidoe are found in the Antilles, of which only one, and that of exceptionally developed migratory habits, occurs elsewhere. The peculiar family Todidoe has been already mentioned; and it is only necessary here to remark that the single genus Todus which it contains seems to have 5 species, one limited to each of the large islands, Cuba, Jamaica, Hispaniola, and Porto Rico, the fifth being from an unknown locality.^[41. A bird of this group was one of those asserted by Ledru to have formerly occurred in St Thomas (page 734).] Much the same has to be said of Saurothera, a genus of Cuculidoe, which is represented by a distinct species in each of these four islands, while another genus of the same family, Hyetomis, with one species, is peculiar to Jamaica. The Trogonidoe have two genera, Prionoteles and Temnotrogon, each with a single species, the former peculiar to Cuba, and the latter, which exhibits a remarkable affinity to the African genus HapaLoderma, to Hispaniola. Pseudoscops, a genus of Strigidoe, is peculiar to Jamaica, but Gymnoglaux, belonging to the same family, has one species limited to Cuba, while a second extends from Porto Rico to some of the Virgin Islands. Cuba also, besides a widely-ranging species of Kestrel (Tinnunculus), has a second species which is peculiar to the island. Jamaica, on the other hand, seems to have no Kestrel at all.

Any speculations as to the former history of the Antilles derived from our imperfect knowledge of their existing ornis would be vain. It is enough to perceive, as the preceding facts will show, that there must here have been no ordinary amount of upheaval and subsidence, of turning land into water and water into land, to account for the present distribution of their avifauna. More wonderful than any evidence given by the Birds, is that which is afforded by other Classes. It is asserted that Solenodon, an Antillean genus of Insectivorous Mammals, has its nearest ally in a Malagasy form; and a splendid Butterfly, found only in Jamaica (Urania sloanii), belongs to a genus of which while two other species are known from Central and South America respectively, the only other genus resembling it is one that inhabits Madagascar.

III. The Ne arctic Region comprises all that is left of the American continent, after the Neotropical Region has been taken off, and certain outlying groups of islands, such as the Aleutian chain, with its immediate dependencies, and the Bermudas—none of them, however, being of any great importance,—as well as the circumpolar lands lying westward of long. 60 c W., and Greenland. The confines of these two Regions, as before stated (page 748), are as yet but vaguely traced. All that is known for certain is that the more northern runs considerably southward along the highlands of Central America, and that its influence, as determined by the presence of resident genera of northern extraction, is perceptibly felt on the summits or slopes of the mountains, at least so far southward as lat. 20° N. In the lowlands the boundary lies much further towards the north, and, perhaps, in general terms, may be placed somewhere about lat. 25° N., while both in lowlands and highlands, as above explained, the northern influence varies with the seasons of the year, being greatest in winter, when the migratory birds, which breed in the Nearctic Region, have turned their flight southward, and least in summer, when they have retired to their northern homes. If the avifauna of the Neotropical Region could, in a wide sense, be truly termed homogeneous, much more is this the state of the case with the Nearctic. Of the 63 families^[42. Three of these (Haematopodidce, Jiecun·irosiridce, and PliaLaropod- idoc) are not regarded as good families by the writer. They are all common also to the Palaearctic Region.] of Birds, which is the highest number that it seems possible to count for this region, only 1, Chamoeidoe, is peculiar, and the validity of the grounds on which this has been established as such may be open to question; 44 of them are also Pahsarctic; and the remaining 18 are common to the Neotropical Region, of which last number at least 4 (Trogonidoe, Plotidoe, Fregatidoe, and Phaetontidoe) have a much more extended range. Thus there are 14 peculiarly American families left. These are Mniotiltidoe, Coerebidoe, Tanagridoe, Vireonidae, Icteridae, Tyrannidoe, Trochilidoe, Momotidoe, Aridoe, Cathartidoe, Graddoe, Meleagridae, Tantalidae, and Aramidae. But the propriety of here admitting Trogonidoe (mentioned above) aud Momotidoe is very doubtful; for, though included by Dr Coues, they are omitted by Professor Baird from his North American Birds, the most recent work on the subject. The claim of Coerebidoe to be considered Nearctic is also slender, resting on the fact that a small colony of the Sugar-bird which inhabits the Bahamas (Certhiola bahamensis) has established itself on one of the Florida Cays. The Aridoe are represented in the Region by a single species only—the long-known Carolina Parrakeet (Conurus carolinensis); and the Tanagridoe, a family containing upwards of forty genera, have but one genus (Pyranga), exemplified by four or five species, out of about a dozen, which occur within its limits.

On the other hand, the peculiarly American families best represented in the Nearctic Region seem to be four in number,— Mniotiltidoe, by 13 genera and about 50 species, Vireonidoe by 1 genus and 14 species, Icteridae by 8 genera and 21 species, and Tyrannidoe by 8 genera and 26 species. The first of these, however, can alone be regarded as eminently characteristic of the Region, since that affords a home to all but 3 of the genera, but at the same time, only about one-half of the described species occur there. None of the rest can compare with it in this respect, Vireonidoe having 5 genera and 50 species, Icteridae 24 genera and 105 species, and Tyrannidoe 71 genera and 324 species in the Neotropical Region.

Coming now to the genera of Nearctic birds, we may put the number perhaps at 330, of which 24 seem to be peculiar to the Region; 2 of them belong to Turdidoe, 1 to Chamoeidoe, Paridoe, Troglodytidoe, and Motacillidoe respectively, 5 to Ember izidoe, 2 to Corvidoe, 1 to each of Picidoe, Falconidoe, and Columbidoe, 5 to Tetraonidoe, and 1 to Scolopacidoe, Anatidoe, and Larxdoe respectively. But it is perhaps worth remarking that the families Emberizidoe and Tetraonidoe, here most abundantly represented by genera, are still more abundantly represented in like manner elsewhere. In the Neotropical Region we have some 30 and in the Old World some 15 genera of the former, which are not found in the Nearctic Region; and the Old World has some 30 genera of the latter which are not found in the New. On the other hand it must be admitted that if we subdivide the American Tetraonidoe into sections or sub families, we find that while one of those sections, the Odon tophorinoe, is peculiar to America, the balance as regards the other, Tetraoninae, is clearly in favour of its greater development in North America, where we have 3 genera absolutely peculiar, as well as 3 others which are also found in the Palaearctic Region. With this Region, indeed, the Nearctic has about 128 generain common, having 178 which are also Neotropical. Returning to these last presently, it may be advisable here to give some particulars of those which are common to both sides of the North Atlantic. 1 belongs to each of the families Turdidoe and Cinclidoe ; 3 to Sylviidae, 2 to Paridoe, 1 to Sittidoe, Certhiidoe, Troglodytidoe, and Alaudidoe respectively, 2 to each of Mota- [9:3:751] dlidoe and Hirundinidoe, 1 to Ampélidoe and Laniidoe respectively, 7 to Fringillidoe, 2 to Ernberizidoe, 3 to Corvidae, 1 to each of Cypselidoe and Alcedinidoe, 3 to Picidce, 9 to Strigidoe, 10 toFalconidoe, 1 to Columbidoe, 3toTetra- onidoe and Charadriidoe respectively, 2 to each of H<mor tσpodidce i Recurvirodridoe, and Phalaropodidoe, 7 to Scolo- pacidoe, 1 to Ibididoe and Plataleidoe respectively, 4 to Ardeidoe, 1 to Gruidae, 5 to Rallidoe, 1 to Phoenicopteridae, 18 to Anatidoe, 1 to each of Sulidoe, Pelecanidoe, and Phalacrocoracidoe, 6 to Larxdae, 3 to Procellarvidoe, 1 to each of Colymbidoe and Podicipedidoe, and 10 to Alcidoe ^[43. Of many American Birds, especially Water-birds, which from time to time occur as stragglers in Europe, no account has here been taken, and, of course, they will not be reckoned in our computation of Palaearctic genera.] A Thus it will be seen that no less than 57, or more than one-sixth of the whole 330 genera, are purely Land-birds,—a very large proportion.

The genera which occur both in the Nearctic and Neotropical Regions, without appearing in the Palaearctic, must be divided into two categories in order to arrive at a just estimate of the relations of the avifaunas of the first two. These categories consist of those genera which, being only winter visitants to the southern Region, do not breed there, and those which may fairly be called common to both. The latter need perhaps no further attention, after what has been previously said of the Central-American Subregion (p. 748), but the former require some notice. Of those in this category 1 genus belongs to each of the families Sylviidoe and Troglodytidoe, 8 to Mniotiltidae, 6 to Embe- rizidoe, 1 to Icteridoe, Trochilid<x, Picidoe, and Columbidoe respectively, 6 to Scolopacidoe, and 1 to Phalaropodidoe — 27 in all. These must, of course, be considered characteristic of the Nearctic Region, and might, indeed, be not inappropriately added to the 24 genera which are, as already said, peculiar thereto; but even if this be done, we find the number of peculiar and characteristic genera (taken together) of the Nearctic Region to be only 51—a smaller number than that of the genera of Land-birds alone (57) which are common to the Palaearctic, and considerably less than half the number of all genera which are found on both sides of the Atlantic (128), while the remaining genera which are strictly common to the Neotropical (151) is much larger again. Thus, regarded simply from an ornithologist’s point of view, what we call the Nearctic “Region” seems to have no right to be considered one of the primary Regions of the earth’s surface, and to be of less importance than some of the Subregions of the Neotropical Region, as may be shewn more plainly by the following table :—
[table]

It is not, however, intended here to question the validity of the Nearctic Region in a zoogeographical sense. If that position could be successfully disputed, it must be done on more than ornithological grounds, and a consideration of them would be out of place in this article. It is enough to mention that though the Mammals would possibly lead to much the same conclusion as the Birds do, yet the lower Classes of Vertebrates—Reptiles, Amphibians, and Fishes —would most likely have a contrary tendency, while the present writer is quite unable to guess at the result which would be afforded by the Invertebrates. Now, as in map ping out the W(θrld into zoological Regions all animais have to be regarded, he has no wish to disturb the scheme which has been so generally approved, but contents himself with pointing out that the case for its adoption is not in this particular instance strengthened by the evidence given by the Class Aves.

A great majority of the Nearctic families and genera of Birds appear to be generally distributed throughout all the “Subregions,” or perhaps it would be better to call them “provinces,” into which ingenuity can separate the Region. And on this account, as well as from what has been urged in the preceding paragraph, it seems unnecessary to treat of each “Subregion” or “province” so fully as has hitherto been done in the present article. Indeed such districts are not easily defined, and their definition rests rather on differences of species than of higher groups, as we have found to be the case in discussing the several component parts of the other Regions we have considered. Professor Baird, in a masterly treatise on this and another subject,^[44. “The Distribution and Migrations of North American Birds, American Journal of Science and Arts, ser. 2, vol. xli. pp. 78-90,184-192, 337-347 (January, March, and May, 1866).] would first divide that portion of North America which constitutes the Nearctic Region into two principal sections, the Eastern extending from the Atlantic sea-board westward across the Alleghany Mountains and over the valley of the Mississippi and its fertile prairies to about long. 100° W., where the sterile plains begin. The western boundary of this division, however, is not sharply defined, nor does it coincide with any meridian line, but lies somewhat obliquely and interdigitates with the eastern confines of the next division by extending westward along the riverbottoms. Marching with this irregular frontier we have the second, or Western, great division reaching thence to the shores of the Pacific, and though the character of its avifauna is much the same through and beyond the Rocky Mountains to the eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada and Cascade Mountains of California and Oregon, it changes somewhat on their western slope and thence to the sea, exhibiting modifications which may warrant further separation into a truly Western and a Central subdivision—thus making in all three provinces for the whole of the more southern part of the Nearctic Region, while each of them shews, as might be expected, indicatione of additional change, subject in great measure to the degree of latitude under which any particular locality in them may lie.

Having thus pointed out the three provinces into which this portion of the Region can be separated, it may be well to cull from Professor Baird’s investigations of the subject some further details. The boundary of the Eastern province, which, taking up an old name, we may perhaps term the “Alleghanian”—from the principal mountain range within its limits,—starts from the Gulf of Mexico, near the eastern border of Texas, perhaps between the rivers Brazos and Sabinè, and following the course of the former to the great American Desert, in about long. 100° W., runs northward, forced sometimes more or less westward, especially along the Platte, and sometimes eastward. It crosses the Platte between Forts Kearney and Laramie, and apparently intersects the Missouri about Fort Lookout. Reaching the southern frontier of the Dominion of Canada, it rapidly inclines to the westward, and including the valleys of the Saskatchewan and the Athabasca, it crosses the Rocky Mountains, and, cutting the river Yukon below the junction of the Pelly and the Porcupine, loses itself in the wilds which border the Arctic Ocean. Since the Middle province—on which as yet no more precise name has been bestowed—lies for the most part between the Alleghanian and the Western or “Californian,” as it has been entitled, the boundaries of this last had best, so far [9:3:752] as is possible, be j,iven. Its extent both southward and northward is somewhat indefinite. The avifauna of Cape San Lucas, at the extremity of the peninsula of Old or Lower California, is said to be thoroughly that of the “Middle” province, but whether the whole of that promontory is to be reckoned as belonging thereto, or only its eastern border, is not known. It appears, however, that some of the most characteristic forms of the Middle province find their way to the Pacific coast through a break in the mountains opposite to San Diego, and it is to be remarked that the difference between the species of birds found at Cape San Lucas (of which about a score are absolutely peculiar) and of Mazatlan, though separated only by the breadth of the Gulf of California, is very great. Northward the boundary of the Californian province probably runs along the Sierra Nevada and the Cascade Mountains before named, so that its extent is contracted to a mere strip along the coast, while still further to the north, in British Columbia, no precise details of its limits have as yet reached this country. But it would seem that in Alaska, as will presently be stated at greater length, an avifauna presenting many very different characters from any found elsewhere in America is reached, for here we encounter a number of genuine Palaearctic forms.

But these are not all the zoological provinces into which this part of North America can be separated. A fourth, of especially Arctic type, occupies the northern portion of the continent, and gradually melts away into the rest, extending far to the southward along the highest ranges, even to Fort Burgwyn, in lat. 37° N., if not beyond. This province may be called the “Canadian,” from the ancient colony of that name constituting so large a portion of it, but its limits must be confessed to be indefinite in a high degree. The eastern half, at least, of the British possessions in North America are herein included, and the province may be deemed to extend across Davis’s Strait to Greenland.

In noticing these provinces, the results of Professor Baird’s researches have been, with little deviation, mainly adopted, but his enquiries have been largely supplemented by the more recent investigations of Mr J. A. Allen, who has admirably carried out the further subdivision of the Eastern, or, as it has been termed, the Alleghanian province, together with part of what has just been denominated the Canadian. Regarding the whole eastern half of the continent as one province, he recognises in it the existence of seven distinct ornithological faunas, namely, the Floridan, the Louisianian, the Carolinan, the Alleghanian, the Canadian, the Hudsonian, and the American-Arctic, comparing them also with the distribution therein of Mammals and Reptiles.^[45. Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard College, vol. ιi. pp. 387-407.] To describe more fully the boundaries of these faunas would be to enter on matters too special for our present purpose, and it must suffice to 'direct attention to this essay of Mr Allen’s, which, like others of his,^[46. Memoirs of the Boston Society of Natural History, vol. i. pp. 448-526, and Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology, vol. iii. pp. 113-183.] though their titles may seem to indicate for them but a limited scope, has, in truth, a very general bearing.

The provinces above named (and naturally the districts which they comprise) appear to be characterized rather by the presence or absence of certain species of widely-spread genera than by the presence or absence of the genera themselves, and much less of families, but it seems expedient to notice some of the chief exceptions to general distribution in the latter of these groups. First we have the peculiar family of Chamoeidoe, restricted so far as is known to the coast-district of California, where it is represented by a single genus and a single species; and then among families of greater range, the Coerébidoe, already introduced to us as a Neotropical group, but in the Nearctic Region existing only in the case of the colony of a species of Certhiola before noticed; the Aridoe, nowadays almost limited to Western Louisiania, Arkansas, and Florida, but formerly known along the whole valley of the Mississippi to the verge of the Great Lakes, and even occasionally penetrating to Pennsylvania and the State of New York; the Cathartidoe, of which one genus {Pseudogryphus), having for its sole species one of the largest birds of flight, the Californian Vulture (P. califomianus), is confined to the Pacific coast from a little north of the Columbia River to the Colorado, extending eastward to the Sierra Nevada, while of another genus (Cathartes) one species ranges from the Strait of Magellan to the Saskatchewan, but a second hardly strays further northward than North Carolina, and does not occur on the Pacific coast of the United States; the Turkeys (Meleagridae), found only to the eastward of the Rocky Mountains, and now extinct in most of the settled districts of Pennsylvania, New England, and Canada; the Wood-Ibises (Tantalidae), belonging to the southern country from the Colorado eastward, and so far to the north as the State of Ohio and the Carolinas; the Spoonbills (Plataleιdce), with apparently much the same range as the last, but more limited towards the north, being of only accidental occurrence on the Lower Mississippi and in the Carolinas; the Courlans (Aramidoe), frequenting in this region only the shores of the Gulf of Mexico and the coast of Florida; the Flamingoes (Phoenicopteridoe), with haunts nearly as much confined, though occasionally reaching South Carolina; the Pelicans (Pelecanidoe), having one species abundant in the Western and only by chance occurring in the Middle and Eastern states, while a second is of strictly marine habit, and is found on the coast of California, and in the Gulf of Mexico and the shoals of Florida. The single representative of the Darters (Plotidoe) in summer reaches North Carolina and Illinois, but that of the Frigate-birds (Fregatidoe) is confined to the shores of the great Gulf, while that of the Tropic-birds (Phaetontidoe) not only haunts the same waters but also finds a nursery in the Bermudas; the species of Divers (Colymbidoe) breed only in the north—Halifax, in lat. 45° N., being perhaps their most southern limit of reproduction; while, finally; the Auks (Alcidoe), Sea-birds of northern range, exhibit a most remarkable development of genera, species, and individuals on the rocky cliffs and islets which riβe from the North Pacific.

Reference has already been made to the peculiarity of the avifauna of Alaska—Russian America, as it was formerly called,—and its character needs brief notice. The list of Birds observed in this territory, as given by Messrs Dall and Bannister,^[47. Transactions of the Chicago Academy of Sciences, vol. i. pp. 267- 310.] seems after due revision to number 210 species. Of these 96 are Land-birds, belonging to 63 genera, whereof 20 at the outside are peculiarly American, while of the remaining 43, which are common to the Nearctic and Palaearctic Regions, 3 are found nowhere else in the New World but in Alaska, and their occurrence there does not preclude us from setting them down as being emphatically Palaearctic forms. Two of them are actually represented by species common throughout the greater part of Asia and Europe, as is the case with Budytes flavus, a Yellow Wagtail, and Phylloscopus borealis, a Willow-Wren, while the third is a peculiar species of Bullfinch, Pyrrhula cassini. Of the whole 96 species of Land-birds, 23, or nearly one-fourth, are common to the two Regions. The Water-birds, amounting to 115 species, are referable to 63 genera, of which only 4 (all belonging to Scolopacidoe) are [9:3:753] peculiarly Nearctic, though of the species 58 are truly American against 52 common to both Regions, one of these last, however, not having been found elsewhere in the New World, while the home of 5 seems doubtful. These numbers will show the great influence of Palaearctic forms on Alaska, and it only remains to be said that some of the ordinary summer-migrants thither would seem to arrive there from Asia, as the Wagtail and Willow-Wren just mentioned, to which should possibly be added the Wheatear (Saxicola aenanthe), for though that species is known as a regular annual visitant to Greenland and Labrador (where it breeds), and almost annually appears as a straggler on the eastern coast of the United States, the flocks which throng the stony hill-tops of Alaska in spring are not likely to have performed a north-west passage from Europe, and indeed it is stated that specimens from Norton Sound differ considerably in dimensions from those obtained in Greenland. All these Birds are unseen in British Columbia, and as all are migratory, the inference that they make some part of Asia their winter-quarters is almost irresistible.

After all, perhaps there is nothing very surprising in this, when we consider the narrowness of the ohannel^[48. Behring’s Strait is said also to be very shallow, which fact is suggestive as to a still greater interchange of animal life in past ages.] by which in these longitudes the New World is divided from the Old, and it would seem that it is almost within the confines of the Arctic circle that, apart from circumpolar species, the connection of the faunas of the two continents is closest. At any rate, the Aleutian Islands, though they look like stepping-stones from the one to the other, do not appear to be used as a route of communication; for Mr Dall calls especial attention to the fact that no intrusion of Asiatic forms occurs towards the western end of the chain, while observing that its avifauna beyond Oonalaska is reinforced by several Arctic species not possessed by more eastern islands.^[49. Proceedings of the Californian Academy of Sciences, 14th March 1S74,]

Northward of the Aleutians lies a little volcanic group known as the Prybilov Islands, whose coasts are frequently encumbered by ice, and there only 40 species of Birds have as yet been found, while those which breed are about 12 in number, and among them a Sandpiper (Tringa ptilocnemis), apparently peculiar to St Paul’s Island, the largest of the group. Only one of the characteristically Palaearctic forms, and this also a Water-bird (Limosa uropygialis), which appear but in Alaska, seems there to occur—a fact which points yet again to the more northern connection of the two continents by way of Cape Prince-of-Wales and the East Cape (Vostochni) of Asia.

We have next to turn to another group of islands, situated in a different ocean, and in formation very unlike that last considered. These are the Bermudas, a cluster of low coral-reefs rising from the Atlantic, about 600 miles from Cape Hatteras, the nearest point on the eastern coast of North America. They possess but few Land-birds, and not a single peculiar species, yet they play by no means an unimportant part as a resting-station to the flocks of migrants as they retreat southward from their northern homes in Labrador and Greenland, and, though less often, on their northward journey in spring. Only about 6 Landbirds are resident, and about as many Water-birds are known to breed there; but the number of stragglers is large, and includes two or three of undoubtedly European extraction.

Greenland is the last portion of the Nearctic Region to which we shall especially invite attention, and there though the character of the avifauna is certainly that of the New World, yet that of the Old is very influential. Out of the 45 genera to which the feathered inhabitants of Greenland belong, none are peculiar to the Palaearctic Region, while 2— Zonotrichia, one of the Emberùidoe, and Rhodostethia, one of the Laridae — are peculiar to the Nearctic. If we take the species, we find that of the 63 inhabitants, those peculiar to the New World amount to 11, while those not elsewhere dwelling out of the Old are only 5. < But, on the other hand, the Sea-Eagle (Haliaetus), the Ringed Plover (Aegia- litis), and the Snipe (Scolopax) which breed in Greenland are those of Europe instead of their American congeners; and the Wheatear (Saxicola), the Sanderling (Calidris), the Knot (Tringa canutus), and the Bernacle-Goose (Bernicla leucopsis) would appear to cross the Atlantic from the east, while 43 out of the 63 inhabitant species are every bit as much Palaearctic as Nearctic; and 2 more, the Ptarmigan (Lagopus rupestris) and Barrow’s Duck (Clangula islandica) breed abundantly in Iceland. Following the western coast-line (for of the eastern we know little) to the Arctic circle,^[50. People are apt to forget that Cape Farewell, the most southerly point of Greenland, lies in the latitude which cuts the Shetlands and passes far to the south of Iceland; and a large portion of the country though undoubtedly exposed in the highest degree to the rigours of an Arctic climate, is situated outside the Arctic circle.] we find the proportion of forms which are common to the Palaearctic Region increase, until in lat.jΓ5° N. or thereabouts, there are (so far as our means of information will allow us to judge) no species of Birds which have not been known to occur, and only about 5 which have not been known to breed, in the Old World.

It has been already stated that 128 out of the 330 Nearctic genera, or more than one-third, are common also to the Palaearctic Region. This will serve to shew the great similarity of the two; and if we investigate the species, the similarity is still to a great extent borne out. Taking the number of Nearctic species at 700 (which is perhaps an exaggeration), and that of the Palaearctic at 850 (which is certainly under the mark), we find that, exclusive of stragglers, there are about 100 common to the two Regions. Nearly 20 more are Palaearctic but occasionally occur in America, and about 50 are Nearctic which from time to time stray to Europe or Asia.^[51. Professor Baird, in the essaybefore cited, has reasonably accounted for this disproportionate reciprocity between Europe and America; but perhaps something more than he has allowed must be set down to the comparative want of records in the new country, where observers and amateur collectors have until lately been scarce. This want is, however, being speedily supplied by the numerous students of out-of-doors ornithology, who are everywhere springing up throughout the United States.] But this is not the only ground of the resemblance. Of many genera the species found in the New World are represented in the Old by species which often no one but an expert can distinguish. Of such representative or parallel species, somewhere about 80 might be enumerated; and thus the relation of the two regions may be concisely stated :—

IV. The Palaearctic Region begins with the Atlantic Islands (the Azores, Canaries, and Madeiras) and includes that portion of North-west Africa which was formerly known as the Barbary States, the whole of Europe and its islands—from Iceland and Spitsbergen to those of the Mediterranean—Asia Minor, Palestine, Persia, Afghanistan, and all the rest of the Asiatic continent lying to the north ward of the Himalaya Mountains and of a line drawn as though it was a prolongation of that range to the eastward[9:3:754] somewhere between lat. 30' j and 35° N. till it meets the Pacific Ocean, besides Japan and the Kurile Islands. The propriety of comprehending this enormous tract in one Zoological Region was first shown by Mr Sclater, in the paper to which reference has before been made,^[52. Journal of the Proceedings of the Linnean Society, Zoology, oL it pp. 134-138.] and as regards the distribution of most classes of animals there have been few to doubt that it is an extremely natural one. Not indeed altogether so homogeneous as the Nearctic Region, it presents however even at its extreme points no very striking difference between the bulk of its Birds. Though Japan is far removed from Western Europe, and though a few generic forms and still fewer families inhabit the one without also frequenting the other, yet there is a most astonishing similarity in a large portion of their respective Birds, ς∖In some cases the closest examination has failed to detect any distinction that may be called specific between the members of their avifauna; but in most it is possible to discover just sufficient difference to warrant a separation of the subjects. Nevertheless it is clear that in Japan we have as it were a repetition of some of our most familiar species—the Redbreast and the Hedge-Sparrow for example—slightly modified in plumage or otherwise so as to furnish instances of the most accurate representation.

The limits of the western portion of the Region are definite enough, for except in its African province it is girt by the sea, but even there we find a boundary hardly inferior to a coast-line in the precision with which it may be recognized and in the influence it exerts. This is the Great Desert, commonly known as the Sahara, which, though yearly crossed by innumerable multitudes of many of the more migratory species, just as the sea itself is traversed by them, acts as a complete barrier to the less migratory and to the residents, cutting off the denizens of Morocco, Algeria, and Tunis from the rest of the continent to which they are geographically attached. Further to the eastward, however, the limits of the Region are if in any way marked at least but little known, though indications are not wanting to show that the avifauna of Tripoli is rather Ethiopian than Palaearctic in its character. When we reach Egypt we have a state of things which may be compared to that debatable land in Central America wherein the Neotropical and Nearctic avifaunas meet but hardly mingle. During winter the bird-population of the Nile-valley is formed almost exclusively of the hordes of European migrants of nearly all Orders and families which there seek refuge. When spring returns these begin to troop across the Mediterranean, and their place is taken by the indigenous Birds of Egypt which had been either reduced to comparative insignificance by, or actually thrust out before, the northern invaders. The seaboard of Palestine, and even its interior, until the western limits of the Jordan-basin are touched, are on the contrary almost purely Palaearctic, but the depressed valley of the Ghor, part of which is sunk about 1300 feet below the level of the Mediterranean, seems to be an outlier of the Ethiopian Region, and though the scanty avifauna of the Mountains of Moab may possess a northern phase, the desert, with its characteristic, and in the main Ethiopian, forms of animallife almost immediately succeeds, and it is not until the fertile plains of Mesopotamia are approached or attained that we can feel assured we have again entered the Palaearctic area, which may be considered to reach the head of the Persian Gulf. Coasting this inlet on its eastern side we have a fauna the character of which it is as yet impossible to declare, and this difficulty becomes greater still when we emerge into the Indian Ocean. It seems most probable that Beloochistan belongs to the Palaeartic Region, but if not then the line of demarcation must run inland and so continue between that land and Afghanistan till, ascending the right bank of the valley of the Indus, it turns the shoulder of the Great Snowy Range and thence proceeds in the direction already traced parallel to the southern frontier of Thibet, and across the intervening portion of the Chinese Empire, once more to the ocean. Arrived here the remaining limits of the Region are as well marked by the coastdine as they were in Europe. They extend to Kamchatka, and rounding the furthest verge of Asia, within the Arctic Circle, they return by the north coast of Siberia till the confines of Europe are again reached.

To separate this vast area into subsidiary districts according to the zoological properties of each is perhaps a less easy task than is the same operation with regard to the Nearctic Region, and, as in that case, the mapping-out of the whole into Subregions is almost impossible except it be done arbitrarily. Nevertheless the attempt must be made, and, though in the Asiatic half considerable assistance is to be derived from a careful essay by Mr Elwes,^[53. Proceedings of the Zoological Society, 1873, p, 615.] respecting the European moiety much doubt may be reasonably entertained.

The very fulness of the information which we possess as to the ornis of some countries of Europe makes the scarcity of it in respect to others all the more conspicuous, and renders any really comprehensive view of the whole all the more difficult. Grounds are not wanting at first sight in favour of a longitudinal or approximately longitudinal division of this quarter of the globe, in which case the line of demarcation might be taken to run up the Adriatic Sea, and starting from the neighbourhood of Trieste, to cross the Camic Alps, descend the valley of the Inn till it falls into the Danube, and thence follow the angular mountain frontier of Bohemia as far as the head-waters of the Niesse, along which it would proceed to their junction with the Oder, and so to the Baltic a little to the westward of Stettin. Thence it might be continued northward between (Eland and Gottland up the Gulf of Bothnia to the confines of Sweden and Finland, where cutting the Scandinavian peninsula to the westward of the Lower Torneâ and its affluent the Muonio it would strike the shores of the Arctic Ocean perhaps on the Lyngen Fjord. Though undoubtedly most species of Birds are common to both sides of this imaginary line, yet it would be found to divide the breeding-range of a few which are very characteristic of the east and west of Europe respectively. But on further consideration it would seem that though such a division as has just been suggested may be convenient if not natural for the countries lying north of the Mediterranean basin, those, such as the three principal peninsulas which project into the great inland sea, together with the portion of North Africa which was at one time known as Mauritania, form a group which have much in common, and collectively differ more from the countries lying further to the north than the two (Eastern and Western) divisions of Central and Northern Europe, just suggested, do from one another. Accordingly it seems best to adopt primarily a latitudinal division of the Western part of the Palaearctic Region. This done we should have as our first Subregion all Europe north of the Pyrenees, the Alps, the Balkan, the Black Sea, and the Caucasus, and since it would thus comprehend by far the greater portion of this quarter of the globe, we may not inappropriately call it the “European” Subregion, further subdividing it if we think fit into a Western and an Eastern Province, according to the boundary above traced—the eastern boundary of the last being indeed very uncertain, though perhaps to [9:3:755] be limited by the Ural Mountains and the River of the same name. Next we should have the Subregion to which we may most properly affix the name of “Mediterranean,” comprehending the portion of North Africa already indicated, the Iberian and Italian peninsulas, as well as Turkey in Europe and the Peloponnesus, but we must extend it far to the eastward through Asia Minor and Persia until it touches the Indian Region. The lofty range of the Caucasus would divide it from the European Subregion between the Black Sea and the Caspian; beyond the latter, however, we cannot do more than guess that the desert of the Tekko Turcomans and the mountains of Cabool would form its northern boundary. Then stretching from the eastern shores of the Caspian in a wide belt, but how wide is a matter of the greatest uncertainty, comes the third Subregion, which we may call the “Mongolian ”—marching with the Mediterranean Subregion till the Hindoo Koosh is reached, and thence coincident with the southern borders of the Region towards the Yellow Sea—possibly following the course of the Yangstzekiang. To this Subregion also would belong the greater part if not the whole of Japan. Northward again we have the great “Siberian” Subregion, but materials for any attempt to shew whether its southern boundary is capable of being laid down are absolutely wanting. Even on the seaboard it is at present impossible to say whether it is in Manchuria that one Subregion passes into the other, or whether first the Stannovoi and further inland the Altai Mountains mark their respective limits.

Having thus indicated the component parts of the whole area, it is time to say somewhat of its avifaunal characters. Like the Nearctic the Palaearctic Region seems to produce but a single peculiar family of Birds—the Panuridae, the type of which is the beautiful species known to Englishmen as the Bearded Titmouse (Panurus biarmicus) — and this is a family which has not been long or very generally recognized. Its members, however, are found stationed at intervals from the western to the eastern extremity, and every attempt to refer them to other groups of Birds has proved unsatisfactory—for the different genera (about the number of which there is much doubt) have often been widely scattered by systematists, one being placed at times with the Titmouse-family (Parùke), at times with the Buntings (Ernberizidae), another relegated to the Finches (Fringillidae), and a third or even more to the so-called “Babblers” (Timeliidae). The entire number of Palaearctic families, computing them as we have already done those of other Regions, is about 67, not counting 1 other (Nectar iniidae) of which a single species is peculiar to the valley of the Ghor, and that of the genera 323, about which there can be little doubt, or if any exist it may be that the number is understated. Of these as we have above mentioned 128 are common to the Nearctic Region. Species of 5l more seem to occur as true natives both in the Ethiopian and Indian Regions, of which 4 genera belong to Sylviidoe, 1 each to Timeliidae, Ixidae, and Oriolidae, 2 to Muscicapidoe, 1 to Laniidae, 2 to Motacillidoe, 1 to Dicaeidae, 2 to Fringillidae, 1 to Embeñzidae, 3 to Alaudidae, 1 to Cuculidae, 2 to Coraciidae, 1 to Meropidae, Upupidae, Caprimulgidae, and Cypselidae respectively, 4 to Vultwridae, 6 to Falconidae, 1 to each of Strigidae, Columbidae, and Pterocleidae, 3 to Tetraonidoe, 1 to Turnicülae, 2 to Otididae and Gharadriidae, and 1 to each of Glareolidae, Gursoriidae, Laridae, and Anatidae. Besides these 18 appear to be common to the Ethiopian without being found in the Indian Region, and no fewer than 71 to the Indian without being found in the Ethiopian. Of the former 1 is referable to Turdidae, 3 to Sylviidoe, 1 to each of Timdiidae, Musàcapidae, Laniidae, and Motacillidoe, 3 to Fringillidae, 1 to Ernberizidae and Sturnidae respectively, 3 to Alaudidae, and 1 to each of Gruidae and Ciconiidae.

Of the latter, 2 genera belong to Turdidae, 17 to Sylviidoe, 4 to Timxl·iidae, 1 to each of Troglodytidae and Gerthridae, 3 to Liotrichidae, 1 to Parwlae and Ixidae respectively, 4 tc Muscicapidoe, 1 to each of Motaxillidae and Hirundinidae, 3 to Fringillidae, 4 to Sturnidae, 3 to Corvid ce, 1 to Pittidae, 2 ïoPicidae, 1 ïojyngidae and Cuculidae respectively, 2 to Alcedinidae, 1 to V·dturidae, 3 to Strigidae, 2 to each of Golumbidae and Tetraonidoe, 5 to Phasianidae, l to Otididae, 3 to Scolopacidae, and 1 to Anatidae. To compare the Palaearctic genera with those of the Australian and Neotropical Regions would be simply a waste of time, for the points of resemblance are extremely few, and such as they are they lead to nothing. It will therefore be seen from the above that next to the Nearctic Region, the Palaearctic has a much greater affinity to the Indian than to any other, a fact which need not surprise us when we consider the great extent of their contact.

Having shewn this much we have next to deal with the peculiarities of the Region under our view. At the lowest computation 37 genera seem to be peculiar to it, though it is certain that species of several are regularly wont to wander beyond its limits in winter seeking a southern climate there to avoid the distress they would suffer in that of their birth. Of these genera 3 are to be apportioned to the Warblers, Sylviidoe; probably 2 to the Babblers, Timeliidae ; at least 3 or perhaps 4 to the Panuridae ; 1 to each of Paridae and Ixidae; 2 to the Flycatchers, Muscicapidoe; 6 to the Finches, Fringillidae; 1 to the Buntings, Ernberizidae, Starlings, Sturnidae, Crows, Gor-vidae, Woodpeckers, Picidae, and the Sand-Grouse, Pterocleidae, respectively; 2 to each of the Grouse, Tetraonidoe, and Pheasants, Phasianidae ; 1 to the Ducks, Anatidae, and Cranes, Gruidae, respectively; 2 to the Plovers, Gharadriidae ; and 5^[54. One of these last has for a wonder received no name from systematists, but its generic separation seems on several grounds expedient. It is that which would have for its type the Triηga platyrhyncha of Temminck.] to the Snipes, Scolopacidae.

The European Subregion does not seem to possess a single genus which can be accounted absolutely peculiar to it, but it has two genera, each containing but one species — Mergulus, one of the Alcidae, and Ρagοphila, belonging to the Laridae —which do not appear to be elsewhere found in the Palaearctic Region though both inhabit the most northern parts of the Nearctic. Muscicapa as now restricted^[55. That is excluding Butalis, Eryihrostema, and other kindred groups, as well as the purely Ethiopian forms which have been by some systematists attached to Μuscicapa proper.] almost fulfils the conditions of peculiarity, but one species has been said to breed, though in small numbers, in Palestine.

The Mediterranean Subregion appears to have peculiar to it 4 genera of Sylviidoe, and 1 of Laridae ; but some 23 more belong to it and to no other part of the Region, though having a wider range outside of the latter. Of these there are 8 common to both the Ethiopian and Indian Regions, namely, 1 of Vulturii ae, 3 of Falconidae, and 1 of Tetraonidoe, Anatidae, Glareolidae, and Cursoriidae respectively. Confined to the same Subregion and the Ethiopian Region are 11, to wit, 1 of Turdidae, 1 of Sylviidoe, 1 of Timeliidae, 1 of Laniidae, 2 of Fringillidae, 1 of Emberizidae, 1 of Sturnidae, 1 of Alaudidae, 1 of Vulturidae, and 1 of Gharadriidae ; while having the like relation to the Indian Region are 2—1 belonging to Cuculidae and 1 to Otididae. Of the family last named another genus (Eupodotis), which only just makes its appearance in Morocco, ranges over Africa, India, and Australia; and a genus of Anatidae (Erismaturd) is represented in America and Australia as well as in Africa.

The Atlantic Islands, which must be regarded as outliers [9:3:756] of the Mediterranean Subregion, offer some peculiarities too remarkable to be here left unnoticed. First we have the Azores, the subject of an excellent monograph by Mr Frederick Godman,^[56. Natural History of the Azores or Western Islands, 8vo. London: 1870.] in which is contained the result of his own investigations in that group, as well as those of his predecessors. There is a general tendency among Azorean Birds to vary more or less from their continental representatives, and this is especially shown by the former having always darker plumage and stronger bills and legs. In one instance the variation is so excessive that it fully justifies the establishment of a specific distinction. This is the case of the Bullfincjι of the more eastern of these islands (Pyrrhula murina), the male of which, instead of the ruddy breast of its well-known congener (P. vulgaris), has that part of a sober mouse-colour. A similar sombre hue distinguishes the peculiar Chaffinch of the Canary Islands (Fringilla teydea), but to these islands as well as the Azores and Madeiras there belongs in common another Chaffinch (F. tintiUon), which, though very nearly allied to that of Mauritania (F. spodiogenia), is perfectly recognizable, and not found elsewhere. Madeira has also its peculiar Golden-crested Wren (Regulus maderensis), and its peculiar Pigeon (Columba trocaz), while two allied forms of the latter (C. laurivora and C. bollii) are found only in the Canaries. Further on this subject we must not go; we can only state that Mr Godman has shown good reason for declaring that the avifauna of all these islands is the effect of colonization extending over a long period of years, and going on now.

The Mongolian has the largest number of peculiar genera of any Palaearctic Subregion. In Sylviidoe there is 1, in Timeliidoe 2, in Panuridoe and Ixidae 1 each, in Fringillidoe 3, in Stumidoe and Pterocleidoe ^[57. The genus of this family here meant is Syτrhaptes, the Three-toed Sand-Grouse, one species of which (& paradoxus) overran Europe in astounding numbers in 1863, and effected a temporary settlement both in Denmark and Holland.] 1 respectively, in Phasianidoe 2, and in Anatidoe 1—or 13 in all; but, in common with the Indian Region, and that only, there are 10 of Sylviidoe, 4 of Timeliidoe, 1 of Troglodytidoe, 3 oiLiotrichidae, 1, rather doubtful in position, but possibly belonging to Panuridoe, 1 of Ixidae, 4 of Muscicapidoe, 1 of Motacillidoe and Fringillidoe respectively, 2 of Stumidoe, 1 of Picidoe, 2 of Strigidoe and as many of Columbidoe, 1 of Tetraonidoe, 4 of Phasianidoe, and 1 generally referred to Scolopacidoe ^[58. This is Il)idorhynclιus, which, until some details of its osteology are known, can hardly be placed without risk of error.] —or 39 altogether. In common with the Ethiopian Region alone, the Mongolian Subregion has only 1 genus, and that belongs to Motacillidoe; but in common with both Ethiopian and Indian, though with these only, there are 1 of Muscicapidoe and 1 of Laniidoe; while 2 genera— 1 of Fringillidoe and 1 of Scolopacidoe — belong equally to the Nearctic fauna: 2 genera, members respectively of the Dicoeidoe and Pittidoe, are common as well to the Ethiopian, Indian, and Australian Regions.

The Siberian Subregion seems to have but 1 genus peculiar. This is Eurynorhynchus, one of the Scolopacidoe; but as its breeding-quarters have never yet been discovered the matter must remain in doubt. One genus of Laridoe and 6 of Alcidoe are also common to the Nearctic Region, but do not inhabit any other Palaearctic Subregion.

It would extend the present article far beyond all reasonable bounds were we to dwell upon more than a few of the curiosities of distribution which have been revealed by the continuous observations of European ornithologists. There is no need to travel out of our own island to meet with some of the most remarkable among them, and we may take that of the Nightingale (Daulias luscinia) as an example. In England the western limit of the range of this incomparable songster seems to be formed by the valley of the Exe, which is only overstepped on rare occasions—Montagu having once heard it near Kingsbridge, while it is said to have been observed at Teignmouth and Barnstaple. But even in the east of Devonshire it is local and rare, as it also is in the north of Somersetshire, though plentiful in other parts of that county. Crossing the Bristol Channel it is said to be not uncommon at times near Cowbridge in Glamorganshire; but this seems to be an isolated spot, or at any rate there is no evidence of its being found elsewhere in Wales, or between that place and Tintern on the Wye, where it has been reported to be plentiful. Thence there is more or less good testimony of its occurrence in Herefordshire, Shropshire, Staffordshire, Derbyshire, and so on, to about 5 miles north of York, but not further. Along the line thus sketched out and immediately to the east and south of it, the appearance of the nightingale, even if regular, which may be doubted, is rare, and the bird exceedingly local; but in many parts of the midland, eastern, and southern counties it is abundant, and the woods, coppices, and gardens ring with that thrilling song which has been the theme of writers in all ages. There are many assertions of its occurrence in England further to the northward, but some of them rest on anonymous authority only, and all must be regarded with the greatest suspicion. Still more open to doubt are the statements which have been made as to its visits to Scotland, while in Ireland there is no pretence even of its appearance. No reasonable mode of accounting for the partial distribution of the Nightingale has hitherto been propounded: there is no peculiar kind of soil which it especially affects, or none, so far as we know, that it especially avoids; and the same may be said of its relations to the flora of this country. It is not so entirely adscriptus gleboe that it will not readily betake itself to new localities suited to its wants, when these have been formed within its natural limits, though they may be miles away from its ancient haunts. On the contrary, it is often one of the first birds to establish itself when a heath has been broken up, and plantations of trees thereon made have grown sufficiently to afford it the sheltering covert that it loves. This instance, taken from a bird whose habits have been so closely studied both in captivity and at large, and one which is so familiar, and in many places so numerous, that abundant opportunities are given for observing all that can be observed about it, shews how futile would be the expectation that in most cases we could at present, even if ever, satisfactorily account for the existing causes which limit the distribution of species. A vast majority of them, we know, have each its bounds, which virtually it cannot pass, and the case of the Nightingale in England, beyond the fact that its distribution is extremely well marked, and therefore has long attracted especial attention, has really nothing out of the common way in it.^[59. When the history of the earth shall be really well and minutely understood, it seems quite possible that as much light will be shed on this and other particular cases of the same kind by a knowledge of the various changes and displacements which sea and land have undergone as has already been done by the same means in regard to many of the general facts of distribution. The results of the labour of the geologist are doubtless just as necessary to, and closely connected with, the work of the biologist, as those of the investigation of the historian are to and with the efficiency of the statesman; while, in return, the researches of the biologist are, or ought to be, of the greatest service to the geologist. The history of the earth is for a long period of time that of its inhabitants.] In Europe, the neighbourhood of Copenhagen is the most northern point which our Nightingale is asserted to reach; but on the continent its range is less extended, and though abundant in Mecklenburg, it is not found in that part of Pomerania [9:3:757] which lies to the north of the river Peene, nor does it stretch so far to the eastward as Danzig. It occurs, however, sparingly on the Polish frontier, near Thom, and is observed in Austria, Upper Hungary, and Gallizia. In Russia its distribution cannot be laid down with any degree of accuracy, but it does not reach the Governments near the Ural, though it is said to be plentiful in that of Kharkov, and it is known to visit the Crimea. Still further to the eastward it can be traced through Circassia, and as far as Kasbin in Persia. Southward of this imperfectly-drawn line it may be found as a winter-visitant even in Arabia, Nubia, and Abyssinia, as well as in Algeria, where it is reported as breeding, and it would seem to migrate thence so far as the Gold Coast. It is abundant in Spain and Portugal; but it is a stranger to Britanny, the western peninsula of France, just as it is to the western peninsula of England.^[60. Cf. Yarrell, British Birds, ed. 4, vol i. pp. 315-318.]

One other example we may take, and this, though much less familiar, is equally instructive, as exhibiting some of the as yet unexplained peculiarities of distribution. It shall be from a Bird belonging to a very different Order from the last, having habits entirely dissimilar, and presenting in most ways a great contrast. The Kentish Plover {Aegialitis cantiana), first determined from specimens obtained on the coast of that English county whence it takes its specific name, has its breeding-place in Britain limited to the pebbly beach between Sandwich and Hastings, and in other parts of the British Islands only occurs as a chance straggler. Yet this bird has as wide a range elsewhere as almost any that could be named—breeding not only abundantly along the greater part of the coasts of the temperate and warmer portions of the Old World north of the Equator, but also occasionally in the interior, as at the base of the Caucasus and in the chotts of the North African plains; while during its migrations it wanders to the Malay Archipelago and South Africa, or even seems most likely to be specifically identical with a Plover which is found on the west coast of America, from California southward—though this last has been described as distinct under the name of Ae. nivosa.

Islands must always be a matter of the greatest interest to the student of Geographical Distribution, and we have already mentioned some peculiarities of those groups which belong to the Mediterranean Subregion of Europe. There are not many more here to be cited. Spitsbergen is supposed to have its peculiar species of Ptarmigan {Lagopus hemileucurus), though it is confessedly very nearly allied to the Rock-Ptarmigan (Z. rupestris) which inhabits the Arctic portion of the American continent and islands, Greenland, and Iceland, but, except in the last-named country, does not occur in the Palaearctic Region. Iceland is also remarkable for being the headquarters of the noble Falcon {Falco islandus) which takes its name therefrom, though this bird also inhabits the southern districts of Greenland, to say nothing of other countries; and in Iceland alone of the western portion of the Region does the beautiful Harlequin-Duck {Histrionicus torquatus) breed. It is, however, known to inhabit North America and the eastern half of Siberia.

Coming nearer home, we have a remarkable case of restricted distribution in the Red Grouse {Lagσρus scoticus), found (and in certain districts, as every one knows, numerously), in each of the three kingdoms composing the British Islands as well as in the principality of Wales. The details of its local distribution, as of that of all other birds which breed in Great Britain, have been ∙carefully and concisely given by Mr More,^[61. Ibis, 1865, pp. 1-27, 119-142, 425-458.] and we do not propose to con sider them here, but what is worthy of remark is that this particular species differs in no essential character save coloration from the Willow-Grouse {L. albus), which is an abundant bird throughout the whole of the northern parts of the Palaearctic Region from Norway to Kamchatka, and again throughout the same or even lower latitudes of the Nearctic Region from Alaska to Newfoundland. Its remains, as has before been said (page 731), have also been found in the south of France, associated with those of the Reindeer and Snowy Owl. It is not for us now to enter into any hypothetical discussion, but it is hard to resist drawing an inference that at a time, geologically speaking, not very recent, both these species of Grouse had a common ancestor, and that the severe winters to which it has for a long period been exposed have caused the Willow-Grouse to don the snowy garb that is characteristic of it and other species of the genus, the more so since we find it in its first plumage possessed of the coloured quills, which are precisely similar to those of the Red Grouse at the same age.

Other instances there are in which British-born examples of species common to the continent are in a less degree distinguishable from those of neighbouring countries. The Coal-Titmouse of England is to be recognized from that of continental Europe {Parus ater), and accordingly by some ornithologists it is regarded as a distinct species {P. britannicus), but the scanty remnants of the ancient pine-forests of Scotland are inhabited by birds between which and European examples no difference can be established. The home-bred Bottle-Titmouse of Britain, too, has, from its darker coloration, been accorded specific rank, but then we occasionally find continental birds of this species {Acredula caudata) varying in this respect, and the specific validity of the British form (A. rosea) can hardly be with consistency maintained. Indeed, as a matter of fact, nearly all our smaller birds can be distinguished by an expert from their continental brethren, and this mainly through their duller or darker plumage. The difference is not so great by any means as obtains in the case of the birds of the Atlantic Islands above mentioned, but it most unquestionably exists to a greater or less degree; and it is curious that an analogous state of things is observable in regard to many of the birds of Japan, a country which is subject to many of the same climatic conditions as the British Islands. It will be for future investigators to ascertain the cause of this similarity, we here only record the fact; but another remarkable instance of the forms of the western portion of the region being repeated in the far east, is fouħd in the range of the two kindred species of the beautiful genus Cyanopica— the Blue Magpie of Portugal and Spain {C. coolci) being replaced in Amoorland and Japan by a species {C. cyanea) so closely allied that some authorities refuse to acknowledge their distinctness, and yet throughout 130° of longitude no representative of either is found.

V. The Ethiopian Region, comprising the whole of the African continent, except the Barbary States, besides the Cape-Verd Islands and naturally those situated in the Gulf of Guinea, as well as Madagascar and the Mascarene group from Réunion (Bourbon) to the Seychelles, and the large island of Socotra, and crossing the Red Sea to Arabia, is sufficiently well marked out in a geographical point of view. The Ghor, or valley of the Jordan and the depressed basin of the Dead Sea, has been before mentioned as an outlier of this Region, the north-eastern part of which melts into the Palaearctic between Palestine and the Persian Gulf. There, and apparently there only, do its boundaries admit of no precise definition. Some zoogeographers seem inclined to extend its limits further to the eastward, through Beloochistan and even beyond the Indus; but though the desert-form3 of a large portion of that tract of country are [9:3:758] undoubtedly closely allied to, if not identical with, the denizens of similar districts in Africa, yet it must be remarked that such forms should be regarded in much the same light as those which frequent wide seas, and that the determination of a desert-tract must therefore depend rather on the fauna which inhabits its islands—as we may term the oases which, whether plentifully or rarely, stud its surface—rather than on the fauna of the desolate space which surrounds these fertile and more favoured spots. Still, it is hardly to be denied that the influence of Ethiopian types is to be discovered in Sindh, Gujerat, and even further in the Indian peninsula. In the Ethiopian Region we again find a number of the sub-class Ratitoe in the very specialized form Struthio — the Ostrich—and this ranges, or did range, from the immediate vicinity of the Cape of Good Hope to the confines of Algeria in the north-west, and to the banks of the Euphrates in the north-east.^[62. Xenophon, Anabasis, I. v. 2.] It is even possible that within historic times it penetrated much further to the eastward and reached Sindh at least, and if this be so, the fact would lend colour to the proposed inclusion of that country within the Ethiopian Region.^[63. For all that can be said as to the supposed former extent of the Ostrich’s range in Asia, and, indeed, for the best account of this Bird that has ever been published, see Finsch aud Hartlaub, Vögel Ost-Afrikas (pp. 597 -607), forming the fourth volume of Von der Decken’s Reise in Ost-Afrika (Leipzig und Heidelberg: 1870). Fossil remains of Struthio have been indubitably recognized from the Sivalik hills in India.] But without concerning ourselves with speculations of this kind, there is enough and to spare which marks the Region as one of the chief zoological portions of the globe, despite the mystery which still hangs over its interior and at present completely defies any attempt to trace the boundaries of its Subregions or provinces beyond a comparatively little distance from the coast.

So large a portion of the Ethiopian Region lies between the tropics that no surprise need be expressed at the richness of its fauna relatively to that of the last two Regions we have considered. Between 50 and 60 families of landbirds alone are found within its limits, and of them at least 8— Buphagidae, Eurycerotidoe, Musophagidoe, Irrisoridoe, Leptosomidoe, Coliidoe, Serpentariidoe, and Struthionidoe— are peculiar; but it is singular that of them only 2 belong to the Order Passeres, a proportion which is not maintained in any other tropical Region. The number of peculiar genera is too great for them to be named here; some of the most remarkable, however, especially of those peculiar to one of its Subregions, whose Bird-life has been differentiated to a degree that is very extraordinary, will presently be mentioned.

The subdivision of the Ethiopian Region is perhaps accomplished with less difficulty than in the case of the more temperate tracts with which we have lately had to do. Bounded on the north by the Mediterranean Subregion of the Palaearctic Region, we have a Subregion extending from the Cape-Verd Islands on the one side of the continent to Socotra on the other; and with this we must comprehend all the Asiatic territory, whatever be its limits, which is, for zoogeographical purposes, to be annexed to the Ethiopian Region. On the West Coast of Africa the southern frontier of this Subregion, which we may call the “Libyan/’^[64. In using this name the writer follows Blyth {Nature, iii. p. 428, March 30, 1871). Mr Sharpe, whose kind assistance in preparing this portion of the present treatise the author gratefully acknowledges, has proposed to call this Subregion the “Abyssinian,” from its leading characteristics being most evident in that country, but that name would seem to be better applied to a province, and accordingly, here a more general designation appears preferable.] seems to lie a little to the northward of lat 10° N.; but, owing to the unexplored state of the country, we quickly lose trace of its confines. We may perhaps presume that they more or less follow that parallel to somewhere about long. 15° E., and then trend in a southeasterly direction. On the East Coast the frontier of the Libyan Subregion extends from near Cape Guardafui in a south-westerly direction towards the system of the Great Lakes, all the waters flowing to which it may be held to include; and is then succeeded by the “Mosambican” Subregion, which continues perhaps to Sofala. Beginning on the West Coast, where the Libyan Subregion stops, we have another Subregion, the “Guinean,” comprising the seaboard from Sierra Leone to somewhere about Angola; but as to how far inland, this penetrates we are absolutely without information. The rest of continental Africa forms what may be called the “Caffrarian”^[65. Again following Blyth (loc. cit.)] Subregion, while Madagascar, the Comoros, and the widely-scattered Mascarene Islands, constitute a fifth Subregion, the most distinct and remarkable of all, and for this we may most reasonably use the name “Madagascarian.”

(1.) The Libyan Subregion, the first we have separated, may perhaps be broken up into four provinces—the Arabian, Egyptian, Abyssinian, and the Gambian; but it must not be expected that all their respective boundaries can be distinctly drawn—those of the first excepted, which, however, seems to be the one that has precisely the fewest positive characteristics, and the propriety of its recognition, except on purely geographical grounds, is most questionable. We may doubt whether it has more than half-adozen peculiar species; but then we know next to nothing of the zoology of any part of Arabia, save the Peninsula of Sinai and the desert of the Tih. As before mentioned the Ostrich occurs here, but its present northern or eastern limits are indeterminate; we know, however, that within recent years it has been killed in the desert of Belka, just on the other side of the Dead Sea. The species which seem to be peculiar to the Jordan basin are— Crateropus chalyboeus, Nectarinia osea, Passer moabiticus, Amy drus tristrami and Caprimulgus tamaricis, the last but one of which in its name commemorates Canon Tristram, the naturalist to whom we owe most of our information as to the fauna of this singular district.

The Egyptian province, so far as regards the valley of the Lower Nile, is remarkable for being, as already stated, overrun by migrants from Europe during the winter, and since it is chiefly from the observations of travellers at this season that most of our knowledge is derived, it is perhaps not very wonderful that many zoogeographers are inclined to iιrclude this district within the Palaearctic Region. The number of species which occur in Egypt and Nubia, as given by Captain Shelley,^[66. Handbook to the Birds of Egypt. London: 1872.] is 352, but many of them he says are of doubtful occurrence. Of these more than 230 are natives of the Palaearctic Region; but only between 50 and 60, or about one quarter of them, remain to breed in Egypt, and of this number a considerable proportion do not breed in Europe, but only in the Barbary States. The extra-Palaearctic character of the Egyptian ornis seems to be thus fully established.

Respecting the Abyssinian province very full particulars are included in the lately-completed work of Dr von Heuglin;^[67. Ornithologie Nordost-Afrika' s. Cassel: 1859-75] but for our purpose it is not easy thence to ascertain the precise features of its avifauna, since he has not discriminated between it and the Egyptian. Northeast Africa, according to him, has about 950 species of Birds, of which he reckons about 325 as migrants from Europe or Western Asia—that is to say, from the Palaearctic Region. Cf these 113 breed in that Region, as well as in North-eastern Africa; 294 have been observed in the Barbary[9:3:759] States; 438 are common to the West Coast, but whether to the Guinean Subregion, presently to be treated, or only to the Gambian province of the Libyan, is not stated; 318 are common to South Africa or the Caffrarian Subregion, and 253 only to the Mosambican; while 215 are peculiar to the district to which his work especially relates; the last statement being the most important for our present use, since it cannot be doubted that nearly all these 215 species are peculiar to the Abyssinian province, which may be taken as extending from about the southern frontier of Dongola to the Victoria Nyanza, and from the Kosanga River (long. 27° E.) to Cape Guardafui One of the most wonderful forms of birds peculiar to this province is the gigantic Whale-headed Stork, Baloeniceps rex. Of Socotra we know far too little to determine its provincial affinity.

Of the Gambian province we cannot say much, through want of materials to convey any definite notion of its character; and we are only able to confirm the general belief that it has a good deal in common with the Abyssinian, next to be mentioned, for without lists carefully drawn up by those who have a special knowledge of the avifauna of a country, or the power to compile such for oneself, which in this case the present writer does not possess, any attempt at a critical examination of its details would be rather misleading than otherwise. The province probably lies between lat. 18° and lat. 10° N., but whether it preserves those limits in the interior, whether it passes directly into the Abyssinian, or whether another province intervenes, are questions that cannot be now decided. It would seem to have in common with the East Coast several very characteristic species, of which Buphaga africana, Vidua paradisea, Parus leucopterus, Corythomis cyanostigma, Coracias ncevia, and Toccus nasutus, with T. eτythroτhynchus, may be mentioned.

To the Gambian province belong the Cape-Verd Islands, which, out of 17 or 18 Land-birds enumerated by Dr H. Dohrn (Joum. für Omith. 1871, pp. 1-10), seem to have 2 peculiar species—-a Sparrow (Fringillidoe) and an aquatic Warbler (Sylviidoe).

(2.) The Guinean Subregion is the next to be treated, and occupies what is commonly spoken of as the “West Coast” of Africa, extending from Sierra Leone to the south of Congo, while its breadth is a matter of the greatest uncertainty. Hitherto no catalogue even of its birds has been published, for the work of Dr Hartlaub^[68. System der Ornithologie West Africa's. Bremen: 1857.] comprehends also those of the Gambian province of the Libyan Subregion, while, admirably executed as it was at the time of its appearance, so much has since been done by collectors in this part of Africa, and by those who in Europe have examined their collections (especially Professor Barboza du Bocage and Mr Sharpe), that its results must be regarded as out of date. Yet no good, and much harm, would follow from any attempt to generalize on the facts thus recorded, at various times and in various publications, except it were made by one especially acquainted with African ornithology; and we must therefore, perforce, leave the continental portion of this Subregion without trying to exhibit its particular characteristics. Respecting the islands belonging to it, however, somewhat may be advanced with more confidence. The chief of these are four in number—Fernando Po, Prince’s Island, that of St Thomas, and Annobon, The first, lying in the Bight of Biafra, was once believed to possess a very peculiar avifauna; but one by one, all, or nearly all, of the supposed peculiar species have been found on the mainland, until it seems likely to have none whatever. Prince’s Island, situated outside the Bight, but still lying within the Gulf of Guinea, has been said to possess 1 peculiar genus, Cuphopterus (of perhaps uncertain affinity, though it has been referred to the Timeliidoe), comprising a single species, (but this has since been sent from the Gaboon) and 6 other species—1 each of Dicoeidoe and Hirundinidoe, and 2 of Ploceidoe and Columbid<x respectively. A curious assertion has been made with regard to this island, namely, that it is not inhabited by any Diurnal Bird-of-prey, all such being, it is said, driven off by the Grey Parrots (Psittacus erithacus) which there abound. The island of St Thomas, lying nearly or just under the equator, also has 6 peculiar species, belonging respectively to the Turdidoe, Dicaeidoe, Oriolidoe, Ploceidoe, Columbidoe, and Strigidoe; while another species of the family last mentioned is common to this and Prince’s Island, but seems to be found nowhere else. Of Annobon we know nothing.

(3.) The Caffrarian Subregion has its inland boundaries as ill-defined as either of the preceding, yet its distinctive features are much more marked—a fact which is doubtless to some extent explained by so great a portion of it lying without the tropic. Though this part of Africa has perhaps received the closest attention from ornithologists, the several labours in various districts of the Subregion of Levaillant and Jules Verreaux, Audersson and Andrew Smith, Mr Layard and Mr· Ayres, assisted at home by Sundevall and Mr Gurney, all require digesting before their bearings upon the subject of geographical distribution can be fully comprehended; and, as in the cases previously mentioned, the careful collation and comparison of different lists can only be usefully accomplished by one who has a special knowledge of the objects treated of by those writers, and any attempt to attain this end by an inexpert would be dangerous. Only one island can be with certainty affiliated to this Subregion, and that is St Helena, where the indigenous Land-birds, if any there were, have probably been extirpated with most of its original and peculiar flora. Yet, curious as it may be, it seems to be a fact that this isolated spot possesses a peculiar Water-bird, albeit it is of a group which greatly affects dry places. This is a small Ringed Plover (Aeguüitis sanctoe-helenoe), and, though belonging to a genus the members of which are remarkable for very wide distribution, it is not known to have occurred off the island. Tristan da Cunha, commonly assigned to the Ethiopian Region, and therefore to this Subregion, seems, from reasons before stated, to have at least as much affinity to the Neotropical, and Ascension appears to have no indigenous Land-birds whatever, so that its appropriation must remain in doubt.

(4.) The Mosambican Subregion next follows, and its relations to the Abyssinian the numbers already quoted from Dr von Heuglin will have shewn, but these must be taken with caution, since the limits of the Subregion are so indefinite. Whether we should comprehend in it the whole of the country drained by the Zambesi and its tributaries seems to be very uncertain; but, judging from the collections he has received, Mr Sharpe is now inclined to think that this part has more affinity to South Africa. The general uniformity of distribution which obtains among the Birds of all the tropical portion of the Region, especially noticed by Dr Kirk in writing on thosς,pf Zambesia (Ibis, 1864, p. 307), requires much fuller" geographical details than are at present available to entitle us to form any very decided opinion, though the in most respects ex cellent monograph of Drs Finsch and Hartlaub (see note at page 758) gives ample information as to the literature and descriptions of the 448 species which, according to those learned authors, constitute its avifauna, and no attempt can possibly be made to subdivide the Subregion into provinces. Lying off its coast are three considerable islands, Pemba, Zanzibar, and Monfia, but as yet there is no reason [9:3:760] to expect that they have any very important bearing from a zoogeographical point of view. Zanzibar is the best known, and that seems to have a few species peculiar to it— for instance, Laniarius salimoe, L. orientalis, and Francolinus kirki,— but further investigation may prove that some of them also occur on the mainland.

(5.) The Afadagascarian Subregion remains for consideration, and this from its insularity is obviously well defined, while a good deal of attention has been paid to its remarkable peculiarities.' Indeed, except New Zealand, it may be safely deemed the most peculiar Subregion on the earth’s surface, while from ' ι the richness and multifariousness of its animal and especially of its ornithic population, New Zealand cannot for a moment be compared with it. Its principal subdivision, Madagascar itself, once possessed in the extinct gigantic bird Aepyomis a form of JRatitoe, not less singular than the Ostrich or the Moa, and though some writers would fain see in the remains of this marvellous creature a realization of Oriental fables respecting the Roc, not a vestige has been recovered which can be declared to belong to any period to which history or even legend can reach, and Arabian tales are not corroborated by the hypothesis of Professor Bianconi, while they are virtually contradicted by the researches at home of Μ. Alphonse Milne-JJdwards, and Herr von Nathttsius, and of Μ. Grandidier abroad. Three also of the satellite islands—Mauritius, Réunion (Bourbon), and Rodriguez—possessed brevipennate Birds totally dissimilar from but hardly less singular than the Aepyomis, and here the Dodo and its kindred, together with other Birds now extirpated, flourished peacefully till they felt the power of man and his agencies. But brief particulars of these extinct forms have already been given (pp. 732, 733), and we must now restrict ourselves to the consideration of those which survive.

This Subregion is easily divided into two provinces— Madagascar and the Mascarene Islands; but then it becomes a question whether the Comoros should not be considered to form a third, and also how the Seychelles should be treated. Not without scruples we propose to refer the latter to the Mascarene province as an outlying group, and to regard the former in the same light in reference to the Malagash province or Madagascar proper.

Long studied as the Birds of Madagascar have been, hardly a year now passes without some new form being added to its list; and what is especially remarkable is that a very large proportion of the additions are not merely new species of genera previously known, but are the types of undeniably good and new genera, while it would seem also as if many of these had a very limited range in the island, for every fresh district visited by a collector is almost sure to produce something which neither he nor his predecessors have met with in other parts, though the actual distance between the localities may be inconsiderable. The number of genera of Land-birds amounts to nearly 100, and of them almost one-half are peculiar to the Subregion; by far the greatest number of them belonging to the Order Passeres, though the Picarioe are also well represented by peculiar genera, and the Psittaci and Columbae possess to a certain extent the same characteristics. Many of the genera belonging to the two Orders first named can be but with difficulty referred to any family existing elsewhere, but for fear of exaggerating the singular character of the Subregion we prefer regarding two only of these families as absolutely peculiar. These are Lepto- somidoe and Eurycerotidae, the single genus and species constituting each of which it seems impossible to place with any other family. z Almost the same may be said of the genera Brachypter acias, Geobiastes, and Atelornis, which may perhaps be linked in one group, though to what family it should be attached seems very doubtful; and there is Philepitta so isolated that by one author it is referred to the Turdidoe, by another to the Paradiseidoe, and by a third to the Pittidoe, the probability being that each assignation is wide of the mark. But the avifauna of Madagascar is not entirely composed of such singularities as these. We have homely genera, even among the Passeres, occurring there, such as Acrocephalus, Motacilla, Pratincola, and Alauda, while a Cisticola, which, though it has received a distinct trivial name, is undistinguishable from the well-known Fantail-Warbler (C r . schoenicola) of southern Europe, Africa, and India, has long been known as an inhabitant of Madagascar. But there are also species, though not Passerine, which are absolutely identical with those of Britain— Aluco flammeus, Coturnix communis, Porzana pygmoea, and Podiceps minor —all of them common in the island. The number of species of Birds hitherto found in Madagascar cannot be safely put at less than 200, of which 120 are Land-birds, and of these latter fully 100 are peculiar. The Comoros, so far as they have been explored, have yielded more than 20 Land-birds, of which 12 at least are peculiar, the remainder being common to Madagascar; but, no doubt, throughout every part of the Malagash province there is room for further discoveries.

The principal islands of the Mascarene province have had their original fauna so largely destroyed by colonization, as has just been stated, that we are hardly in a condition to judge its peculiarities accurately. Mauritius and Réunion, lying within sight of each other, and possessing about the same number of existing species, seem not to have more than 3 in common. There is 1 genus (Oxynotus) belonging to the Campephagidoe which is peculiar to these two islands, and represented in each by a distinct species. Réunion also had within the memory of men yet living a peculiar genus of Stumidoe —Fregilupus. Rodriguez is now known to possess only 4 species of Land-birds natural to it; and of these 3 are peculiar, 1 being the Parrakeet before mentioned as on the verge of extinction, and another an aberrant form of Drymoeca, pointing possibly to a common origin with certain Indian species.^[69. Tlιis same leaning towards India is also indicated by the genus Hypsipetes, one of the Turdidoe, all the members of which, save 4, belong to the Indian region, and these four are peculiar respectively to Madagascar, Réunion, Mauritius, and the Seychelles, and it would be easy to cite similar cases of isolated Birds of either the Indian or Ethiopian Region which have their nearest relatives natives of the other.] The Landbirds of the Seychelles which have not been introduced are 14 in number, and of these 12, according to Mr Edward Newton (Ibis, 1867, p. ff59), are peculiar; but there is no good genus which can be so termed. Finally, we may mention that the small island of Aldabra has a Dove which has been described as a distinct species, and that of St Denis a Water-hen which probably merits the same remark. Taken as a whole, we cannot but be struck with the force of the evidence as to the land-connection which must once have existed—though not necessarily all at once—between the various units forming the whole Subregion. Even the scanty remnant that is left enables one to see how the denizens of its most distant quarters represent one another, a clear token of their long-continued isolation and the working of a differentiating power. But this is no place to pursue theories.

VI. Tee Indian Region ^[70. It must be mentioned that objection has frequently, and not without show of reason, been taken to the name “Indian” applied to this Region; and, except for the awkwardness of the title, we must admit that “Indo-Malayan” would have most likely been found a more expressive and suitable epithet, since what we commonly mean, by “India” forms but a small and perhaps not the most characteristic portion. Mr Wallace proposes to use the name “Oriental,” against which it may be not unreasonably urged that it errs on the side of vagueness, just as “Indian” does on the side of particularity. On the whole, it seems as though “Indian,” having been the distinguishing term first applied to this region, had better be retained.] completes our survey of the [9:3:761] globe; and its boundaries, so far as they can be defined, have been already sketched out when treating of the adjoining areas. Large as is its extent, and greatly varied as are its physical features, it would seem to have but 2 peculiar families of Birds (Phyllornithidae and Euryloemidcé) out of upwards of 70 which occur within its limits. There is peculiar difficulty in determining the zoological Subregions and provinces into which this Region should be separated. While the fauna of some districts, or even larger portions, has been studied so that we possess a knowledge of them almost as full as of any country in the world, Europe and the tracts of other Regions settled by Europeans alone excepted, the greater part is not much better known zoologically than is the centre of Africa. Yet we cannot treat the Indian Region with the same audacity of ignorance that we did the Ethiopian, drawing our boundaries here and there in a manner which the experience of a few more years will very likely prove to be exceedingly wide of the mark, for our acquaintance with the Region now under consideration is such as to convince us that throughout its whole extent there are districts, large or small, which have an unmistakable affinity to one another, and yet appear to be cut off from all communication with their neighbours. True it is that we may readily account for this on the ground that the similarity to be observed is due to corresponding elevation above the sea-level, and that throughout the whole Region the hill-countries are, as a rule, disconnected; but such an explanation does not make our task the easier, and we are filled with the consciousness that we cannot map out the Indian Region according to the method we have hitherto followed. We find the characteristics of the Himalayan avifauna shewing themselves not only on the highlands of Southern India and Ceylon, but far away to the eastward also, as in Formosa, Hainan, and Cochin China, and again repeated in a lesser but still perceptible degree to the southward in the mountain ranges of Malacca and Sumatra. This then being the case, we think it better to follow in the main the scheme adopted by Mr Elwes, to whose essay on the geographical distribution of Asiatic Birds we have before referred (page 754). Right or wrong in his results, he has the merit of having arrived at them, as he tells us, contrary to a certain bias which he had entertained at the beginning of his investigations, and these are marked by uncommon care and a diligent study of all the means of information at that time available to him. Mr Elwes would establish three Subregions— the “Himalayan” “or Himalo-Chinese,” the “Indian” (proper), and the “Malayan.”

(1.) The Himalo-Chinese Subregion, according to his view, includes all the middle slopes of the Himalayan range, from an elevation of about 3000 to 12,000 feet, and, beginning with Cashmere, extends through Nepal, Bhotan, the highlands of Assam, and thence, marching with the as yet undetermined frontier of the Palaearctic Region, to the sea-coast of China. To this Subregion belong the islands of Formosa and Hainan, and it not only includes a great part of China proper, but probably the whole of Cochin China and Siam, with the hill-country of Tennasserim and Burmah, merging into the Malayan Subregion somewhere about lat. 12° N. In its western part, he observes, it is merely a narrow border-land, in which the members of two very different faunas meet, and, being inhabited during some part of the year by nearly all the principal Palaearctic genera, and those of the proper Indian Subregion, probably includes some of the richest portions of the world. Besides this, as already remarked, its influence is felt far to the southward, even in the islands of Ceylon and Sumatra.

From what has been said above as to the way in which some of the Subregions of the Indian Region are broken up, and this Subregion especially, it is useless to attempt any partitioning of them into true zoological provinces. We can only follow Mr Elwes in taking the various countries in succession, and stating what is known of them. Cashmere is the first. Here there seems to be 171 Landbirds, referable to 116 genera; of the latter, 34 have a wide range, 32 are characteristic of the Palaearctic Region, 29 of the Indian, and 21 peβuliar to or characteristic of the Himalo-Chinese Subregion. There is only 1 species peculiar to the country—a very normal Bullfinch (Pyrrhula) belonging to Fringillidoe. Cephalopyrus, an aberrant Titmouse (ParidcE), and once thought to be a peculiar genus, extends eastward so far as Simla. Of the species 70 seem to be peculiar to the Himalayan district, and 30 are common to the Palaearctic Region.

Nepal is the next country of which we know enough to give any satisfactory account; and, indeed, thanks to Mr Hodgson’s labours in years gone by, our knowledge of its zoology is very tolerably complete, though of late years little has been added to it. Its rich avifauna is said to consist of 553 species of Land-birds, belonging to 294 genera; of the latter, 62 are of wide range, 30 characteristic of the Palaearctic, and 122 of the Indian Region, while 80 are peculiar to, or characteristic of, the Himalaya. Of the species there are 330 peculiar to the Himalayan district, and 60 common to the Palaearctic Region.

The small state of Sikkim seems to be richer stilL Excluding the Accipitres there are here found 423 species of Land-birds, of which 270 do not occur out of the Himalaya, except as migrants or stragglers. Of these, 63 belong to genera of wide range, 60 more are of Palaearctic distribution, and 154 are nearly peculiar to the Indian Region, while 146 are peculiar to, or characteristic of, the Himalo-Chinese Subregion. Passing to Assam, the hills to the north and east of which, however, are very little known, its ornithic character seems greatly to resemble that of Sikkim; but we have from its southern boundary a few genera which are not actually found in the Himalaya, such as Anthreptes, Turdinus, and Ehytoceros, belonging respectively to Nectar- iniidoe, Timeliidoe, and Bucerotidoe, while we are acquainted with only 16 species which are not found also in Sikkim, and of these one-half are Burmese.

Burmah must be taken next, though a district intervenes of which we are quite ignorant, and this country, its highlands especially, requires much more exploration, but the valley of the Irrawadi, Aracan, and Pegu are very fairly known. Of 373 species of Land-birds, 97 are common to India, and the rest to the Malay peninsula. 193 more are found in India, and 27 in the peninsula alone, while 46 are peculiar to Burmah or to Burmah and Tennasserim. In Tennasserim, taking it to extend from Martaban to the isthmus of Krau, we have 313 species of Land-birds, 93 being common to India and the rest of the peninsula, 117 more being found in India, and 56 in the peninsula alone, while 47 are peculiar to Tennasserim or to Tennasserim and Burmah. This country is especially rich in species of the peculiarly Indian family Euryloemidae, possessing a majority of the known forms.

Lying in the Bay of Bengal are two remarkable groups of islands—the Andamans and the Nicobars—which the authority we are following would, from the similarity of their avifauna to that of Pegu, include in this Subregion. Lord Walden, however, thinks (Ibis, 1873, p. 297) the former have a greater affinity to the highlands of India south of the Himalaya and west of the Brahmapootra, and Mr Hume (Stray Feathers, ii. p. 136) considers both groups to form an outlying bit of the proper Indian Subregion on which many foreign intruders have established [9:3:762] themselves. It is certain that many genera, or even families, which are common in Burmah are wanting in the Andamans, such as the Timeliidoe, Pittidoe, Eurylaemidoe, and Bucerotidoe, though a peculiar form of the last occurs on Narcondam, an island between the Andamans and Burmah, and there is an extreme paucity of several other families. Still the Andamans possess an avifauna of some 155 species, 17 of which (all Land-birds) are peculiar. The precise number of species found in the Nicobars is not explicitly stated by Mr Hume, but he gives 10 as peculiar to that group, which is inhabited by two very noteworthy forms— Caloenas, a very remarkable genus of Columbidoe, widely spread throughout the Malayan archipelago, and a species of Megapodius, belonging to one of the most characteristic families of the Australian Region. The presence of these two forms would almost incline one to remove the Nicobars from the Subregion to which they have generally been assigned, and refer them rather to the Malayan Subregion.

It is now necessary to retrace our steps northward and notice China;^[71. Of China proper Mr Elwes says little, but he includes Eastern Thibet in this Subregion. The present writer, however, is disposed to refer that, or at any rate the scene of Père David’s discoveries, to the Palaearctic Region.] but this is a branch of the subject on which it is as yet impossible to form an opinion. The chief authority on Chinese ornithology is unquestionably Mr Swinhoe, who has for so long a time laboured in various parts of that country equally as a public servant and a naturalist; but the results of his multitudinous contributions to our knowledge of its avifauna have never yet been tabulated, and probably their author is alone competent to perform this task -without running into errors that would be disastrous in their consequences. In his latest catalogue of the Birds of China,^[72. Proc. Zool. Soc. 1871, pp. 337-343.] he enumerates 675 species as found in that country and its islands; but valuable and carefully-drawn up as this list is, it is impossible to eliminate therefrom the species not strictly belonging to that part of the Celestial Empire which lies within our present bounds; or even were this possible, an intimate acquaintance with its ornis would be required to separate the birds-of-passage from the residents, and still more to classify them according to their several Orders and families. Add to this, that assiduously as Mr Swinhoe has himself worked in the field, and diligently as he has availed himself of such information as he could obtain from other trustworthy observers, only the outskirts of this great territory have, with few exceptions, been examined. Much is it to be hoped that he will be able in due time to bring forth the ripe fruit of his labours, but meanwhile the attempt to elucidate the peculiarities of the avifauna of China proper, that is, south at least of the Yangstzekiang and of Cochin China, would be vain if not misleading.

The two principal islands lying off the Chinese coast, however, are in a different condition. One of them has been extremely and the other tolerably well ransacked by Mr Swinhoe. In Formosa he has found 144 species, referable to 102 genera, of which 98 are found in the Himalayan Subregion, and 70 in the Malayan. The species may be thus assorted :—74 belong to wide-ranging genera, 47 to genera common to the Himalayan and Malayan Subregions, 18 are peculiar to, or characteristic of, the former Subregion, and 5 to China itself; 18 are not found in the Malayan Subregion, and no less than 34 are peculiar to the island. For Hainan Mr Swinhoe has enumerated 130 species belonging to 96 genera, of which latter 86 are common to the Malayan Subregion, and 93 to the Himalayan. Of the species 54 belong to wide-ranging genera, 59 to genera characteristic of the Indian and 16 of the Palaearctic Region, while 16 are believed to be peculiar to the island.

(2.) The Indian Subregion, still following Mr Elwes, is the next to be considered. This consists of the remainder of the peninsula of India lying to the south and west of the last, as well as of the island of Ceylon. Its partition into provinces has been several times attempted, and doubtless the method proposed by Mr Blanford, when treating of the geographical distribution of Indian Reptiles,^[73. Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, 1870, pp. 335-376.] is one of the most reasonable, but even this may perhaps be premature,^[74. Compare Dr Giinther’s remarks, Zoological Record, vii. p. 67.] and here it seems preferable to abstain from doing more than consider, so far as materials are available, the avifauna of the various districts of which it is composed— the more so since the extraordinary impulse given to the study of ornithology in India by the publication of the late Dr Jerdon’s work^[75. The Birds of India. Calcutta: 1S62-64.] will doubtless in a few years place the whole subject in a very different light, for the number of Indian ornithologists is grown so considerable that that country has now a journal especially devoted to the record of their observations.

Beginning in the north-west with the Punjab, we have as yet no complete list of the Birds of this most important district, and we can only infer that we shall here find the Malayan influence at its least, and the Palaearctic at its greatest; but descending the Indus to Sindh we have a discursive account of its ornithology by Mr Hume,^[76. Stray Feathers, i. pp. 44-49, 91-239, 419-421.] from which Mr Elwes gives the following results :—of 150 species observed, 41 are peculiarly desert-forms, and as such either very nearly allied to or identical with the like forms of the Palaearctic and Ethiopian Regions; 40 are peculiar to the Indian Subregion, 8 are common to the Malayan, 4 to the non-desert portions of the Ethiopian, and 12 to the similar parts of the Palaearctic Region, while 45 do not come under any of these heads. Omitting the desert-forms as not leading to any just conclusion, it would appear that Sindh has less affinity to the Ethiopian Region than to the Palaearctic, that is to say, to its Mediterranean Subregion. The very remarkable district of Cutch yielded 115 Land-birds to Stoliczka,^[77. Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, 1872, pp. 211-258.] and these were mostly migrants or common Indian species of wide range.

Of Rajpootana and Central India we know very little, but near Goona, about 200 miles to the south of Agra, Dr King some years since observed 116 species of Landbirds;^[78. Op. cit. 1868, pp. 208-218.] and more lately Mr Adam has noticed 171 species of Land-birds around the Sambhur Lake in its western portion.^[79. Stray Feathers, i. pp. 361-404.]

We must next turn eastward to Oudh, wherein Col. Irby {Ibis, 1861, p. 217) obtained 108 species of Land-birds, but of these 23 were found only on the hills of Kumaon. There seems to be a remarkable absence of many of the most widely-spread genera of the Region, and many forms generally common to Africa are also wanting; but no doubt Mr Brooks, who has of late industriously investigated this portion of the country, will be able to supply some of these unaccountable deficiencies.

We may judge of what are politically known as the “Central Provinces” of India, as well as of Bundelcund, Malwa, and Chota Nagpore, forming the “Gangetic” subprovince of Mr Blanford, from observations made by that gentleman and Colonel M 4 Master,^[80. Ibis, 1867, p. 461; Proc. As. Soc. Beng. 1869, p. 104; Joum. As. Soc. Bang. 1871, pp∙ 207-216,] ° wherein 190 species of Land-birds are enumerated, of which 38 have a very wide range. 57 belong to widely-ranging genera but are almost [9:3:763] confined to India, 37 to genera common to tropical Africa and India, 8 to genera of Ethiopian type, and 53 to purely Indian genera.

Pursuing our way southward we come to the Deccan or table-land of India, and our information respecting its ornis chiefly rests on the catalogue given by Sykes many years ago,^[81. Proc. Zool. Soc. 1832, pp. 77, 149] which only contains about 150 species of Land-birds, of which about 105 belong to genera common to the Himalayan and Malayan Subregions, 27 to Himalayan but not Malayan genera, 30 to genera having Ethiopian or Palaearctic affinity, and the rest to widely-ranging genera or to genera peculiar to the Indian Subregion.

The avifauna of Southern India seems to be small relatively to the extent and variety of the country, and most of its peculiar species are said to have a considerable range of latitude, though some, which are restricted to the highest hills, are only found to the southward of lat. 12° N., where several mountain-ranges reach the height of 8000 feet. No single comprehensive listof the Birds of this part of India seems lately to have been put together, and Mr Elwes gives us no statistics as the result of his investigations whereby we may compare its ornithic products with those of other districts.

Ceylon has profited by the residence of several competent naturalists—especially Mr Layard and Mr Holdsworth, and taking also its isolation into account, we are in a position to speak of this island with greater certainty than of the preceding portions of the Subregion. The latter of these gentlemen gives a list^[82. Op cit., 1872, pp. 404-483.] numbering 323 species, of which 224 are Land-birds, and an analysis shews that, though 37 species are peculiar, only 4 belong to genera not found in Southern India, 22 belong to genera inhabiting the Himalaya but not the Malayan Subregion, and only 6 to Malayan but not Himalayan genera, while 14 are members of genera only found in India.

(3.) The Malayan Subregion is the last of which we have to treat, and we have already hinted that it possibly has a connection with the Indian through the Nicobar Islands, but of course the most intimate communication between the two exists on the mainland. The birds of its continental portion, the Malay Peninsula, have never formed the subject of a separate memoir, and to compile a complete list of them at present is a task which a more competent author has found impossible. Stoliczka has given us a catalogue^[83. Joum. As. Soc. Peng. 1870, pp. 277-334. This, however, must not be read without referring to Lord Walden’s remarks on it (Ibis, 1871, pp. 158-177).] of 95 species obtained in the Wellesley Province, lying opposite to Penang, and numerous species have been constantly described by various authors as coming from Malacca or Singapore, which in most cases probably means that the specimens have been purchased at one of those places. To enter into any details with respect to the Malay Peninsula, therefore, would here be impossible, but the case is different as regards the islands which form the greater part of the Subregion.

The Philippines, for more than a century, have supplied European ornithologists with materials of study, yet it is little more than ten years ago that any attempt to compile a complete list of their Birds was made, and that list, by Dr von Martens,^[84. Journal fur Ornithologie, 1866, pp. 5-31] was manifestly imperfect. It is only since the present article was begun that a satisfactory account of their avifauna has appeared. This is the work of Lord Walden,^[85. Transactions of the Zoological Society, ix. pp. 125-252.] and we here avail ourselves of the results which he has so ably set forth. He enumerates 219 species, of which 150 are Land-birds; but in consequence of the caution he has exercised, it is most probable that this number is really too small. Of these, 106 species are peculiar to the archipelago—96 of them being Land-birds. There is no species, he remarks, which is common to the Philippines and the neighbouring island of Celebes which does not also possess a more extended range, and there is only one genus— Prioniturus, a very singular form of Psittaci — common to both and yet found nowhere else. The genera peculiar to the group are 11 in number— Pseudolalage belonging to Cam,pephagidoe, Zeocephus to Muscicapidae, Rhabdornis to Certhiidoe, Sarcops to Sturnidoe, Penelopides to Bucerotidoe, Dasylophus and Lepidogrammus to Cucu- lidoe, Pseudoptynx to Strigidoe, Phabotreron and Ptilocolpa to Columbidoe, and Amaurornis to Rallidoe. There is also only 1 species common to one of the Philippines—the island of Negros—and to one other island. This is Xantholoema rosea, which is also found in Java, and seems to be the representative of the widely-spread X. hoematocephala, which ranges over India, Malacca, and Sumatra, but is not found either in Java or Negros. It will thus be seen that the amount of peculiarity exhibited by the avifauna of the Philippines is very great, but it must be observed that hardly anything is as yet known of Palawan or the Sooloo cluster—islands which connect the Philippines with Borneo.

Borneo is the next island to which our attention should be directed, and this magnificent country, large enough as Mr Wallace has remarked for the whole of the United Kingdom to be set down in its midst and hidden, has lately had its avifauna carefully investigated by Dr Salvador!, the result of whose labours was published in 1874.^[86. Annali del Museo Civico di Storia Naturale di Genova, v. pp. 1-430.] The following may be given as a summary of them. There are 392 species, of which 325 are Land-birds, 27 belonging to the Order Accipitres, 4 to Psittaci, 99 to Picarioe, 172 to Passeres, 14 to Co! tmboe, and 9 to Gallinoe. Yet there are only 3 unquestionably peculiar genera^[87. A reputed fourth, Anais, referred to Artamιdas, is suspected to be founded on a manufactured specimen! Lobiophasis, since established by Mr Sharpe (Ann. and Mag. Nat. Hist. Ser. 4, xiv. p. 373), and belonging to Phasianidoe, probably makes another.] — Pityriasis, a most singular form, doubtfully referred to Laniidoe, Schwaneria belonging to Muscicapidae, and Heterococcyx to Cuculidoe. There are 58 or 59 peculiar species, all but 1 Land-birds, and at least 25, or perhaps as many as 32, which have no representatives elsewhere. Of Land-birds Borneo has, in common with Malacca and Sumatra, 226 species; in common with Java, 149; with the Philippines, 25; with the Indian Subregion, 53; with China, 72; and with Celebes, 28. A species of Megapodius (Μ. cumingι) is found in Borneo and also in the Philippines,^[88. Mr Sharpe, however, considers the species distinct (Proc. Zool. Soc. 1875, p. 111).] and its presence in both, like that of a member of the same genus in the Nicobars already noticed, is a very remarkable fact.

The comparatively little-known island of Banca, lying between Borneo and Sumatra, produces 2 peculiar species of Pittidae, the one representing a species which inhabits the whole Subregion and extends to China and Siam, the other allied to two species, the first ranging from Nepal to Malacca, and the second inhabiting the Philippines, Borneo, and Sumatra.^[89. But on this point compare Mr Hume’s remark (Stray Feathers, ii. p. 475).]

Sumatra must be considered next, or perhaps it ought to have been taken after Malacca, from which it is divided by so narrow a channel. The greater part of this island, its northern half especially, is unknown, and not more than 240 species can be assigned to it, of which about 20 appear to be peculiar. Its avifauna is much allied to that [9:3:764] both of Malacca and of Borneo, but it seems to have much less peculiarity than the latter’s.

We then have Java, the best-explored, the most thickly-peopled, and, proportionately to its fauna, the most peculiar, perhaps, of the Indo-Malay Islands. Here we find about 270 species of Land-birds, of which about 45 are peculiar—most of them being from the mountains in the western part of the island. The reappearance in Java of several Burmese species, as Crypsirhina varians, Picus analis, Pavo muticus, and others, which do not occur in the Malay Peninsula south of Penang, is very remarkable.

Of Bali, so interesting as the southern outpost of the Region, we only know from Mr Wallace that he saw there several Birds highly characteristic of Javan ornithology, and whether the island has any peculiar species nowhere appears. We are then brought to the brink of that remarkable strait through which runs “Wallace’s Line,” and crossing it find ourselves at once in the Australian Region, with which we began this protracted dissertation.

It is, of course, much to be regretted that at present our information does not allow of our treating all the Six Zoological Regions of the globe on a uniform plan, or of dealing equally with their several component portions. That this will be possible in a few years, as materials are accumulated, none can doubt; but as yet we are far from the attainment of so desirable an end, and must be content to make the most of what we have. Want of space, also, has hindered the proper consideration here of many points that fully deserve notice, and especially the negative characteristics of the different Regions—often quite as important as those which are positive. Of the imperfections of the preceding sketch no one can be more painfully aware than its author, but its very imperfections may serve a useful purpose in drawing attention to the districts about which least is known. Yet it would be affectation for him not to believe that it has some actual merit, but that merit is greatly if not chiefly due to the kindness of Mr Wallace, who, in the manner already stated, has allowed his forthcoming work to be laid under contribution, though in several respects its conclusions are not here adopted. That work, when published, will unquestionably form a foundation on which a noble superstructure will ultimately be erected, but it were vain to anticipate the ends which such a building will one day serve, and it would be beyond our scope to enter into any theoretical disquisition on the deductions which follow from the facts here advanced.

MIGRATION.

Most strangely and unaccountably confounded by many writers with the subject of Distribution is that of Migration. True it is that owing to the vast powers of locomotion possessed by nearly all Birds, we have individuals belonging in the main to certain groups, but by no means always confined to them, straying from their proper quarters and occurring in places far removed, not only from the land of their birth, but from the country whither they are ordinarily bound in their journeys, to reach which is the object wherefore such journeys are undertaken. It may be that in some measure this erraticism is governed by fixed laws, and indeed indication is not wanting that such laws exist, though as yet we know much too Httle to lay them down with any approach to confidence. But it is obvious on reflection that granting the existence of most rigorous laws of this kind—determining the flight of every winged vagabond—they must be very different from those which are obeyed by Birds commonly called “Migratory,” and migrating year after year according to a more or less fixed rule from one locality to another with the seasons as they roll. The former laws would seem to be created or controlled by purely external circumstances, which if they possess any periodicity at all possess a periodicity of cycles, and are most likely dependent in the main on cycles of the weather, but on this point observation has not yet supplied us with the means of avoiding speculation. We may indeed say almost without much risk of error that so many individuals of a foreign species—whether North-American or Asiatic—will occur in Great Britain so many times in the course of a term of years; but, though we may safely predict that if they appear at all they will do so at a certain season, it is impossible to make a forecast as to the year in which an example will turn up, or whether in one year some half-dozen may or may not occur. The matter thus becomes a matter of averages, and like all such is open to the influence of many perturbants, not that such may not well be subject to some law of which we are ignorant. Besides this, the average is hard to strike, depending as it must on the existence of favourably-placed and watchful observers. Moreover if we consider that the number of competent observers, though possibly greater in England than anywhere else in the world, has been at all times small, it is not surprising that little has been effected towards the compassing of any definite notion on this head. At present we can but attribute the appearance of foreign stragglers on our shores, and no doubt the same may be said of other countries, to the influence of storms which have driven the wanderers from their course, and though other more remote causes may possibly be assigned, there seems to be none but this on which we can safely rely. Consequently until the periodicity of storms is brought within our knowledge we must be content to abide in our ignorance of the laws which govern the appearance of the strangers. Still confining our remarks to the British Islands, the effect of these laws is in some degree constant. Singular as it may appear, the greatest number of North-American Birds—and especially of the Limicoloe. or Shorebirds, which are recorded as having occurred in this country have been met with in the eastern part of England or Scotland. There are two ways of accounting for this fact, the first of which is the unfortunate scarcity of observing naturalists in Ireland and on its western coast especially, and this is by no means to be overlooked; but it may be remarked that in no part of the United Kingdom is the profession of the gunner more enthusiastically followed than in the sister island, and the men who pursue that vocation are all alive to the mercantile value of any strange bird which may fall in their way. Of course they have no means of knowing what it is, yet as their spoils are sent for sale to the nearest market, it cannot but happen that if many examples of North-American species were procured by them, some proportion of these would find their way to the notice of the amateur naturalist and by him be recorded in the public prints.^[90. It seems also not unlikely that the very scarcity of rare birds in Ireland is one reason why there are so few ornithologists in that country, for here it is not uncommon for a man to have his attention first called to zoology by meeting with some strange animal—be it beast, bird, beetle, or butterfly, and for such a man afterwards to become no mean field-naturalist.] Now, as compared with Great Britain, this so rarely occurs in Ireland that it is by no means unfair to draw the inference that Transatlantic Birds are there far less frequently met with. The second mode of accounting for the fact above stated is that the majority of North-American Birds which occasionally visit Europe are of species which breed in somewhat high northern latitudes. On their way thence to their winterquarters, some are driven out to sea by violent westerly gales—the strongest winds, be it remembered, that prevail [9:3:765] in the North Atlantic, and thus strike the coast of Norway.^[91. Prof. Baird’s remarks on this subject are much to the point {Am. Journ. Sc., ser. 2, xli. pp. 344, 345).] In that country observers may be said to be practically absent, and fowlers as a rule unknown. Such storm-beaten wanderers there consort with the allied species to be found at that season in abundance on its shores and in their company pursue the same southerly course. With them they cross to the east of Great Britain, and once arrived here are speedily picked out and secured by the practised gunner. But should they even escape his notice, they with their comrades follow the shore-line, where they obtain the best supply of food, until passing round the south coast they find themselves at the western extremity of England—the district of the Land’s End, in which, next to Norfolk and Suffolk, the greatest number of these Transatlantic stragglers have been obtained. This suggestion may serve to shew what most likely goes on in other parts of the world, though the materials for establishing its general truth are not forthcoming.

I But returning to the subject of Migration proper, distinguished as it ought to be from that of the more or less accidental occurrence of stray visitors from afar, we have here more than enough to excite our wonder, and indeed are brought face to face with perhaps the greatest mystery which the whole animal kingdom presents—a mystery which attracted the attention of the earliest writers, and can in its chief point be no more explained by the modern man of science than by the simple-minded savage or the poet or prophet of antiquity. Some facts are almost universally known and have been the theme of comment in all ages and in all lands. The Hawk that stretches her wings toward the south is as familiar to the latest Nile-boat traveller or dweller on the Bosphorus as of old to the author of the book of Job. The autumnal thronging of myriads of Waterfowl by the rivers of Asia is witnessed by the modern sportsman as it was of old by Homer. Anacreon welcomed the returning Swallow, in numbers which his imitators of the colder north, to whom the associations connected with it are doubly strong, have tried in vain to excel. The Indian of the Fur-Countries in forming his rude calendar names the recurring moons after the Birds-of-passage whose arrival is coincident with their changes. But there is no need to multiply instances. The flow and ebb of the mighty feathered wave has been sung by poets and reasoned of by philosophers, has given rise to proverbs and entered into popular superstitions, and yet we must say of it still that our “ignorance is immense.’’

On one point and one only in connection with this subject can we boast ourselves to be clearly wiser than our ancestors. Some of them fully believed that the seasonal disappearance of the Swallow, the Nightingale, the Cuckow, and the Corncrake was due to hibernation, while others indeed doubted whether or not this was the true explanation of the fact. It is not so long since this belief and these doubts were in vogue, but now assuredly they have no hold upon the mind of any one capable of appreciating evidence, and this absurd fancy being exploded need not again trouble us.

In considering the phaenomena of Migration it will be best first to take the facts, and then try to account for their cause or causes. That a very large number of Birds all over the world change their abode according to the season is well known, and we find that in almost all countries there are some species which arrive in spring, remain to breed, and depart in autumn; others which arrive in autumn, stop for the winter, and depart in spring; and others again—and these are strictly speaking the “Birds of Passage ”—which shew themselves but twice a year, passing through the country without staying long in it, and their transient visits take place about spring and autumn. People who have given but little thought to the subject are apt to suppose that these migrants, which may thus easily be classed in three categories, are acted upon by influences of different kinds, whereas very little reflection will show that all are really affected by the same impulse, whatever that may be, and that the at first sight dissimilar nature of their movements is in truth almost uniform. The species which resort to this and to other temperate countries in winter are simply those which have their breeding-quarters much nearer the poles, and in returning to them on the approach of spring are but doing exactly aβ do those species which, having their winter-abode nearer the equator, come to us with the spring. The Birds-of-passage proper, like our winter-visitants have their breeding-quarters nearer the poles, but, like our summer-visitants, they seek their winter-abode nearer the equator, and thus perform a somewhat longer migration. So far there is no difficulty and no hypothesis—the bringing together of these three apparently different categories is the result of simple observation.

This however is not the only fact which is evident on the most cursory examination. To take the birds of the British Islands as an example (though exactly similar cases are presented in other countries) we find that while there are some species, such as the Swallow or the Fieldfare, of which every individual disappears at one period of the year or another, there are other species, such as the Pied Wagtail or the Woodcock, of which only the majority of individuals vanish—a few being always present^[92. Whether these few be not migrants from another district is a point that would require further consideration.] —and these species form the so-called “Partial Migrants.” If we extend our view and look to birds on the continent of Europe, we find that many species are there notoriously migrant which are not generally suspected to be so in this country—such as the Song-Thrush and the Redbreast, both of which species closer observation has proved to be with us subject to the migratory impulse. In respect of the former it is known that towards the end of summer or in autumn our native Song-Thrushes receive a considerable accession in numbers from the birds which arrive from the north, though the immigration is by no means so well marked as it is in Belgium, France, or Germany, where the arrival of the strangers sets all the fowlers to work, and the beginning of the Chasse aux Grives or Drosselzug is regarded in many places nearly as the Twelfth of August or the First of September is with us. In most localities in Britain the new comers depart after a short sojourn, and are accompanied by so many of the home-bred birds that in some parts of the island it may be safely declared that not a single Song-Thrush can be found from the end of November to the end of January, w hile in others examples can always be seen. Much the same may be said of the Redbreast. Undeniably resident as a species, attentive scrutiny will reveal the fact that its numbers are subject to very considerable variation according to the season of the year. At no time do our Redbreasts collect in bands, but towards the end of summer they may be seen in the south of England successively passing onward, the travellers being mostly if not wholly young birds of the year; and so the great majority disappear, departing it may be safely presumed for more southern countries, since a few weeks later the markets of most towns first in France and then in Italy are well supplied with this species. But the migratory influence affects, though in a less degree, many if not most of the Redbreasts that remain with us. Content during the autumn to occupy their usual haunts, [9:3:766] the first sharp frost has a decided effect upon their distribution, and a heavy fall of snow drives them towards the homesteads for the larger supply of food they find there, while should severe and long-continued hard weather follow even these birds vanish, leaving only the few which have become almost domesticated.

These two species have been here chosen as illustrative cases because they are at once plentiful and familiar, and want of space only forbids us from citing others, but we shall find on inquiry that there is scarcely a Bird of either the Palaearctic or Nearctic Region, whose habits are at all well known, of which much the same may not be said, and hence we are led to the conclusion that every Bird of the northern hemisphere is to a greater or less degree migratory in some part or other of its range. Such a conclusion brings us to a still more general inference—namely that Migration, instead of being the exceptional characteristic it uβed formerly to be thought, may really be almost universal, and though the lack of observations in other, and especially tropical, countries does not allow us to declare that such is the case, it seems very probable to be so. Before proceeding however to any further conclusions it is necessary to examine another class of facts which may possibly throw some light on the matter.

It must be within the experience of every one who has ever been a birds’-nesting boy that the most sedentary of Birds year after year occupy the same quarters in the breeding season.^[93. Two remarkable instances of this persistency may be noticed. The nest of a Falcon ( Falco peregrinus) on Avasaxa—à hill in Finland somewhat celebrated as one of the most southern points whence the midnight sun may be seen—is mentioned by the French astronomer Maupertuis as having been observed by him in the year 1736. In 1799 it was rediscovered by Skjöldebrand and Acerbi. In 1833 Wolley found it tenanted, and from enquiries he made of the neighbours it was evident that such had yearly been the case so far as any one could remember, and so it was in 1855 as the writer can testify. In 1779 according to one account, in 1785 according to another, a pair of the Blue Titmouse (Parus caeruleus) built their nest in a large earthenware bottle placed in the branches of a tree in a garden at Oxbridge near Stockton-on-Tees. With two exceptions only, this bottle, or a second which has lately been placed close to it, has been tenanted by a pair of birds of this species from the year in which it was first occupied until 1873, when the writer saw it.—See YarrelΓs British Birds, 4th ed. i. pp. 58, 486.] In some instances this may be ascribed, it is true, to the old haunt affording the sole or the most convenient site for the nest in the neighbourhood, but in so many instances such is not the case that we are led to believe in the existence of a real partiality, while there are quite enough exceptions to show that a choice is frequently exercised. The same may equally be said of the most migrant of Birds, and perhaps the strongest instance that has ever come to the knowledge of the writer refers to one of the latter. A pair of Stone-Curlews (Oedicnemus crepitans)— a very migratory species, affecting almost exclusively the most open country—were in the habit of breeding for many years on the same spot though its character had undergone a complete change. It had been part of an extensive and barren rabbit-warren, and was become the centre of a large and flourishing plantation.

With these two sets of facts before us we may begin to try and account for the cause or causes of Migration. Iu some cases want of food would seem to be enough, as it is undoubtedly the most obvious cause that presents itself to our mind.^[94. Far more so than variation of the temperature, though in popular belief that probably holds the first place. But Birds generally, as compared with other Vertebrates, are but slightly affected by extremes of heat or cold, and indeed (so far as we can judge) by most climatic influences, provided only their supply of food is not affected thereby. —‘Cf. Max Schmidt, Zoolog. Garten, 1865, pp. 330-340.)] The need which all animals have of finding for themselves proper and sufficient sustenance is all-powerful, and the difficulties they have to encounter in obtaining it are so great that none can wonder that those which possess the power of removing themselves from a place of scarcity should avail themselves of it, while it is unquestionable that no Class of animals has this facility in a greater degree than Birds.^[95. The only animals which approach Birds in the extent and character of their migrations are Fishes, of which there is no need here to say anything.] Even among many of those species which we commonly speak of as sedentary, it is only the adults which maintain their ground throughout the year. It has long been known that Birds-of-prey customarily drive away their offspring from their own haunts so soon as the young are able to shift for themselves. The reason generally, and no doubt truly, given for this behaviour, which at first sight appears so unnatural, is the impossibility of both parents and progeny getting a livelihood in the same vicinity. The practice, however, is not limited to the Birds-of-prey alone, but is much more universal. We find it to obtain with the Redbreast, and if we watch our feathered neighbours closely we shall perceive that most of them indulge in it. The period of expulsion, it is true, is in some Birds deferred from the end of summer or the autumn, in which it is usually performed, until the following spring, when indeed from the maturity of the young it must be regarded as much in the light of a voluntary secession on their part as in that of an act of parental compulsion, but the effect is ultimately the same. These cases, however, which make certainly the exception rather than the rule, we can account for in another manner. It is to be observed that they are confined to species having a peculiar mode of life, the individuals associating in family-parties to form small bands. The members of the Titmouse-family (Paridae) offer a good instance of this peculiarity, but it requires no very abstruse reflection to perceive that the adoption of this habit is one eminently conducive to the easy attainment of their food, which is collected, as it were, into particular spots often far apart, but where it does occur occurring plentifully. Thus a single Titmouse searching alone might hunt for a whole day without meeting with a sufficiency, while if a dozen are united by the same motive it is hardly possible for the place in which the food is lodged to escape their detection, and when discovered a few call-notes from the lucky finder are enough to assemble the whole company to share the feast. It is impossible to watch a band of any species of Titmouse, even for a few minutes, without arriving at this conclusion. One tree after another is visited by the active little rovers, and its branches examined: if nothing be forthcoming away goes the explorer to the next that presents itself, merely giving utterance to the usual twitter that serves to keep the body together. But if the object of search be found, another kind of chirp is emitted, and the next moment the several members of the band are flitting in succession to the tree and eagerly engaged with the spoil.^[96. The case is altogether different with those species which in winter form themselves into large flocks, as most of the Finches (Fringillidoe) and Buntings (Emberizidae). The discoverer of a favourite morsel perhaps by his actions betrays what he has obtained, and accordingly his fellows may repair to the place, but it is without invitation on his part, and the only particular bond of union not entirely selfish which keeps them together is the cry of alarm with λvhich a stranger is greeted.]

The mode in which the want of sustenance produces Migration may best be illustrated by confining ourselves to the unquestionably migrant Birds of our own northern hemisphere. As food grows scarce towards the end of summer in the most northern limits of the range of a species, the individuals affected thereby seek it elsewhere. Thus doing, they press upon the haunt of other individuals: these in like manner upon that of yet others, and so on, [9:3:767] until the movement which began in the far north is communicated to the individuals occupying the extreme southern range of the species at that season; though, but for such an intrusion, these last might be content to stay some time longer in the enjoyment of their existing quarters.

This seems satisfactorily to explain the southward movement of all migrating Birds in the northern hemisphere; but when we consider the return movement which takes place some six months later, doubt may be entertained whether scarcity of food can be assigned as its sole or sufficient cause, and perhaps it would be safest not to come to any decision on this point. On one side it may be urged that the more equatorial regions which in winter are crowded with emigrants from the north, though well fitted for the resort of so great a population at that season are deficient in certain necessaries for the nursery. Nor does it seem too violent an assumption to suppose that even if such necessaries are not absolutely wa iting, yet that the regions in question would not supply sufficient food for both parents and offspring—the latter being at the lowest computation, twice as numerous as the former—unless the numbers of both were diminished by the casualties of travel.^[97. If the relative proportion of land to water in the Southern Hemisphere were at all such as it is in the Northern, we should no doubt find the birds of southern continents beginning to press upon the tropical and equatorial regions of the globe at the season when they were thronged with the emigrants from the north, and in such a case it would be only reasonable that the latter should be acted upon by the force of the former, according to the explanation given of the southward movement of northern migrants. But, though we know almost nothing of the migration of birds of the other hemisphere, yet, when we regard the comparative deficiency of land in southern latitudes all round the world, it is obvious that the feathered population of such as now-a-days exists can exert but little influence, and its effects may be practically disregarded.] But on the other hand we must remember what has above been advanced in regard to the pertinacity with which Birds return to their accustomed breeding-places, and the force of this passionate fondness for the old home cannot but be taken into account, even if we do not allow that in it lies the whole stimulus to undertake the perilous voyage.

Mr Wallace in some remarks on the subject (Nature, X. p. 459) ingeniously suggests the manner in which the habit of Migration has come to be adopted:^[98. In principle Captain Hutton had already foreshadowed the same theory.— (Trans. New Zeal. Inst. 1872, p. 235.)] —

“It appears to me probable that here, as in so many other cases, ‘ survival of the fittest’ will be found to have had a powerful influence. Let us suppose that in any species of migratory bird, breeding can as a rule be only safely accomplished in a given area; and further, that during a great part of the rest of the year sufficient food cannot be obtained in that area. It will follow that those birds which do not leave the breeding area at the proper season will suffer, and ultimately become extinct; which will also be the fate of those which do not leave the feeding area at the proper time. Now, if we suppose that the two areas were (for some remote ancestor of the existing species) coincident, but by geological and climatic changes gradually diverged from each other, we can easily understand how the habit of incipient and partial migration at the proper seasons would at last become hereditary, and so fixed as to be what we term an instinct. It will probably be found, that every gradation still exists in various parts of the world, from a complete coincidence to a complete separation of the breeding and the subsistence areas; and when the natural history of a sufficient number of species is thoroughly worked out, we may find every link between species which never leave a restricted area in which they breed and live the whole year round, to those other cases in which the two areas are absolutely separated.”

A few more particulars respecting Migration are all that can here be given, and it is doubtful whether much can be built upon them. It has now been ascertained by re- i peated observation that in the spring-movement of most species of the northern hemisphere the cock-birds are always in the van of the advancing army, and that they appear some days, or perhaps weeks, before the hens. It is not difficult to imagine that, in the course of a journey prolonged throughout some 50° or 60° of latitude, the stronger individuals should outstrip the weaker by a very perceptible distance, and it can hardly be doubted that in most species the males are stouter, as they are bigger than the females. Some observers assert that the same thing takes place in the return-journey in autumn, but on this point others are not so sure, which is not surprising when we consider that the majority of observations have been made towards what is the northern limit of the range of the Passeres, to which the remark is especially applicable —in the British Islands, France, North Germany, and the Russian Empire—for it is plain that at the beginning of the journey any inequality in the speed of travelling will not have become so very manifest. There is also another matter to be noticed. It has been suspected that where there is any difference in the size of birds of the same species, particularly in the dimensions of their wings, the individuals that perform the most extensive journeys are naturally those with the longest and broadest remiges, and in support of this view it certainly appears that in some of the smaller migrants—such as the Wheatear (Saxicola oenanthe) and Willow-Wren (Phylloscopus trochilus) — the examples which reach the extreme north of Europe and there pass the summer possess greater mechanical powers of flight than those of the same species which stop short on the shores of the Mediterranean. It may perhaps be also inferred, though precise evidence is wanting, that these same individuals push further to the southward in winter than do those which are less favoured in this respect. It is pretty nearly certain that such is the case with some species, and it may well be so with individuals. Canon Tristram has remarked (Ibis, 1865, p. 77) that, in many genera of Birds, “those species which have the most extended northerly have also the most extended southerly range; and that those which resort to the highest latitudes for nidification also pass further than others to the southward in winter,” fortifying his opinion by examples adduced from the genera Turdus, Fringilla, Cypselus, and Turtur. But supposing this to be true for many Birds, it may fairly be doubted whether it is so for all, and whether in some species certain individuals do not always occupy the most northern portion of the range and others always keep to the most southern, no matter what the season of the year may be, or over what countries the range may extend. On this point therefore it will be advisable to await further investigation.

For many years past a large number of persone in different countries have occupied and amused themselves by carefully registering the dates on which various migratory Birds first make their appearance, and certain publications abound with the records so compiled.^[99. These are far too numerous to mention here. Perhaps the most remarkable series of them is that carried on from 173t> to 1810 and again from 1836 to 1874 by four generations of the Marsham family at Stratton-Strawless and Rippon near Norwich, of which an account is given by Mr South well (Trans. Norf, and Norw. Nat. Soc. ii. p. 31).] Some of the observers have been men of high scientific repute, others of less note but of not inferior capabilities for this especial object. Still it does not seem that they have been able to determine what connection, if any, exists between the arrival of birds and the state of the weather. This is not very wonderful, for the movements of the migrants, if governed at all by meteorological forces, must be influenced by their action in the places whence the travellers have come, and therefore to establish any direct relation of cause and effect corresponding observations ought equally to be made in such places, which has seldom been done.^[100. To a limited extent it must be admitted that the popular belief as to certain Birds being the harbingers of severe weather is justifiable. Cold comes from the north, and when it is accompanied, as is most gene-]
[9:3:768]

As a rule it would seem as though Birds were not dependent on the weather to any great degree. Occasionally the return of the Swallow or the Nightingale may be somewhat delayed, but most Sea-fowls may be trusted, it is said, as the almanack itself. Were they satellites revolving around this earth, their arrival could hardly be more surely calculated by an astronomer. Foul weather or fair, heat or cold, the Puffins (Fratercula arctica) repair to some of their stations punctually on a given day as if their movements were regulated by clock-work. Whether they have come from far or from near we know not, but other Birds certainly come from a great distance, and yet make their appearance with scarcely less exactness. Nor is the regularity with which certain species disappear much inferior; every observer knows how abundant the Swift (Cypselus apus) is up to the time of its leaving its summer-home— in most parts of England, the first days of August—and how rarely it is seen after that time is past.

It must be allowed, however, that, with few exceptions, the mass of statistics above spoken of has never been worked up and digested so as to allow proper inferences to be made from them, and therefore it would be premature to say that little would come of it, but the result of those few exceptions is not very encouraging. Some twenty years ago Dr von Middendorff carefully collated the records of the arrival of migratory Birds throughout the Russian Empire, but the insight into the question afforded by his published labours^[101. Die Iseρiρtesen Russlands. Grundlagen zur Erforschung der Zug-: itm und Zugrichtungen der Vögel Russlands. St Petersburg: 1855.] is not very great. His chief object has been to trace what he has termed the isepipteses (ισος = oequalis, έπίπτησις = advolatus) or the lines of simultaneous arrival, and in the case of 7 species^[102. Hirundo rustica, Motacilla alba, Alauda arνensis, Oriolus galbula, Cuculus canorus, Ciconia alba, and Grus communis.] these are laid down on the maps which accompany his treatise. The lines are found by taking the average date of arrival of each species at each place in the Russian dominions where observations have been regularly made, and connecting those places where the dates are the same for each species by lines on the map. The curves thus drawn indicate the nequality of progress made by the species in different longitudes, and assuming that the advance is directly across the isepiptesial lines, or rather the belts defined by each pair of them, the whole course of the migration is thus most accurately made known. In the case of his seven sample species the maps show their progressive advance at intervals of a few days, and the issue of the whole investigation, according to him (op. cit. p. 8) proves that in the middle of Siberia the general direction of the usual migrants is almost due north, in the east of Siberia from south-east to north-west, and in European Russia from south-west to north-east. Thus nearly all the migrants of the Russian Empire tend to converge upon the most northern part of the continent, the Taimyr Peninsula, but it is almost needless to say that few of them reach anything like so far, since the country in those high latitudes is utterly unfit to support the majority. With the exception of some details, which, though possessing a certain special interest, need not here be mentioned, this treatise fails to shew more; for the fact that there are places that notwithstanding their higher latitude are reached by Birds on their spring-migrations sooner than others in a lower latitude was already known.

The routes followed by migratory Birds, so far as our information at present extends, has been the subject of a very exhaustive memoir by Herr Palmen^[103. Om Foglames fyttningsvägar (Helsingfors'. 1874). In this and the work of Dr von Middendorff, already cited, reference is made to almost every important publication on the subject of Migration, which renders a notice of its very extensive literature needless here, and a pretty full bibliographical list is given in Prof. GiebeΓs Thesaurus Ornithologies (i. pp. 146-155). Yet mention may be made of Prof. Schlegel’s Over het trekken des Vogel's (Harlem: 1828), Mr Hodgson’s “On the Migration of the Natatores and Grallatores as observed at Kathmandu” in Asiatic Researches (xviii. pp. 122-128), and Μ. Marcel de Serres’s Des causes des Migrations des Animaux et particulièrement des Oiseaux et des Poissons (Harlem: 1842). This last though one of the largest publications on the subject is one of the least satisfactory. Prof. Baird’s excellent treatise On the Distribution and Migrations of North American Birds has been before adverted to.] / but it would be impossible within the limits of the present article to do more than mention his results concisely. He enters very fully into this part of the enquiry and lays down with much apparent probability the chief roads taken by the most migratory Birds of the Palaearctic Region in their return autumnal journey, further asserting that in the spaces between these lines of flight such birds do not usually occur. These main routes are, he states, nine in number. The first (A—to use his notation), leaving the Siberian shores of the Polar Sea, Nova Zembla, and the North of Russia, passes down the west coast of Norway to the North Sea and the British Islands. The second (B), proceeding from Spitsbergen and the adjoining islands, follows much the same course, but is prolonged past France, Spain, and Portugal to the west coast of Africa. The third (C) starts from Northern Russia, and, threading the White Sea, and the great Lakes of Onega and Ladoga, skirts the Gulf of Finland and the southern part of the Baltic to Holstein and so to Holland, where it divides—one branch uniting with the second main route (B), while the other, running up the valley of the Rhine and crossing to that of the Rhone, splits up on reaching the Mediterranean, where one path passes down the western coast of Italy and Sicily, a second takes the line by Corsica and Sardinia, and a third follows the south coast of France and eastern coast of Spain —all three paths ending in North Africa. The fourth (D), fifth (E), and sixth (F) main routes depart from the extreme north of Siberia. The fourth (D) ascending the river Ob, branches out near Tobolsk—one track, diverging to the Volga, descends that river and so passes to the Sea of Azov, the Black Sea, and thence, by the Bosphorus and Aegean, to Egypt; another track makes for the Caspian by way of the Ural River and so leads to the Persian Gulf, while two more are lost sight of on the steppes. The fifth (E) mouuts the Jennesei to Lake Baikal and so passes into Mongolia. The sixth (F) ascends the Lena and striking the Upper Amoor reaches the Sea of Japan, where it coalesces with the seventh (G) and eighth (0) which run from the eastern portion of Siberia and Kamchatka. Besides these the ninth (X) starting from Greenland and Iceland passes by the Faeroes to the British Islands and so joining the second (B) and third (C) runs down the French coast. These being the main routes it must be added that, in Herr Palmén’s opinion and that of many others, nearly all river-courses form minor routes.^[104. In giving this abstract the present writer wishes to state that he does not thereby express his agreement with all that it contains. Herr Palmén’s views deserve the fullest attention from the truly scientific spirit in which they are put forward, but some of the details on which they are founded seem to require correction.]

But lay down the paths of migratory Birds, observe their comings and goings, or strive to account for the impulse which urges them forward as we will, there still remains for consideration the most marvellous thing of all—How do the birds find their way so unerringly from such immense distances? This seems to be by far the most inexplicable part of the matter. Year after year the migra-

rally the case, by heavy falls of snow, such Birds are of course driven southward to seek their living. But as often as not the Birds arrive with the kind of weather they are commonly held to prognosticate, while sometimes this does not follow their appearance.
[9:3:769]

tory Wagtail will build her nest in the accustomed spot, and year after year the migratory Cuckow will deposit her eggs in that nest, and yet in each interval of time the former may have passed some months on the shores of the Mediterranean, and the latter, absent for a still longer period, may have wandered into the heart of Africa.^[105. Absolute proof of the identity of the particular birds is of course wanting, but if that objection be raised the circumstance becomes still more puzzling, for then we have to account for some mode of communicating precise information by one bird to another.] The writer cannot offer an approach to the solution of this mystery. There was a time when he had hopes that what is called the “homing” faculty in Pigeons might furnish a clue, but Mr Tegetmeier and all the best authorities on that subject declare that a knowledge of landmarks obtained by sight, and sight only, is the sense which directs these Birds, while sight alone can hardly be regarded as affording much aid to Birds—and there is reason to think that there are several such—which at one stretch transport themselves across the breadth of Europe, or even traverse more than a thousand miles of open ocean, to say nothing of those—and of them there are certainly many—which perform their migrations by night. That particular form of Bluethroat which yearly repairs to breed upon the mosses of the Subalpine and Northern parts of Scandinavia (Cyanecula suecica) is hardly ever seen in Europe south of the Baltic.^[106. It has occurred indeed as a straggler in about a dozen instances in England, and it arrives twice a yea? in greater or less numbers in Heligoland as reported by the ever-watchful observer on that island, Mr Gätke, to whom ornithologists are so deeply indebted for his long-continued and intelligent scrutiny of the extraordinary number of wandering birds which alight there.] Throughout Germany it may be said to be quite unknown, being replaced by a conspicuously different form (C. leucocyand), and as it is a Bird in which the collectors of that country, a numerous and well-instructed body, have long taken great interest, we are in a position to declare that it is not known to stop in its transit from its winter haunts, which we know to be Egypt and the valley of the Upper Nile, to its breeding-quarters. Other instances, though none so crucial as th13, could be cited from among European Birds were there room here for them. In New Zealand there are two Cuckows which are annual visitors: one, a species of Chrysococcyx, is supposed to come from Australia, the other, Eudynamis taitensis is widely spread throughout Polynesia, yet both these birds yearly make two voyages over the enormous waste of waters that surrounds the country to which they resort to breed. But space would utterly fail us were we to attempt to recount all the examples of these wonderful flights. Yet it seems impossible that the sense of sight should be the faculty whereby they are so guided to their destination, any more than in the case of those which travel in the dark.

Dr von Middendorff (op. cit. p. 9), from the conclusions he has drawn, as before mentioned, as to the spring-movement of all birds in the Russian Empire being towards the Taimyr Peninsula, the seat of one of the magnetic poles, has suggested that the migrating Bird is always aware (he does not sufficiently explain by what means) of the situation of this point, and thus knows how to steer its course. Not only is this hypothesis unsupported by any considerations known to the writer, but it is not at all borne out by 'the observed facts of Migration in North America, where Birds as has been shewn by Professor Baird (op. cit. p. 347) do not migrate in the direction of the magnetic pole.

Other authors there are who rely on what they call “instinct” as an explanation of this wonderful faculty. This with them is simply a way of evading the difficulty before us, if it does not indeed remove the question altogether from the domain of scientific inquiry. Rejecting such a mode of treatment, Herr Palmén meets it in a much fairer spirit. He asserts (op. cit. p. 195) that migrants are led by the older and stronger individuals among them, and, observing that most of those which stray from their right course are yearlings that have never before taken the journey, he ascribes the due performance of the flight to “experience.” But, granting the undisputed truth of his observation, his assertion seems to be only partially proved. That the birds which lead the flock are the strongest is on all accounts most likely, but what is there to show that these are also the oldest of the concourse? Besides this, there are many Birds which cannot be said to migrate in flocks. While Swallows, to take a sufficiently evident example, conspicuously congregate in vast flocks and so leave our shores in large companies, the majority of our summer-visitors slip away almost unobserved, each apparently without concert with others. It is also pretty nearly certain that the same species of Bird does not migrate in the same manner at all times. When Skylarks arrive on our north-eastern coast in autumn they come flitting over in a constant, straggling stream, not in compact flocks; yet a little later these same birds collect in enormous assemblages which prosecute their voyage in company. It is indeed possible that each bird of the stream intentionally follows that which goes before it, though in a long seapassage it must be hard to keep the precursor in sight, and it may perhaps be granted that the leader of the whole is a bird of experience. But then we must consider not these cases only, but also those of Birds which do not migrate in company, and we must also have regard to what is implied in the word “experience.” Here it can only signify the result of knowledge acquired on former occasions, and obtained by sight. Now it was stated by Temminck^[107. Manual à: Ornithologie, iii. Introd. p. xliii. note.] many years ago, and so far as would appear the statement has not been invalidated, that among migrants the young and the old always journey apart and most generally by different routes. The former can have no “experience,”, and yet the greater number of them safely arrive at the haven where they would be. The sense of sight, essential to a knowledge of landmarks, as we have above attempted to demonstrate, is utterly insufficient to account for th® success that attends Birds which travel by night, or in a single flight span oceans or continents. Yet without it the idea of “experience” cannot be substantiated. We may admit that inherited but unconscious experience, which is really all that can be meant by instinct, is a factor in tho whole matter—certainly, as Mr Wallace seems to have proved, in originating the migratory impulse, but yet every aspect of the question is fraught with difficulty, and we must leave to time the discovery of this mystery of mysteries.

There yet remain a few words to be said on what may be termed Exceptional Migration, that is when from some cause or other the ordinary practice is broken through. This differs from the chance occurrence of the waifs and strays with which this section of the article began in that the Birds subject to it keep in a great measure their customary habit of migrating, and yet are compelled to indulge it in an irregular, or perhaps an altogether novel, manner, though they are not entirely the sport of circumstances. The erratic movements of the various species of Crossbill (Loxia) and some allied forms afford perhaps the best-known examples. In England no one can say in what part of the country or at what season of the year he may not fall in with a company of the Common Crossbill (A. curvirostra), and the like may be said of many other lands. The food of these Birds consists mainly of the seeds of conifers, and as its supply in any one locality is intermittent or precarious, we may not unreasonably guess that [9:3:770] they shift from place to place in its quest, and may thus find an easy way of accounting for their uncertain appearance. The great band of Nutcrackers (Numfraga caryocatactes) which in the autumn of 1844 pervaded Western and Central Europe^[108. Bull, de ΓAcad. de Bruxelles, xi. p. 298.] may also have been actuated by the same motive, but we can hardly explain the roaming of all other Birds so plausibly. The inroads of the Wax wing (Ampelis garrulus) have been the subject of interest for more than 300 years, and by persons prone to superstitious auguries were regarded as the forerunners of dire calamity. Sometimes years have passed without its being seen at all in Central, Western, or Southern Europe, and then perhaps for two or three seasons in succession vast flocks have suddenly appeared. Later observation has shown that this species is as inconstant in the choice of its summer-as of its winter-quarters, and though the cause of the irregularity may possibly be of much the same kind as that just suggested in the case of the Crossbill, the truth awaits further investigation.^[109. Cf. Yarrell, Brit. Birds, cd. 4, i. pp. 524-532.] One of the most extraordinary events known to ornithologists is the irruption into Europe in 1863 of Pallas’s Sand-Grouse (Syrrhaptes paradoxus). Of this Bird, hitherto known only as an inhabitant of the Tartar steppes, a single specimen was obtained at Sarepta on the Volga in the winter of 1848. In May 1859 a pair is said to have been killed in the Government of Vilna on the western borders of the Russian Empire, and a few weeks later five examples were procured, and a few others seen, in Western Europe—one in Jutland, one in Holland, two in England, and one in Wales. In 1860 another was obtained at Sarepta; but in May and June 1863 a horde computed to consist of at least 700 individuals overran Europe—reaching Sweden, Nor way, the Faeroes, and Ireland in the north-west, and in the south extending to Sicily and almost to the frontiers of Spain. On the sandhills of Jutland and Holland some of these birds bred, but war was too successfully waged against the nomades to allow of their establishing themselves, and a few survivors only were left to fall to the gun in the course of the following winter and spring.^[110. this, 1864, pp. 185-222. A few additional particulars which have since become known to the writer are inserted above.] In the summer of 1872, another visitation to Great Britain was reported, but if it really took place it must have been that of a very small number of birds, and it was not observed on the Continent. Speculation has amused itself by assigning causes to these movements but the real reason remains in doubt.

We cannot quit the subject of Migration, however, without referring to the wonderful assemblages of Birds which have in various places been time and again noticed by night. Towards the close of summer, in dark, cloudy, and still weather, it not unfrequently happens that a vast and, to judge from their cries, heterogeneous concourse of Birds may be heard hovering over our large towns. The practical ornithologist will recognize the notes of Plover, Sandpiper, Tern, and Gull, now faint with distance and then apparently close overhead, while occasionally the stroke of a wing may catch his ear, but nothing is visible in the surrounding gloom. Sometimes but a few fitful wails are heard, of which only an expert listener will know the meaning. At others the continuous Babel of sounds will ensure the attention of the most incurious. It is supposed that these noises proceed from migrating birds, which, having lost their way, are attracted by the glare of the street-lamps, but far too little has been observed to remove the obscurity that in a double sense surrounds them and to enable us to come to any definite conclusion. It must be added also that such a concourse has been noticed where the fascina tion of light did not exist, for Lord Lilford has recorded^[111. Ibis, 1865, p. 176.] how that once at Corfu he was startled by an uproar as if all the feathered inhabitants of the great Acherusian Marsh had met in conflict overhead, but he could form no conception of what birds produced the greater part of it.

Leaving then the subject of Migration, the next important part of the economy of Birds to be considered is perhaps their Song—a word, however, in a treatise of this kind to be used in a general sense, and not limited to the vocal sounds uttered by not more than a moiety of the feathered races which charm us by the strains they pour from their vibrating throat,—strains indeed denied by the scientific musician to come under cognizance as appertaining to his art, but strains which in all countries and in all ages have conveyed a feeling of true pleasure to the human hearer, and strains of which by common consent the Nightingale is the consummate master. It is necessary in a philosophical spirit to regard every sound made by a Bird under the all-powerful influence of love or lust as a “Song.” It seems impossible to draw any but an arbitrary line between the deep booming of the Emeu, the harsh cry of the Guillemot (which, when proceeding from a hundred or a thousand throats, strikes the distant ear in a confused murmur like the roar of a tumultuous crowd), the plaintive wail of the Plover, the melodious whistle of the Widgeon, “the Cock’s shrill clarion,” the scream of the Eagle, the hoot of the Owl, the solemn chime of the Bellbird, the whip-cracking of the Manakin, the Chaffinch’s joyous burst, or the hoarse croak of the Raven, on the one hand, and the bleating of the Snipe^[112. δ The true cause of this sound has been much, discussed, but Herr Meves’s explanation (Proc. Zοοl. Sοc. 1858, p.∙ 302), based on experiment, seems to be correct, though it is far from being generally accepted.] or the drumming of the Ruffed Grouse, on the other. Innumerable are the forms which such utterances take. In many birds the sounds are due to a combination of vocal and instrumental powers, or, as in the cases last mentioned, to the latter only. But, however produced—and of the machinery whereby they are accomplished there is not room here to speak— all have the same cause and the same effect. The former has been already indicated, and the latter is its consummation. Almost coinstantaneously with the hatching of the Nightingale’s brood, the song of the sire is hushed, and the notes to which we have for weeks hearkened with rapt admiration are changed to a guttural croak, expressive of alarm and anxiety, inspiring a sentiment of the most opposite character. No greater contrast can be imagined, and no instance can be cited which more completely points out the purpose which “Song” fulfils in the economy of the bird, for if the Nightingale’s nest at this early time be destroyed or its contents removed, the cock speedily recovers his voice, and his favourite haunts again resound to his bewitching strains. For them his mate is content again to undergo the wearisome round of nest-building and incubation. But should some days elapse before disaster befalls their callow care, his constitution undergoes a change and no second attempt to rear a family is made. It would seem as though a mild temperature, and the abundance of food by which it is generally accompanied, prompt the physiological alteration which inspires the males of most birds to indulge in the “Song” peculiar to them. Thus after the annual moult is accomplished, and this is believed to be the most critical epoch in the life of any bird, cock Thrushes, Skylarks, and others begin to sing, not indeed with the jubilant voice of spring but in an [9:3:771] uncertain cadence which is quickly silenced by the supervention of cold weather. Yet some birds we have which, except during the season of moult, hard frost, and time of snow, sing almost all the year round. Of these the Redbreast and the Wren are familiar examples, and the Chiff-chaff repeats its two-noted cry, almost to weariness, during the whole period of its residence in this country.^[113. A curious question, which has as yet attracted but little attention, is whether the notes of the same species of Bird are in all countries alike. From his own observation the writer is inclined to think that it is not, and that there may exist “dialects,” so to speak, of the song. (Cf. Gloger, Jowr. für Orn. 1859, p. 398.)]

Akin to the “Song” of Birds, and undoubtedly proceeding from the same cause, are the peculiar gestures which the males of many perform under the influence of the approaching season of pairing, but these again are far too numerous here to describe with particularity. It must suffice to mention a few cases. The Ruff on his hillock in a marsh holds a war-dance. The Snipe and some of his allies mount aloft and wildly execute unlooked-for evolutions almost in the clouds. The Woodcock and many of the Goatsuckers beat evening after evening the same aerial path with its sudden and sharp turnings. The Ring-Dove rises above the neighbouring trees and then with motionless wings slides down to the leafy retreat they afford. The Capercally and Blackcock, perched on a commanding eminence, throw themselves into postures that defy the skill of the caricaturist—other species of the Grouse-tribe assume the strangest attitudes and rur in circles till the turf is worn bare. The Peacock in pride spreads his train so as to shew how nearly akin are the majestic and the ludicrous. The Bower-bird, not content with his own splendour, builds an arcade, decked with bright feathers and shining shells, through and around which he paces with his gay companions. The Larks and Pipits never deliver their song so well as when seeking the upper air. Rooks rise one after the other to a great height and, turning on their back, wantonly precipitate themselves many yards towards the ground, while the solemn Raven does not scorn a similar feat, and, with the tenderest of croaks, glides supinely alongside or in front of his mate.^[114. No comprehensive account of the Song of Birds seems ever to have been written. The following may be cited as the principal treatises on the subject :—Barrington, Phil. Trans. 1773, pp. 249-291; Kennedy, xV. AbhancU. baier. Akad. {Phil. Abhandl.) 1797, p. 169; Blackwall, Mem. LU. and Phil. Soc.

The notes of many of our common Birds are musically expressed by Mr Harting, Birds of Middlesex (London: 1866).]

NIDIFICATION.

Following or coincident with the actions just named, and countless more besides, comes the real work of the breeding-season, to which they are but the prelude or the accompaniment. Nidification is with most birds the beginning of this business; but with many it is a labour that is scamped if not shirked. Some of the Auk tribe place their single egg on a bare ledge of rock, where its peculiar conical shape is but a precarious safeguard when rocked by the wind or stirred by the thronging crowd of its parents’ fellows. The Stone-Curlew and the Goatsucker deposit their eggs without the slightest preparation of the soil on which they rest; yet this is not done at haphazard, for no birds can be more constant in selecting, almost to an inch, the very same spot which year after year they choose for their procreant cradle. In marked contrast to such artless care stand the wonderful structures which others, such as the Tailor-bird, the Bottle-Titmouse, or the Fantail-Warbler build for the comfort or safety of their young. But every variety of disposition may be found in the Class. The Apteryx seems to entrust its abnormally big egg to an excavation among the roots of a tree-fern; while a band of female Ostriches scrape holes in the desert-sand and therein promiscuously dropping their eggs cover them with earth and leave the task of incubation to the male, who discharges the duty thus imposed upon him by night only, and trusts by day to the sun’s rays for keeping up the needful, fostering warmth. The Megapodes raise a huge hotbed of dead leaves wherein they deposit their eggs and the young are hatched without further care on the part of either parent. Some of the Grebes and Rails seem to avail themselves in a less degree of the heat generated by vegetable decay, and dragging from the bottom or sides of the waters they frequent fragments of aquatic plants form of them a rude half-floating mass which is piled on some growing water-weed—but these birds do not spurn the duties of maternity. Many of the Gulls, Sandpipers, and Plovers lay their eggs in a shallow pit which they hollow out in the soil, and then as incubation proceeds add thereto a low breastwork of haulm. The Ringed Plover commonly places its eggs on shingle, which they so much resemble in colour, but when breeding on grassy uplands it paves the nest-hole with small stones. Pigeons mostly make an artless platform of sticks so loosely laid together that their pearly treasures may be perceived from beneath by the inquisitive observer. The Magpie, as though self-conscious that its own thieving habits may be imitated by its neighbours, surrounds its nest with a hedge of thorns. Very many birds of almost every group bore holes in some sandy cliff, and at the end of their tunnel deposit their eggs with or without bedding. Such bedding, too, is very various in character; thus, while the Sheldduck and the Sand-Martin supply the softest of materials, the one of down from her own body, the other of feathers collected by dint of diligent search,—the Kingfisher forms a couch of the undigested spiny fish-bones which she ejects in pellets from her own stomach. Other birds, as the Woodpeckers, hew holes in living trees, even when the timber is of considerable hardness, and therein establish their nursery. Some of the Swifts secrete from their salivary glands a fluid which rapidly hardens as it dries on exposure to the air into a substance resembling isinglass, and thus furnish the “edible birds’ nests” that are the delight of Chinese epicures. In the architecture of nearly all the Passerine birds, too, some salivary secretion seems to play an important part. By its aid they are enabled to moisten and bend the otherwise refractory twigs and straws and glue them to their place. Spiders’ webs also are employed with great advantage for the purpose last mentioned, but perhaps chiefly to attach fragments of moss and lichen so as to render the whole structure less obvious to the eye of the spoiler. The Tailor-bird deliberately spins a thread of cotton and therewith stitches together the edges of a pair of leaves to make a receptacle for its nest. Beautiful too is the felt fabricated of fur or hairs by the various species of Titmouse, while many birds ingeniously weave into a compact mass both animal and vegetable fibres, forming an admirable non-conducting medium which guards the eggs from the extremes of temperature outside. Such a structure may be open and cup-shaped, supported from below as that of the Chaffinch and Goldfinch, domed like that of the Wren and Bottle-Titmouse, slung hammock-wise as in the case of the Golden-crested Wren and the Orioles, or suspended by a single cord as with certain Grosbeaks and Hummingbirds. Under such circumstances it is even sometimes needful to balance the nest lest the weight of the growing young should destroy the equipoise and, precipitating them on the ground, dash the hopes of the parents, and compensation in such cases is applied by loading the opposite [9:3:772] side of the structure with lumps of earth. Certain Warblers (Aedon and Thamηobia) for some unascertained reason invariably lay a piece of snake’s slough in their nests—to repel, it has been suggested, marauding lizards who may thereby fear the neighbourhood of a deadly enemy. The clay-built edifices of the Swallow and Martin are known to everybody, and the Nuthatch plasters up the gaping mouth of its nest-hole till only a postern large enough for entrance and exit, but easy of defence, is left. In South America we have a family of birds (Eurnariidoe) which construct on the branching roots of the mangrove globular ovens, so to speak, of mud, wherein the eggs are laid and the young hatched. The Flamingo erects in the marshes it frequents a mound of earth some two feet in height, with a cavity atop, on which the hen, having oviposited, sits astride with dangling legs, and in that remarkable attitude is said to perform the duty of incubation. The females of the Hornbills, and perhaps of the Hoopoes, submit to incarceration during this interesting period, the males immuring them by a barrier of mud, leaving only a small window to admit air and food, which latter is assiduously brought to the prisoners.

But though in a general way the dictates of hereditary instinct are rigidly observed by birds, in many species a remarkable degree of elasticity is exhibited or the rule of habit is rudely broken. Thus the noble Falcon, whose ordinary eyry is on the beetling cliff, will for the convenience of procuring prey condescend to lay its eggs on the ground in a marsh, or appropriate the nest of some other bird in a tree. The Golden Eagle, too, remarkably adapts itself to circumstances, now rearing its young on a precipitous ledge, now on the arm of an ancient monarch of the forest and again on a treeless plain, making a humble home amid grass and herbage. Herons also shew the same versatility and will breed according to circumstances in an open fen, on sea-banks or (as is most usual) on lofty trees. Such changes are easy to understand. The instinct of finding food for the family is predominant, and where most food is there will the feeders be gathered together. This explains, in all likelihood, the associated bands of Ospreys or Fish-Hawks, which in North America breed (or used to breed) in large companies where sustenance is plentiful, though in the Old World the same species brooks not the society of aught but its mate. Birds there are of eminently social predilections. In Europe, excepting Sea-fowls—whose congregations are universal and known to all—we have perhaps but the Heron, the Fieldfare, and the Rook, which habitually flock during the breeding-season; but in other parts of the world many birds unite in company at that time, and in none possibly is this habit so strongly developed as in the Anis of the Neotropical Region, the Republican Swallow of North America, and the Sociable Grosbeak of South Africa, which last joins nest to nest until the tree is said to break down under the accumulated weight of the common edifice.^[115. There are not many works on nidification, for “Caliology” or the study of nests has hardly been deemed a distinct branch of the science. A good deal of instructive matter (not altogether free from error) will be found in Rennie’s Architecture of Birds (London: 1831), and there is Mr Wallace's most interesting dissertation, “A Theory of Birds’ Nests,” originally published in the Journal of Travel and Natural History (1868, p. 73), and reprinted in his Contributions to the Theory of Natural Selection (London: 1870). Mr Andrew Murray’s and the Duke of Argyll’s remarks on this essay are contained in the same volume of the Journal named (pp. 137 and 276).]

In the strongest contrast to these amiable qualities is the parasitic nature of the Cuckows of the Old World and the Cow-birds of the New, but this peculiarity of theirs is so well known that to dwell upon it would be needless. Enough to say that the egg of the parasite is introduced into the nest of the dupe, and after the necessary incubation by the fond fool of a foster-mother the interloper successfully counterfeits the heirs, who perish miserably, victims of his superior strength. The whole process has been often watched, but the reflective naturalist will pause to ask how such a state of things came about, and there is not much to satisfy his enquiry. Certain it is that some birds whether by mistake or stupidity do not unfrequently lay their eggs in the nests of others. It is within the knowledge of many that Pheasants’ eggs and Partridges’ eggs are often laid in the same nest, and it is within the knowledge of the writer that Gulls’ eggs have been found in the nests of Eider-Ducks, and vice versa; that a Redstart and a Pied Flycatcher will lay their eggs in the same convenient hole —the forest being rather deficient in such accommodation; that an Owl and a Duck will resort to the same nest-box, set up by a scheming woodsman for his own advantage; and that the Starling, which constantly dispossesses the Green Woodpecker, sometimes discovers that the rightful heir of the domicile has to be brought up by the intruding tenant In all such cases it is not possible to say which species is so constituted as to obtain the mastery, but it is not difficult to conceive that in the course of ages that which was driven from its home might thrive through the fostering of its young by the invader, and thus the abandonment of domestic habits and duties might become a direct gain to the evicted householder. This much granted, all the rest will follow easily enough, but it must be confessed that this is only a presumption, though a presumption which seems plausible if not likely.

EGGS.

The pains bestowed by such Birds (incomparably the most numerous of the Class), as build elaborate nests and the devices employed by those that, not doing so, display no little skill in providing for the preservation of their produce, invite some attention to the eggs which they lay. This attention will perhaps be more cheerfully given when we think how many naturalists, not merely ornithologists, have been first directed to the study of the animal kingdom by the spoils they have won in their early days of birds’ nesting. With some such men the fascination of this boyish pursuit has maintained its full force even in old age—a fact not so much to be wondered at when it is considered that hardly any branch of the practical study of Natural History brings the enquirer so closely in contact with many of its secrets. It is therefore eminently pardonable for the victims of this devotion to dignify their passion by the learned name of “ Oologï,” and to bespeak for it the claims of a science. Yet the present writer—once an ardent follower of the practice of birds’-nesting, and still on occasion warming to its pleasures—must confess to a certain amount of disappointment as to the benefits it was expected to confer on Systematic Ornithology, though he yields to none in his high estimate of its utility in acquainting the learner with the most interesting details of bird-life—without a knowledge of which nearly all systematic study is but work that may as well be done in a library, a museum, or a dissecting-room, and is incapable of conveying information to the learner concerning the why and the wherefore of such or such modifications and adaptations of structure. To some—and especially to those who are only anatomists— this statement may seem preposterous, but it is in truth no such thing. What engineer can be said to understand his business if he knows not the purpose to which the machines he makes are to be applied and is unacquainted with their mode of working 1 We may investigate thoroughly the organs of any animal, we may trace them from the earliest moment in which they become defined, and [9:3:773] watch them as they develop to maturity, we may comprehend the way in which every part of a complicated structure is successively built up, but if we take not the trouble to know their effect on the economy of the creature we as naturalists have done but half our task and abandon our labour when the fulness of reward is coming upon us. The field-naturalist, properly instructed, crowns the work of the comparative anatomist and the physiologist, though without the necessary education he is little more than an empiric, even should he possess the trained cunning of the savage on whose knowledge of the habits of wild animals depends his chance of procuring a meal.

Perhaps the greatest scientific triumph of oologists lies in their having fully appreciated the intimate alliance of the Limicoloe (the great group of Snipes and Plovers) with the Gavioe (the Gulls, Terns, and other birds more distantly connected with them) before it was recognized by any professed taxonomist,—L’Herminier, whose researches have been much overlooked, excepted; though to such an one was given the privilege of placing that affinity beyond cavil (Huxley, Proc. Zool. Soc. 1867, pp. 426, 456-458; cf. Ibis, 1868, p. 92). In like manner it is believed that oologists first saw the need of separating from the true Passeres several groups of birds that had for many years been unhesitatingly associated with that very uniform assemblage. Diffidence as to their own capacity for meddling with matters of systematic arrangement may possibly have been the cause which deterred the men who were content to brood over birds’ eggs from sooner asserting the validity of the views they held. Following the example furnished by the objects of their study, they seem to have chiefly sought to hide their offspring from the curious eye—and if such was their design it must be allowed to have been admirably successful. In enthusiastic zeal for the prosecution of their favourite researches, however, they have never yielded to, if they have not surpassed, any other class of naturalists. If a storm-swept island, only to be reached at the risk of life, held out the hope of some oological novelty there was the egg-collector (Faber, Isis, xx. pp. 633-688; Proctor, Naturalist, 1838, pp. 411, 412). Did another treasure demand his traversing a burning desert (Tristram, Ibis, 1859, p. 79) or sojourning for several winters within the wildest wastes of the Arctic Circle (Wolley, Ibis, 1859, pp. 69-76; 1861, pp. 92-106; Kennicott, Rep. Smithson. Inst. 1862, pp. 39, 40), he endured the necessary hardships to accomplish his end, and the possession to him of an empty shell of carbonate of lime,^[116. A small proportion of carbonate of magnesia and phosphate of 4ime and magnesia also enters into its composition.] stained or not (as the case might be) by a secretion of the villous membrane of the parent’s uterus, was to him a sufficient reward. Taxonomers, however, have probably been right in not attaching too great an importance to such systematic characters as can be deduced from the eggs of birds, but it would have been better had they not insisted so strongly as they have done on the infallibility of one or another set of characters, chosen by themselves. Oology taken alone proves to be a guide as misleading as any other arbitrary method of classification, but combined with the evidence afforded by due study of other particularities, whether superficial or deep-seated, it can scarcely fail in time to conduct us to an ornithological arrangement as nearly true to Nature as we may expect to achieve.

The first man of science who seems to have given any special thought to oology, was the celebrated Sir Thomas Browne, of Norwich, who already in 1681, when visited by John Evelyn (from whose diary we learn the fact), had assigned a place in his cabinet of rarities to a collection of birds’ eggs. The next we hear of is that Count of Marsigli who early in the eighteenth century explored, chiefly for this kind of investigation, the valley of the Danube—a region at that time, it is almost unnecessary to remark, utterly unknown to naturalists. But there is no need to catalogue the worthies of this study. As they approach our own day their number becomes far too great to tell, and if very recently it has seemed to dwindle the reason is probably at hand in the reflection that most of the greatest prizes have been won, while those that remain to reward the aspiring appear to be just now from one cause or another almost out of reach. Perhaps at the present time the Birds-of-Paradise and their allies form the only group of any recognized distinctiveness and extent of whose eggs we know absolutely nothing—though there are important isolated forms, such a3 Atrichia, Heterolocha, and others, concerning the eggs as well as the breeding habits of which our ignorance is absolute, and the species of many families that have hitherto defied the zeal of oologists are very numerous. These last, however, though including some common and some not very uncommon British birds, possess in a general way comparatively little interest, since, the eggs of their nearest allies being well known, we cannot expect much to follow from the discovery of the recluses, and it is only to the impassioned collector that the obtaining of such desiderata will afford much satisfaction.

The first thing which strikes the eye of one who beholds a large collection of egg-shells is the varied hues of the specimens. Hardly a shade known to the colourist is not exhibited by one or more, and some of these tints have their beauty enhanced by the glossy surface on which they are displayed, by their harmonious blending, or by the pleasing contrast of the pigments which form markings as often of the most irregular as of regular shape. But it would seem as though such markings, which a very small amount of observation will shew to have been deposited on the shell a short time before its exclusion, are primarily and normally circular, for hardly any egg that bears markings at all does not exhibit some spots of that form, but that in the progress of the eggs through that part of the oviduct in which the colouring matter is laid on many of them become smeared, blotched, or protracted in some particular direction. The circular spots thus betoken the deposition of the pigment while the egg is at rest, the blurred markings show its deposition while the egg is in motion, and this motion would seem often to be at once onward and rotatory, as indicated by the spiral markings not uncommonly observable in the eggs of some Birds-of-prey and others—the larger end of the egg (when the ends differ in form) making way for the smaller.^[117. That the larger end is protruded first was found on actual experiment by Mr Bartlett, Superintendent of the Gardens of the Zoological Society, to be the case commonly, but as an accident the position may be sometimes reversed, and this will most likely account for the occasional deposition of markings on the smaller instead of the larger end as not un frequently shown in eggs of the Sparrow-hawk (Accipiter ηisus}. The head of the chick is always formed at the larger end.] At the same time the eggs of a great number of birds bear, beside these last and superimposed markings, more deeply-seated stains, generally of a paler and often of an altogether different hue, and these are evidently due to some earlier dyeing process. The peculiar tint of the ground-colour, though commonly superficial, if not actually congenital with the formation of the shell, would appear to be suffused soon after. The depth of colouring whether original or supervening is obviously dependent in a great measure on the constitution or bodily condition of the parent. If a bird, bearing in its oviduct a fully-formed egg, be captured, that egg will speedily be laid under any circumstances of inconvenience to which its producer shall be subjected, but such an egg is usually deficient in coloration—fright and [9:3:774] captivity having arrested the natural secretions. In like manner over excitement or debility of the organs, the consequence of ill health, give rise to much and often very curious abnormality. It is commonly believed that the older a bird is the more intensely coloured will be its eggs, and to some extent this belief appears to be true. Certain Ealconidoe, which ordinarily lay very brilliantly-tinted eggs, and are therefore good tests, seem when young unable to secrete so much colouring-matter as they do when older, and season after season the dyes become deeper, but there is reason to think that when the bird has attained its full vigour improvement stops, and a few years later the intensity of hue begins to decline. It would be well if we had more evidence, however, in support of this opinion, which is chiefly based on a series of eggs of one species—the Golden Eagle (Aquila chrysaetus), in the writer’s possession, among which are some believed on good grounds to have been the produce in the course of about twelve years of one and the same female. The amount of colouring-matter secreted and deposited seems notwithstanding to be generally a pretty constant quantity—allowance being made for individual constitution; but it often happens—especially in birds that lay only two eggs—that nearly all the dye will be deposited on one of these, leaving the other colourless; it seems, however, to be a matter of inconstancy which of the two is first developed. Thus of two pairs of Golden Eagles’ eggs also in the possession of the writer, one specimen of each pair is nearly white while the other is deeply coloured, and it is known that in one case the white egg was laid first and in the other the coloured one. When birds lay many mottled, and a fortiori plain, eggs, there is generally less difference in their colouring, and though no two can hardly ever be said to be really alike, yet the family resemblance between them all is obvious to the practised eye. It would seem however to be a peculiarity with some species—and the Tree-Sparrow (Passer· montanus) which lays five or six eggs may be taken as a striking example— that one egg should always differ remarkably from the rest of the clutch. In addition to what has been said above as to the deposition of colour in circular spots indicating a pause in the progress of the egg through one part of the oviduct, it may be observed that the cessation of motion at that time is equally shewn by the clearly defined hair-lines or vermiculations seen in many eggs, and in none more commonly met with than in those of the Buntings (Ember- izidoe). Such markings must not only have been deposited while the egg was at rest, but it must have remained motionless until the pigment was completely set, or blurred instead of sharp edges would have been the result.^[118. The principal oological works with coloured figures are the following:—Thienemann, Fοrtpflαηzιιηgsgeschichte der gesummten Vögel (4to, Leipzig: 1845); Lefèvre, Atlas des oeufs des oiseaux d'Europe (8vo, Paris: 1845); Hewitson, Coloured Illustrations of the Eggs of British Birds (8vo,Ed. 3, London: 1856); Brewer, North American Oology (4to, Washington: 1859); Taczanowski, Oologia Ptakow Pclskich (8vo, Warszawa: 1862); Bädeker, Die Eier der Europäischen Vögel (fol. Leipzig: 1863); Wolley, Ootheca Wolleyana (8vo, London: 1864)—some of which have never been completed; but a great number of rare eggs are also figured in various journals, as the Proceedings of the Zoological Society, Naumannia, the Journal für Ornithologie, and The His.]

The composition of this pigment has long excited much curiosity, and it has been commonly and rather crudely ascribed to secretions of the blood or bile,^[119. % Cf. Wilke, Naumannia, 1858, pp. 393-397, and C. Leconte, Revue et Magasin de Zoologie, 1860, pp. 199-205.] but very recently unexpected light has been shed upon the subject by the researches of Mr Sorby (Proc. Zool. Soc. 1875, p. 351), who, using the method of spectrum-analysis, has now ascertained the existence of seven well-marked substances in the colouring-matter of eggs, to the admixture of which in certain proportions all their tints are due. These he names

Oorhodeine, Oocyan, Banded Oocyan, Yellow Ooxanthine, Rufous Ooxanthine, a substance, giving narrow absorptionbands in the red, the true colour of which he has not yet been able to decide, and lastly Lichenoxanthine. It would be out of place here to particularize their chemical properties, and it is enough to say that they are closely connected either with haemoglobin or bile-pigments, and in many respects resemble the latter more than do any other group of colouring-matters, but do not actually agree with them. The first is perhaps the most important of all the seven, because it occurs more or less in the shells of so great a number of eggs that its entire absence is exceptional, and it is of a very permanent character, its general colour being of a peculiar brown-red. The second and third seem when pure to be of a very fine blue, but the spectrum of the former shows no detached bands, while that of the latter has a well-marked detached absorbent-band near the red end, though the two are closely related since they yield the same product when oxidized. The fourth and fifth substances supply a bright yellow or reddish-yellow hue, and the former is particularly characteristic of eggs of the Emeus (Dromoeus), giving rise when mixed with oocyan to the fine malachite-green which they possess, while the latter has only been met with in those of the Tinamous (Tinamidoe), in which it should be mentioned that oorhodeine has not been found, or perhaps in those of a Cassowary (Casitamus), and when mixed with oocyan produces a peculiar lead-colour. The sixth substance, as before stated, has not yet been sufficiently determined, but it would seem in combination with others to give them an abnormally browner tint; and the seventh appears to be identical with one which occurs in greater or less amount in almost all classes of plants, but is more especially abundant in and characteristic of lichens and fungi. There is a possibility however of this last being in part if not wholly due to the growth of minute fungi, though Mr Sorby believes that some such substance really is a normal constituent of the shell of eggs having a peculiar brick-red colour. That gentleman is further inclined to think that oorhodeine is in some way or other closely related to cruentine, being probably derived from the red colouring-matter of the blood by some unknown process of secretion, and likewise that there is some chemical relation between the oocyans and the bile.

The grain of the egg-shell offers characters that deserve far more consideration than they have received until lately, when the attention of Herr von Nathusius having been directed to the subject by some investigations carried on by Dr Landois^[120. Zeitschr. für wissensch. Zoologie, xv. pp. 1-31,] and Herr Rudolf Blasius,^[121. Op. cit. xvii. pp. 480-524.] he has brought out a series of remarkable papers^[122.

A summary of these will be found in Journ. für Ornith. 1871, pp. 241-260, and the subject has been continued in the same periodical for 1872, pp. 321-332, and 1874, pp. 1-26.] in which he has arrived at the conclusion that a well-defined type of shell-structure belongs to certain families of birds, and is easily recognized under the microscope. In some cases, as in the eggs of certain Swans and Geese (Cygnus olor and C. musicus, Anser cinereus and A. segetum) even specific differences are apparent. The bearing of these researches on classification generally is of considerable importance and must be taken into account by all future taxonomers. Here we cannot enter into details, it must suffice to remark that the grain of the shell is sometimes so fine that the surface is glossy, and this is the case with a large number of Pi- camoe, where it is also quite colourless and the contents of their eggs seen through the semi-transparent shell give an [9:3:775] opalescence of great beauty; but among the Tinamous {Tinamidoe) colour is invariably present and their opaque eggs present the appearance of more or less globular balls of highly-burnished metal or glazed porcelain. Most birds lay eggs with a smooth shell, such as nearly all the Gavioe, Limicoloe, and Passeres, and in some groups, as with the normal Gallinoe, this seems to be enamelled or much polished, but it is still very different from the brilliant surface of those just mentioned, and nothing like a definite line can be drawn between their structure and that in which the substance is dull and uniform, as among the Alxidoe and the Accipitres. In many of the Ratitoe the surface is granulated and pitted in an extraordinary manner,^[123. It is curious that Ostriches’ eggs from North Africa are to be readily, distinguished from those from the Cape of Good Hope by their smooth ivory-like surface, without any punctures, whereas southern specimens are rough as though pock-marked {Ibis, 1860, p. 74), yet no difference that can be deemed specific has as yet been established between the birds of the north and of the south.] and in a less degree the same feature is observable in the eggs of some other birds, as the Storks {Ciconiidoef Many Water-fowls, and particularly the Ducks {Anatidoe), lay eggs with a greasy or oleaginous exterior, as the collector who wishes to inscribe his specimens with marks of their identity often finds to his inconvenience; but there are other eggs, as those of the Anis {Crotophaga), the Grebes {Podicipedidoe), and all of the Steganopodes, except Phaeton, which are more or less covered with a cretaceous film, often of considerable thickness and varied by calcareous protuberances.

In form eggs vary very much, and this is sometimes observable in examples not only of the same species but even from the same mother, yet a certain amount of resemblance ,is usually to be traced according to the natural group to 'which the parents belong. Those of the Owls {Strigidoe) .and of some of the Picarioe — especially those which lay the glossy eggs above spoken of—are often apparently spherical, though it is probable that if tested mathematically none would be found truly so—indeed it may be asserted that few eggs are strictly symmetrical, however nearly they may seem so, one side bulging out, though very slightly, more than the other. The really oval form, with which we are most familiar, needs no remark, but th13 is capable of infinite variety caused by the relative position and proportion of the major and minor axes. In nearly all the Limicoloe and some of the Alcidoe the egg attenuates very rapidly towards the smaller end, sometimes in a slightly convex curve, sometimes without perceptible curvature, and occasionally in a sensibly concave curve. The eggs having this pyriform shape are mostly those of birds which invariably lay four in a nest, and therein they lie with their points almost meeting in the centre and thus occupying as little space as possible and more easily covered by the brooding parent. Other eggs as those of the Sand-Grouse {Ptcrocleidoe) are elongated and almost cylindrical for a considerable part of their length terminating at each end obtusely, while eggs of the Grebes {Podicipedidoe) which also have both ends nearly alike but pointed, are so wide in the middle as to present a biconical appearance.^[124. A great deal of valuable information on this and other kindred subjects is given by Des Murs, Traité gênerai <TOοlοgic ornithologique (8vo, Paris: 1860).]

The size of eggs is generally but not at all constantly in proportion to that of the parent. The Guillemot {Alca trode) and the Raven {Corvus corax) are themselves of about equal size; their eggs vary as ten to one. The Snipe {Scolopax gallinago) and the Blackbird {Turdus merula) differ but slightly in weight, their eggs remarkably. The eggs of the Guillemot are as big as those of an Eagle; and those of the Snipe equal in size the eggs of a Partridge {Perdix cinerea). Mr Hewitson, from whom these instances are taken, remarks :—“The reason of this great disparity is, however, obvious; the eggs of all those birds which quit the nest soon after they are hatched, and which are consequently more fully developed at their birth, are very large.”^[125. Hewitson, op. cit. Introd. p. x.] It must bs added, though, that the number of eggs to be covered at one time seems also to have some relation to their size, and this offers a further explanation of the fact just mentioned with regard to the Snipe and the Partridge —the former being one of those birds which are constant in producing four, and the latter often laying as many as a dozen—for the chicks of each run as soon as they release themselves from the shell.

Incubation is performed, as is well known, by the female of nearly all Birds, but with most of the Passeres and many others the male seems to share her tedious duties, and among the Ratitoe, apparently without exception, the cock takes that office wholly on himself. There are a few groups or perhaps species in which the same practice is suspected to obtain—certain of the Limicoloe for instance, the Godwits {Limosa), the Phalaropes {Phalaroprus), and the Dotterel {Eudromias morinellus)— and in these it is to be remarked that the hen is larger and more brightly coloured than her mate. Owing to the unfortunate neglect of those who have the opportunity of making the needful observations the period of Incubation has been ascertained in comparatively few birds, and it is here possible to deal with that subject only in the most vague and general language. It may be asserted that most of the smaller Passeres of Europe hatch their young in about thirteen days, but in a few species the term is believed to be shortened to ten or eleven days, while in the largest of that Order, the Raven, it is lengthened to some twenty-one days. This also is the period which the Barndoor-fowl ordinarily takes, but the Pheasant, though so very nearly allied, takes about twentyeight. Most Water-birds, so far as is known, and the smaller Birds-of-prey seem to require as long a time, but in the Swan incubation is protracted to six weeks. The temperature of the air is commonly credited with having something to do either in hastening or retarding exclusion from the egg, but to what extent, or even whether justly so or not, seems in the absence of precise experiments to be doubtful. Certain birds occasionally begin brooding as soon as the first egg is laid,^[126. This seems to be very often the case with the Owls, but if the writer’s observation is not mistaken the habit is not constant even with the same individual bird.] and this plan unquestionably has its advantages, since the offspring being of different ages thereby become less of a burthen on the parents which have to minister to their wants, while the fostering warmth of the earlier chicks can hardly fail to aid the development of those which are unhatched, during the absence of father and mother in search of food; but most birds, and it need scarcely be said, all those the young of which run from their birth, await the completion of the clutch before sitting is begun. The care bestowed, by almost every species, on the infant-brood, is proverbial, and there is hardly any extremity of danger which one at least of the anxious parents will not incur to ward off injury from their progeny.

MOULT.

The more or less protracted business of reproduction being ended there forthwith follows in the case of nearly all Birds a process of the most vital consequence to them. This is the Moult or shedding of their old and often weather-beaten feathers to be replaced by an entirely new suit. It is probably the severest strain to which bird-life is exposed, and, to judge from its effects on our domesticated pets, produces a greater mortality than an occasional want [9:3:776] of proper or even any food does. Important however as are its bearings on every individual of the whole Class, the subject is one which has been sadly neglected by ornithological writers and, with one exception,^[127. This is a valuable paper by Herr Meves, of Stockholm {(Εfνers. K. Vet. Αkαd. Fiirhaηdl. 1854, p. 258), of which a German translation with some additions by the author may be found in Jοwm. für Ornith. 1855, pp. 230-238.] we are not aware of any connected series of observations on Moult within the whole range of their literature. The structure and mode of growth of feathers has been very well studied and described by several investigators, and must be especially treated in introducing the subject of Pterylography—or the disposition of the various plumed patches on the bird’s body—which, having been found to be a most useful auxiliary in Classification, is deferred until that comes to be discussed under the article “Ornithology.” For the present we have briefly to consider the different phases which the process of Moulting offers.

As a general rule all Birds are subject to an annual Moult, and this as above stated, commonly begins immediately on the close of the breeding-season, but, as will be explained further on, there arc some which undergo in addition a second or even a third partial change of plumage, and it is possible that there may be others still more exceptional, our information respecting these, however, is too meagre to make it worth while saying anything here about them. It must be acknowledged that with regard to the great majority of form3 we can only judge by analogy, and though it may well be that some interesting deviations from the general rule exist of which we are altogether ignorant, yet when we consider that the Ratitoe, so far as observed, moult exactly in the same manner as other birds,^[128. For the knowledge of this fact the write? is indebted to the vast experience of Mr Bartlett.] the uniformity of the annual change may be almost taken for granted.

It is not intended here to describe the way in which a feather dies and a new one succeeds it, nor need we compare the process of moulting with the analogous shedding of the hair in Mammals or of the skin in Reptiles. Enough for our present purpose to see that such renovation is required in Birds, which nearly all have to depend upon their quills for the means of locomotion and hence of livelihood. It is easy to understand that durable as are the flight-feathers, they do not last for ever and are besides very subject to accidental breakage, the consequence of which would be the crippling of the bird. It is obviously to provide against what in most cases would be such a disaster as this last that we find the remiges, or quill-feathers of the wings, to be always shed in pairs. They drop out not indeed absolutely at the same moment, though this sometimes seems to happen, but within a few days of each other, and, equilibrium being thus preserved, the power of flight is but slightly deteriorated by their temporary loss. The same mιy be observed in a less degree, since there is less need of regularity, with the rest of the plumage, as a little attention to any tame bird will show, and the new feathers grow at an almost equal rate. In the young of most species the original quills are not shed during the first year, nor in the young of many does there seem to be an entire moult during that time, but in the typical Gallinoe, which are able to fly at a very early age, often before they are one-third grown, the original quills, being proportioned to the duties required of them, are shed before the bird has attained its full size and are succeeded by others that serve it when it has reached maturity. In the Duck-tribe (Anatidoe), however, we have a very singular exception to what has been above stated. Most of these birds shed their quillfeathers all at once, and become absolutely incapable of flight for a season,^[129. One species, Μicrορterus cinereus, seems never to regain the power of flight thus lost. Cf. Cunningham, Proc. Zool. Soc. 1871, p. 262.] during which time they generally seek the shelter of thick, aquatic herbage, and it is further to be particularly remarked that the males of most of two sections of the family (Anatinoe and Fuligulinoe) at the same period lose the brilliantly-coloured plumage which commonly distinguishes them and “go into eclipse,” as Waterton happily said, putting on for several weeks a dingy garb much resembling that of the other sex, to resume their gay attire only when, their new quills being grown, it can be safely flaunted in the open air. Here we have the first instances of Additional Moult to be mentioned. Another is not less interesting, though ornithologists must confess with shame that they have not sufficiently investigated it. This 13 that of the Ptarmigan (Lagopus mutus), both sexes of which not only moult after the breeding-season is over into a grey suit, and then again as autumn passes away into their snowy winter-clothing, but, divesting themselves of this last in spring, then put on each a third and most distinctive dress—these changes, however, do not extend to the quills either of the wings or tail.^[130. Macgillivray {Brit. Birds, i. p. 196, London: 1837; and Nat. Hist, of Deeside, p. 405, London: 1855) thought there were four moults in this species, but that seems to be one too many. Herr Meves (loc. cit.) and the Abbé Caire (Rev. Zook 1854, p. 494) independently made the discovery of the Triple Moult, and almost simultaneously announced it. Cf. G∖ogeτ, Joum. für Orn. 1856, p. 461.] J

The number of Birds which undergo a more or less entire Double Moult is very considerable, and the peculiarity is not always characteristic of families or even, unless in a restricted sense, of genera. Thus while the Garden-Warbler (Sylvia salicaria) is said to moult twice in the year the Blackcap (S. atricapilla) does so but once. The same may be said of the Embemzidoe, in which family both practices seem to obtain, but on the other hand the distinction in this respect between the Larks (Alaudidoe) and the Pipits (Anthinoe), belonging to the family Motacillidoe, appears, so far as our knowledge goes, to be invariable, though the habits and general appearance of both groups are so much alike— the Alaudidoe moulting but once and the Anthinoe, conforming to the practice of the normal Motacillidoe (Motacillinoe), twice a year—the quills, be it understood, excepted. But it would be impossible here to give more than these few examples, and indeed we scarcely know anything of the subject outside of groups belonging to the Northern hemisphere.^[131. The fullest list as yet published is that of Herr Meves (ut supra), but it is not entirely free frem error.]

In a large number of species the Additional Moult is very partial, being often limited to certain portions of the plumage, and it is yet an unsolved problem how far some of the changes to be observed are due to actual Moult and how far to the alteration of colour in the feathers themselves, as also the way by which this alteration of colour is produced, whether, as certainly happens in many instances, by the dropping off of the “barbicels ’’—the fine filaments that fringe the “barbicels” which are arranged on the upper surface of each “barb” composing the web of the feather —or in some other manner. With either of these last considerations we need not now concern ourselves. It is unquestionable that there are innumerable species of birds, the males at least of which put forth in spring decorative plumes unknown at any other season, and it would appear that in the majority of them the feathers which before clothed the parts whence the newly-donned ornaments grow are doffed to make room for these paraphernalia of marriage.

The subject of Additional Moult is thus intimately connected with the seasonal adornment of Birds, and as that [9:3:777] properly belongs to a branch of the great question of Natural Selection, its further consideration must here be put off until that is more fully treated, together with what are known as the “Laws of Plumage,” the reader being meanwhile referred to those excellent chapters in which Mr Darwin^[132. The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex, chaps, xiiι.- xvi. London: 1871. Index to the Genera and Larger Groups of Birds named. [table]] has treated the matter with his usual perspicuity, though even he has far from exhausted its varied points of interest.

It remains to be remarked that though the annual Moult commonly takes place so soon as the breeding-season is over, there are plenty of cases where we find the change delayed to a later period of the year. This is so with the Swallow {Hirundo rustica), which has long been known to moult in midwinter, and it is generally the way with all the Diurnal Birds-of-prey. But unquestionably most birds accomplish the change much earlier, and before they leave their breeding-quarters for their winter-haunts, thereby starting on one of their great annual journeys with all the external machinery of flight renewed and in the best condition for escaping its attendant perils.
