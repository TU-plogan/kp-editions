Major Smyth says in his Survey Report of the 24 Pargands District (1857):— “The natives call it ‘ Chânak,’ from the circumstance of Job Charnock, the founder of Calcutta, having erected a bungalow and established a small bâzâr there [in 1689]. Troops were first stationed there in 1772, from which time it has acquired the name of Barrackpur. The cantonment is situated on the left bank of the Hùgli; it has also a large bâzar and several large tanks, and also a parade ground.

There are usually four regiments of Native infantry cantoned in the lines. To the south of the cantonment is situated the park, created by the taste and public spirit of Lord Wellesley. Within the park is situated the Government House, a noble-looking building, commenced by Lord Minto, and enlarged into its present state by the Marquis of Hastings. The park is beautifully laid out, and contains a small menagerie.” Its most interesting feature is now Lady Canning’s tomb. Within the last few years commodious two-storied brick barracks have been constructed for the British troops, and have materially added to the health and comfort of the soldiers. The military bâzàr is situated a short distance from the Sepoy lines, and is carefully supervised by the authorities. The military force stationed in the cantonment, on the 1st March 1873, was as follows :—English troops, 18 officers, and 395 noncommissioned officers and rank and file; Native, 12 English and 21 Native officers, with 877 non-commissioned officers and men; total of all ranks, European and Native, 1323.

Barrackpur played an important part in the two Sepoy mutinies of 1824 and 1857, but the details of these belong to the general history of British rule in India.
