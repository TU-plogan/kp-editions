BARCLAY DE TOLLY, Michael, a Russian prince and general, highly distinguished in the wars with Napoleon, was born in Livonia in 1759. He was a descendant of the old Scotch family of Barclay, a branch of whom had settled in Russia in the 17th century. He was adopted by General Vermoulen, and entered a Russian cuirassier regiment when very young. In 1788 and 1789 he served against the Turks, and in the following years against the Swedes and Poles, In 1806, when Russia took up arms against Napoleon, he commanded the advanced guard at the battle of Pultusk. At Eylau he lost an arm, and was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-general. In 1808 he commanded against the Swedes, and in 1809 by a rapid and daring march for two days over the ice he surprised and seized Umeo. In 1810 he was made minister of war, and retained the post till 1813. There was very keen opposition to the appointment of a foreigner as commander-in-chief, and after the defeat of Smolensk, the outcry was so great that he resigned his office and took a subordinate place under the veteran Kutusoff. On the death of the latter he was reappointed to the supreme command, and fought at the battles of Bautzen, Dresden, and Leipsic. He was unable to bring up his forcée in time for the battle of Waterloo, but marched into France and took part in the occupation of Paris. He was rewarded for his services by being made prince and field-marshal. He died in 1818 at Insterburg, in Prussia, while on his way to the Bohemian baths.
