BIRDS RECENTLY EXTIRPATED.

From the consideration of Fossil Birds we are naturally led to treat of those which have been extirpated in modern times, and are made known to us by evidence of various kinds, and more or less old. The most remarkable of these is the Dodo {Didus ineptus), which, on the discovery of Mauritius by the Portuguese under Mascaregnas in the beginning of the 16 th century, was found to inhabit that island. Voyagers have vied with each other in describing or depicting its uncouth appearance, and its name has almost passed into a byword expressive of all that is effete. Clumsy, flightless, and defenceless, it soon succumbed, not so much to the human invaders of its realm as to the domestic beasts which accompanied them, and there gaining their liberty, unchecked by much of the wholesome discipline of nature, ran riot, to the utter destruction (as will be seen) of no inconsiderable portion of the Mauritian fauna. The latest known testimony of the Dodo’s existence is furnished by the copy of a journal (now in the British Museum) kept by one Benjamin Harry, mate of the ship “Berkley Castle,” which shews that it survived until July 1681. It had its life most likely sometime longer, but of this there is no evidence forthcoming. For a century and a half all that was known of it was derived from the quaint and sometimes questionable accounts of early voyagers; certain pictures, mostly by Dutch artists—for the bird was not unfrequently sent alive to Europe, and the traffic of the East Indies w as then chiefly in the hands of the Netherlanders—which pictures, however grotesque, were doubtless for the most part faithful portraits; and a few scattered relics—a foot in the British Museum, a head and foot at Oxford, a perfect skull at Copenhagen, and a fragmentary one at Prague. Still these (or indeed the Danish specimen alone) were enough to enable Professor Reinhardt to determine the affinity of the lost bird to the Pigeons, an alliance not before surmised, but one which scarcely anybody now disputes. In 1866, however, Mr George Clark of Mauritius discovered in the peat of a pool (the Mare aux Songes) in that island an abundance of Dodos’ bones {Ibis, 1866, p. 141); and these, when transmitted to Europe, informed naturalists as to nearly every part of its osseous structure, which was soon after described in detail by Professor Owen {Trans. Zool. Soc.. vi. p. 49).

But the Dodo is not the only member of its family that has vanished. The little island which has successively borne the name of Mascaregnas, England’s Forest, Bourbon, and Réunion, and lies to the southward of Mauritius, had also an allied Bird, now dead and gone. Of this not a relic has been handled by any naturalist. The latest description of it, by Du Bois in 1674, is meagre in the extreme, and though two figures—one by Bontekoe {circa 1646), and another by Pierre Witthoos {ob. 1693) have been thought to represent it {Trans. Zool. Soc. vi. p. 373, plate 62), their identification is but conjectural. Yet the existence of such a bird is indubitable.

Far to the eastward of these two sister islands lies a third—Rodriguez. Here there formerly lived another Didine bird, sufficiently distinct from the Dodo of Mauri tius to form a genus of its own— Pezophaps solitarius, the [9:3:733] Solitaire of Léguât, a Huguenot exile who, passing some time in 1691-93 on that island, has left, with a very inferior figure, a charmingly naive account of its appearance and habits, the general truth of which has been amply substantiated by Mr Edward Newton’s discovery in large numbers of its bones {Phil. Trans. 1869, p. 327); and a nearly complete skeleton of either sex may be seen in the museum of the University of Cambridge, by the side of the most perfect specimen existing of that of its bulkier relative, the Mauritian Dodo.

Nor does this group of Didine birds contain all the lost forms of the Mascarene islands. From Mauritius have disappeared at least two species of Parrot, a Dove, a large Coot, and a second Ralline bird, abnormal, flightless, and long-billed— Aphanapteryx. A painting of this last was found by Von Frauenfeld in the emperor’s library at Vienna, and some of its bones, rescued by Mr Edward Newton from the peat of the Mare aux Songes, have been fully described by Μ. A. Milne-Edwards. Remains of the Coot and one of the extinct Parrots were found also in the same spot, while skins of the other Parrot and of the Dove still exist in a few museums. Réunion, also, once had other birds now lost, and so had Rodriguez. In the former, a somewhat abnormal Starling {Fregilupus) existed until some forty years ago {Proc. Zool. Soc. 1874, p. 474), and its skin and skeleton are among the treasures of three or four museums. Perhaps, also, there were other Ralline birds, but the evidence on this head is inconclusive. In Rodriguez, the greater part of its original avifauna has vanished. There was a small but peculiar Owl {Athene murivora'), a big Parrot {Necropsittacus rodericanus^), a Dove {Erythroena? sp. ign.), a large brevipennate Heron {Ardea megacephala), and a singular Rail {Miserythrus leguati)— in some respects allied to the Mauritian Aphanapteryx— besides other birds of which we know from old voyagers,^[1. Proc. Zool. Soc. 1875, pp. 39-42.] though their remains have not yet been determined (as those of the species above mentioned have been) from the numerous caverns of the island. A second Parrot, or rather Parrakeet {Palceornis exsuΓ), still exists, but in very small numbers, and the unique specimen known was obtained in the year 1871.

With the examples of these Mascarene Islands before us, it is not without reason that we suppose a like fate to have befallen many of the feathered inhabitants of other places exposed to similar ravages. We cannot read the accounts not merely of the earliest voyages to the Antilles, but even of those performed within the last hundred years, without being aware that the writers met with many Birds which are not now known to inhabit them. These lost species, there is some ground for believing, were mainly; if not wholly, peculiar to the locality, and after having made good their existence, maybe, for ages, fell easy and helpless victims to the forces which European civilization brought into play. Chief among these forces was fire. In all countries and at all times it has been the habit of colonists to burn the woods surrounding their settlements — partly to clear the ground for future crops, and partly (in tropical climates especially) to promote the salubrity of their stations. When fire was set to the forest and bush of a small island, the whole of which could be burnt at once, the disastrous effect on its fauna can easily be conceived. Even the animals which happened to escape the conflagration itself would speedily starve, owing to the at least temporary destruction of the native flora whence, either directly or indirectly, they derived their wonted sustenance. Thus in certain of the Virgin Islands the “dead” shells of many species of terrestrial Gasteropods are everywhere found in astounding numbers, while not a living individual of several of the species has ever been met with by the conchologists [9:3:734] of our day. The only assignable cause of the extinction of these creatures lies in the fact that these islands are known to have been laid waste by fire. The shells have resisted destruction but how many more animals must have perished without leaving a trace of their existence 1 Even at the present time, few parts of the world so overrun by people of European descent are from a naturalist’s point of view so little known as the West-India Islands. Still less is known of their state a century ago; and it would be a long and wearisome task to collect from old voyages the meagre, scattered, and often inaccurate information they contain as to the zoology of these islands. One example may, perhaps, be sufficient. Ledru accompanied an expedition sent out in 1796 by the French Government to the West Indies. In his work he gives a list of the birds he found in the islands of St Thomas and St Croix (Voyage, aux Isles de Tenerife, dec., Paris, 1810, ii. p. 29). He enumerates fourteen kinds of birds as having occurred to him then. Of these there is now no trace of eight of the number; and, if he is to be believed, it must be supposed that within fifty or sixty years of his having been assured of their existence, they have become extinct^[2. One of the survivors (a Parrakeet, Conurus xantholaεmus) was a few years ago restricted to a single hill-top in St Thomas, and so reduced in numbers that the present writer was ridiculed by many of the inhabitants for believing that such a bird ever existed in the island. Found, however, it was at last, but it must be regarded as verging upon extinction.] And yet the period just mentioned was long subsequent to that in which the primeval woods of the islands were burnt. What, then, must not have been the changes which tho forest-fires produced?

If this be not enough we may cite the case of the French islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique, in which, according to Μ. Guyon (Comptes Rendus, lxiii. p. 589), there were once found six species of Psittaci, all now exterminated; and it may possibly be that the Maccaws stated by Mr Gosse (B. Jamaica, p. 260) and Mr Marsh (Proc. Acad. N^.S. Philad. 1863, p. 283) to have formerly frequented certain parts of Jamaica, but not apparently noticed there for some twenty-five or thirty years, have fallen victims to colonization and its consequences.

Mention has already been made of the Gare-fowl (Alca impennis), whose bones have been found in the kitchen-middens of Denmark, and more lately in similar deposits in Caithness. This species, nearly allied to our common Razor-bill (A. torda), but flightless and about twice as big, seems to have become extinct since 1844, in which year the last two examples known to have lived were taken on a rocky islet—one of a group called Fuglaskér, or Fowlskerries, off the south-west point of [Iceland. Ten years before, one had been caught alive at the entrance of Waterford harbour; and in 1821 or 1822 one was taken near St Hilda, to which lonely island, as appears from old authors, the bird had been accustomed to resort in the breeding season. In 1812 a pair were killed at Papa-Westray, which was also a breeding station of the species, and the stuffed skin of one of them is preserved in the British Museum, while that of the Waterford specimen may be seen in the museum of Trinity College, Dublin. In the Faeroes the species was formerly common, but it certainly ceased from appearing there about the beginning of the present century. In the Iceland seas there are three localities called after the bird’s name, but on only one of them has it been observed for many years, having probably been as long extirpated in the rest as in the Faeroes. On the locality where it continued latest, there is ample evidence to show that it once was plentiful. There was a large skerry—the Geirfuglaskér proper—on which, in 1813, the crew of a Faeroese vessel made a descent and slaughtered a large number of Gare-fowls; but this, like the rest of the group, was a place very difficult of access, and, in 1821, Faber, the well-known faunist of Iceland, failed to land upon it, though some of his companions reached the Geirfugladrângr, a smaller islet lying further to seaward. In 1830 the large skerry, through a submarine volcanic eruption, disappeared beneath the λvaves, and immediately after a colony of Gare-fowls was discovered on another rock lying nearer the mainland, and known as Eldey.^[3. Whether on the subsidence of the large skerry another portion of the birds which frequented it colonized the outermost islet is not known, for this spot does not seem to have been visited by any human being since Faber’s time, more than fifty years ago.] In the course of the next fourteen years, not fewer probably than sixty birds were killed on this newly-chosen station, and a nearly corresponding number of eggs were brought off; but the colony gradually dwindled until, as above said, in 1844 the last two were taken (Ibis, 1861, p. 374).

In Greenland, for the last three hundred years, the Garefowl has only been known as an occasional straggler, but it would appear that in 1574 a party of Icelanders found it so plentiful at a spot on the east coast—since identified [9:3:735] with DanelΓs or Graah’s Islands—that they loaded one of their boats with their captives. All recent explorations of this inhospitable coast prove the utter vanity of the notion that the Gare-fowl is able there to find an asylum.

But it was in the seas of Newfoundland that this species, known to the settlers and fishermen as the “Penguin,”— a corruption of the words “pin-wing,”—was most abundant, as a reference to Hakluyt’s and similar collections of voyages will prove. In 1536, or forty years after the discovery of the country, we find an island taking its name from the bird, and others are even now so called. English and French mariners alike resorted to these spots, driving the helpless and hapless birds on sails or planks into a boat, “as many as shall lade her,” and salting them for provision. The French crews, indeed, trusted so much to this supply of victual, as to take, it is said, but “small store of flesh with them.” This practice, we learn from Cartwright (Journal, <fcc., iii. p. 55), was carried on even in 1785, and he then foresaw the speedy extirpation of the birds, which at that time had only one island left to breed upon. In 1819, Anspach reported their entire disappearance, but it is possible that some few yet lingered. On Funk Island, their last resort, rude enclosures of stones are, or recently were, still to be seen, in which the “Pinwings” were impounded before slaughter; and a large quantity of their bones, and even natural mummies, preserved partly by the antiseptic property of the peat and partly by the icy subsoil, have been discovered. One of the last has furnished the chief materials from which the osteology of the species has been described (Trans. Zool. Soc. V. p. 317). Some 70 specimens of the bird’s skin, about as many eggs, and nearly half-a-dozen more or less perfect skeletons, with detached bones of perhaps an hundred individuals, are preserved in collections; but even if there be any truth in the various reports of the appearance of the species since 1844 (some of which seem to rest on fairly good testimony), so that it may still survive, it is obvious that its rediscovery will most likely seal its fate.

Far less commonly known, but apparently quite as certain, is the doom of a large Duck which even fifty years ago was commonly found in summer about the mouth of the St Lawrence and the coast of Labrador, migrating in winter to the shores of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, New England, and perhaps further southward. For many years past, according to the best-informed American ornithologists, not a single example has been met with in any of the markets of the United States, where formerly it was not at all uncommon at the proper season, and the last known to the writer to have lived was killed by Col. Wedderburn in Halifax harbour in the autumn of 1852.^[4. It is needless to observe that no one at that time had any notion of its approaching extinction.] This bird, the Anas labradora of the older ornithologists, was nearly allied to the Eiders (Somateria}, and like them used to breed on rocky islets, where it was safe from the depredations of foxes and other carnivorous quadrupeds. This safety was however unavailing when man began yearly to visit its breeding-haunts, and, not content with plundering its nests, mercilessly to shoot the birds. Most of such islets are, of course, easily ransacked and depopulated. Having no asylum to turn to, for the shores of the mainland were infested by the four-footed enemies just mentioned, and (unlike some of its congeners) it had not a high northern range, its fate is easily understood. No estimate has yet been made of the number of specimens existing in museums, but it is believed to be not very great.

Another bird which has become extinct within the last few years is one of a group of Parrots (Nestor} peculiar to the New-Zealand Subregion, and though some of its congeners still exist in the less-frequented and alpine parts of that country, this species (N. productus} seems to have been confined to Phillip Island. The last known to have lived, according to information supplied to the writer by Mr Gould, was seen by that gentleman in a cage in London about the year 1851. Not much more than a dozen specimens are believed to exist in collections.
