MOVERS, Franz Karl (1806-1856), a German Orientalist, was born at Koesfeld 17th July 1806, studied at Münster, was consecrated priest in 1829, and was professor in the Catholic theological faculty at Breslau from 1839 to his death on 28th September 1856. He was one of the most learned Catholics of Germany, and his elaborate work on Phoenicia^[1. Die Phönizier·, vol. i., Religion (1840); vol. ii., Das Phönizische Alterthum (3 parts, 1849-50-56).] attained a high and in some respects an exaggerated reputation. It is a monument of great industry but of little judgment, and the progress of epigraphic studies has superseded much of the author’s material. The first volume in particular, which deals with the religion of the Phoenicians, may be viewed as quite out of date. Movers himself modified some of his views in his article “Phönizien” in Erseh and Gruber’s Encyklopddie. Of his other writings two Biblical studies were of some importance, viz., his Kritische Untersuchungen uber die ATliche Chronik (1834) and Latin essay on the two recensions of the text of Jeremiah (1837).
