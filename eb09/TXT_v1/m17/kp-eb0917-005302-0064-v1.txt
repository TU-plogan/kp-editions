MURE, William (1799-1860), historian of Greek literature, was born at the family seat near Caldwell, Ayrshire, Scotland, 9th July 1799. He was educated at Westminster school and Edinburgh, and he spent several years at the university of Bonn, where he laid the foundations of his classical knowledge. From 1846 to 1855 he represented the county of Renfrew in parliament in the Conservative interest, and he was lord rector of Glasgow [9:17:54] university in 1847-48. For many years he devoted his leisure to Greek studies, and in 1850-57 he published five volumes of a Critical History of the Language and Literature of Ancient Greece, which, however, he did not live to complete. While C. O. Miiller’s work, as translated and continued by Donaldson, is the best general history of Greek literature in English, Mure’s treatment of the Homeric poems, of the lyric poets, and of the historians of the Attic period is the fullest in our language, and is everywhere marked by thorough knowledge, at first hand, of the Greek authors. Of the unity of the authorship of the Iliad and Odyssey he is a strenuous defender, attributing both to the one person, Homer. Colonel Mure was for many years commandant of the Renfrewshire militia. He died at London on 1st April 1860.

His other works are— Remarks on the Chronology of the Egyptian Dynasties, 1829; Dissertation on the Calendar of the Zodiac of Ancient Egypt, Edinburgh, 1832; Journal of a Tour in Greece and the Ionian Islands in 1838, Edinburgh, 1842. He also edited the Caldwell Papers, 3 vols., for the Maitland Club.
