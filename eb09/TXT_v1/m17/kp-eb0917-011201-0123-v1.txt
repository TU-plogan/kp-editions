MUSTARD. The varieties of mustard-seed of commerce are produced from several species of the Cruciferous genus Brassica. Of these the principal are the Black or Brown Mustard, Brassica nigra (Sinapis nigra, I..), the White Mustard, Brassica alba, and the Sarepta Mustard, B. juncea. The finest qualities of Black and White Mustard are cultivated in the eastern counties of England. The former is a plant requiring a rich soil and much care in its treatment, but its seeds, which are very minute, weighing not more than one-fiftieth of a grain, are the most valuable for commercial purposes. The peculiar pungency and odour to which mustard owes much of its value are due to an essential oil developed by the action of water on two peculiar chemical substances contained in the black seed. These bodies are a compound termed by its discoverers myronate of potassium, but since called sinigrin, C 10 H 18 KNS 2 O 10 , and an albuminoid body, myrosin. The latter substance in presence of water acts as a ferment on sinigrin, splitting it up into the essential oil of mustard, a potassium salt, and sugar. It is worthy of remark that this reaction does not take place in presence of boiling water, and therefore it is not proper to use very hot water in the preparation of mustard. Essential oil of mustard is in chemical constitution an iso-sulphocyanate of allyl C 4 H 5 NS. It is prepared artificially by a process, discovered by Zinzin, which consists in treating bromide of allyl with sulphocyanate of ammonium and distilling the resultant sulphocyanate of allyl. The seed of White Mustard contains in place of sinigrin a peculiar principle called sinalbin, [9:17:113] C 30 H 44 N 2 S 2 O 16 , in several aspects analogous to sinigrin. In presence of water it is acted upon by myrosin, present also in White Mustard, splitting it up into sulphocyanate of acrinyl, sulphate of sinapine, and sugar, Sulphocyanate of acrinyl is a powerful rubefacient principle, whence White Mustard, although yielding no volatile oil, forms a valuable material for cataplasms. The seeds of Brassica juncea have the same constitution and properties as Black Mustard, as a substitute for which they are extensively cultivated in Russia. The mustard-seed imported from the East Indies is also largely composed of B. juncea.

Both as a table condiment and as a medicinal substance, mustard has been known from a very remote period. Under the name of vατrυ it was used by Hippocrates in medicine. The form in which table mustard is now sold in the United Kingdom dates from 1720, about which time Mrs Clements of Durham hit on the idea of grinding the seed in a mill and sifting the flour from the husk. The bright -yellow farina thereby produced under the name of “Durham mustard” pleased the taste of George I., and rapidly attained wide popularity. As it is now prepared mustard consists essentially of a mixture of black and white farina in certain proportions. Several grades of pure mustard are made containing nothing but the farina of mustard-seed, the lower qualities having larger amounts of the white cheaper mustard; and corresponding grades of a mixed preparation of equal price, but containing certain proportions of wheaten or starch flour, are also prepared and sold as “mustard condiment.” The mixture is free from the unmitigated bitterness and sharpness of flavour of pure mustard, and it keeps much better.

All varieties of mustard-seed contain from 25 to 35 per cent, of a bland inodorous yellow-coloured fixed oil, free from pungency and with little tendency to become rancid. It is extensively used in India for cooking and all ordinary purposes, and is one of the ordinary commercial oils of Western countries. The mustard papers commonly used as rubefacients and vesicants are made from mustard flour entirely deprived of its fixed oil.
