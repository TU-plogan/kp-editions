MUZAFFARPUR or Mozufferpore, a district in the lieutenant-governorship of Bengal, India, lying between 25° 30' and 26° 51' N. lat. and 84° 55' and 85° 58' E. long., is bounded on the N. by Nepâl, E. by Darbhangah, on the S. by Patnâ, and W. by Sâran and Champâran districts, with an area of 3004 square miles. It was formed in January 1875 out of the great district of Tirhut, which up to that time was the largest and most populous district of lower Bengal. Of its six subdivisions, the three eastern were in January 1875 formed into the new district of Darbhangah, and the three western—Muzaffarpur, Hâjipur, and Tâjpur—into the district of Muzaffarpur.

The census of 1881 returned the inhabitants at 2,582,060 (males 1,265,731, females 1,316,329), viz., Hindus 2,265,380,Mohammedans 316,308, Europeans 140, mixed races 43, native Christians 179. The cultivated area amounts to 1,435,859 acres, of which 762,830 are under rice. Muzaffarpur suffered severely from the famines of 1866 and 1874.

Muzaffarpur, chief town and administrative headquarters of the above district, is situated on the right or south bank of the Little Gandak river in 26° 7' N. lat. and 85° 26' E. long., with a population (1881) of 42,460. The town is clean, with many broad and well-kept streets; it has a good collectorate and court-houses, jail, dispensary, and several good schools. A large trade is carried on both by road and river. The town, however, is liable to inundation, and suffered severely from this cause in 1871.
