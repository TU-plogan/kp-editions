MÜHLHAUSEN, a busy manufacturing town of Thuringia in the district of Erfurt, Prussia, is situated on the right bank of the Unstrut, 25 miles to the northwest of Gotha. It consists of a new and an old town surrounded by five suburbs, and with its numerous old churches and towers presents a quaint and picturesque appearance. The most interesting churches are those of the Blessed Virgin and St Blasius, dating respectively from the 14th and from the 12 th century; the town-house is also a fine mediaeval structure. Mühlhausen contains a gymnasium, a “real school,” a theatre, an orphanage, and two hospitals. Its chief industries are the spinning and weaving of woollens and cottons, in which about 50,000 spindles and 3000 looms are employed; but a list of its other manufactures includes the most varied articles, such as needles, machinery, cigars, soap, hosiery, and shoes. There are also numerous large establishments for dyeing, tanning, lime-burning, iron-making, brewing, and the preparation of liqueurs. The active trade of the town is mainly in grain, fruit, garden-stuff, wool, and cattle, and is fostered by the fertility of the surrounding country, which is remarkable for the abundance of its streams and watercourses. The great majority of the inhabitants, numbering 23,478 in 1880, are Protestants.

Mühlhausen is one of the oldest towns in Thuringia, and is said to have been fortified in 925. Its early importance is shown by the grant of imperial privileges made to it by the emperor Henry I., and by the diet held there in 1135. At the epoch of the Reformation Mühlhausen became notorious as one of the chief seats of the Anabaptists. Thomas Münzer, one of their leaders, was captured in the vicinity and executed in the town. Internal dissensions and injury received during the Thirty Years’ War and the Seven Years’ War afterwards reduced Mühlhausen to unimportance. In 1802 it lost its independence and passed to Prussia, in 1807 it was [9:17:13] attached to the kingdom of Westphalia, and in 1815 it again became Prussian. The Teutonic Order established itself at Mühlhausen in 1200, and acquired considerable property there, which ultimately passed into the possession of the town.
