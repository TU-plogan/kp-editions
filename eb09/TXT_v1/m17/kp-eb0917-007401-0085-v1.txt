MUSES, The, according to the view which prevailed among the Greek writers and has become â commonplace of modern literature, were nine goddesses who presided over the nine principal departments of letters: Calliope, Muse of epic poetry; Euterpe, of lyric poetry; Erato, of erotic poetry; Melpomene, of tragedy; Thalia, of comedy; Polyhymnia, of the hymn as used in the worship of the gods; Terpsichore, of choral song and the dance which formed its necessary accompaniment; Clio, of history; and Urania, of astronomy. They are represented in ancient art as fully draped figures characterized by attitude, dress, and symbols appropriate to the departments over which they presided. In the simpler conception that prevails in earlier literature they were said to be daughters of Zeus and Mnemosyne, i.e., memory personified. In chorus round the altar of Zeus they sing the origin of the world, of gods, and of men, the might and the glorious deeds of Zeus. At the banquets of the gods their joyous music is heard. They honour also the great heroes; they sing at the marriage of Cadmus and of Peleus; their mourning song at the death of Achilles drew tears from both gods and men. They know all things past and future and impart to their chosen poets the knowledge and the skill to write. They are usually maiden goddesses, but some of the mythic poets—Orpheus, Linus, Ialemus—are said to be sons of a Muse.

This conception of the number and character of the Muses is as old as Hesiod and the Odyssey (xxiv. 60), yet it is far removed from the genuine religious stratum out of which the poets fashioned it. The religion of the Muses had two chief seats, on the northern slope of Mount Olympus around Dion in Pieria, by the holy springs Leibethron and Pimpleia, and on the slope of Mount Helicon near Ascra and Thespiae. Nothing is known of the cultus in its older form, but it appears to have been connected with the religion of Dionysus. The Muses must have been originally a variety of the Nymphs (see Nymphs), the spirits of nature who live in the fountains and forests; hence they are associated with Pegasus, the winged horse of the thunder-cloud. The half-mythic race called Thracian, which is specially associated with the two localities where the worship of the Muses had its seat, survived in Greek memory as a race of bards; and this character of the race coloured its conception of the spirit-life which it saw in nature. The spirits who know or who remember (Moυσα = Movτιa, from man, to think) sang to them in the voice of the water and the trees. At first they gave no definite number or form to their conception of these spirits; the number nine is the invention of a later time and of a different order of thought, and some accounts speak of three Muses or of a single Muse.
