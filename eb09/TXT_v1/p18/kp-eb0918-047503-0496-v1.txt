PELL, John (1610-1685), mathematician, was born on 1st March 1610 at Southwick in Sussex, where his father was minister. He was educated at the free school of Steyning, and entered Trinity College, Cambridge, at the age of thirteen. During his university career he made himself an accomplished linguist, and even before he took his Μ. A. degree (in 1630) he was engaged in learned correspondence with Briggs and other mathematicians. His great reputation and the influence of Sir William Boswell, the English resident, with the States-General procured his election in 1643 to the chair of mathematics in Amsterdam, whence he removed in 1646, on the invitation of the prince of Orange, to Breda, where he remained till 1652.

From 1654 to 1658 Pell acted as Cromwell’s political agent to the Protestant cantons of Switzerland. On his return to England he took orders and was appointed by Charles II. to the rectory of Fobbing in Essex, and in 1673 he was presented by Bishop Sheldon to the rectory of Laindon in the same county. His devotion to mathematical science seems to have interfered alike with his advancement in the church and with the proper management of his private affairs. Cheated, it is said, by his tenants and relations, he was reduced to the utmost [9:18:476] poverty. For a time he was confined as a debtor in the King’s Bench prison. He lived, on the invitation of Dr Whistler, for a short time in 1682 at the College of Physicians, but died 12th December 1685 at the house of Mr Cothorne, reader of the church of St Giles in the Fields. He was buried at the expense of the rector of this church and of Dr Busby, the master of Westminster School. Many of Pell’s manuscripts fell into the hands of Dr Busby, and afterwards came into the possession of the Royal Society; they are still preserved in something like forty folio volumes, which contain, not only Pell’s own memoirs, but much of his correspondence with the mathematicians of his time.

The Diophantine analysis was a favourite subject with Pell; he lectured on it at Amsterdam; and he is now best remembered for his solution of the indeterminate equation, ax t -y 2 =l, which is now known by his name, and which had been proposed by Fermat as a challenge to the English mathematicians. His chief works are Astronomical History of Observations of Heavenly Motions and Appearances, 1634; Ecliptica Prognostica, 1634; Controversy with Loηgomontanus concerning the Quadrature of the Circle, 1646 (?); An Idea of the Mathematics, 12mo, 1650; Branker's Translation of Rhonius's Algebra, much altered and augmented, 4to, 1668; A Table of Ten Thousand Square Numbers, fol., 1672.
