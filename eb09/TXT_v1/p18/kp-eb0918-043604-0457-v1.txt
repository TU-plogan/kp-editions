PAUSANIAS, the general who led the Greeks to victory at Plataea, was a Spartan and a member of the Agid branch of the royal house. In 479 B.c. he succeeded his father Cleombrotus as regent and guardian of his cousin the youthful king Plistarchus, and in the same year he was appointed, by virtue of his rank, to lead the army despatched by the Spartans to help the Athenians against the Persians under Mardonius. He commanded the united Greek army at the memorable battle of Plataea (479), which for ever secured the freedom of Greece against the Persians. The credit of that great victory belongs to the soldiers rather than to their general, for Pausanias seems to have acted without any settled plan, and to have given battle only when he was forced to do so by the enemy. Indeed, his attempt to withdraw the Spartan contingent from the post of honour on the right, in order to avoid encountering the native Persian troops under Mardonius, savours of positive co - wardice. But, if he feared the living, he respected the dead; a proposal made by a Greek after the battle to avenge the death of Leonidas by mutilating the corpse of the gallant Mardonius received from Pausanias a stern rebuke. After the expulsion of the Persians from Greece Pausanias led a Greek fleet (478 or 477) to Cyprus and thence to Byzantium, which he captured from the Persians. But the successes he had hitherto enjoyed only fed without satisfying his ambition. He conceived the design of making himself master of all Greece, and with this view he opened a correspondence with Xerxes, offering to marry his daughter and reduce Greece to a Persian province. The proposal was hailed with delight by the Persian monarch. Puffed up with these hopes, Pausanias now assumed by anticipation the airs and state of a tyrant, and by his overbearing manners offended the Greeks so deeply that in disgust they transferred the leadership of the allied forces from Sparta to Athens,—a momentous step, from which sprang the maritime empire of Athens. Pausanias was recalled to Sparta and tried, but, though convicted and punished for minor offences, the evidence was insufficient to substantiate the charge of treason, and he was acquitted. Having afterwards the folly to return to Byzantium in a private capacity and reopen communications with Persia, he was again recalled and put on his trial. There was strong suspicion of his treason, but no positive evidence. It was known, too, that he had incited the Helots to revolt, [9:18:437] promising them freedom and citizenship if they would join him; but, with characteristic caution, the authorities declined to accept the evidence of a Helot against a Spartan, and Pausanias might, after all, have been acquitted if it had not been that a messenger to whom he entrusted a letter for Artabazus, the Persian satrap, opened it, and, finding in it a direction to put the bearer to death, carried it to the ephors. But not until they had contrived to overhear a conversation between Pausanias and his messenger were the ephors satisfied of his guilt; and then they proceeded to arrest him. Foreseeing their intention, Pausanias took refuge in the temple of Athene of the Brazen House. The ephors took off the roof, blocked up the doors, and starved him. When on the point of death he was dragged out, that his corpse might not defile the sanctuary. This happened about 467.

The principal authorities for the life of Pausanias are Herodotus (ix. 10 sq.) and Thucydides (i. 94, 95, 128-134). There is a biography of him by Cornelius Nepos. See also Diodorus, xi. 29- 34, 44-46; Pausanias, iii. 4, 7 and⅛. 17, 7; Plutarch, Themistocles, 23; Id., Aristides, 11, 14-20, 23; Aristodemus, ii. iv. vi.-viii. (in Müller’s Fragm. Hist. Graec., vol. v.); Justin, 2, 14.
