PARR, Samuel (1747-1825), the son of Samuel Parr, surgeon at Harrow-on-the-Hill, was born there 15th January 1747. At Easter 1752 he was sent to Harrow School as a free scholar, where he made the acquaintance of many pupils, such as Bishop Bennet, Sir William Jones, and Warburton Lytton, who became eminent in after life. They read in the same class, they shared in the same sports, and their friendship lasted from youth to age. As Parr was destined for his father’s profession, he was removed from school in the spring of 1761, and for the next few years assisted his father in his practice. When the old surgeon realized that his son was but ill-adapted for this pursuit, the boy was sent to Emmanuel College, Cambridge (autumn of 1765), but on his father’s death shortly afterwards he was compelled, through lack of means, to return to Harrow. From February 1767 to the close of 1771 he acted as head assistant at Harrow School to Dr Sumner, a teacher whom he idolized, and had under his care many pupils, of whom Sheridan was the best known. When the headmaster died in September 1771 Parr became a candidate for the place, but was rejected, chiefly on account of his youth, whereupon he started another school at Stanmore, and drew after him about forty of his former scholars. After a trial of five years he found himself unable to bear up against the attractions of his old establishment, and dismissed the boys entrusted to his charge, becoming first the headmaster of Colchester Grammar School (1776-78) and then of Norwich School (1778-86). The small rectory of Asterby in Lincolnshire was conferred upon him in 1780, and it was followed three years later by the vicarage of Hatton near Warwick. Though he exchanged this latter benefice for Wadenhoe in Northamptonshire in 1789, he stipulated to be allowed to reside, as assistant curate, in the parsonage of Hatton. In this retirement he spent the rest of his days, cheered by the attractions of an excellent library, described by Mr H. G. Bohn in Bibliotheca Parriana (1827), and the converse of his classical friends, some of whom, like Porson and E. H. Barker, passed many months in his company. The degree of LL.D, was conferred on him by the university of Cambridge in 1781. Parr died at Hatton vicarage, 6th March 1825, and was buried in the chancel of its church. He had to middle age felt the pressure of poverty, but through the gift in 1788 of the prebendal stall of Wenlock Barns in St Paul’s Cathedral (then worth only a reserved rent of £20 a year, but on the lapse of the lease in 1804 a preferment of considerable value), and through the purchase for him by his friends in 1789 of an annuity of £300, he died possessed of a large fortune.

Dr Parr’s writings fill several volumes, but they are all beneath the reputation which he acquired through the variety of his knowledge and the dogmatism of his conversation. The chief of them are his character of Charles James Fox; his Latin preface, a long eulogy of Burke, North, and Fox, to a new edition of three books of Bellendenus; and his reprint of the Tracts of Warburton and a Warburtoηian, not admitted into their works, a volume still not without interest for its scathing exposure of Warburton and Hurd. The character of Parr’s compositions may be gathered from a passage in the Edinburgh Review (October 1802) on his Spital sermon, “a discourse of no common length . . . . an immeasurable mass of notes which appear to concern every learned thing, every [9:18:321] learned man, and almost every unlearned man since the beginning of the world.” Even amid the terrors of the French Revolution he adhered to Whiggism, and his correspondence included every man of eminence, either literary or political, who adopted the same creed. There are two memoirs of his life, one by the Rev. William Field (1828, 2 vols.), the other, with his works and his letters, by John Johnstone (1828, 8 vols.); and E. H. Barker published in 1828-29 two volumes of Parriana, a confused mass of information on Parr and his friends. An essay on his life is included in De Quincey’s works, vol. v., and a little volume of the Aphorisms, Opinions, and Reflections of the late Dr Pan· appeared in 1826.
