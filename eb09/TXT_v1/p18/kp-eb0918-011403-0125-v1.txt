PACHECO, Francisco (1571-1654), Spanish painter and art historian, born at Seville in 1571, was the pupil of Luis Fernandez, and a diligent and prolific workman. Favourable specimens of his style are to be seen in the Madrid picture gallery, and also in two churches at Alcala de Guadaira near Seville; they are characterized by careful drawing and correct if somewhat feeble composition, but prove that he was no colorist. He attained great popularity, and about the beginning of the 17th century opened an academy of painting which was largely attended. Of his pupils by far the most distinguished was Velazquez, who afterwards became his son·in-law. From about 1625 he gave up painting and betook himself to literary society and pursuits; the most important of his works in this department is a treatise on the art of painting (Arte de la Pintura: su anteguedad y grandezas, 1649), which, although characterized by prolixity and pedantry of style, and often nonsensical enough in its theories, is of considerable value for the information it contains, especially on matters relating to Spanish art. He died ini 654.
