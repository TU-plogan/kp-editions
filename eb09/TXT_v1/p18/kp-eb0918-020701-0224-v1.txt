PAMPLONA (Pampeluna, Fr. Pampelune), a city of Spain, capital of the province of Navarre, and an episcopal see, is situated 1378 feel above sea-level, on the left bank of the Agra, a tributary of the Ebro, ‘on a height commanding a wide view of the hill-encircled plain known as the “cuenca” or “bowl” of Pamplona. It is a station on the Ebro railway connecting Alsasua with Saragossa. The climate in general is cold and moist, but owing to the purity of the air and the excellence of its drainage the town is not unhealthy. From its position Pamplona has always been the principal fortress of Navarre. The fortifications form a rectangle of which the north-east and north-west sides face the river (here crossed by several bridges), while on the south-west side stands the citadel, which owes its present construction to Philip II., who modelled it on that of Antwerp. It is a pentagon, separated from the city by an esplanade, and is calculated to accommodate 7500 men. The streets of the town are regular and broad; there are three ii plazas,” the principal of which, containing the Casa de la Diputacion and the theatre, is sometimes on festive occasions turned into a bull-ring. The cathedral is a late Gothic structure begun in 1397 by Charles III. (El Noble) of Navarre, who is buried within its walls; of the previous structure raised by Don Sancho about 1123 only a small portion of the cloisters remains. The interior, which is fine, is remarkable for the peculiar structure of its apse; the wood carvings of the choir, in English oak, by Miguel Ancheta, a native artist, are excellent. The principal façade is Corinthian, from designs of Ventura Rodriguez (1783). The same architect designed the superb aqueduct by which the city is supplied with water from Monte Francoa, some nine miles off. The beautiful cloisters on the south side of the cathedral, and the chapter-house beyond them, as well as the old churches of San Saturnino (Gothic) and San Nicolas (Romanesque), are also of interest to the student of architecture. Among •other places of public resort in Pamplona may be mentioned the bull-ring, capable of accommodating 8000 spectators, and the tennis court (El Trinquete). The town has a well-equipped secondary school, two normal and numerous primary schools, as well as an academy of design; and there are three hospitals. Of the public gardens and walks the finest is La Taconera. The surrounding district is fertile, producing wine as well as grain and other seeds; the manufactures are comparatively unimportant, the chief being that of linen. The yearly fair in connexion with the feast of San Fermin (July 7), the patron saint of the city, attracts a large concourse from all parts of the country. Population of ayuntamiento in 1877, 25,630.

Originally a town of the Vascones, Pamplona was rebuilt in 68 b.c. by Pompey the Great, whence the name Pompaelo or Pompeio (Strabo). It was captured by Euric the Goth in 466 and by the Franks under Childebert in 542; it was dismantled by Charlemagne in 778, but repulsed the emir of Saragossa in 907. In the 14th century it was greatly strengthened and beautified by Charles III., who built a citadel on the site now occupied by the Plaza de Toros and by the Basilica de S. Ignacio, the church markingthe spot where Ignatius Loyala received his wound in defending the place against André de Foix in 1521. From 1808 it was occupied by the French until taken by Wellington in 1813. In the Carlist war of 1836-40 it was held by the Cristinos, and in 1875-76 it was more than once attacked, but never taken, by the Carlists.
