PARÁ, or Santa Maria de Belem do Grao Para, one of the most flourishing cities of Brazil, capital of the province of Pará or Gräo Pará, lies on a point of land with sandy porous soil at the junction of the Guamâ with the Rio Pará or eastern arm of the Amazons, about 75 miles from the sea. The main river is about 20 miles wide opposite the town, but is broken by numerous islands. Pará is regularly built, well-paved, and well-lighted. The houses, which seldom exceed two or three stories in height, are usually substantial structures of stone; and a general brightness of aspect is produced by red-tiled roofs and white, yellow, or even pink and blue coloured walls relieved by dense tropical foliage. The Estrada das Mon-gubeiras, running about a mile from the river to Largo da Polvora in the east end of the city, has long been famous for its magnificent cotton trees (Bombax Monguba, B. Ceiba'); but the grand old trees are dying out, and the finest avenue in Pará is now the Estrada de Sâo José, with its colonnade of tall “royal palms ” (Oreodoxa regia). In the outskirts of the city the wealthy merchants have villas with very extensive grounds, and a little way beyond these begins the dense swamp-forest. Pará has a wonderfully pleasant and healthy climate, with a temperature extremely equable throughout the year. “The mornings are cool. From 10 till 2 the heat increases rapidly, commonly reaching 90° or 91°. A little later great black clouds appear in the east and spread quickly over the sky; the temperature falls suddenly, the wind blows in varying gusts, the rain pours down, and ere one is aware the sun leaps out. Sometimes the first shower is followed by a second or even a third. By sunset the ground is dry.” This is the rule all the year round; only in the height of the dry season a week may pass without any showers. The Brazilians have a proverb, “Who came to Pará was glad to stay: who drank assai went never away.” The [9:18:234] assai referred to is a beverage made by squeezing the black grape-like berries of the assai palm (Euterpe edulis) ; it is largely drunk by all classes in Parâ. The importance of the city is due to its being the great emporium of the rapidly-developing trade of the Amazons. The trade is carried on by several steamboat companies; the most important, the Amazonian Steamboat Company, receives a subsidy from the Brazilian Government. Two lines of steamers run between Liverpool and Paré,; there are also a French line and a German line. A large trade is transacted with the United States, but mainly through English, French, German, and Portuguese houses. The principal exports are cocoa, Brazil nuts, hides, deer-skins, isinglass, balsam of copaiba, tonka beans, and Peruvian bark. In 1863 the total value of the imports was about £500,000 and of the exports about <£525,000; by 1882 the duties paid to the custom-house amounted to £864,396.

Population has been growing faster than the supply of houses. In 1819 the inhabitants were estimated at 24,500, but by 1850 they had declined to 15,000; in 1866 they were 36,000 (about 5000 slaves); and they are now (1884) nearly 40,000. Besides a vast cathedral (1720) and the president’s palace, usually considered one of the best buildings of its kind in Brazil, Parâ contains an episcopal palace (formerly the Jesuit college), a handsome theatre, a large market building, a custom-house (formerly a convent, with two great towers), naval and military arsenals (the first of some size, with shipbuilding yards and a gridiron), a botanical garden, &c. About a mile from the city is the chapel of Our Lady of Nazareth, the most celebrated shrine in northern Brazil.

In 1615 Francisco Caldeira de Castello Branco, sent out by the Portuguese at Maranhao, built the fort of Santo Christo and founded the settlement of Nossa Senhora de Belem. By 1641 it was a place of 400 inhabitants, with four monasteries. A premature declaration of independence was made at Para in 1823, and soon after Captain Grenfell, sent by Lord Cochrane, brought the city over to the Brazilian party; but for many years it was subject to political disturbance. In 1835 “every respectable white was obliged to leave the city” by the anarchical proceedings of the so-called “Liberals” Gomes, Vinagre, and Rodriguez.
