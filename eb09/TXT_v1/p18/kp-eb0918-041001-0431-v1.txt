PATRIARCH (πατριάρχης, lit. the head or ruler of a πάτριά, tribe, family, or clan) occurs four times in the New Testament, being applied to Abraham, the twelve sons of Jacob collectively, and David, and several times in the LXX., where the word is used to denote the officials called by the chronicler “princes of the tribes of Israel,” “princes of hundreds,” “chiefs of the fathers.” Under the late Roman empire the title was officially applied down to the 5th century to the chief rabbi in Palestine (see Cod. Tkeod., xvi. 8, 1; and comp. Israel, vol. xiii. p. 428); the head of the synagogue at Babylon appears also to have been known as patriarch until 1038. The title at an early date passed over into the Christian church as an honorific though not official designation of all bishops; thus Gregory of Nyssa (Or. Pun. in Melf) alludes to the fathers assembled in council at Constantinople as “these patriarchs.” Afterwards the Easterns showed a tendency to limit the appellation to the occupants of the more important sees, just as in the West the so-called “metropolitans” began to receive more definite recognition. At the present day the heads of the various extant churches and sects in the East are very commonly called patriarchs (see vol. xi. p. 154 sqf), and in the West the Roman Church gives the honorary title to several dignitaries, such as the archbishops of Lisbon and Venice. In a strictly technical sense, however, that church recognizes only five patriarchates, those of Constantinople, Alexandria, Jerusalem, Antioch, and Rome. This peculiar restriction of the word, which may be said to date from the council of Chalcedon in 451, can be traced downwards from the time of Constantine, when the altered political circumstances and the civil division of the empire into four prefectures (Orientis, Illyrici Orientalis, Italiae, Galliarum), each containing a number of “dioceses,” gave a new importance to questions of ecclesiastical jurisdiction. Thus the council of Nice (can. 6) adjusted the jurisdiction of the “bishop” of Alexandria so as to include Libya and Pentapolis as well as Egypt, the ancient rights of Rome, Antioch, and the other “eparchies” being at the same time conserved. The third canon of the council of Constantinople assigned precedence to the “bishop” of Constantinople immediately after the “bishop” of Rome; and by the 28th of Chalcedon the “metropolitans” of Thrace, Pontus, and Asia were appointed to receive their consecration at his hands. The same council invested the bishop of Jerusalem, formerly under the jurisdiction of the metropolitan of Antioch, with supremacy over the whole of Palestine. Thenceforward a certain co-ordinate primacy was thus accorded to Rome, Constantinople, Antioch, Alexandria, and Jerusalem; but it is to be observed that in no official document belonging to this period is the title “patriarch” given to the bishop of any one of these sees, though the word “eparch” or “exarch” is occasionally employed. We find Theodosius, however, so designating the bishop of Rome, and not only is it given to the bishop of Constantinople in the NoveUae of Justinian, but we find Mennas in 536 claiming to be called ó oικovptvικoς πατριάρχης, not, of course, without violent protest in the West. After the fall of Jerusalem (637), Antioch (638), and Alexandria (640) into the hands of the Saracens, the importance of these sees became of course nominal merely, and it grew easier for Rome, at the head of the unbroken Western church, to give practical expression to its claims of superiority[9:18:411] over its sole surviving Eastern rival. Finding it difficult, however, to avoid the appearance of equality that was involved in the name of “patriarch,” now conventionally bestowed on the occupants of other ancient and apostolic sees, the bishops of Rome rather avoided the title, preferring the more colourless designation of papa or pope (see Pope).
