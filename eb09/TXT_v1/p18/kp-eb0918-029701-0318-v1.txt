PARK, Mungo (1771-1806?), a celebrated African traveller, was born in Selkirkshire, Scotland, on the 20th September 1771, at Fowlshiels on the Yarrow,—the farm which his father rented from the duke of Buccleuch. He was the seventh in a family of thirteen. Having received a good education (at home from a private tutor, and afterwards at the grammar school of Selkirk), he was apprenticed to a surgeon named Anderson, in Selkirk, and then attended the university of Edinburgh for three sessions (1789-91). By his brother-in-law, James Dickson, a botanist of repute, he was introduced to Sir Joseph Banks, and through his good offices he obtained the post of assistant-surgeon on board the “Worcester” East Indiaman. In this capacity he made the voyage in 1792 toBencoolen in Sumatra, andon his return in 1793 he contributed a description of eight new Sumatran fishes to the Transactions of the Linnean Society. Park next offered his services to the African Association, then looking out for a successor to the unfortunate Major Houghton, and, again supported by the influence of Sir Joseph Banks, he was successful in his application. On the 21st June 1795 he reached the Gambia, but it was not till December 2d that he started for Pisania with only two Negro servants (Johnson and Demba) on the hazardous and difficult expedition into the interior, from which he was to return with the proud distinction of being the first of modern Europeans to reach the well-nigh fabulous waters of the Niger. Striking north-eastward across the upper basin of the Senegal, he advanced through Kaarta and El Hodh, and descended upon the great river of his quest at Segu on the north bank, about 13° 5 ’ N. lat. and 6° 20' W. long. Though he was not able to proceed down stream any farther than Mursan and Silla, he managed on his home journey to follow the river valley as far up as Bammako, a distance of about 300 miles. By the 10th June he was again at Pisania, but he did not reach England till December 22, 1796. An account of his journey was at once· drawn up for the Association by Bryan Edwards, and a detailed narrative from his own pen appeared in 1799 (Travels in the Interior of Africa). Abundance of incident, and an unaffected charm of style, at once rendered [9:18:298] the work extremely popular, and it still holds its place as one of the acknowledged classics in this department of literature. It seemed for a time as if Park was now to settle down quietly at home; he married a daughter of his old master, Mr Anderson, and commenced practice as a country doctor at Peebles, where at least he could enjoy “a glass of strong beer and a peep at the sky through Mr Oman’s telescope”; but he was ill at ease—his heart was in Africa. In 1804 the people of Peebles were amused and alarmed by the vagaries of Sidi Omback Boubi from Mogador, who had come to teach their doctor Arabic; and in autumn Park parted from Sir Walter Scott, who had been one of his best friends, with the hopeful proverb on his lips, “Freits (omens) follow those that look to them.” He had accepted Lord Hobart’s proposal that he should take command of a Niger expedition. He sailed from Portsmouth on January 30, 1805; and the expedition started from Pisania on May 4th. Unfortunately the rainy season soon afterwards commenced; by the time Bammako was reached the party was reduced from forty-four Europeans to eleven, and from Sansanding the leader had to report “five only are at present alive, viz., three soldiers (one deranged in his mind), Lieutenant Martyn, and myself.” Among those who had died at Sansanding was his brother-in-law Mr Anderson. On November 19th he set sail down the river from Sansanding with the “fixed resolution to discover the termination of the Niger or perish in the attempt.” Isaaco, the Mandingo guide who had accompanied the expedition up to this point, was afterwards sent on a mission to find out the fate of the voyagers; it was learned that they had managed to make their way through countless perils to Bussa (Boussa) between 9° and 10° N. lat., and that they were there attacked by the natives, and were drowned in endeavouring to escape. Park was 6 feet in height, active and robust; his countenance was prepossessing, his manner in company plain and simple, but somewhat cold and reserved.

See the Life (by Wishaw) prefixed to Journal of a Mission into the Interior of Africa in 1805, London, 1815; H. B., Life of Mungo Park, Edinburgh, 1835; and an interesting passage in Lockhart’s Life of Sir Walter Scott, vol. ii.
