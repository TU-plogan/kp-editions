PASQUIER, Étienne (1529-1615), one of the glories of the French bar, and one of not the least remarkable men of letters of the 16th century, was born at Paris on the 7th June 1529 by his own account, according to others a year earlier. Nothing is known of his family, and hardly anything of his youth, but he seems to have inherited a small property at Châtelet in the district of Brie. He certainly studied law early, and in 1547 was a pupil of the famous Cujas at Toulouse. Thence, like many of his contemporaries, he went to finish his studies in Italy. He was called to the Paris bar in November 1549, having not yet (or at most barely) reached his majority. He practised diligently and with success, but by no means neglected literature. Some of his work both at this time and later is light and almost frivolous. A treatise on love, the Mono-ρhile, appeared in 1554, and not a few similar publications followed it, one of them, the Ordonnances d'Amour, being somewhat Rabelaisian in character. Pasquier, however, though not a stoic, was a man of perfectly regular life, and he married early; his wife, who was of his own age, affluent, and, it is said, handsome, being a widow for whom he had gained a lawsuit. The next year he had the misfortune to eat some poisonous mushrooms and very nearly died of them; indeed he did not recover fully for two years. This lost him his practice for the time, and he again betook himself to general literature, publishing in 1560 the first book of his great work the Recherches de la France. Before very long, however, clients once more came to him, and in 1565, when he was thirty-seven, his fame was established by a great speech still extant, in which he pleaded the cause of the university of Paris against the Jesuits, and won it. He was thenceforward constantly employed in the most important cases of the day, and his speeches, many of which we possess, displayed a polished eloquence which was new in his time. But he did not neglect general literature, pursuing the Recherches steadily, and publishing from time to time much miscellaneous work. His literary and his legal occupations coincided in a curious fashion at the Grands Jours of Poitiers in 1579. These Grand Jours (an institution which fell into desuetude at the end of the 17 th century, with bad effects on the social and political welfare of the French provinces) were a kind of irregular assize in which a commission of the parlement of Paris, selected and despatched at short notice by the king, had full power to hear and determine all causes, especially those in which seignorial rights had been abused. At the Grands Jours of Poitiers of the date mentioned, and at those of Troyes in 1583, Pasquier officiated; and each occasion has left a curious literary memorial of the kind of high jinks with which he and his colleagues relieved their graver duties. The Poitiers work was the celebrated collection of poems on a flea, of which English readers may find a full account in Southey’s Doctor. Up to this time Pasquier had held no regular office except the lieutenant-generalship of Cognac, where his wife had property; but in 1535 Henry III. made him advocate-general at the Paris Cours des Comptes, an important body having political as well as financial and legal functions. Pasquier distinguished himself here [9:18:341] particularly by opposing, sometimes successfully, the mischievous system of selling hereditary places and offices, which more perhaps than any single thing was the curse of the older French monarchy. He was present at the famous States of Blois, where Guise was assassinated, and he met Montaigne there. The civil wars brought him much personal sorrow. His wife and children had remained in Paris much harassed by the Leaguers; Madame Pasquier Was even imprisoned, and, though she regained her liberty, she died shortly afterwards, in 1590. Her youngest son was killed fighting on the royalist side the year before. For some years Pasquier lived at Tours, working steadily at his great book, but he returned to Paris in Henry IV.’s train on the 22d March 1594. He continued until 1604 at his work in the Chambre des Comptes; then he retired. He survived this retirement more than ten years, producing much literary work, and died after a few hours’ illness on September 1, 1615, at the age of at least eighty-six.

In so long and so laborious a life Pasquier’s work was naturally considerable, and it lias never been fully collected or indeed printed. The standard edition is that of Amsterdam, 1723, 2 vols, folio. But for ordinary readers the selections of Μ. Léon Feugère, published at Paris in 2 vols. 8vo, 1849, withan elaborate introduction, are most accessible. As a poet, though very far from contemptible, Pasquier is chiefly interesting as a minor menlber of the Pléiade movement. As a prose writer he is of much more account. The three chief divisions of his prose work are his Recherches, his letters, and his professional speeches. All are of much value as important documents in the history of the progress of French style. The Recherches and the letters have a value independent of this. The letters are of much biographical interest and historical importance, and the Recherches contain in a somewhat miscellaneous fashion invaluable information on a vħst variety of subjects, literary, political, antiquarian, and other.
