PERTHES, Friedrich Christoph (1772-1843), German publisher, was born at Rudolstadt on 21st April 1772. At the age of fifteen he became an apprentice in the service of Böhme, a bookseller in Leipsic, with whom he remained about six years. In Hamburg, where he settled in 1793 as an assistant to the bookseller Hoffmann, he started in 1796 a bookselling business of his own, in developing which he soon gave evidence of remarkable tact, energy, and intelligence. In 1798 he entered into partnership with his brother-in-law, J. H. Besser, with whose aid he rapidly succeeded in forming an establishment which commanded universal confidence and respect. By his marriage with a daughter of the poet Matthias Claudius (in 1797) he was brought into intimate relation with a group of Protestant writers, who, although of a liberal tendency, retained a strong belief in the essential doctrines of Christianity; and they exercised a powerful influence on the growth of his religious opinions. This, however, did not prevent him from being on friendly terms with a number of eminent Roman Catholic authors. Perthes was an ardent patriot; and during the period of Napoleon’s supremacy he distinguished himself by his steady resistance to French pretensions. His zeal for the national cause led him to issue (in 1810-11) Das Deutsche Museum, to which many of the foremost publicists in Germany contributed. For some time the French made it impossible for him to live in Hamburg; and when, in 1814, he returned, he found that his business had greatly fallen off and that it would have to be thoroughly reorganized. In 1821, his first wife having died, he left Hamburg, transferring his business there to his partner, and went to Gotha, where he established what ultimately became one of the first publishing houses in Germany. Among other important works issued by him may be named the Theologische Studien und Kritiken and the Geschichte der europäischen Staaten, the latter conducted in the first instance by Heeren and Ukert, afterwards by Giesebrecht. Perthes died at Gotha on 18th May 1843.

Of the three sons of Perthes, the youngest, A. H. T. Perthes, succeeded him as a publisher. The elder sons became authors of some eminence, and one of them, C. T. Perthes, wrote an excellent biography of his father, Friedrich Perthes' Leben. In 1785 a publishing house was founded in Gotha by the uncle of F. C. Perthes, J. G. Justus Perthes, whose son Wilhelm became distinguished as a publisher of works relating to geography. Bernhard Wilhelm, Wilhelm’s son, who succeeded to the business in 1853 and died in 1857, greatly extended its operations. In 1854 he established a geographical institute, and the Mittheilungen αus Justus Perthes’ geographischem Institut, conducted by A. Petermann, soon gained a European reputation. This house issues the Almanach de Gotha, and has published the maps and writings of many of the most eminent German geographers and travellers.
