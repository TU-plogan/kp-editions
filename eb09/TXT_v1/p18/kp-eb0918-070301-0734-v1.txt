PÉTION DE VILLENEUVE, Jerôme (1753-1794), was the son of a procureur at Chartres, where he was born in 1753. He himself became an avocat in his native place in 1778, and at once began to try to make a name in literature. His first printed work was an essay, Sur les Moyens de prévenir l , Infanticide, which failed to gain the prize for which it was composed, but pleased Brissot so much that he printed it in vol. vii. of his Bibliothèque philosophique des Législateurs. Pétion’s next works, Les Lois Civiles, and Essai sur le Mariage, in which he advocated the marriage of priests, confirmed his position as a bold reformer, and when the elections to the States-General took place in 1789 he was elected a deputy to the Tiers Etat for Chartres. Both in the assembly of the Tiers Etat and in the Constituent Assembly Pétion showed himself a radical leader. He supported Mirabeau on 23d June, attacked the queen on 5th October, and was elected president on 4th December 1790. On 21st June 1791 he was chosen one of three commissioners appointed to bring back the king from Varennes. After the last meeting of the assembly on 30th September 1791 Robespierre and Pétion were made the popular heroes and were crowned by the populace with civic crowns. Pétion received a still further proof of the affection of the Parisians for himself on 14th November 1791, when he was elected second mayor of Paris in succession to Bailly. In his mayoralty he exhibited clearly his republican tendency and his hatred of the old monarchy, especially on 20th June 1792, when he allowed the mob to overrun the Tuileries and insult the royal family. For neglecting to protect the Tuileries he was suspended from his functions by the Directory of the department of the Seine, but the leaders of the Legislative Assembly felt that Pétion’s cause was theirs, and rescinded the suspension on 13th July. On 3d August, at the head of the municipality of Paris, Pétion demanded the dethronement of the king, and on 10th August, while the monarchy was falling with the Tuileries, he patiently underwent a form of detention in his own mairie. He was still mayor of Paris when the massacres of September in the prisons took place, and must bear the blame of not having endeavoured to interfere. He was elected to the Convention for Eure-et-Loir, and became its first president. Manuel then had the folly to propose that the president of the Assembly should have the same authority as the president of the United States; his proposition was at once rejected, but Pétion got the nickname of “Roi Pétion,” which contributed to his fall. His jealousy of Robespierre allied him to the Girondin party, as did also his assiduous attention at Madame Roland’s salon. With the Girondins he voted for the king’s death and for the appeal to the people, as one of them he was elected to the first committee of general defence in March 1793, as their representative he attacked Robespierre on 12th April, and it is no matter of wonder, therefore, that his name was among those of the twenty-two Girondin deputies proscribed on 2d June. Pétion was one of those who escaped to Caen and raised the standard of provincial insurrection against the Convention; and when the Norman rising failed he fled with Guadet, Buzot, Barbaroux, Salle, and Louvet to the Gironde, and hid in a grotto at St Émilion. At last, but a month before Robespierre’s fall in June 1794, the escaped deputies felt themselves tracked down, and deserted the grotto; Louvet found his way to Paris, Salle and Guadet to Bordeaux, where they were soon taken; Barbaroux committed suicide; and the bodies of Pétion and Buzot were found in a field, half-eaten by wolves.

For Pétion’s published works, see the edition of his Oeuvres, 3 vols., 1792; for his life, see the ridiculous eulogy in J. J. Regnault-Warin’s Vie de Pétion, 1792, and Mémoires inédits de Pétion et Mémoires de Buzot et de Barbaroux, with an introduction by C. A. Dauban, 1866; and for his last days and death, see C. Vatel, Charlotte Corday et les Girondins, 3 vols., 1872.
