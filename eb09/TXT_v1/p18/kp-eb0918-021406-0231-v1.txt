PANTOGRAPH is an instrument for making a reduced, an enlarged, or an exact copy of a plane figure. One of the simplest forms is represented in fig. 1. Four links of wood or metal are jointed together so as to form a parallelogram ABCS. On two sides BA and BC produced points P and P' are taken in a line with S, so that the triangles PSA and SP'C are similar, as the sides of the one are parallel to those of the other. Hence SA/AP = P'C∕CS. Now the parallelogram ABCS is movable, its angles changing whilst its sides remain unaltered. The above ratio will therefore remain constant, and therefore again the points PSP' will always remain in a line. At the same time the ratio PS∕SP' does not change, as it equals the ratio PA∕AB. If then the point S be kept [9:18:215] fixed in a plane, and if P be made to describe any given figure, the point P' will describe another figure which is similar and similarly situated to the given one with S as centre of similitude, the ratio of similitude being PS: SP'. Thus if the point S be fixed at S fig. 2, and if P be made to describe the figure ABCD, then P' will describe the similar figure A'B'C'D'. For the geometry of figures which are similar and similarly situated, compare “Similar Figures” under Projection.

For practical working there is at P a steel tracer having a fine but not sharp point, and at P' a tracing pencil for drawing the copy, or sometimes a sharp steel point for at once engraving the copy on a plate of metal. To obtain the smooth and steady motion of the instrument required for delicate work, a variety of different constructions are in use under various names, but all rest on the above principle that three points are kept in a line with their distances in a constant ratio. It will be noticed if any three points T, Q, Q' in a line be taken, as in fig. 1, these fulfil the conditions required, so that, for instance, T might be taken as the fixed point, and Q, Q' as the tracer and pencil.
