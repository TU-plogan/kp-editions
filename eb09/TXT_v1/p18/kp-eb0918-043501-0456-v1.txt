+=====================================================================+


PAULUS, Heinrich Eberhard Gottlob (1761-1851), the distinguished representative of the rationalistic school of German theologians of the beginning of this century, was born at Leonberg, near Stuttgart, 1st September 1761. His father, the Lutheran clergyman at Leonberg, was convinced of the immortality of the soul by spiritualism, and was deprived of his living in consequence of his belief in the intercourse of departed spirits with men. He likewise required of his children unconditional obedience, and commanded them to believe the doctrines of religion without asking wherefore. The father’s spiritualism and dogmatism drove the son by natural reaction to the rationalism which prevailed at the time, and of which, in its application to Biblical history, Paulus became the most famous representative. He was educated at Tübingen, was three years headmaster of a German school, and then spent two years in travelling through England and the principal countries of the Continent. He subsequently published interesting passages from the journal of his tour. In 1789 he was chosen ordinary professor of Oriental languages at Jena. In addition to the studies of his own department he prosecuted especially mathematics, as the best preparation for clear thinking. At Jena he lived in close intercourse with Schiller, Goethe, Herder, and the most distinguished literary men of the time. In 1793 he succeeded Doederlein as professor of theology. His special work was the exposition of the Old and New Testaments in the light of his great Oriental learning and according to his characteristic principle of “natural explanation.” He held that miracles in the strict sense were impossible, that the events recorded in the Bible took place naturally, and that the narratives of the Gospels are the true reports of men who either were eyewitnesses or had obtained information from such as were. From a purely apologetic motive he sought to remove what other interpreters regarded as miracles from the Bible by distinguishing between the fact related and the author’s opinion of it, by seeking a naturalistic exegesis of a narrative, e.g., that επι της θαλάσσης (Matt. xiv. 25) means by the shore and not on the sea, by supplying circumstances omitted by the author, by remembering that the author produces as miracles occurrences which can now be explained otherwise, e.g. i exorcisms. The chief exegetical works of Paulus are his Philologisch-kritischer und. histor ischer Commentar uber das Neue Testament (4 vols., 1800- 1804), Clavis uber die Psalmen (1791), and Clavis über Jesaias (1793), and particularly his Exegetisches Handbuch über die drei ersten Evangelien (3 vols., 1830-33; 2d ed., 1841-42). His Life of Jesus (2 vols., 1828) is a synoptical translation of the Gospels, prefaced by an account of the preparation for the Christ and a brief summary of His history, and accompanied by very short explanations interwoven in the translation. The form of the work was fatal to its success, and the subsequent Exegetisches Handbuch rendered it quite superfluous. In the latter work Paulus really contributed much to a true interpretation of the Gospel narratives, notwithstanding his entire failure to explain the miracles away. The historical and geographical excursuses and dissertations interwoven in his commentaries are of considerable value. He was particularly well acquainted with the conditions of Oriental life. In the year 1803 Paulus left Jena on account of his health, and filled various posts in south Germany until 1811, when he became professor of exegesis and ecclesiastical history at Heidelberg. It was there that he found the freest scope for his great learning and tutorial abilities. He filled this chair until 1844, when he retired on account of his great age. He died, faithful to his first rationalistic position, a staunch friend of intellectual and political freedom and light, 10th August 1851, in his ninetieth year.

The literary labours of Paulus were not confined to exegesis. He edited a collected small edition of Spinoza’s works (1802-1803), a collection of the most noted Eastern travels (1792-1803), Schelling’s Vorlesungen über dis Offenbarung (1843), &c. He was also the author of Skizzen aus meiner Bildungs- und Lebensgeschichte (1839), and he left behind him the materials for a biography, which was published by Professor Reichlin-Meldegg, under the title II. E. G. Paulus und seine Zeit (1853).
