PHILOPOeMEN, “the last of the Greeks” as he was called by an admiring Roman, was a leading champion of the Achaean League, which preserved in Peloponnesus a last shred of Greek freedom. Sprung from an illustrious Arcadian family, he was born at Megalopolis in Arcadia in 252 B.c. His father Craugis dying in his infancy, Philopoemen was brought up by his father’s friend Cleander, an exile from Mantinea. In his youth he associated with Ecdemus and Megalophanes, who had studied the Academic philosophy under Arcesilaus, and had proved themselves friends of freedom by helping to rid Megalopolis and Sicyon of tyrants. Philopoemen soon distinguished himself in war and the chase. Hard-featured but of an iron frame, simple and hardy in his way of life, blunt and straightforward in speech and manner,^[1. The simplicity of his manners is illustrated by a tale like that of Alfred an<l the cakes, Plut., Phil., 2.] he was a born soldier, delighting in war and careless of whatever did not bear on it. Thus he would not practise wrestling because the athlete’s finely-strung habit of body is ill-fitted to bear the strain of a soldier’s life. He read books of a martial and stirring tone, like the poems of Homer, together with works on military history and tactics. Epaminondas was his pattern, but he could not school his hot temper into the unruffled patience of the Theban. Indeed we miss in this rugged soldier that union of refinement at home with daring in the field which had stamped the soldier-citizens of the best age of Greece. His leisure was devoted to the chase or to the cultivation of his farm, where he worked like one of his hinds. In 222, when Cleomenes king of Sparta made himself master of Megalopolis by a night attack, Philopoemen secured by his valour the retreat of the main body of the citizens to Messene, and encouraged them to refuse the insidious invitation of Cleomenes to return to their homes on condition of renouncing their connexion with the Achaean League. Thus baffled, Cleomenes laid the city in ruins and retired. At the battle of Sellasia (early summer 221), where Cleomenes was defeated by the combined Achaean and Macedonian forces under Antigonus, king of Macedonia, Philopoemen greatly distinguished himself by charging, without orders, at the head of the Megalopolitan cavalry and thus saving from defeat the wing on which he fought. His conduct won the admiration of Antigonus, who offered him a command in the Macedonian army, but he declined it and went to the wars in Crete. Returning after some time with fresh laurels, he was at once chosen to command the Achaean cavalry, which, from an ill-mounted, raw, and cowardly body he soon turned into a highly-trained and thoroughly efficient force; at the head of it he overthrew the Aetolian and Elean horse, and slew their commander with his own hand (209). He was elected general of the Achaean League for the first time in 208. In this, the highest dignity of the confederacy, he infused greater vigour and independence into the councils of the League than had been shown by Aratus, who had leaned on Macedonia and trusted to diplomacy rather than the sword. Philopoemen entirely changed the equipment and tactics of the troops of the League, substituting complete armour, long lances and large shields for the lighter arms hitherto in use, and adopting the Macedonian phalanx as the fighting order. But he did more: by example and precept he turned a nation of dandies into a nation of soldiers, who now spent on arms and accoutrements the wealth they had before lavished on dinners and dress. With the army thus transformed he defeated Machanidas, tyrant of Sparta, at the battle of Mantinea. The tyrant fell by Philopaemen’s hand, Tegea was taken, and Laconia ravaged. A bronze statue representing Philopoemen slaying Machanidas was set up at Delphi by the Achaeans. At the Nemean festival which followed the battle Philopoemen, then general for the second time, was hailed by the people as the liberator of Greece. Jealous of the degree of independence to ∖Λιich Philopoemen had raised the League, Philip king of Macedonia sent emissaries to murder him, but they were foiled. So great was the terror of his name that at the bare report that he was coming the Boeotians raised the siege of Megara and fled. When Nabis, successor of Machanidas in the tyranny of Sparta, seized Messene, Philopoemen, though he held no office at the time and the general of the League refused to stir, collected his fellow-townsmen and drove out the tyrant. In his third generalship (201-200) he mustered the Achaean forces with great secrecy at Tegea and, invading Laconia, defeated the troops of Nabis. The Romans were now about to cross the sea for the war with Philip of Macedonia, and Philopoemen was the means of preventing the Achaeans from concluding an alliance with Philip against Rome. At the expiry of his year of office he sailed once more to Crete, where he successfully led the troops of the Gortynians, beating the Cretans with their own weapons of craft and surprise. Philopoemen did not return to Peloponnesus till after the Romans under Flamininus had conquered Philip. He found the Romans and Achaeans making war on Nabis and was again elected to the generalship (192). Nabis was besieging Gythium, which with the other towns on the Laconian coast had been wrested from him by the Romans, handed over l>y them to the Spartan exiles, and attached to the Achaean League. Being defeated in an attempt to relieve Gythium [9:18:791] by sea, Philopoemen landed and surprised a part of the tyrant’s forces not far from that town, burned their camp, and slew many. After ravaging Laconia he marched on Sparta in the hope of compelling Nabis to raise the siege. But Nabis took Gythium and awaited the Achaeans in a pass. Philopoemen was surprised, but by skilful generalship he not only extricated himself but routed the Spartans and cut off most of the fugitives. When Nabis was assassinated Philopoemen hastened to Sparta and induced it to join the Achaean League. In the same year (192) Antiochus, king of Asia, crossed into Greece to fight the Romans. By the advice, or at least with the concurrence, of Philopoemen the Achaeans rejected the king’s proposal that they should remain neutral, and declared war against him and his allies the Aetolians. In the following year Diophanes, general of the League, hearing that Sparta showed signs of revolt, marched against it accompanied by Flamininus. Philopoemen had remonstrated in vain against this step, and he now boldly threw himself into Sparta, composed the disturbances, and closed the gates against Diophanes and Flamininus. The grateful Spartans offered Philopoemen a splendid present, but he bade them keep such bribes for their enemies. In 189 Philopoemen, again general, proposed and carried in an assembly, which he summoned at Argos, a decree that the general assembly of the League should meet in all the cities of the League in rotation, instead of, as hitherto, at Aegeum only. This measure was obviously meant to deprive Achaea of its position as head of the League, and to make the allied cities more equal. In the same year the Spartans made an unsuccessful attack on one of the maritime towns occupied by the exiles. As these towns were under Achaean protection the League required Sparta to surrender the authors of the attack. Far from complying, the Spartans put to death thirty partisans of Philopoemen and renounced their connexion with the League. The Achaeans declared war, and in the following spring (188) Philopoemen, having been re-elected general, marched against Sparta, which was forced to pull down its walls, to expel the foreign mercenaries and the slaves whom the tyrants had freed, to exchange the laws and institutions of Lycurgus for those of the Achaeans, and, lastly, to receive back the exiles. It would seem that on this occasion Philopoemen allowed his hatred of the old enemy of Megalopolis to overpower his judgment; his conduct was as unwise as it was cruel, for it afforded the Romans—what Philopoemen had hitherto been careful not to furnish them with—a pretext for meddling in the affairs of Greece. His treatment of Sparta was censured by the senate, and Roman officers in Greece remonstrated with the League on the subject. In 183, the last year of his life, Philopoemen was general for the eighth time (his seventh generalship perhaps fell in 187, but this is uncertain). He lay sick of a fever at Argos when word came that Messene, under Dinocrates, had revolted from the League. At first he despatched his friend arid partisan Lycortas to put down the revolt, then growing impatient, in spite of the fever and his seventy years, he hurried in a single day to Megalopolis, and, taking with him the cavalry of his native town, entered Messenia and routed Dinocrates. But, the enemy being reinforced, he was compelled to fall back over broken ground. In his anxiety to cover the retreat of his troopers he was left alone, and, his horse stumbling, he was thrown to the ground and taken prisoner. He was conducted with his arms pinioned through the streets of Messene and cast into a dungeon. At nightfall on the second day an executioner was sent to him with a cup of poison. Seeing the light and the executioner standing by, Philopoemen sat up with difficulty, for he was weak, and, taking the cup in his hand, he asked the man, What tidings of the cavalry? Being told that they had mostly escaped, he bowed his head and said that it was well. Then he drained the cup and lay down to die. Swift vengeance overtook his murderers. The indignant Achaeans, under Lycortas, ravaged Messenia, and when the capital surrendered all who had had part in the murder of Philopoemen were obliged to kill themselves. Dinocrates had already committed suicide. The body of Philopoemen was burned, and his bones conveyed to Megalopolis with every mark of respect and sorrow, the urn, almost hidden in garlands, being borne by his fellow-townsman, the historian Polybius. Numerous statues were set up and honours decreed to him in the cities of the League. After the destruction of Corinth by Mummius some one proposed to destroy the statues of a man who had been no friend of the Romans · but the Roman general rejected the base proposal.

Philopaemen’s lot was cast in evil days. Hardly were the Achaeans freed by him from Macedonia when they had to submit to Rome. His policy towards the Romans was marked by a prudence and moderation hardly to be expected from one of his passionate nature. He saw that the final subjugation of Greece was inevitable, but he did his best to delay it, not by a war which would only have precipitated the catastrophe, but by giving the Romans no ground for interference, and by resisting their encroachments, so far as this could be done, by an appeal to reason and justice.

Our authorities for the life of Philopoemen are Polybius, Livy, Plutarch, and Pausanias. Polybius’s work on Philopoemen was in three book , but it is lost. Plutarch’s biography, like the account in Pausanias (viii. 49-51), is based on Polybius. ' (J. G. FR.)
