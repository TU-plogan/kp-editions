HEIM, François Joseph (1787-1865), French painter, belongs to that group of painters in whose works we find the special characteristics of the Restoration. Born at Belfort on 16th December 1787, he early distinguished himself at the École Centrale of Strasburg, and in 1803 entered the studio of Vincent at Paris. In 1807 he obtained the first prize, and in 1812 his picture of The Return of Jacob (Musée de Bordeaux) won for him a gold medal of the first class, which he again obtained in 1817, when he exhibited, together with other works, a St John —bought by Vivant Denon. In 1819 the Resurrection of Lazarus (Cathédral Autun), the Martyrdom of St Cyr (St [9:11:625] Gervais), and two scenes from the life of Vespasian (ordered by the king) attracted attention. In 1823 the Re-erection of the Royal Tombs at St Denis, the Martyrdom of St Laurence (Notre Dame), and several full-length portraits increased the painter’s popularity; and in 1824, when he exhibited his great canvas, the Massacre of the Jews (Louvre), Heim was rewarded by the legion of honour. In 1827 appeared the King giving away Prizes at the Salon of 1824 (Louvre—engraved by Jazet)—the picture by which Heim is best known—and Saint Hyacinthe. Heim was now commissioned to decorate the Gallery Charles X. (Louvre), work for which he was thought eminently fit. Like many other painters of this period, Heim retained only enough of the high-pitched ideal of David to make an awkward contrast with the lively colour and movement by which he tried to give interest to his subjects, and with the emptiness of form and expression which resulted from the hasty execution necessitated by the vast number of his commissions. Ridiculed by the romantists, Heim maintained his position, and replaced Régnault at the Institute in 1834, shortly after which he commenced a series of drawings of the celebrities of his day, which are of much interest. His decorations of the Conference room of the Chamber of Deputies were completed in 1844; and in 1847 his works at the Salon—Champ de Mai and Reading a Play at the Théâtre Français—were the signal for attacks renewed with great violence. Yet something like a turn of opinion iu his favour took place at the exhibition of 1851; his powers as a draughtsman and the occasional merits of his composition were recognized, and toleration extended even to his colour. Heim was awarded the great gold medal, and in 1855—having sent to the Salon no less than sixteen portraits, amongst which may be cited those of Cuvier, Geoffroy de St Hilaire, and Madame Hersent— he wιs made officer of the legion of honour. In 1859 he again exhibited a curious collection of portraits, sixty-four members of the Institute arranged in groups of four; and six years later, on 29th September 1865, he died, at the age of seventy-eight. Besides the paintings already mentioned, there is to be seen in Notre Dame de Lorette (Paris) a work executed on the spot; and the museum of Strasburg contains an excellent example of his easel pictures, the subject of which is a Shepherd Drinking from a Spring.
