HASLINGDEN, a market-town of Lancashire, England, is situated 7 miles S.E. of Blackburn, in a hilly district on the borders of the forest of Rossendale, and is supposed by some to derive its name from the hazel trees which at one time abounded in its neighbourhood. The town formerly stood on the slope of a hill, but the modern part, which is substantially built of stone, has been erected at its base. The parish church dedicated to St James was, with the exception of the tower, which dates from the time of Henry VIEL, rebuilt in 1780, and the whole structure was restored in 1879. Handsome schools are attached, to which there is an endowment for ten poor boys, founded in 1749. The principal other buildings are the mechanics’ institute, the town-hall, where the sessions and county court are held, and the public hall for assemblies. The woollen manufacture, formerly the staple of the town, has now been superseded by that of cotton, and there are also silk manufactures, iron-works, and size-works. In the vicinity there are collieries and quarries for stone, flags, and slate. The population of the town in 1861 was 6929, and 7698 in 1871, and that of the township was 10,109 and 12,000.
