HEIBERG, Johan Ludvig (1791-1860), Danish poet and critic, was the son of the political writer Peter Andreas Heiberg, and of the famous novelist, afterwards the Baroness Gyllembourg-Ehrensvärd. He was born at Copenhagen, December 14, 1791. In 1800 his fatherwas exiled, and he was taken by Rahbek and his excellent wife into their house at Bakkehuset. They found him, however, very difficult to manage, and about 1802 sent him back to his own family. His mother’s marriage being by a state decree annulled, she married the Swedish baron Gyllembourg-Ehrensvärd, keeping up, however, friendly correspondence with her first husband in Paris. In 1805 she describes, in one of these letters, the brilliant precocity of the young Johan. The latter proceeded to the university of Copenhagen in 1809. It was not needful that he should earn his bread, and accordingly his mother indulged for many years his extraordinary thirst for knowdedge. In 1812 he visited Sweden, and made some long stay in Stockholm; he afterwards sent to his mother from Upsala the first important poem which he composed, Hfemkomsten (The Return Home), a piece of remarkable strength and brightness. In 1813 his first publication appeared, a romantic drama for children, entitled The Theatre for Marionettes. This was followed by Christmas Jokes and New Year , s Tricks in 1816, The Initiation of Psyche, 1817, and The Prophecy of Tycho Brahe. These works attracted attention at a time when Baggesen, Oehlenschläger, and Ingemann possessed the popular ear, and were understood at once to be the opening of a great career. In 1817 Heiberg took his degree, and in 1819 went abroad with a grant from Government. He proceeded to Paris, and spent the next three years there, under his father’s roof. In 1822 he published his drama of Nina, and was made professor of the Danish language at the university of Kiel. At this town he delivered a course of lectures, comparing the Scandinavian mythology as found in the Edda with the poems of Oehlenschläger. These lectures were published in German in 1827. In 1825 Heiberg came back to Copenhagen for the purpose of introducing the vaudeville^[1. He composed a great number of vaudevilles, ’ of which the best known are King Solomon and George Hatmaker, 1825; April Fools, 1826; A Story in Rosenborg Garden, 1827; Kfoge Huskors, 1831; The Danes in Paris, 1833; No, 1836; Yes, 1839; and Emily's Beating Heart, 1840.] on the Danish stage. Meanwhile he was producing dramatic work of a more serious kind: in 1828 he brought out the national drama of Elυerhoi, in 1835 the comedy of The Elves, and in 1838 Fata Morgana. In 1841 Heiberg published a volume of New Poems, containing “A Soul after Death,” which is perhaps his masterpiece, “The Newly Wedded Pair,” and other pieces. All this time he had been busily engaged in editing the famous journal, The C openhagen Flying Post, which he founded in 1827 and continued until 1837. In 1831 he married Johanne Louise Paetges, the greatest actress that Scandinavia has produced. Heiberg’s scathing satires at last began to make him very unpopular; and this antagonism reached its height when, in 1845, he published [9:11:622] his little malicious drama of The Nut Crackers. Notwithstanding this he received in 1847 the responsible post of director of the national theatre, for which indeed he was more eminently fitted than any other living person. He filled it for seven years, working with great zeal and conscientiousness, but was forced by intrigues from without to resign it in 1854. His health was much disturbed by these attacks, and he retired into private life. Heiberg died at Bonderup, near Ringsted, on the 25th of August 1860.

It has been said that “the average cultivated Dane nowadays is very much what Heiberg has made him.” His influence upon taste and critical opinion was greater than that of any writer of his time, and can only be compared with that of Holberg in the 18th century. Most of the poets of the Romantic movement in Denmark were very grave and serious; Heiberg added the element of humour, elegance, and irony to the dignity of Oehlenschlager, the pathos of Ingemann, and the passion of Hertz. His versification was refined and exact, and his very best pieces are those in which he mingles rich lyrical expression with what is satirical or purely ludicrous. The works of Heiberg were collected, in 11 vols., in 1861-62.
