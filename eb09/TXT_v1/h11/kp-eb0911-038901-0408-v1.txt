HALL, or Halle, Edward (oδ. 1547), an English lawyer who takes high rank among the earlier narrators of his country’s history, was born in London about the close of the 15th century and died in 1547, the year of the death of King Henry VIII. Though his name has all the appearance of a purely English word, it is none the less of foreign origin, John Hall of Northall, in Shropshire, our author’s father, tracing his lineage back to Frederick of Halle in Tyrol, natural son of Albert of Austria. From Eton Edward Hall passed to Cambridge, and according to some accounts it would appear that at a later date he was also a student at Oxford. Entering Gray’s Inn he was duly called to the bar; and we find him afterwards filling the offices of common sergeant, under-sheriff of the city of London, summer reader of Gray’s Inn (1533), double reader in Lent (1540), and judge of the sheriff court. The date of the first appearance of his chronicle has been matter of question; but it is generally agreed that there was no such edition as that of 1542 assigned by the older bibliographers to Berthelette. The real editio princeps is almost certainly that issued by Grafton in 1548, the year after Hall’s death, with a continuation compiled mainly from the author’s MSS.; it is remarkable, says Mr Hazlitt {Collections and Notes'), as having probably more variations in the copies than any book in the language. A reprint was published in 1809 under the supervision of Sir Henry Ellis, who, however, furnished neither introduction nor comment.

Hall’s work deserves a higher title than that of chronicle; partly, perhaps, by a happy accident, but partly also by the author’sjudicious management, it possesses no small unity of theme and construction. Beginning with the famous combat at Coventry between Henry of Hereford and Thomas Mowbray, it follows the tragic progress of the strife between York and Lancaster till it is brought to a close by the marriage of Henry VII. with Margaret of York, and then it shows England united and at rest under Henry VIII. The policy of this monarch is presented under a very favourable light, and in the religious question the author sides emphatically and intolerantly with Protestantism. For all kinds of ceremonial in utterance and action he has all a lawyer’s respect, and his pages are often adorned and encumbered with the pageantry and material garniture of his story. In his style he unites the redundant reduplication and painful particularization of his profession with that evident effort after balance of clauses and fanciful and forcible phraseology which not long afterwards resulted in “Euphuism.” On the whole the work is not only valuable but attractive. To the historian it furnishes what is evidently the testimony of an eye-witness on several matters of interest which are neglected by other narrators; and to the student of literature it has the exceptional charm of being one of the prime sources of Shakespeare’s historical plays. Compare James Gairdner, Early Chroniclers of Europe; England, London, 1879.
