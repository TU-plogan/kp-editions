HALA, or Halla (formerly known as Murtizâbâd), a town in Hyderabad district, Sind, India, situated on the Aliganj canal and immediately connected with the Trunk Road at two points, 25° 48' 30'' N. lat., 68° 27' 30" E. long. It was long famous for its glazed pottery and tiles, made from a fine clay obtained from the Indus, mixed with flints. The stisis, or trouser-cloths, for which the town is also celebrated, are manufactured to the value of .£750 yearly. Hâla was built about 1800 in consequence of old Hâla, 2 miles distant, being threatened with encroachment by the Indus. Among the antiquities round which the new town has grown up are the tomb and mosque of a pir or saint, who died in the 16th century, and in whose honour a fair, largely attended by Mahometans from all parts of the province, is held twice a year. The local trade, chiefly of grain, piece goods, ghi, cotton, and sugar, is valued approximately at £3900; the transit trade (in the same articles) at about £700. Population (1872), 4096, including 2646 Mahometans and 1234 Hindus.
