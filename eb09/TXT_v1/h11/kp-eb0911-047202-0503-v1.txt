HARDENBERG, Friedrich von (1772-1801), German poet and philosopher, best known as Novalis, was born on his father’s estate in the county of Mansfeld, in Prussian Saxony, May 2, 1772. He was of a shy, retiring, and thoughtful disposition, and was deeply influenced by his parents, who were strict members of the sect of Moravian Brethren. After attending the gymnasium of Eisleben he went as a youth of eighteen to the university of Jena, where he studied philosophy, mathematics, and the natural sciences. There he was treated with great kindness by Schiller, of whom he was a warm admirer. He studied law in Leipsic and Wittenberg, and in 1794 settled for a time in Teunstädt in order to-perfect himself in the practical work of the legal profession. During his residence in Tennstädt he formed a passionate attachment to Sophie von Kühn, a beautiful but delicate girl of thirteen, and with her consent obtained a promise from her parents that when she reached womanhood she should become his wife. In 1795 he was made auditor at the salt-works of Weissenfels, where his father was director. Two years afterwards his betrothed died, and for some time he seemed to be broken-hearted and to have lost all interest in life. In a few months, however, he went to the academy of mines at Freiberg, where he studied with a view to a higher appointment in connexion with the salt-works; and in the midst of his studies he became engaged for a second time, and was again able to look forward to a happy and useful career. He returned to Weissenfels in 1799, and was associated as assessor with the directorate of the salt-works. As he was preparing for his marriage in the autumn of 1800 he was alarmed by the sudden appearance of blood from the lungs. The wedding was postponed, and although he believed to the end that his recovery was certain, the disease made rapid progress, and he died on the 25th of March 1801. He was of a tall, slight, and graceful figure, with light brown hair and hazel eyes, and a face expressive of a calm, gentle, and meditative spirit. After his death his writings were issued in two volumes by his friends Ludwig Tieck and Friedrich Schlegel, and were rapidly recognized as important contributions to German literature. They are for the most part composed of fragments, of which the chief is Heinrich von Ofterdingen, an unfinished romance. Hardenberg is often spoken of as “the prophet of the Romantic school ;” and the phrase sufficiently marks his leading peculiarities. He took no part in the literary warfare carried on by his friends, but he shared to the full their strongest sympathies. Like them he intensely disliked those “enlightened” writers of the 18th century who had claimed to say the last word about human life through mere logic; he was penetrated by the conviction that there are elements in the world which cannot be grasped by the understanding, and which must be felt rather than reasoned about. Although he was fond of science and history, he moved most freely in the borderland between religion, philosophy, and poetry; and his prose writings are full of sayings which, although not easily intelligible, are impressive and stimulating. His diction is often simple and unostentatious, but it is rendered difficult both by the abstruseness of his themes and the remoteness of his allusions. As a poet he lacked definiteness of conception; his lyrics, however, especially those of a religious nature, have a certain tender beauty which gives them high rank in the serious literature of Germany. They are marked by deep feeling and by sweetness and grace of expression. He himself regarded a series of Hymns to Night as his best achievement, but it is in Heinrich von Ofterdingen that the majority of his admirers find the fullest utterance of his mystic aspirations, his passion for spiritual beauty, and his idealist philosophy.
