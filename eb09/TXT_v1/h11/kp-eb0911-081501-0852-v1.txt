HILDEBRANDT, Theodor (born at Stettin 1804, died at Düsseldorf 1874), was a disciple of the painter Schadow, and, on Schadow’s appointment to the presidency of a new academy in the Rhenish provinces in 1828, followed that master to Düsseldorf. Bred in the academy of Berlin, and finished under Schadow (1820-24), Hildebrandt began by painting pictures illustrative of Goethe and Shakespeare; but in this form he followed the traditions of the stage rather than the laws of nature. His artificial modes of thought were not, however, without admirers, and he produced rapidly Faust and Mephistopheles (1824), Faust and Margaret (1825), and Lear and Cordelia (1828). He visited the Netherlands with Schadow in 1829, and wandered alone in 1830 to Italy; but travel did not alter his style, though it led him to cultivate alternately eclecticism and realism. At Düsseldorf, about the year 1830, he produced Romeo and Juliet, Tancred and Clorinda, and other works of the same kind which deserved to be classed with earlier ones; but during the same period he exhibited (1829) the Robber and (1832) the Captain and his Infant Son, examples of an affected but kindly realism which captivated the public of the time, and marked to a certain extent an epoch in Prussian art. The picture which made Hildebrandt’s fame is the Murder of the Children of King Edward, of which the original, afterwards frequently copied, still belongs to the Spiegel collection at Halberstadt. It challenges comparison with a similar composition by Paul Delaroche, though rather to Hildebrandt’s disadvantage. Hildebrandt chose the moment when the children are asleep, and the murderers pause ere they smother their victims with a pillow. Delaroche with subtler sense of artistic propriety represented the princes seated on their bed, unconscious of the near approach of their assassins, whose vicinity is betrayed by a streak of light at the bottom of the door and the watching of a dog. The execution of Delaroche is spirited and delicate, that of Hildebrandt finished and smooth. But the German master, who was below Sohn and Schadow in power, is also naturally far below his French competitor. Comparatively late in life Hildebrandt tried his powers as an historical painter in pictures representing Wolsey and Henry VIII., but he lapsed again into the romantic in Othello and Desdemona, a fair replica of which, in Schulte’s collection at Düsseldorf, gives a good idea of his shiny, ineffective, technical execution. After 1847 Hildebrandt gave himself up to portrait painting, and in that branch succeeded in obtaining a large practice.
