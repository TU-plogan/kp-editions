HACO, or Hakon (c. 920-960), surnamed the Good, king of Norway, was the son of Harold Fairhair by a female slave, and was presented by Harold to King Athelstan of England, to mark his contempt for an insult he had received. The child was placed by a Norse warrior on Athelstan’s knee, who was thus made to observe the symbol of adopting a child that was base born. Athelstan did not, however, take vengeance on the innocent cause of his anger, but brought him up as one of his own sons. On hearing of the death of Harold, he supplied Haco with men and ships, and sent him to Norway to wrest the throne from Eric, eldest son of Harold, whose violent and cruel reign had during the life of his father gained him the general hatred of his subjects. The news of Haco’s arrival ia Norway spread, says the saga, “like fire through dried grass.” Eric at once took flight to Orkney and then to England, and Haco was chosen king at every “thing.” Haco, though himself a Christian, found it impossible in his time to establish Christianity in Norway. He ruled his kingdom with great justice and prudence, and gained for it many victories over the Danes by land and sea. He was slain in a great fight against the Danes, led by the sons of Eric, about the year 960.
