HAWFINCH, a bird so called from the belief that the fruit of the hawthorn (Cratoegus Oxyacantha) forms its chief food, the Loxia coccothraustes of Linnaeus, and the Coccothraustes vulgaris of modern ornithologists, one of the largest of the I inch family {FmngiUidοe'), and found over nearly the whole of Europe, in Africa north of the Atlas, and in Asia from Palestine to Japan. It was formerly thought to be only an autumnal or winter-visitor to Britain, but later experience has proved that, though there may very likely be an immigration in the fall of the year, it breeds in nearly all the English counties to Yorkshire, and abundantly in those nearest to London. There seems also to be good reason for supposing that it is yearly extending its range in the British Islands. In coloration it bears some resemblance to a Chaffinch, but its much larger size and enormous beak make it easily recognizable, while on closer inspection the singular bill-hook form of some of its wingfeathers will be found to be very remarkable. Though not uncommonly frequenting gardens and orchards, in which as well as in woods it builds its nest, it is exceedingly shy in its habits, so as seldom to afford opportunities for observation. As the genus Coccothraustes is now commonly restricted, it includes but this single species,—the Japanese form, at one time regarded as distinct, being considered by the latest authorities to be inseparable.
