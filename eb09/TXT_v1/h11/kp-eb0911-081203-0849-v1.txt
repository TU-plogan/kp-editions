HILARIUS, St, of Arles (c. 403-449), an eminent prelate and an able if unsuccessful defender of the liberties of the Gallican Church, was born about 403, and in early youth entered the abbey of Lerins, then presided over by his kinsman Honoratus (St Honoré). Having succeeded Honoratus in the bishopric of Arles in 429, he set about the discharge of his episcopal functions with unusual energy and zeal. Following the example of St Augustine, he is said to have organized his cathedral clergy into a “congregation,” devoting a great part of their time to social exercises of ascetic religion. As bishop of Arles he held the rank of metropolitan of Vienne and Narbonne, and in this capacity he came into collision in 444 with Leo the Great on the question of the deposition of one of his bishops (Chelidonius); this quarrel resulted in his being deprived of his lights as metropolitan to consecrate bishops, call synods, or exercise ecclesiastical oversight in the province, and in the edict of Valentinian HL, so important in the history of the Gallican Church, “ut episcopis Gallicanis omnibusque pro lege esset quidquid apostolicae sedis auctoritas sanxisset.” He died in 449, and his name was afterwards introduced into the Roman martyrology for commemoration on the 5th of May. Hilarius enjoyed during his lifetime a high reputation for learning and eloquence as well as for piety; his extant works (Vita S Honorati Arelateηsis Episcopi and Metrum in Genesin) compare favourably with any similar literary productions of that period. A poem, De Providentia, usually included among the writings of Prosper, is sometimes also attributed to Hilary of Arles.
