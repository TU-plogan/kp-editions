HEILSBRONN, or Kloster-Heilsbronn, a marketvillage in the Bavarian government of Middle Franconia, with a station on the railway between Nuremberg and Ansbach. In 1871 it had only 998 inhabitants, but in the Middle Ages it was the seat of one of the great monasteries of Germany. This foundation, which belonged to the Cistercian order, owed its origin to Bishop Otto of Bamberg in 1132, and continued to exist till 1555. Its sepulchral monuments, many of which are figured by Hocker, Heilsbronnischer Antiquitätenschatz (Ansbach, 1731-40), were of exceptionally high artistic interest, ten burgraves of Nuremberg (it was their hereditary burialplace), three electoral princes, five margraves of Brandenburg, and many other persons of note having been laid to rest within its walls. The buildings of the monastery have all disappeared, with the exception of the fine church, restored between 1851 and 1866. The “Monk of Heilsbronn” is the ordinary appellation of a didactic poet of the 14th century, whose Seven Degrees, Daughter of Sy on, and Life of Saint Alexius were published by Merzdorf at Berlin in 1870.
