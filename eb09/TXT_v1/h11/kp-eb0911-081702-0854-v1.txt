HILL, Aaron (1685-1749 or 1750), an English poet and miscellaneous writer, was born in London, 10th February 1685. Though left by his father in necessitous circumstances, he was educated first at Barnstaple and then till his fourteenth year at Westminster School, after which he went out to Constantinople, where Lord Paget, a relative of his mother, was British ambassador. Under the care of a tutor he then travelled through Palestine, Egypt, and a great part of the East, returning to England about 1703. Having subsequently quarrelled with his patron, he again went abroad as travelling companion to a Yorkshire baronet. On returning home he published in 1709 his History of the Ottoman Empire, which, according to his own admission, had far more success than it deserved. About the same time appeared his poem of Camillus, in honour of the famous Charles Mordaunt, earl of Peterborough; and in the same year he was made manager of Drury Lane Theatre, and afterwards of the Haymarket. Both those offices he soon after lost through his indiscretion, and the remainder of his life was spent partly in literary pursuits and partly in commercial speculations, which were all unlucky. One of these schemes called him to the Highlands of Scotland, and while there he wrote The Progress of Wit, being a Caveat for the use of an eminent Writer. The “eminent writer” was Pope, who had introduced Hill into the Dunciad, though in a way that was in fact complimentary. Hill died in 1749 or 1750, and was buried in Westminster Abbey. Two only of his seventeen dramas are now remembered, Zara and Merope, both adaptations from the French of Voltaire. His poetry is stilted and commonplace, and even the Progress of Wit never rises above a flippant smartness. Though a poor and tasteless poet, and afflicted with an overwhelming sense of his own importance, Hill was an honourable man, and his letters to Savage, on whom he conferred many benefits, show his character in a very amiable light. The Miscellaneous JForZ·s of Hill were published in 1753 in 4 vols. 8vo, and his Dramatic Works, to which a Life was prefixed, appeared in 1759 in 2 vols. 8vo.
