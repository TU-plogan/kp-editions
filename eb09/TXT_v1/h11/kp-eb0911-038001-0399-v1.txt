HALAS, a corporate town of Hungary, in the megye or county of Pest-Pilis-Solt-Kis-Kun, is situated about 76 miles S.S.E. from Budapest, in 46° 24' N. lat. and 19° 3Γ E. long. The most noteworthy buildings are the Calvinist and Roman Catholic churches, and the Jewish synagogue. IIalas contains also a Protestant gymnasium, various literary institutions, and a local tribunal. The inhabitants of the town and neighbourhood are mostly engaged in cattle-breeding and agricultural pursuits. Not far from Halas is a lake of the same name, containing an island which was once fortified, and served as a place of refuge to the inhabitants from the incursions of the Turks. Prior to 1876 Halas belonged to the old district of Little Cumania. In the spring of 1879 the town was much injured by floods. The population in 1870 amounted to 13,127, of whom the greater number were Magyars.
