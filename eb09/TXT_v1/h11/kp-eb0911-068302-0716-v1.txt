HERALDRY, though etymologically denoting all the business of the herald, has long in practice been restricted to one part of it only, and may be defined as the art of blazoning or describing in proper terms armorial bearings. It treats also of their history, of the rules observed in their employment and transmission, of the manner in which by their means families and certain dignities are represented, and of their connexion with genealogies and titular rank.

Particular symbols have in all ages been assumed by the various families of mankind, civilized and uncivilized. Such were the lion of the tribe of Judah, the S. P. Q. R. upon the standards of ancient Rome and the eagle surmounting them, the tattoo marks of the savages of America and the Pacific, the Danish raven, and the white horse of Saxony, which still remains carved upon the chalk downs of western England.^[1. The subject of ancient and especially of Greek “heraldry” is discussed by Curtius in a learned and interesting paper “Wappengebrauch und Wappenstyl im Alterthum” in the Abhandlungen der Königl. Akad. d. Wissenschaften zu Berlin (1874). See also article Gems, vol. x. p. 136.] Heraldry, however, is a purely feudal institution, coeval with close armour, devised possibly in Germany, adopted and improved in France, Spain, and Italy, and imported into England by the Norman invaders and settlers. Its figures have little or nothing to do with the older symbols, though these have occasionally been incorporated into its charges, and an apparent connexion thus established between them. These symbols, as has been well said, were the precursors and not the ancestors of heraldic bearings. The supposed connexion, however, misled the credulous heraldic writers of the 16th and 17th centuries, and caused them to attribute coats of arm3 to the heroes of sacred and profane history, who were certainly as ignorant of hèraldry as ever was Adam of genealogy.

“Arms” or “armories,” so called because originally displayed upon defensive armour, and “coats of arms” because formerly embroidered upon the surcoat or camise worn over the armour, are supposed to have been first used at the great German tournaments, and to have reached England, though to a very moderate extent, in the time of Henry II. and Coeur de Lion. To “blazon,” now meaning to describe a coat of arms, is the German “blasen,” to blow as with the horn, because the style and arms of each knight were so proclaimed on public occasions. The terms employed in heraldry are, however, mostly French or of French origin. Though now matters of form and ceremonial, and subject to the smile which attaches to such in a utilitarian age, armorial bearings were once of real use and importance, and so continued as long as knights were cased in plate, and their features thus concealed. At that time leaders were recognized in the field by their insignia alone, and these—both figures and colours—became identified with their fame, from personal became hereditary, were subject to certain rules of descent, and to the laws of property and the less certain rules of honour.

Froissart mentions a case in which a knight of the Scrope family could with difficulty be restrained from putting to death a prisoner because he wore the same bearings with himself. The last De Clare owed his death on the field of Bannockburn to his having neglected to wear his cotte d’armes; had he been recognized, his great value as a prisoner would have saved him. Also the loss of the battle of Barnet was in part attributed to the similarity between the royal cognizance of a sun and that of John de Vere, a star with streamers,—Warwick charging Oxford by mistake for the king.

The best if not the only absolutely safe evidence for the origin of armorial bearings is that afforded by seals. Seals were in common use both before and after the introduction of armorial bearings, and they are not so likely as rolls of arms or monumental effigies to be the work of a later age. There are said by Courcelles to be extant, appended to charters of 1030 and 1037 a.d., two seals of Adalbert, duke of Lorraine, which bear on a shield an eagle with wings closed. This however wants confirmation; but Anna Comnena, describing the shields of the French knights who visited Constantinople about 1100, gives their surfaces as of metal only, polished but plain; nor have any decided traces of arms been discovered among the early crusaders. Louis le Jeune, who seems first of the French kings to have used the fleur-de-lys, caused it to be represented in gold over the azure mantle and chaussures worn by his son at his coronation. Also, in 1180, he seals with a fleur -de-lys, but it is placed in a circle, not upon a shield. Planché cites two seals of Philip, count of Flanders, one plain, in 1157, and another in 1164 charged with a lion, their subsequent bearing. Seton mentions the seal of John de Mundegumbri in 1170 as bearing a fleur-de-lys, which, like that of Louis, has two intermediate flower-stems, as seen on Florentine coins. He also gives the seal of Falconer (1170) as bearing a falcon; and that of Corbet bore two ravens perched upon a fleur-de-lys, while his brother bore them upon a tree. This indeed was at a period when fleurs-de-lys, stars, and various animals were commonly represented as mere ornaments on seals, but the peculiarity of the instances named is that the falcon and the raven, like the fleur-de-lys of France, were afterwards the heraldic bearings of those families. The seals of the close of the 12th century, though not generally heraldic, certainly betray many of the elements of heraldry. No doubt, when once introduced, armorial bearings were felt to supply a real and serious want, and came rapidly into use, but Wace, the poet of the reign of Henry II., although he tells us that

“N’i a riche home ne Baron, Ki n’ait lez li son gonfanon, U gonfanon u altre enseigne,”

can scarcely be seriously held to mention armorial bearings.

It is uncertain at what period armorial bearings found their way into England. The Conqueror and his successors certainly did not use them; they do not appear upon their seals, nor are they shown upon the banners of the Bayeux tapestry. The monk of Marmoutier, probably a contemporary, describes Henry I., upon the marriage of his daughter to Geoffrey of Anjou in 1122, as hanging about the bridegroom’s neck a shield adorned with small golden lions, “leonculos aureos;” and, making mention of a combat in which Geoffrey was engaged, he describes him as “pictos leones praeferens in clypeo.” It is true that the number, attitude, and position of these lions on the shield are not specified, but considering that not long afterwards two lions became the arms of Plantagenet, and so of England, this may fairly be taken as their introduction. Stephen is said to have used a centaur, Sagittarius, as an emblem, because he landed in England when the sun was in that sign, but on his great seal his shield is quite plain, save a ridge down the .centre, evidently a part of its construction. On the seals of the Conqueror, Rufus, and Henry I., only the hollow or under side of the shield is shown; so there probably was no design upon the front. There is no seal of Duke Robert, but William, earl of Flanders, his son, shows a [9:11:684] plain shield on his seal. His monumental effigy (1128) bears a large pavesse shield, and upon it an escarbuncle, apparently a highly ornamented clamp. The seal of Henry II. also shows the hollow of the shield. The first great seal of Richard I. bears a lion rampant, who from his position may be inferred to be fighting with a similar lion upon the sinister and concealed half of the shield, blazoned in a MS. cited by Mr Way as “two lion3 confrontés.”

Up to this time the kings, though represented on horseback and in full armour, have the face uncovered, and therefore their persons would be known. The seal of Richard I. in 1189 shows a close helmet, and upon the shield two lions passant gardant in pale, “leones lopardés,” as they were then or soon after called. On a later seal, after his return from captivity in 1194, Richard added a third lion. John, while earl of Mortaine, sealed with two lions, but his seal as king bears three, and the coat has so remained. That the two lions were more than a mere ornament is evident from their having been adopted by John’s natural son, Richard de Warren, who seals with two lions passant regardant. The seals of the great barons show the growth of the practice. Richard, constable of Chester, contemporary with Stephen, bears a shield covered over with small plates, tegulated, like his armour; but Stephen, earl of Richmond, as early as 1137, seals with seven fleurs-de-lys, a very early heraldic seal. Waleran, earl of Meulan (died 1166), also used an heraldic seal. Duchesne gives a seal of Bouchard de Montmorenci (1182), a contemporary of Louis le Jeune, with a cross between four alerions on his shield, and another in whch the cross is charged with roundels. Mathieu, his son, seals also with the cr0s3 and alerions, which had evidently become, as they remained, hereditary. In England, William, earl of Essex (died 1190), seals with the escarbuncle of his family. In 1187 Gervase Paganel, a great Anglo-Norman baron, seals with two lions passant, which his family continued to bear.

With the 13th century arms came rapidly into use. The second seal of Mathieu de Montmorenci in 1209 has them introduced upon his horse furniture, but this practice does not appear upon the seals of the kings of England until the second seal of Edward I. Baldwin de Bethune, earl of Albemarle (died 1214), sealed with three martlets in chief, and many other early examples of regular heraldic seals occur at this period attached to extant charters. The earliest roll of arms is of the reign of Henry III.; of a second of the same reign a copy is preserved in the Harleian collection; and a third, in the next reign, is the roll of Caerlavrock, 1300 ad. So that for the reign of Henry and his son the evidence for armorial bearings is copious and excellent. Other rolls exist carrying the practice through the 14th and 15th centuries, before the middle of which there is no known work on heraldry, nor any trace of heraldic regulations save what may be deduced from recorded practice.

Coats of arms were not at first strictly hereditary, nor even always permanent in the same person. Thus William de Ferrars, 6th earl of Derby (died 1216), seems to have borne “argent, 6 fers de cheval, or horse shoes, 3, 2, 1, sable.” William, his son, in consequence of a match with Peveril, who bore “vair,” changed his bearing to “vair, or and gules, on a border azure 8 horse shoes argent.” Robert his son, 8th earl (died 1278), dropped the horse shoes, and bore “vair, or and gules.”

“Ferrars his tabard with rich vair yspread.”

After the match with Quincy, the Ferrarses laid aside their own coat and bore that of Quincy, “gules, 7 mascles conjoined 3, 3, 1, or.” Their male heir through a younger branch, —Ferrers of Baddesley-Clinton,—commemorates these various changes by bearing “quarterly,—(1st) vair, or and gules; (2d) sable, 6 horse shoes, 3, 2, 1, argent; (3d) gules, i mascles, 3, 3, 1, or, a canton ermine.” Hugh Lupus, earl of Chester (died 1101), is fabled to have borne a wolf’s head, and not improbably his surname arose from some such emblem. Richard, his son, is said to have borne “azure, semée of crosslets or, a wolf’s head erased argent” Ranulph Meschines, 3d earl (died 1128), was sister’s son to the first earl, and to him is assigned “or, a lion rampant gules.” Hugh Cyfeliøc, 5th earl (died 1180), certainly bore “azure 6 garbs of wheat, 3, 2, 1, or;” and Ranulph Blondevile, his son, bore “azure, 3 garbs or.” With him the line failed, but as the wheat-sheaf is a common Cheshire bearing, it is probable that arms came into general use in the palatinate, in the time of the last two earls.

Sir Nicholas Carru (died 1283) seals with a tricorporate lion, but at Caerlavrock in 1300 is found with a

“Banière et jaune bien passable, O trois passans lyons de sable/’ the arms of the Carews of our day. The fess and label of Saher de Quincy, earl of Winchester, in 1170, were changed by Roger his son for the mascles by which they were best known, and which he repeats upon his housings. The fact is that, at the close of the 13th century, arms, though on the whole hereditary, had not quite acquired that fixed character that belonged to them half a century later. That the changes were the exception rather than the rule is, however, clear from the roll of Henry IΠ., and from the arms of the forty great barons which he caused to be painted on the walls of Westminster Abbey, almost all of which, so far as they are on record, are the same with those borne or quartered by their representatives. There exist also in England a few families of Norman origin, the period of whose arrival in England is known, and whose arms are the same with those of the present stock in the parent country. Such are Harcourt of Ankerwyke and D’Aubigny, who therefore bore their arms before the separation from Normandy under Henry III.

Early bearings were usually very simple, the colours in strong contrast, and their form and outline such as could readily be distinguished even in the dust and confusion of a battle. They are mostly composed of right lined figures known in heraldry as ordinaries. The favourite beast is the lion.

The earliest and most valuable records relating to English armorial bearings are undoubtedly the rolls of arms of the reigns of Henry III and the first three Edwards, which have been well edited by Sir II. Nicolas. That of Henry III. known as Glover’s roll, drawn up between 1243 and 1246, describes or blazons 218 coats of arms, and therefore shows very sufficiently the heraldry of the period. Of these coats nearly one-half are composed solely of the ordinaries and subordinaries, and other simple lines and figures. About two score of them exhibit lions, chiefly rampant, and leo-pardés, a form of the sune animal. The only other beast is the “teste de sanglier” borne by Swinburne. Of birds there are but the eagle and the papagay, several martlets, and single examples of the raven, the cock, the heron, and the horiole. The luce or pike is the only fish. The cinquefoil and sexfoil, the fleurde-lys, the rose, and the wheat-sheaf, used very sparingly, represent the vegetable world. For the rest there are annulets, barnacles, crescents, estoiles, escallops, fers de cheval, mullets, and water budgets. There is one ray of the sun, and one whirlpool.

The coat of Mortimer “barré, a chef palée,a corner geren-née d’or et d’azur, a ung escucheon d’argent,”—or, in modern terms, “harry, a chief paly, its corners gyronny or and azure, an escutcheon argent ’’ (fig. 63),—is the only one at all of a complex character, and this is composed of ordinaries and subordinaries'; and though many of the ordinaries bear the smaller charges, or are placed between them, there are very few examples of an ordinary so charged also [9:11:685] placed between charges, a common usage in later coats. An exception is Chandos, who bears three estoiles on a pile, which again is placed between six others; but this stands alone.

The roll of Edward II. blazons 957 coats of the bannerets of England, so that the use of arms had increased considerably. The lions have risen to 225, the eagles to 43; and there are 102 crosses of various kinds. Of new beasts, fabulous or real, there are the griffin, the wyvern, the stag, wolf, goat, and greyhound: of new birds, the falcon ; of fishes, the dolphin. Of other objects the additions are the millrind, buckle, covered cup, chaplet, gauntlet, arrow, trumpet, hammer, battle-axe, palmer’s staff, pots, winnowing fans or vans, pens, cushions, and chessrooks. The character of the arms remains very simple, and the blazon employed agrees in the main with that still in use, and is in general perfectly intelligible. These rolls give various examples of changes of coats, either altogether or by the introduction of a difference to distinguish members of the same∣ family; and it is observable that when the figures are altered the colours are usually adhered to, as though it were considered undesirable to change them. Thus Gilbert de Segrave (died 1254) bore “sable, 3 garbs argent.” Of his grandsons John and Nicholas, John bore the paternal coat, but Nicholas, at Caerlavrock, had exchanged the garbs for a lion. This afterwards became the family bearing as “sable, a lion rampant argent, crowned or,” the colours being retained.

No sooner had the great barons assumed arms for themselves than they began to grant them to their followers. Arms so granted commonly bore some resemblance to those of the grantor, and hence certain charges prevailed in certain districts. Thus the chevron of De Clare was common in South Wales, in the Honours of Gloucester and Clare, and about Tonbridge. The garb or wheat-sheaf was found in Cheshire; the cinquefoils of the Bellomonts in Leicestershire; the annulets of Vipont in Westmoreland; the lion all over England, and the tressure in Scotland, both from the royal arms. Some of these grants remain; others can with certainty be inferred. Stephen Curzon, who held under the earls of Derby, bore “vair, with a border of 8 popinjays argent,” and Richard, his brother, bore “vair, on a fess 3 horse-shoes.” Hubert, earl of Kent, bore “7 lozenges vair ;” and Anselm de Guise, on taking under him lands in Berks and Gloucester, assumed the same coat, with the addition of a canton or, charged with a mullet sable. In 1349 Robert Morle granted to Robert de Corby and his heirs the arms “d’argent, ove un saltier engrailé de sable,” which he himself had inherited from Baldwin de Manoirs. In 1356-7 William, baron of Greystock, who bore “harry of 6 argent and azure, 3 chaplets gules,” granted to Adam de Blencowe and his heirs for ever “an escutcheon sable with a bend closetted [or barred] argent and azure, with 3 chaplets gules.” In 1391-2 Thomas Grendale granted to William Morgue his heirs and assigns, “argent, on a cross azure 5 garbs or,” which, as cousin and heir, he himself hid inherited from John Beaumeys. Finally, in 1442, Humphrey, earl of Stafford, who bore “or, a chevron gules,’ granted to Robert Whitgreaves “un escue d’azure, a quatre points d’or, quatre chevrons de gules,” to him and hi3 heirs, of lineage,—in modern terms “azure, a cross quarter-pierced or, on each limb a chevron gules.” A coat o. arm3 was not only heritable, subject to certain heraldic customs, but could, be willed or granted away, wholly or in part, like chattel property.

The crusades, by bringing together soldiers of different nations, tended to produce a certain assimilation in their heraldries, but their influence upon the arms themselves has been exaggerated. The stories as to bearings adopted to commemorate feats of arms in Palestine are mostly inventions. The cross no doubt was a crusading bearing, but it was so because it was the emblem of Christianity, and primarily popular as such. The stars, torteaux, water budgets, and other charges attributed to the crusaders, were of earlier date and of independent origin. There is no evidence that the crosses pâtée of the Berkeleys, or the crosslets of Beauchamp, Clinton, Windsor, and Howard, were added to their simpler bearings in token of services in the Holy Land. The star of De Vere, always attributed to an adventure there, was evidently a mark of cadency, adopted by Robert de Vere, brother of Alberic, 2d earl of Oxford. The fact appears to be that most of the additions to or alterations in the earlier coats of arms were made for some genealogical reason, to commemorate a match with some great family or to distinguish between the several branches from the parent tree. After, usually long after, the period of the crusades, arms were invented for “fabled knights in battles feigned,” and but few of the Saracens’ heads which figure so formidably in many coats of arms are contemporary with any Saracenic war.

The diversion of the tournament did even more than actual war to promote the glories of heraldry. On these occasions the presence of spectators, and especially of ladies, encouraged all sorts of heraldic display. At a tournament at Calais in 1381 Richard Beauchamp, earl of Warwick, one of the most accomplished knights of the reigns of Richard II., Henry IV., and Henry V., suspended on three shields three several coats of arms, as representing three several knights who professed to be ready successively to meet all comers. Three Frénch knights appeared to the challenge. Against the first the earl came forth as the green knight with a black quarter, bearing “silver, a maunch gules,” the arms of De Tony, a maternal ancestor, and so overcame his adversary and retired unknown to his pavilion. On the second day he appeared as the green knight, and bearing “silver, .two bars gules,” the arms of Mauduit of Hanslape, another ancestor, he met a second knight with equal success. On the third day he appeared in his proper person bearing the arms of Guy of Warwick and Beauchamp on his shield, and those of De Tony and Mauduit on his caparisons, and thus with great honour won the third day also.

The shield, as the most obvious piece of the defensive armour, was that upon which arms were first displayed. The Norman shield was of wood covered with hide, and clamped and stiffened in a fashion which is thought to have given rise to the first simple bearings. It was 3 to 4 feet long, pointed below, and 18 inches broad. This shield is common on early monumental effigies armed in chain mail, and it is unusual to find it with armorial bearings. It was succeeded by the small triangular heater shield, and that, in the reign of Edward III., by a somewhat larger and full bottomed shield, which by degrees ceased to be used in war, and became more and more an architectural ornament. The arms were also displayed upon the breast-plate, and upon the camise or surcoat that covered the armour, and were repeated upon the housings of horses both before and behind the saddle. When the Comte d’Artois fell at Damietta, the Saracens showed 1 » in triumph his “cotte d’armes toute dorée et fleur-de-lisée.” The emperor Henry of Luxembourg is described in the Chronicle of Flanders as bearing “an aigle noir, sur un tornicle d’or qui pendoit jusq’ a mi-jambe.” Sir Alexander Nevile appeared at Halidon Hill in a surcoat of his own arms, the quarters filled up with the arms of his friends. The fine effigy of William de Valence at Westminster is decorated with small escutcheons of his arms on various parts of his dress and weapons. An actual remnant of the richly embroidered surcoät of William de Fortibus, earl of Albemarle (died 1261), is still preserved, and has been engraved in the [9:11:686] Archceologia. It was against the embroidery of the surcoat that the severe sumptuary enactments of Richard and Philip Augustus were mainly directed.

The importance attached to armorial bearings is strongly shown in the uses to which they were applied. A sovereign who wished to assert his claim to a kingdom placed its arms upon his shield. In 1479 when Alphonso of Portugal resigned his claim to Castile, he was required to lay aside its armorial ensigns. It appears that when Edward III. assumed the French lilies, he at first did so simply as representing his mother, who was an heiress, and placed her arms in his second quarter; when, however, he claimed the kingdom of France in her right, he removed the lilies to the first quarter as representing the more important kingdom. A grant of arms at the hand of a sovereign had great value. Among the more solid bribes which Louis XI. bestowed upon the courtiers of Edward IV. occurs a grant of three fleurs-de-lys to a knight of the Croker family. Thus also when Juan de Orbieta captured Francis I. on the Ticino, he was rewarded by a grant of arms from Charles V.,.though of so complex a character as to do little credit to Spanish heraldry. In later times John Gibbon, the heraldic author, having a quarrel with two maiden ladies of his name, obtained a licence to convert the scallops in their common coat into the black balls called ogresses,—a most heraldic revenge.

Armorial bearings were largely painted, enamelled, and embroidered upon personal ornaments, furniture, and weapons. The sword of Edward, prince of Wales (died 1483), is a curious example of this; it bears on its pommel the words “aves fortes” and five shields :—(1) England, (2) the duchy of Cornwall, (3) England and France with a label, (4) Mortimer quartering Ulster, (5) the earldom of Chester. In the middle is the cross of St George. The citizens of London were bound to provide their banner bearer, Lord Fitz Walter, with “a saddle with his arms,” and the seal of one of that family, about 1300, shows the arms upon the back or rest of his war saddle. The seal of Sir Hugh le Despenser (1292) also so shows his arms. Various bequests of plate and furniture with arms occur in the 14th century. In 1368 William, Lord Ferrars of Groby, bequeathed his green bed “with his arms thereon, and his furniture bearing the arms of Ferrars and Ufford, impaled.” In 1380 Edward Mortimer devised “à notre tres chier friere John Gilbert, evesque de Hereford, une plate de argent pour espices et enamillés ove les armes de Mortimer en la face.”

Richard, earl of Arundel, in 1392, bequeathed a canopy of the arms of Arundel and Warren quarterly. In 1399 Eleanor Bohun, duchess of Gloucester, had a psalter with her father’s arms upon the clasps. In the Decorated and Perpendicular styles of architecture shields of arms are common ornaments. Those of benefactors were set up in church windows in glass, and those of a family in their houses. In the Scrope roll is a list of sixty-six churches in which the Scrope arms were set up, and the histories of Dugdale and Burton show us that nearly every church in Warwickshire and Leicestershire had a multitude of arms on its windows. Those still remaining in the east windows of Bristol cathedral are early and good examples of the arms of great barons, Berkeley, Clare, and Warren. They are also seen upon floor tiles of the same period.

As arms became hereditary, and their use ceased to be confined to the battle-field, but was largely extended to seals and ornaments, it was natural that some notice should be taken of the arms of females, and that the wife’s coat should be combined in some way with that of the husband, especially when she was the last of, and represented, her family. This seems first to have been managed by giving the wife a separate shield. The kings of France so bore the arms of Navarre after the marriage with the heiress of that kingdom. Another very early plan was to form a composite coat. Thus the old coat of Willoughby was fretty, but on their marriage with Bec of Eresby they adopted the coat of Bec, and Sir John Willoughby (13th Edward III.) bears the cross moline of Bec, but the wings of his crest are fretty for Willoughby, and on either side is a buckle taken from the arms of Roscelin, his wife. Rose of Kilravock bore “or, 3 water budgets sable,” but on a marriage with the heiress of Chisholm they added “a boar’s head couped gules” from her arms. S.o also Halyburton of Pitcur, who bore “or, on a bend azure 3 lozenges of the field,” after a marriage with another Chisholm heiress, added to their coat “3 boars’heads erased sable.” Bohun, who bore “azure, a bend argent, cotised or, between 6 lioncels rampant of the third,” is thought to have added the bend on the occasion of a marriage with Maud, daughter and heir of Milo, earl of Hereford. As this, however, led to complexity and indistinctness in the bearings, and the introduction of a second shield was obviously inconvenient, the method of impalement was devised, by which the sinister half of the shield was appropriated to the lady’s arms, at first under the process known as dimidiation. When, however, the lady was an heiress, a different plan was adopted which ultimately led to quartering or the marshalling of many coats in one shield, a practice, when pushed to any extent, quite inconsistent with the original use of coat armour. This also led to a corresponding alteration in the shape of the shield, which was expanded to contain the arms of each heiress who had married into the family, together with such other heiresses as her family had previously been allied with, so that when a Percy heiress married a Seymour, she added her heiress ancestors’ arms with her own arms to those of her husband, expanded in a similar fashion by the previous matches of his family. Thus the great shield of a family became a compendium of the family pedigree which, to those who could read its language, conveyed a considerable mass of semi-historical information. The defect of this system was that it only took account of heiresses, and did not provide for the purity of the whole descent, so that under it the children of a man of no birth who married a great heiress, would display all her quarterings, and no account would be taken of the absence of any on his side; and further, if it happened, as was actually the case in the last century with the Rodneys of Rodney-stoke, that a family, though ancient, had never intermarried with an heiress, they could display no quarterings.

In France and Germany and to some extent in Scotland a far more perfect system was pursued. There the genealogical escutcheon included the arms of every ancestor and ancestress, whether an heiress or not; thus one generation gave two coats, two generations four coats, and so on. “Seize quartiers” gave evidence of pure blood for four generations, and thirty-two quarters, the qualification for a canon of Strasburg, for five.

As the combinations out of which the early coats were formed were limited, it occasionally happened that two persons of the same nation bore the same arms, and this gave rise to disputes which, as matters connected with military discipline, came under the jurisdiction of the earl marshal. One of the earliest of these disputes is mentioned in the roll of Caerlavrock—

“Le beau Bryan de Fitz Aleyne,

De courtesie, et de honneur pleyn,

Ivi o baniere barrée,

De or et la gouls bien parée, Dont le chalenge estoit le pointz, Par entre lui et Hue Poyntz, Ki portoit cel ni plus ni moins, Dont merveille avoit meinte et meins.”

Cases of a similar character were decided between [9:11:687] Harding and St Loo in 1312, Warburton and Gorges in 1321, and Sytsylt and Fakenham in 1333, when Sir William Fakenham disputed the arms, “le champ de dise barretz argent et azure, supportez de cinq escocheons sables, chargés ovesque tant de lyons primers rampant incensés gules'” They were adjudged by a commission to Sytsylt. Hugh Maltby and Hamon Beckwith had a similar dispute in 1339. But by far the most celebrated dispute of this nature arose in 1384 between Sir Richard Scrope of Bolton and Sir Robert Grosvenor, for the right to bear the arms “azure, a bend or.” The greatest men in the country, including John of Gaunt, gave testimony on one side or the other, and it was shown that each family had used the coat beyond the memory of man. It was finally adjudged to Scrope, and Grosvenor was directed to bear “les ditz armes ove une pleyne border d’argent.” Grosvenor, however, declined to accept the arms so differenced, and assumed “azure, a garb or,” retaining his colours and marking his connexion with the old earls of Chester. It was proved, incidentally, that an ancestor of Grosvenor’s had granted his coat, with a difference, to William Coton of Coton. It is remarkable that both disputants are still represented in the male line, and continue the arms as then settled. Both families had previously had disputes with other parties, and the Scropes long afterwards had a quarrel with the Stanleys for the right to bear the arms of the Isle of Man. The matter was compromised by Edward IV. The Hastings and Grey de Ruthyn case, which rises to the rank of a tragedy, illustrates still more forcibly the value attached to a coat of arms. On the death, childless, in 1389, of John de Hastings, earl of Pembroke, a dispute arose for his heirship between Reginald Grey, his heir-general, and Edward Hastings, the heir male and of the name, but of the half-blood. A court military decided in favour of Grey. Pending the trial Hastings had ceased to difference his arms as a cadet, and assumed them unbroken. He was, however, ordered to bear them with a label, and for contumacy was imprisoned for sixteen years. A suit for arms was decided as lately as 1720 in Blount versus Blount, in the earl marshal’s court.

The same necessity that made it important to prevent the use of similar bearings by different families in the same country made it also necessary to distinguish between the bearings of different members of the same family, all of whom had a right to the paternal coat. As this right was strongest in the eldest son he alone bore the paternal arms unaltered (in French heraldry “sans brisure”); and the other sons were obliged to introduce some sufficient change, called in heraldry a “difference.” This was at first managed by inverting the colours or substituting one ordinary or one inferior charge for another, as a bend for a fess, martlets for mullets, and the like; and sometimes by the use of a coat compounded of the paternal bearing with that of an heiress. A multitude of these early differences occur in the rolls of Henry III. and Edward II., and in various early lists of arms. The family of Grey, always numerous, differenced their cadets in at least fourteen different ways, almost all preserving in some tangible form the paternal coat; and this was also the case with the very numerous family of Basset. Generally no rule is followed, save that on the whole some reference is retained either to the charges upon, or the colours of, the paternal coat. Very frequently, even in the earliest times, the eldest son differenced his father’s coat by a label. In the roll of Henry HI. the label occurs fifteen times, though not always as a difference. Gradually, however, it came to be used almost entirely for that purpose, and finally a set of marks, called of cadency, were devised for each of the sons, the label being the mark of the eldest during his father’s life.

All these rules and alterations were, however, the growth of a later age, and came into use as the bold and simple heraldry of the 13th and 14th centuries began to be overlaid with florid fancies. So long as heraldry represented a real want, its expressions were simple and intelligible, but as “villainous saltpetre” came into use and closed helmets were laid aside, and as skill and strategy rather than personal valour became the attribute of a leader, armorial bearings fell into disuse in war, and were no longer worn upon the person, or upon the horse trappings. But though armorial bearings ceased to be of actual use, they continued to be emblems of rank and family, and a mark of gentle blood. They became, however, exceedingly and often absurdly complex, partly because simplicity was no longer necessary, and partly because it was scarcely practicable, owing to the enormous increase in the number of the gentry, which produced a demand for new combinations.

The glories of heraldry reached their zenith in the reign of Richard II., with “youth at the prow and pleasure at the helm” of the vessel of the state, but it was not till the reign of Richard III. that it was thought necessary to place under specific control the whole heraldry of the kingdom; and this, in close imitation of the example of France, was done by the incorporation of the heralds into a college placed under the presidency of the earl marshal.

The office of the herald as the messenger of war or peace between sovereigns or between contending armies in the field is of far earlier date than the introduction of armorial bearings, but as these came into use they were gradually placed under his charge, and he took his specific name sometimes from that of the noble or leader who employed him, sometimes from one of his castle3 or titles of honour, and sometimes from one of his badges or cognizances, which the herald wore embroidered upon his dress and by which he was known. In the pages of Froissart and other chroniclers frequent mention is made of heralds-at-arms and their attendants the pursuivants, and we read of Somerset and York, Windsor, Chester, and Lancaster heralds, Clarencieux, Arundel, Fleur-de-Lys, and Leopard; and of pursuivants, Antelope, Blanch Lion, Falcon, Portcullis,, and many more. At an early period the principal heralds, and especially those attached to sovereigns, were called kings-at-arms, and as early as Edward I. an officer, called from his jurisdiction, Norroy, was placed in charge of the heraldries north of the Trent. It is probable that a herald was always attached to each order of chivalry, as Toison d’or to the Fleece, and Garter to the chief English order. Garter, however, was only officially appointed by Henry V., when he seems to have been recognized as the principal king-at-arms—“Principalis rex armorum Anglicanorum.” At the institution of the college, or soon afterwards, it was decided that its officers should be Garter, principal king-at-arms Norroy and Clarencieux, provincial kings north and south of Trent; six heralds, Windsor, Chester, Lancaster, Richmond, Somerset, and York; and four pursuivants, Rouge Croix, Blue Mantle, Rouge Dragon, and Portcullis; who constitute the present establishment, though some special officers have since been appointed, as a king-at-arms to the revived order of the Bath, and some others, not members of the college.

It became the duty of the new incorporation to take note of all existing arms, to allow none without authority, and to collect and combine the rules of blazoning into a system. To effect a supervision of the armorial bearings throughout the kingdom, it was necessary to visit the several counties. Such a commission of visitation seems to have been issued by Henry IV. as early as 1412, but the first regular commission acted upon was issued by Henry VIII., 1528-9, and the last early in the reign of James II. The visitations were taken about every thirty years, and for contemporary events are most valuable records. The provincial king, either [9:11:688] personally or by deputy, visited the capital town of each county in his division, and summoned the surrounding gentry to record their pedigrees, and show a title to their armorial bearings. The earl marshal’s court survived the fall of the house of Stuart, and a few causes relative to a right to particular arms were decided in the course of the last century, but its powers fell into disuse, and not long since it was finally abolished, and with it fell any pretence on the part of the. college to regulate, by compulsory authority, the heraldry of the kingdom. At present, however, notwithstanding the democratic tendencies of the age, armorial bearings are in greater demand than ever in England, and more or less coveted in the United States, and a good deal of the proper business of heraldry is still transacted within the college of arms, and a good deal more, irregularly and improperly, outside it. A considerable number of persons still bear arms derived from an ancestor who bore them before the institution of the college; others bear them under grants and patents from that body; and others still more numerous, who or whose fathers have risen from obscurity, have assumed arms according to their fancy, or under the uninstructed advice of some silversmith or finder of arms. The Smiths, said a distinguished member of the family, had no arms; they sealed their letters with their thumbs. It is to avoid so inconvenient a signet that the new men have recourse to the demi-lions and demi-griffins now so much in vogue, aud possibly because they are not aware that Garter and his colleagues are still willing to grant arms, crest, and motto, on terms within reach of almost every aspirant to chivalry.

There is no college or corporation of heralds in Scotland or Ireland; but in Scotland heraldry has been to the full as much considered, and at least as well regulated as in England. “Lyon-king at-arms,” “Lyon rex armorum,” or “Leo fecialis,” called from the lion on the royal shield, is the head of the office of arms in Scotland. When first the dignity was constituted is not known, but Lyon was a prominent figure in the coronation of Robert II. in 1371. The office was at first, as in England, attached to the earl marshal, but it has long been conferred by patent under the great seal, and is held direct from the crown. Lyon is also king-at-arms for the national order of the Thistle. He is styled “Lord Lyon,” and the office has always been held by men of family, and frequently by a peer. His powers have been declared by statute, and extend to fine and imprisonment. He is supreme in all matters of heraldry in Scotland. Besides the “Lyon depute,” there are the Scottish heralds, Islay, Rothesay, Marchmount, Albany, Ross, and Snowdown, with precedence according to date of appointment; and six pursuivants, Kintyre, Dingwall, Carrick, Bute, Ormond, and Unicorn. Heralds and pursuivants are appointed by Lyon.

In Ireland also there is but one king-at-arms, Ulster. The office was instituted by Edward VI. in 1553. The patent is given by Rymer, and refers to certain emoluments as “praedicto officio . . . . ab antiquo spectantibus.” The allusion is to an Ireland king-at-arms mentioned in the reign of Richard II. and superseded by Ulster. Ulster holds office by patent, during pleasure; under him are two heralds, Cork and Dublin; and four pursuivants, Athlone, and St Patrick Nos. 1, 2, and 3. Ulster is king-at-arms to the order of St Patrick. He held visitations in parts of Ireland from 1568 to 1620, and these and other records, including all grants of arms from the institution of the office, are kept in the Birmingham Tower, Dublin, under the charge of the present most courteous and learned Ulster, Sir B. Burke. The precedence of the three chiefs has been the subject of dispute, but is now generally arranged, Garter being followed by Lyon, and he by Ulster.

Heraldry should be studied with reference to the period in which it was a useful art, and in the simple examples of the 14th and 15th centuries. Before that period it was in a changing and elementary state; after it, it became merely ornamental, and its examples are complicated and debased. In a general treatise on the subject notice must of course be taken of the later as well as the earlier conditions of the art, but the greater number of the illustrations in the following pages are taken from the earlier and best examples.

A curious evidence of the vitality of heraldry, and of the desire of all mankind for ancestral distinctions, is afforded by its extension among the republics of the New World. The United States boast some excellent genealogical societies, and a great and very general desire is shown by individuals to trace their pedigrees to the stocks of the Old World, and to assume the arms proper to their name. The national emblem of the stars and stripes, now so widely and honourably known throughout the world, has been traced back to the paternal coat of the first and greatest president, George Washington, whose English ancestors bore “argent, 2 bars gules, in chief 3 mullets of the second.” In Canada, Australia, and other English colonies, the assumption of arms by individuals and by the community is not less general; and the republics of South America, of Spanish origin, almost all have adopted coats of arms. The Peak of Teneriffe, the Beaver, the Red Indian, contribute to the list of charges, and the clear firmament of Chili is indicated by a star. “Coupé d’azur sur gules, à une étoile d’argent en abîme.”

Divisions of Arms.

Armorial bearings may be conveniently divided into those of dominion, of a community, of office, of concession, family or paternal arms, and arms of alliance. To these may perhaps be added arms of attribution. There is also another division, or rather peculiarity, called canting arms, of which many of the former divisions present examples.

1. Arms of Dominion are those of a kingdom or a feudal lordship. The origin of such arms is often obscure. Those of the Isle of Man are three legs conjoined in triangle at the thigh (fig. 116), probably borrowed from the emblem of Sicily, the ancient Trinacria, found upon Greek vases. The Irish harp is an emblem probably allusive to the instrument of Brian Boroimhe. The origin of the lion of Scotland is also obscure, and of the tressure equally so, though fabled to be

“First by Achaius borne.”

Not unfrequently the arms of kingdoms were those of an early sovereign, adopted by succeeding dynasties to the exclusion of their own coat. The lions of England were certainly personal to the Plantagenet kings, if not to Henry I.; but they have become national to the exclusion of the arms of the Tudor, Stuart, Brunswick, and Saxon dynasties, just as neither the arms of Baliol, Bruce, nor Stuart ever became the arms of Scotland. The lion rampant azure, crowned gules, so long borne by the head of the German empire, belonged originally to the house of Hapsburg, and was not used by such of the early emperors as were not members of it; and the bend and alerionsof Lorraine only became a part of the arms of the empire after the marriage of Francis of Lorraine with Maria Theresa. It seems indeed to have been the custom of elected sovereigns, as those of the empire and of Poland, to place their paternal arms on a shield of pretence over those of the dominion. Cromwell so placed his arms over those of the commonwealth, and William of Nassau over those of England, but they disappeared with the individual who introduced them. On the other hand the arms of kingdoms and lordships are sometimes continued to be used as personal arms by the descendants of their former lords. The great shield of Mary of Burgundy quarters the arms of a number of [9:11:689] duchies and provinces. Simon de Montfort thus used the arms of the Honour of Hinkley. Richard de Monthermer (who married the countess of Gloucester, and was, by courtesy, earl of that name) at Caerlavrock, while he bore on his shield his own arms, “or, an eagle displayed vert,” on his banner displayed “or, three chevrons gules” for the earldom. So also Humphrey, duke of Gloucester, (died 1446), used on one of his seals the three fusils of Montacute, because he held lands which belonged to that barony. The Booh of St Albans says that, if the king grant a lordship to a yeoman entitling him to bear arms, he may. take those of that lordship.

Under this head may be described the armorial shield of Great Britain (fig. 1). The arms, gules 3 lions passant in pale or, are for England, and are so borne by the kings of England till the reign of Edward III., who in 1340 quartered with them, in the first quarter, the arms of France, azure, semée of fleurs-de-lys or. Thus they continued till the latter part of the reign of Henry IV., when the fleurs-de-lys were reduced to three. No alteration occurred in the royal achievement during any of the succeeding reigns till the accession of James VI. of Scotland to the throne of England, when that sovereign introduced the royal arms of Scotland into the second quarter, and the arms of Ireland into the third quarter. The royal arms were thus borne by all the monarchs of the house of Stewart till the reign of Anne, though William III. bore over the quarterings of the royal arms those of his Dutch dominions—the house of Nassau. In the reign of Anne a change again took place, occasioned by the union of England and Scotland; and the arms of these kingdoms were impaled in .the first and fourth quarters (England on the dexter, Scotland on the sinister); France was removed to the second; and Ireland retained its former position. On the accession of the house of Brunswick in 1714, the fourth quarter in the royal shield gave place to the arms of his Majesty’s German dominions, an arrangement which continued till 1st January 1801, when, upon the Union of Great Britain and Ireland, the arms of France were excluded, England occupied the first and fourth quarters, Scotland the second quarter, and Ireland its old position in the third quarter; while over all, on an escutcheon of pretence, were placed the arms of Hanover, ensigned with the electoral bonnet, in 1816 exchanged for the Hanoverian crown. On the death of William IV. Hanover passed away, and its arms were withdrawn, and the present arrangement introduced. In Scotland, and in Scotch official documents, the Scottish coat is placed in the first quarter. It bears “or, a lion rampant, w ithin a double tressure flory-counterflory, gules.” There is no positive authority for any early coat of arms being used for Ireland, though the bearing “azure, 3 crowns in pale or” granted by Richard III. to De Vere has been so regarded. From the reign of Henry VII., “azure, a harp or, strings argent,” has been regarded as the Irish coat, and as such is inserted into the imperial shield. There is no authority of any standing for a coat of arms for the whole of the principality of Wales, but the coat usually attributed to it is “quarterly azure and gules, 4 lions passant gardant, counterchanged.” The ancient princes of Wales would scarcely have adopted the lions of England. Moreover, this coat was never used by any leading chief in either middle or south Wales.

In Scotland arms territorial are much recognized. The dukes of Athole quarter Man. The garbs are quartered by the Erskines for the earldom of Bute. When Archibald Douglas was created duke of Touraine, he placed the arms of that duchy, three fleurs-de-lys, on his first quarter, before those of Douglas, Annandale, and Galloway. The dukes of Richmond bear three buckles for the dukedom of Aubigny. “Paly of 6 argent and sable” are the reputed arms of the earldom of Athole, and “a saltire between 4 roses” those of that of Lennox.

To this head belong arms of pretension, where a sovereign claims de jure a possession which he no longer holds, and sometimes never held, de facto. Thus the kings of England from Edward III. to George IΓΓ. bore the French lilies, and claimed to be kings of France, and the kings of Sardinia and Naples used the arms of Cyprus and Jerusalem. In fact, nearly all the older sovereigns of Europe used arms of this character. The armorial shield of the house of Austria at the dissolution of the empire affords a number of curious examples of arms of pretension. Besides Hungary, Bohemia, Dalmatia, and Slavonia, it contained Aragon and Sicily, Brabant, Swabia, Antwerp, Flanders 1 Burgund} r , Naples, Jerusalem, Lombardy, and Milan.

2. Arms of Commzιnities are borne by co: porations, religious houses, colleges, cities and boroughs, the cinque ports, guilds, and inns of court, some of which were allowed arms from an early period. These are very generally adopted in honour of some founder, great benefactor, or early and distinguished member of the body. Thus Birmingham bears the arms of the barons of that name, Manchester of the Byrons, Leicester of the Bellomonts, Cardiff of the De Clares. Of religious houses Atherstone bore the arms of Basset; Garendon of the earls of Leicester; Kirby-Bellers of Bellers. Of colleges, Balliol and All Souls at Oxford, and Pembroke and Clare at Cambridge, so commemorate Balliol, Chichele, Valence, and De Clare. The Cinque Ports all bear a part of the arms of England. The arms of the guilds and city companies usually contain some allusion to their trade; those of the grocers are 9 ’ cloves; of the fishmongers, 3 dolphins; of the blacksmiths; 3 hammers. Of the inns of court, the Inner and Middle Temples bear badges of that order; Lincoln’s Inn uses the purple lion of the De Lacys, earls of Lincoln; Furnival·s Inn the bend and martlets of the Barons Furnival. A bishop, as a corporation sole, represents his see and bears its arms. These usually contain some ecclesiastical emblem, keys, crosses, mitres, martyrs’ crowns, or the like. Hereford bears the arms of Cantilupe, possibly from its canonized bishop of that family. The arms of Lichfield and Coventry are founded upon those of Jerusalem; London, Winchester, and Bath and Wells assert their temporal power by bearing swords. The English sees were early provided with arms, but in Scotland they were of very late introduction. Bishops before the 17th century seem [9:11:690] to have used their personal arms. Thus Gawain Douglas, bishop of Dunkeld,

“Who gave fair Scotland Virgil’s page,”

and Alexander Douglas, bishop of Moray in 1606, placed the Douglas arms upon their seals. Sometimes, however, this seems to have been combined with some ecclesiastical emblem, for the archbishops of St Andrews placed the cross of St Andrew on their seals, while below were their paternal arms, and the bishops of Glasgow so bore a figure of St Mungo.

3. Arms of Office are not uncommon. The electors and chief officers of the empire each bore some token of their office. The crossed swords so well known on Dresden china were borne by the electors of Saxony; the sceptre by those of Brandenburg; the crown of Charlemagne by the electors of Hanover as arch-treasurers. The ancestors of the dukes of Ormond were hereditary butlers of Ireland, and bore three covered cups. The kings-at-arms bear arms of office. Garter, the principal king, bears “argent, a cross gules, on a chief azure a crown or encircled with a garter of the order buckled and nowed between a lion of England and a lily of France,” by no means such an example of heraldry as might be expected from the chief herald of England. The knights of St John of Jerusalem augmented their paternal arms with a chief gules, charged with a cross or. Several civic offices in France gave a right to bear arms. Ménage observed of a mayor of Angers who died upon his election, and was buried with his newly acquired arms—

“Il étoit de bonne nature,

Et ne fut armé qu’en peinture.”

4. Arms of Concession were granted by a sovereign or some feudal superior, sometimes in memory of some great deed, but more frequently to indicate the connexion between the lord and his follower, when they are called arms of patronage. Of the former character was the heart in the arms of Douglas, first used by William I., earl of Douglas, 1356, in memory of James Lord Douglas’s mission with Robert Bruce’s heart; and to this a crown was added in the time of William II., earl of Angus, in 1617. Also the families of De la Warr, Pelham, Vane, and Fane bear arms in allusion to the share of the ancestors of each in the capture of John of France at Poitiers. Sir James Audley, after Poitiers, not only divided the Black Prince’s present between his four squires, but allowed them to bear portions of his coat armour, “gules, a fret or,” in memory of which the family of Delves still bear “argent, a chevron gules, fretty or, between 3 billets sable” (fig 82); and that of DuttθD, “quarterly, argent and gules, on the 2d and 3d quarters a fret or.” It was probably in memory of the same event that John Touchet, Lord Audley, granted to John and Thomas MackworLh, for services performed by their ancestors and themselves to his ancestors and himself, to bear “party dentelle de sable et d’ hermines, un chevron de gules fretté d’or,”—arms still used by the Mackworths, with a slight addition, and now blazoned “per pale indented sable and ermine, on a chevron gules 5 crosses pâtée or.” Among many similar instances may be mentioned Tatton of Cheshire, who bears “quarterly argent and gules,” evidently derived from Massy. Harvey of Ickworth bears “gules, on a bend argent 3 trefoils slipped vert,” derived from Foliot, who bore “gules, a bend argent.” Staunton of Longbridge, who held by the service of repairing a tower of Belvoir Castle, bore “argent, 2 chevrons within a border engrailed sable,” derived from Albini of Belvoir, who bore “or, 2 chevronsand a border gules.” Lowther and Musgrave derive their annulets from Vipont. Moton of Peckleton, Brailsford, Astley of Hillmorton, Besington, bore “argent, a cinquefoil azure ;” “or, a cinquefoil sable ;” “azure, a cinquefoil ermine ;” and “azure, a cinquefoil or,” all derived from the bearings of the Bellomont3, “gules, a cinquefoil ermine.” Hardress, who held under De Clare at Tonbridge, bore “gules, a lion rampant debruised by a chevron or;” and the lords of Avan, Welsh barons under De Clare, bore the three chevrons. Thus also Flamville and Wharton used the mauuch of Hastings. “Ermine and checquy,” from the Newburgh earls, were common in Warwickshire, and the “canton” in Westmoreland, derived from the Lancasters, barons of Kendal. · In Douglasdale the “stars” of Douglas preponderate, and in Annandale the “saltire”.of Johnstone.

Arms also passed from one friend to another by deed or will, even when there was no blood relationship. Henry de Lacy, the last earl of Lincoln, bequeathed to his friend and executor Sir H. Scrope a lion passant purpure, in augmentation of his coat, and Sir Henry wore it accordingly, though for life only. Maud Lucy, heiress of her brother Anthony Lord Lucy of Cockermouth, married Henry Percy, earl of Northumberland, 1414. She died childless, but bequeathed her lands to the Percys on condition they bore her arms, “gules 3 luces,” quarterly with Percy, which they continued to do, and indeed, though without any right, often styled themselves Barons Lucy. To this class also belong arms of augmentation, sometimes called additions of honour. Thus Richard II. chose to impale with his own the imputed arms of the Confessor, “gules, a cross patonce between 5 martlets or,” and he granted to Thomas Holland, duke of Surrey, to impale them within a border argent with his own arms. Thomas Mowbray, duke of Norfolk, was also allowed to impale the entire arms of the Confessor, a fatal gift, as it was one of the charges brought against his ambitious descendant Henry Howard. Richard also allowed De Vere, duke of Ireland, to bear for life “azure, 3 golden crowns within a bordure,” which seems then to have been regarded as the arms of Ireland. They are found on tiles marshalled quarterly with De Vere. After the victory of Flodden, Henry VIII. granted to the earl of Surrey to augment his arms with a “demi-lion gules pierced through the mouth withan arrow, within·a double fressure flowered of the same,” to be placed on the Howard bend. Henry used both the pile and the flaunch in his augmentations to the families of his English wives. Seymour bore “quarterly, 1 and 4, or, on a pile gules between 6 fleurs-de-lys azure 3 lions of England; 2 and 3, Seymour.” The augmentation to Catherine Howard includes 2 flaunches, that to Catherine Parr a pale. Manners of Belvoir bore “or, 2 bars argent, a chief quarterly azure and gules, in the 1st and 4th quarter 2 fleurs-de-lys, in the 2d and 3d a lion of England, or.” The bars were no doubt taken from the Muschamps. The chief and its contents were an augmentation from Henry VIII.

In Scotland an early Lord Seton had a concession from Robert Bruce of a sword supporting a crown, and his descendant in 1601 received as an augmentation “azure, a blazing star of 8 points within a double fressure or.”

Most of the earlier grants or concessions seem intended to commemorate some territorial or genealogical concession, those of later date some connexion with royalty, or some deed of arms in the field. Thus Sir Cloudesly Shovel received 2 fleurs-de-lys in chief and a crescent in base in memory of two victories over the French and one over the Turks, and Nelson and other naval commanders received additions rather to be described as sea pieces than as heraldic augmentations.

5. Family and Paternal Arms and arms of succession are such as descend by custom to the male heir. The descendants of females, heiresses, save by special licence, can only quarter their arms. This rule has indeed been much abused, and on every side are seen good maternai names and arms adopted to the exclusion of those less dis[9:11:691] tinguished on the paternal side. Paternal arms are of very various dates and origin. There seem, however, always to have existed certain recognized rules which the earl marshal had power to enforce. One of the most important of these was that no two persons in the same kingdom should bear the same arms, a practice clearly subversive of the main use of such insignia. Many were the disputes and challenges that arose out of this regulation, of which two of the most remarkable have already been mentioned.

6. Arms of Alliance or heirship were used when those of a great heiress were allowed to supersede the paternal coat. Thus the heiress of Mandeville, earl of Essex, married Say, and their heiress, Beatrice de Say, married Geoffrey Fitz Piers. Geoffrey (died 14 John) became earl of Essex, and their descendants took the name and bore the arms of Mandeville exclusively. William II., earl Warren (died 1148), left a daughter and heiress Isabel, who married Hamelin, natural son of Geoffrey of Anjou and brother to Henry II. He became earl of Surrey, and bore the name and arms and continued the line of Warren. The De la Bisse family, who claimed to descend from the male stock of the De Clares, bore the 3 chevrons differenced with a label of 3 points, though when, in the reign of Richard II., they intermarried with the Staffords, they laid this aside, and adopted “a chevron between three roses.” When Gilbert Talbot (died 1274) married Gwenllian, or Gwendoline, the heiress of the Welsh prince Rhys ap Griffith, he laid aside his paternal coat, “bendy of 10 pieces, argent and gules,” and adopted that of the lady, “gules, a lion rampant or, within a border engrailed of the field,” as still used by the earls of Shrewsbury.

7. Arms of Attribution are altogether fictitious, and such as the heralds of the 15th and 16th centuries indulged in to an absurd extent, providing every hero of antiquity with a coat of arms. The same age that represented the Virgin Mary as versed in the canon law declared that Solomon, us the wisest of men, must have been a good herald, and described the armorial bearings of Achilles and Hector. Perhaps the most extravagant example of this fashion is contained in the work of Dame Juliana Berners, who says: “Of the offspring of the gentielman Japhet, comes Habre-ham, Moyses, Aron, and the profetys, and also the kyng of the right lyne of Mary, of whom the gentilman Jhesus was borne, very God and man; after his manhode King of the londe of Jude, and of Jues, gentilman by is modre Mary, prynce of coat armure and again, “The four doctors of holy chirch, Seynt Jeromy, Ambrose, Augustyn, and Gregori, war gentilmen of blode and of cotarmures.” At an earlier period, in the reign of Richard II., it was believed that many of the bearings in use had been borne ever since the Conquest, as appears from the evidence in the Scrope and Grosvenor controversy. Almost all the older genealogists attribute coats of arms to ancestors long before they were in use. On the tomb of Queen Elizabeth are emblazoned the arms of William the Conqueror and Matilda of Flanders, and of Henry I. and Matilda of Scotland, all of course pure inventions. It is only of very late years, since a critical spirit has found its way even into heraldry, that these absurdities have been exposed.

8. Canting Arms, the “armes parlantes” of French heraldry, are common to all the preceding classes of arms, and most common in those of the earliest date. Such were the castle and lion for Castile and Leon, the fers de cheval of Ferrers, the lion (löwe) of Louvaine, the luces of Lucy, the sharp-pointed row of fusils of Montacute, the corbeau or raven of Corbet, the herons of Heron, the falcon of Falconer, the greyhounds (levriers) of Mauleverer, the barnacles of Bernak, the castle of Chastil, the swine’s head of Swinbourne, the penfeathers of Coupenne, the hirondelles of Arundel, the storm-finches of Tempest, the hammers of

Hamerton, the tyrwhits of Tyrwhitt, the hanks of cotton of Cotton, the fusils of Trefusis, the oxen of Oxenden, the fer de moline of Molyneux, the hazel leaves of Hazlerigge, the Danish axes of Hakluyt, the bozons or bird bolts of Bol-tesham and Bozon, the bend wavy of Wallop, or Well-hope, the whelk-shell of Shelley, and many more, mostly early coats, and borne by considerable persons and families. In fact the practice was introduced whenever the name admitted of it, and sometimes when the allusion is very farfetched indeed, as in the boar pig “verres,” the crest of De Vere, and the cock for Law, alluding to his cry, cock-a-leary-law! Canting arms were equally common in other countries. In Italy the Colonne, Frangipani, and Ursini families bore a column, a piece of broken bread, and a bear. They were also common in France, Spain, and Germany.

Tinctures.

Tinctures (in French, émaux) include metals, colours, and furs. The Metals are —

The Colours—

The Purs—

Ermine, Vair, Ermines or Counter-ermine.

Erminois, Erminites, Pean, Vair-en-point, Counter-vair, Potent· counter-potent.

Gules is thought to come from the Persian gul, “a rose,” but more probably from gula, “the throat.” The other terms are French. To the older colours have been added “sanguine” and “tenné” or tawny, a compound of red and yellow. They are almost unknown in English heraldry, and are symbolized, the one by sardonyx and dragon’s tail, and the other by jacinth and dragon’s head. The blazoning by precious stones and planets, and even by the virtues, was a foolish fancy of the heraldic writers of the 16th century, and applied to the arms of peers and princes. Gwillim condescends to use it.

A shield is rarely of one tincture only. In the roll of Caerlavrock, however, Sir Eurmenious de la Brette

“La banière eut toute rougeate,”

The original bearing of the Gournays of Norfolk seems to have been sable. De Barge of Lorraine bore “azure.” The Captai de Buch, who figures in Froissart as a Guyenne knight, bore “or,” and Boguet, a Norman knight, bore “argent.”

The furs (fig. 2) are all supposed to be formed of the skins of small animals fastened together. Ermine and vair were long the only furs acknowledged, and even now the rest are not common. Ermine (a) represents the skin of the animal of that name, and is white powdered with black spots.

In vair (δ) the skins in shape resemble small escutcheons, the wings representing the forelegs and the point the tail. The fur is that of a sort of squirrel, bluish-grey on the back and white on the belly, and thence called “varus.” The skins are arranged alternately argent and azure; and if of other colours they must be specified. There are varieties of vairs, as vair-en-point[9:11:692], where the point of one escutcheon is placed opposite to the base of that below; counter-vair (7<), where those of the same colour are placed base to base and point to point. At first the vair was drawn bell shaped (e).

In ermines (c) the field is sable and the spots white, in eπninois (d) the field or and the spots sable; pean (∕) is the reverse, having golden spots on a black field. Erminites resembles ermine, save that the two lateral hairs of each spot are red. This fur, however, is seldom if ever used in English heraldry. Guillim in blazoning a fur prefixed the word “purfled.”

Potent (i) is a variety of vair, and often blazoned as “vair-potent.” There is also a form of it called “potentcounter-potent” (fh Manchester, of the county of Stafford, bore “potent-counter-potent, argent and sable, a bend gules.” The escutcheons or skins are T-shaped, and resemble a “potence,” that is, a gallows or a crutch head.

Ermine and vair are used almost to the exclusion of all other furs. Even erminois is very rare.

• The dukes of Britanny, earls of Richmond, bore “ermine” (this was the coat of John de Montfort, duke of Britanny, whose widow married Henry IV.); Lattin, “per pale argent and sable, a saltire engrailed ermines and ermine Beauchamp (old), “vair, a label gules Gresley of Drakelow, “vair, ermine and gules Calvert, “paly of 6 erminois and pean, a bend engrailed counterchanged.”

Of the colours, gules, azure, and sable are by far the most common in early bearings. They contrasted strongly with each other and with the metals. To preserve this contrast, arose the very early and general rule not to place metal upon metal, or colour upon colour. Scott takes the licence of a poet to break this rule in Harmion, whose falcon “Soar’d sable on an azure field,”

and in Ivanhoe, where the black knight bears “a fetterlock and shakle bolt azure, on a field sable.” He pleasantly defended himself by quoting the arms of the kingdom of Jerusalem, “argent, a cross potent between four crosses, all or,” which thus violates this fundamental canon. The French call such coats “armés à engueris.” There are a few other less illustrious but early instances.

Venour, warden of the Fleet, 1480, bore gules on a fess sable, five escallops or, 2, 2, 1.

Leycester of De Tabley: azure, a fess gules between three fleurs-de-lys or.

Sir Richard de Rokesle, temp. Edward II.: “d’azure, a six lioncels d’argent, a une fesse de gules.”

When an object is given of its natural colour it is blazoned as “proper.” Thus in the insignia of the order of St George and St Michael we have “the archangel encountering Satan, all proper ;” though the German family of Teufel displays a teufel or devil gules. A very striking contrast of colour is produced by a process called “counterchanging,” where a shield is divided between two colours, and a charge placed over the dividing line is also divided between the same colours transposed.

Chetwode of Chetwode: quarterly, argent and gules, four crosses pâtée counterchanged.

Peyto of Chesterton: barry of six party per pale dancette, argent and gules counterchanged.

A very convenient practice of representing the tinctures by certain marks and lines arose in the 16th century, and is attributed to Padre Silvestre de Petro Sancto, an Italian. It was devised to allow of the representation of armorial bearings in drawings or engravings where it was inconvenient to colour them. Planché states the earliest known instance of the use of this method in England to be in an engraving of the seals of the regicides attached to the death warrant of Charles I. Sir E. Bysshe in Upton, 1654, gives a representation of these marks. Or (fig. 3) is represented by hatched points; silver is plain; azure is represented by horizontal lines, gules by vertical lines; those for purpure are drawn diagonally from sinister to dexter. and those for vert from dexter to sinister, For sable, the lines are vertical and horizontal; for sanguine, diagonal, or in saltire, from right to left and left to right, a compound of purpure and vert; and for tenné, diagonal from sinister to dexter, and horizontal, a compound of purpure and azure.

Parts of Arms.

These are (1) the escutcheon; (2) the ordinaries; (3) partition lines; (4) charges.

The Escutcheon.

The Escutcheon, écu, or shield, called in blazon the field, upon which all lines are drawn and charges delineated, represents the shield borne in war upon which the arms of the knight were displayed. The figure of the shield varied in heraldry as in war. First came the long-pointed, kiteshaped shield or “pavesse,” slightly convex, and used with chain armour. As late as the reign of Richard I. and John such may be seen on early effigies, commonly but by no means always without armorial bearings, which were not then generally -in use (fig. 4). Varieties of this are the heart-shaped or pear shaped shields (fig. 5), and sometimes a shield representing a third part of a cylinder with square top and bottom, much used in siege operations. Early in the 13th century was introduced the small heater-shaped shield, also triangular but narrow, short, and somewhat lancet-shaped. This was in use in the reign of Henry III., and in the Early English period of architecture (fig. 6). The three water budgets of Ros appear on a shield of similar form of the date of Edward I. in the Temple Church (fig. 7). As coats of arms were then simple, this shield was large enough to contain them without crowding, and therefore with sufficient distinctness. When drawn or carved in architecture it is suspended by its “guiges” or shield straps, either upright or by the upper sinister angle, when it is said to be “couché.” Fig. 8 is from the great seal of Thomas de Beauchamp, earl of Warwick, and shows the form of shield in use during most of the Edwardian period.

As fluted and fancy plate armour came into fashion, the shield also altered its figure and became four-sided, and concave in the top and side edges, with a central point below; a notch also was cut in the upper dexter corner to [9:11:693] allow the lance to reach its rest, which projected from the breastplate, as in the shields upon the tower of the chapel of the Babingtons at Dethick, and on their tombhouse at Kingston (fig. 9). Such shields were called “chancrée,” or “à la bouche.” They are frequently carved as ah ornament in the Perpendicular style of architecture. As the shield ceased to be used in war, and was only known as a representation upon tombs or in pedigrees, it was altered to suit the fashionable practice of introducing large numbers of quartered coats, frequently twenty or thirty, and sometimes a hundred, as in an escutcheon of the earls of Huntingdon in Burnham church.

In the construction of the shield, while actually used in war, great strength had to be combined with as much lightness as possible, and this was attained by the use of cuir-bouilli and plates of horn stretched upon a wooden frame. The cramps and cross pieces employed to stiffen the whole are sometimes seen upon early shields, and are supposed, with much reason, to have been painted or gilded as ornaments, and to have given rise to the bars or ordinaries which predominate in the first simple coats. Our acquaintance with the forms and fashions of the earlier shields is chiefly derived from their representations on tombs, but the actual shield of John of Gaunt was long preserved in old St Paul’s, and that of the Black Prince still hangs above his tomb at Canterbury, as do those of his father and of Henry V. at Westminster. An unmarried woman did not place her arms upon an escutcheon, but, whether maiden or widow, upon a lozenge, an early practice in a∏usion probably to a fusil or distaff. When married she shared the shield of her husband.^[2. When an eminent geologist and proprietor of a well-known patent lozenge left his business for the militia, and after a short time returned to civil life, it was said— “So maidens who to Hymen yield Exchange the lozenge for the shield, But, when they lose the best of men, Return' to lozenges again."] The lozenge is an ancient usage, being found in the seals of English ladies of the middle of the 14th century, and in Scotland a century later. In modern heraldry the shields of knights of an order are usually oval or circular, called “cartouche” shields, and encircled with a ribbon bearing the motto of the order. When married the knight’s arms are blazoned alone within the ribbon, and again represented with those of his wife in a second shield encircled with a plain ribbon, and placed on the sinister side of the other. The dexter side of the escutcheon is that on the proper right of the bearer aûd therefore on the left of the spectator.

To secure due precision in blazoning, nine points, indicated by as many names, are taken on the surface of the shield. These (represented by the letters in fig. 10) are —at the top in a horizontal line three, the middle, dexter, and sinister chief; at the base three, also horizontal, the middle, dexter, and sinister base; and in the central or vertical axis also three, of which the upper is the honour point, the lower t’he nombril point, and the middle the fess point —the central point of the shield. The last three are of course in a line with the chief and base middle points.

Before passing to the ordinaries, it will be convenient here to mention a species of decoration applied to the shield, which, though not strictly heraldic, is often used in early heraldry and called “diaper.” A shield “diapered,” “bracteatus,” is covered with a ground pattern usually in squares or lozenges with a flower or scroll work in each compartment. The idea is said to be copied and named from the linen cloths of Ypres. An often-quoted example of diaper, and a very good one, is the shield of Robert de Vere upon his tomb at Earls Colne (fig. 4). Also the shield of William de Valence upon his effigy in Westminster Abbey is a very fine example of diaper. There the ground is divided into small squares, and each contains a pattern. The row of shields in the tabernacle work of the old chapel of St Stephen’s, Westminster, exhibits some fine specimens of diapered work in squares, lozenges, and circles. The shield of Earl Warren at Castle Acre Priory is a good example of diaper, as is the counterseal of Thomas le Despenser affixed to a Kenfig charter in 1397 (fig. 11).

The Ordinaries, or, as they are called in most heraldic books, “the honourable ordinaries,” have been supposed to represent the clamps or fastenings of the shield, converted into ornaments by painting or gilding. They may be regarded as nine in number—the chief, the pale, the fess, the chevron, the bend, the cross, the saltire, the pile, and the quarter. When charged they are drawn somewhat broader than when blank, and each has one or more diminutives. All were more or less in use in thé earliest times of heraldry, and they were then drawn more boldly and narrower than is now the custom. When such of the ordinaries as admit of it are cut short so as not to reach to the margin of the field, they are said to be humettée or coupée.

Partition Lines, closely allied to the ordinaries named from them, are the lines by which shields may be divided, and which vary both in direction and pattern. It will be convenient to notice these before proceeding to a detailed account of the ordinaries, as the partition lines will be constantly referred to in the examples. When the field is divided in the direction of an ordinary it is said to be “party per” that ordinary, as party per fess or per bend. Party per chief is rare, party per pile or per quarter urn known; party per cross is called quarterly; party per cross and per saltire is gyronny. When the partition line is mentioned without qualification, it is a straight line, but it may be broken in a variety of ways, as indented, dancette, engrailed, invected, undy, nebuly, embattled, dove-tailed, and raguly. These partition lines in some cases, if not in all, have arisen from the outline of a charge or bearing. Thus Charnels of Snareston at first bore eleven [9:11:694] lozenges conjoined in cross, which at a later date became a cross engrailed, and fusils in the same way became converted into dancette. In English heraldry the partition lines are per pale, per fess, per chevron, per bend dexter and sinister, quarterly, per saltire, and gyronny.

The annexed shield (fig. 12) represents these partition lines. It may be blazoned—quarterly of nine coats: 1. Butler: or, a chief indented azure; 2. Fleetwood: party per pale nebuly, azure and or, six martlets counter-changed; 3. Vavasour: or, a fess dancette sable; 4. — or, a chevron invected azure; 5. Boyle: party per bend embattled, argent and gules; 6. Trevor: party per bend sinister, ermine and ermines, a lion rampant or; 7. Lawrence: argent, a cross raguly gules; 8. Bottetourt: or, a saltire engraded sable; 9. —party per fess dovetailed, or and sable. A good example of a cross raguly, not an armorial bearing, is found upon a 12th century tomb in the church of Llanfihangel-yn-Gwynfa in Powysland.

The French use parti and coupé for per pale and per fess; they do not part per chevron, but per bend and per bend sinister are tranché and taillé; quarterly is écartelé, and per saltire écartelé en sautoir; gyronny is gironé. Besides these the French have a number of other divisions, as “tierce,” when the shield is divided into three parts, as “tierce en pal, tierce en fasce, àc. Tierce en pal is convenient when the coats of two wives are to be marshalled on the husband’s shield.

Formerly such broken lines as were used were not mere margins, but affected the whole ordinary; a fess indented was a zigzag and called a daunce or dancette. This practice is still preserved with the line undy. A bend undy or wavy is not a mere bend with a wavy edge, but the whole bend is in waves, whereas a bend nebuly or raguly has merely a particular kind of edge.

Returning to the ordinaries, it may be remarked that very many both of these and of the subordinaries in heraldry are very frequent constituents in mouldings in the Norman style of architecture. The chevron and the billet are amongst the most common. The roundel forms the hood moulding of a door at Peterborough, and is inserted in a moulding in the intersecting arches of St Augustin’s, Canterbury. The fret, the billet, and the roundel or pellet are largely used in the oldest parts of Malmesbury, and on Lincoln tower is a good example of undy,—and this before the regular employment of heraldic bearings.

1. The Chief, chef, caput, is the upper part or head of the shield, covering one-third of it, and parted off by a horizontal line. It is found in the earliest examples of arms. In the roll of Henry III. it occurs fourteen times, in that of Edward II. twenty-one times. T>3 Vivonne: ermine, a chief gules (flg. 13).

Butler (see flg. 12).

Aston: argent, a chief undy (fig. 14).

St John of Melchbourne: argent, on a chief gules, two mullets pierced or (fig. 15). Cromwell of Tattershall: party per chief, gules and argent, a bend azure; which might also be blazoned as gules, a chief argent, and a bend azure (fig. 16).

Heraldic writers give the fillet as a diminutive of the chief. It was a narrow strip laid upon the chief; a little above its lower margin. Guillim mentions, but gives no examples of it.

2. The Pale, pal, palus,, is a vertical strip set upright in the middle line of the shield, and one-third of its breadth. One of its earliest examples, if indeed it be not a mere gilt ornament, is ascribed to Graintmaisnel, baron of Hinkley, who is reported to have borne gules, a pale or; but the banner of the barons of Hinkley carried by Simon de Montfort was per pale indented, gules and or. The “sable pale of Mar” is the well-known bearing of Erskine, argent, a pale sable (fig. 17), but when it was introduced into Scotland is not clear. In the roll of Henry III. there occurs no pale, but there are three examples of paly. Party per pale is also there found. In the roll of Edward II. there is also no pale, but paly or party per pale occurs thirteen times. The latter is called simply “party”:— Pluys, “party d’or et goules. *

The diminutives of the pale are the pallet, one-fourth, and the endorse, one-eighth, of the breadth of the pale, both unknown anciently. The pallet may be used singly, the endorse only in pairs, one on each side of the pale.

Waldgrave: per pale or and gules.

Marshall, Earl Marshal and of Pembroke: party per pale or and vert, a lion rampant gules.

Fleetwood (see fig. 12).

When the pale is repeated, it is blazoned as “paly,” and the number of pieces specified.

Kingdom of Aragon: paly of ten argent and gules (fig. 18).

Gurney: or, two pallets azure.

Wykes of Dursley: argent, on a pale endorsed sable three greyhounds' heads erased or, collared gules (fig, 19).

Daniel of Cheshire: argent, a pale fusilly sable.

L·ightford: azure, a pale rayonée or (fig. 20).

3. The Fess, fesse, fascia, is a strip placed horizontally across the middle of the field. It occurs about twenty-five times in the roll of Henry III., and its diminutives about twenty-three times, or fortyeight times in all, against ninety in the roll of Edward II.

Hapsburg: gules, a fess argent (fig. 21). .

Charlotte, queen of George HI., on her shield of Mecklenburg-Strelitz placed a scutcheon of pretence party per fess, gules and or, for Stargard.

Vavasour (see fig. 12).

Henry de Percy, ancient blazon: azure, a fess engrailed or (fig. 22). This is a way of describing what is better known as azure, five fusils conjoined in fess or.

The seal of waiter son of Alan, steward of Scotland, 1190, gives a fess checquy, probably the earliest trace of the Stewart coat.

weld of Lulworth: azure, a fess nebuly between three crescents ermine (fig. 23). De le Plaunch: argent, a fess embattled gules.

Paramour: azure, a fess embattled counter-embattled, between three estoiles or. The Temple banner “Beauseant" was party per fess sable and argent.

Nicholas de Criol: per fess or and gules.

Swinburne (modern) party per fess gules and argent, three cinquefoils counterchanged.

Pearston: argent, a fess, quarterly, sable and or (fig. 24).

The diminutives of the fess are the bar, covering one-fifth of the field; the barrτιlet, one-half, and the closet, one-quarter of the bar. The closet is used in pairs only, usually called gemelles, and these are sometimes quadrupled, two pairs on each side, and sometime» are used without the bend between them. The bar is rarely used singly, the number must be specified if above four, when the coat is ’ ‘ barry” of the given number. The term fessy is not used. Harcourt of Ankerwyke: gules, two bars or.

Basset of Tehidy: or, three bars wavy gules.

Elount: barry nebuly of eight pieces, or and sable.

Fitz Alan of Bedale: barry of six, argent and azure.

Dabridgecourt: ermine, three bars humetty gules, fesswise in pale.

Badlesmere: argent, a fess gemelled gules (fig. 25). This is from the roll of Caerlavrock, but the more used blazon is—argent, a fess and two bare gemelles gules, which might be given—a fess closeted.

Fairfax of Denton: argent, three bars gemelles gules, surmounted by a lion rampant sable, crowned or.

Huntercombe: ermine, two pair of gemelles gules.

Edmondson and some other writers describe the gemelles as cotises.

4. The Chevron, chevcron, canterius, from whatever sôurce derived,, seems to have been named from its resemblance to the main rafters or principals of a roof, a familiar sight in early buildings. It is common to find orders on the royal foresters for so many pairs of chevrons. Mr Planché points out that in the earliest English examples of this ordinary, in the seal of Gilbert, earl of Pembroke, in the reign of Stephen, the upper edge of the shield is pointed like a ridged roof, and the chevrons are parallel to it, and divide the [9:11:695] shield into thirteen spaces. He regards as a part of the structure of the shield these chevrons, afterwards reduced to three and used as a regular heraldic bearing by the house of Clare. The chevron occurs six times in the roll of Henry III., and the chevronel, its diminutive, nine times. The two occur ninety-two times in the roll of Edward 11. In breadth it is one-fifth of the shield. Its diminutives are the chevronel or étage, of half, and the couple-close, of a quarter its breadth. The latter is borne in pairs above and below the chevron. When the chevron is repeated up to three they may be chevrons or chevronels. If exceeding that number the bearing is chevronny, unless the number be specified. The chev!,.n is still used to denote the rank ot the non-commissioned officers of the British army, but of late years has been borne by them inverted.

Stafford: or, a chevron gules (fig. 26).

Marler: argent, a chevron purpure, in dexter canton an escallop sable.

Fettiplace: gules, two chevrons argent.

Clare: or, three chevrons gules (fig. 6).

wyvill of Constable-Burton, derived from Fitz Hugh: gules, three chevronels brazed vair, and a chief or (fig. 27). [Brazed is interlaced.]

Kniveton: gules, a chevron party per chevron nebuly, argent and sable (fig. 28).

Fitz waiter: or, a fess between two chevrons gules (fig. 29).

Hungerford: per pale indented gules and vert, a chevron or (fig. 30).

Hotot: azure, a chevron couple-closed or, between three crescents argent (fig. 31).

Newport on Usk commemorates the Staffords, its ancient lords, by bearing a chevron reversed (fig. 32).

5. The Bend, bande, balteum, is a strip extended upon the shield from the dexter chief to sinister base, and in breadth one-fifth of the field. The diminutives are the bendlet, half the bend, and the cotise, or cost, a fourth part, borne in pairs, flanking the bend; and the ribbon, one-eighth of the bend. The ribbon is used as a difference, and is sometimes couped or cut short, when it becomes a bâton, and is the French barre. The bâton often marks illegitimacy. The term bâton, however, is also applied to the ribbon.

βcrope of Danby: azure, a bend or; a very celebrated example of the bend (fig. 33).

Culpepper: argent, a bend engrailed gules.

wallop of Farleigh-Wallop: argent, a bend wavy sable (fig. 34).

Fortescue of Castle-Hill: azure, a bend engrailed argent, cotised or.

Clopton: sable, a bend between two cotises dancette or (fig. 35).

Boyle: party per bend embattled,^[3. This is called also crenellated, and in French bretassé, from the bretasche or wo den gallery attached to the battlements of castle walls, when embattled on both faces the piece is said to be “embattled counter-embattled.” The notch ⅛ a parapet is an embrazure, the intermediate piece of masonry a merlon. When a second and a smaller merlon is placed on the first, the battlement is κιιd to be stopped.] argent and gules (see fig. 12).

Byron of Rochdale: argent, three bendlets enhanced gules (fig. 36).

Montford: bendy of ten, or and azure.

Chaucer: per pale argent and gules, a bend counterchanged (fig. 37).

Fite Herbert of Norbury: argent, a chief vair, or and gules, over all a bend sable.

Sir Hugh Baden: argent, on a bend double cotised sable three eagles displayed palewise or.

Keck of Stoughton: sable, a bend ermine between two cotises, flory counterflory, or.

Γhe Bend Sinister is a variety of the bend drawn from the sinister ‰ui°ι ^ ex ⅛ er b ase ∙ Its diminutives are the scrape or scarp, half the breadth, and the ribbon or bâton sinister. À bend sinister is a rare bearing, and, with its diminutives, is frequently used to express illegitimacy, especially the bâton, though sometimes as a difference only.

Richard de Bury, bishop of Durham: party per bend sinister, or and azure, a bend counterchanged (fig. 39).

Trevor (see fig. 12). .

The dukes of Orleans: azure, three fleurs-de-lys or, a bâton argent (fig. 40).

6. The Cross, croix, crux, needs no description save that in heraldry it is usually the Greek cross, or that of equal arms. The breadth is one-third of the shield. It is an early and very common bearing, and whatever its originit speedily became identified with the emblem of Christianity, and was popular throughout Christendom—

“Crux mihi certa salus, crux est quam semper adoro, Crux domini mecum, crux mihi refugium.

Per crucis hoc signum fugiat procul omne malignum.”

When plain it is blazoned only as “a cross.” Thus the cross of St George is “argent, a cross gules,” and the statutes of the Temple direct each knight to wear a red cross upon his “cotte d’armes,” on breast and back. Asa plain cross it occurs six times in the roll of Henry III., and in its varieties eleven times, and in the roll of Edward II. these numbers have risen from 17.to 102, when it was the most popular of the ordinaries.

De Burgh of Ireland: or, a cross gules (fig. 41).

Duckenfield of Duckenfield: argent, a cross pointed wavy sable, voided.

Ufford: sable, a cross engrailed or (fig. 42).

A seal of John de Ufford, probably about 1360, bears on a heater shield what would now be described as eight fusils conjoined in cross, and which is an early form of the Ufford coat. There is'also a mullet in dexter canton, possibly to mark a younger branch.

Colley: argent, a cross wavy, voided, sable (fig. 43).

Skirlaw, bishop of Durham: argent, six willow wands interlaced in cross sable, in allusion to his father, who was a basket-maker (fig. 44).

Lawrence (see fig. 12).

Party per cross or quarterly is an early and popular bearing.

Say: quarterly, or and gules (fig. 45).

Lacy: quarterly, or and gules, a bend sable.

Fitz warin: quarterly, per fess indented, argent and gules.

Atkins of Saperton: argent, a cross sable, bordered with half fleurs-de-lys, between four mullets, sable.

Loraine of Kirkharle: quarterly, sable and argent, a cross counter-quartered of the field.

When the central square of the cross is removed, it is said to be quarter-pierced, a cross quarter-pierced.

The varieties of the cross are almost innumerable. Edmondson gives 107 of them, and there are many more. Of these it will be sufficient to notice those comparatively few that are older and in general use; as the cross botonny, the cross crosslet, the cross flory, moline, pâtée, patonce, potent, receτcelee, and voided. None of these varieties extended to the margin of the field. When a plain cross does not so extend it is blazoned as couped or humetty.

The cross botonny, treflée, or modulata has each limb capped by a trefoil, or sort of button.

Northcote of Pynes: argent, three crosses botonny sable, palewise in bend (fig. 46).

The cross crosslet has its extremities crossed. It is usually borne as a charge in numbers, but not always.

Wasterley: argent, a cross crosslet sable.

Beauchamp, earl of warwick: gules, a fess between six cross crosslets or (fig. 8), When the lower limb is uncrossed and pointed it is “fitchy.” Belgrave: argent, a cross pâtée fitchy sable (fig. 47).

The cross pâtée was the emblem of the Knights of St John, and is known as the “Croix de Malthe.” Thθ cross patonce has expanded ends like the cross pâtée, but each terminates in three points. Pâtée and patonce were not always distinguished. At [9:11:696] Caerlavrock Latimer is described as bearing a cross pâtée, whereas the regιdar coat of the family was gules, a cross patonce or.

Win. de Fortibus, before 1241: gules, a cross patonce vair (fig. 48).

The cross flory or fleure⅛tee is capped in a similar way by fleurs-de-lys.

Lamplugh of Laιnplugh: argent, a cross flory sable (flg. 49).

Richard Suwart or Siward at Caerlavrock bore sable, a cross flory argent.

The cross moline is so called from the fer de moline, or millrind, the iron clamp of the upper millstone. When the millrind itself is borne it is pierced, but the cross moline is not necessarily so. Its extremities are split, curved outwards, and cut off square. It is an early bearing. When pierced this must be specified.

Bee of EreSt>y: gules, a cross moline argent.

.Molyneux ef Sefton: azure, a cross moline quarter-pierced or (flg. 50).

The cross potent, potence, or crutch or gibbet headed, has its extremities T-shaped.

An early example is seen in the arms of Jerusalem, argent, a cross potent between four crosslets or (fig. 51). Originally, however, the arms of the cross ended in knobs like the handles of a pilgrim’s staff, thence called “bourdonnée.”

The cross recercelée has the ends split and curled outwards, but differs from the cross moline in having them pointed. The two bearings were occasionally confounded, and while the Baron Bee bore a cross moline, Bishop Antony Bee, his brother, is described as bearing a cross recercelée.

The cross voided is the outline only, called by the French “un croix faux; " the field is seen through it. The cross recercelée is usually also voided.

The lords of Crevecoeur bore “d’or, ung faux crois de goules, recercelée” (fig. 52). Basing, temp. Edward III.: azure, a cross recercelée and voided or.

The cross formée is peculiar among these varieties, inasmuch as its extremities reach the edge of the field. In other respects it resembles the cross pâtée.

Lawley of Spoonhill: argent, a cross formée cheoquy, or and sable.

Among the other, later, and but little used varieties of the cross may be mentioned the avellane, ending in filbert husks; the cross anchored, of which the limbs terminate in anchors; the cross of the crucifixion or of Calvary, mounted on steps. A cross with a narrow border of another colour is “fimbriated”; across pointed is where the ends are so cut.

7. The Saltire, saltier, or sautoir, is known as the cross of St Andrew, and is a common constituent in Scottish coats of arms. The origin is said to be a sort of stirπιp or crossed loop suspended from the saddle by -the aid of which the knight leaped into his seat. Such a stirrup certainly appears on the steed of Patrick, earl of March, on his seal, and on the seal of an early Despenser, and this is the only suggestion that accounts for the name. The saltire is in breadth one-third of the field.

The Scottish emblem is azure, a saltire argent; that of St Patrick, argent, a saltire gules. Neville bore

“A silver saltire upon martial red," that is, gules, a saltire argent (fig. 53).

Bottetourt: or, a saltire engrailed sable (fig. 12).

Gage: party per saltire, argent and azure, a saltire gules (fig. 54).

Glanville of Catchfrench: azure, three saltires humetty or (fig. 55). Bruce: or, a saltire and chief gules.

Common charges placed upon a horizontal or vertical ordinary, as a fess or chief or cross, are placed upright; if on an inclined ordinary, as a bend or saltire, their position should be specified; if upright, they are palewise; if inclined, bendwise or saltirewise. On the chevron they are upright unless otherwise specified. •Dalrymple: or, on a saltire azure nine lozenges of the first (fig. 56).

Here the charges slope with the limbs of the saltire, that in the centre being upright. The deanery of Hengham, dedicated to St Andrew, bore on its seal a saltire raguly. The saltire has no regular ^diminutives, but when several are borne they are couped.

8. The Pile, pieu, pila, is a triangular strip, its base one-third of the breadth of the shield, and usually applied to its upper margin, the point coinciding with the lower point of the shield. It has been derived from the Roman pilum, a military weapon, and from the pile of the engineer. The origin is obscure, but it is a very early bearing. It has no diminutive.

Sir John Chandos, as Froissart often tells us, bore “d’argent, a ung peel de goules, e un label d’azure” (fig. 57), and his ancestor Robert? temp. Henry III., bore or, on a pile gules three estoiles, between six of the same, counterchanged, an unusually complicated bearing for that age.

waterhouse: or, a pile engrailed sable.

Frequently more piles than one were used, generally three, when they are to be blazoned as meeting in base.

Holies: ermine, three piles sable meeting in base (fig. 58).

Hulse: argent, three piles sable, one issuant from the chief between two from the base.

When the base of the pile is applied to any other part of the shield than the chief it must be specified. The pile was used by Henry VIII. as a vehicle for some of his grants of augmentation.

9. The Quarter or franc-quartier covers the upper dexter quarter of the shield. If placed in the sinister quarter, this must be specified. Its diminutive is the canton, of two-thirds its area. Both are early bearings, but in the roll of Henry III. the quarter appears in several coats which in later rolls are blazoned with the canton. Both are frequently charged. When either occurs in conjunction with another ordinary or subordinary, they are placed above it, and therefore blazoned after it, as further from the field. Both are used as early differences, as in the families of Zouch and Basset, and both are always borne with straight edges. A canton is also called a corner, and a cross between 4 crosses is said to be cantoned of them. De Clare (old): or, a quarter gules (fig. 59).

Shirley of Eatington: paly of six or and azure, a quarter ermine.

Sutton of Norwood: argent, a canton sable.

Samuel Clark, the mai tyrologist: gules, a fleur-de-)ys or, a canton ermine (fig. 60).

Subordinate Ordinaries.— These are the border, the inescutcheon, the orle, the tressure, the fret, the gyron, the flasque, the lozenge, the fusil, the mascle, the rustre, the roundel, guttes or drops, the billet, and checquy.

The Border, bordure, fimbria, or limbus, though a very old and independent bearing, was frequently used as a difference, and occasionally as a mark of illegitimacy. It is what its name expresses, and its breadth is one-fifth of the field. When used in an impaled coat the border is not continued round the inner side; in fact it is dimidiated. In old examples this was not always attended to. In a quartered coat the border is borne complete.

Sir Perdicas d'Albret, temp. Edward III.,

“VVho guly shield about his neck did fling, wrought with dent bordure, silver shining,”

bore “gules, a border indented argent."

Rondell: ermine, a border compony, or and sable (fig. 61).

Hamelin, illegitimate brother of Henry II., seems to have borne around his arms, on a border gules, eight lioncels passant or. This was before quartering came into use. The augmentation granted by Henry VIII. to Courtenay, marquis of Exeter, was a border quarterly of England and France, the fleurs-de-lys and lions enurmy, or in orle (fig. 62).

The Inescutcheon, or écusson, is a small shield bonιe within and upon the greater one. It occurs in the earliest coats, and when voided becomes an orle.

Mortimer: barry of 6 or and azure, an inescutcheon argent, a chief of the first paly of the second between two gyrons of the same (fig. 63).

Rokeley: ermine, an inescutcheon azure.

Allestree of Allestree: argent, a chief azure, on a bend gules three inescutcheons party per chief, vert and argent (fig. 64).

The arms of Maxwell, Lord Herries and earl of Nithsdale, afford a good example of this subordinary. They are, argent, an eagle displayed sable, beaked and membered gules, surmounted with an inescutcheon of the first, charged with a saltire of the second, surcharged with a hedgehog or, for Hemes.

The Orle is the’edge or hem, ourlet, of the inescutcheon, voided, and is therefore blazoned by the French as a false escutcheon.
[9:11:697]

John de Baliol: “De goules, ove ung faux escochon d'argent,” that is, “gules, an orle argent” (fig. 65).

winnington of Stanford: argent, an inescutcheon voided, within an orle of martlets sable (fig. 66).

The Tressure is in fact a narrow'orle, almost always home double, and usually flowered. It is a favourite Scottish bearing, and is set with fleurs-de-lys placed alternately, the upper and the lower half on each face of the tressure, when it is blazoned “flory-counterflory.” This, in the Scottish royal arms, is said to denote the early alliance between that country and France. The bearing is, or, a lion rampant within a double tressure, flory-counterflory, gules (fig. 67). The tressure was a common grant of augmentation from the crown for services or in memory of an alliance. Scott of Thirlstane had it from James V. and bore or, a bend azure, charged with a mullet pierced, between two crescents of the first, the whole within a double tressure flory-counterflory of the second—

“The treasured fleurs-de-lys he claims To wreath his shield.”

The Fret was originally borne fretty, representing a trellis. The single fret is very rare in ancient arms, but many of those families who at first bore fretty afterwards bore a fret. Fretty is usually composed of eight pieces.

Maltravers: sable, fretty or, which soon became and continued sable, a fret or (fig. 68).

When nailed at the joints it is said to be clouée.

Trussel: gules, a trellis (fretty) clouée or.

Harrington: sable, a fret argent, called also a Harrington knot (fig. 69).

Vernon of Sudbury: argent, a fret sable.

The Gyron, also an old bearing, is the lower half of a quarter divided diagonally. It is a Spanish ordinary, and said to come from “giron,” a gusset. It is seldom borne singly, and usually is gyronny, when the shield is divided per pale, per fess, per bend dexter, and per bend sinister into eight sections. If more, the number must be specified. In the earliest examples the divisions are twelve. Bassin⅛boume: gyronny of twelve, or and azure.

Campbell: gyronny, or and sable (fig. 70).

The Flasque, or flaunch, is the segment of a circle taken out of the two sides or flanks of the shield, the margin of which forms the chord. They are always used in pairs, one on each side. This bearing is not of great antiquity.

The Voider, the diminutive of the flasque, has a flatter curve. The voider in defensive armour was a gusset-piece either of plate or of mail, used to cover a void or unprotected space at the elbow or knee joints.

Frere: gules, two pards’ faces between as many flasques or (flg. 71), alluded to in Whistletraβ by Mr Hookham Frere—

“Two leopards’ faces were the arms he bore.”

When the bearer was asked to give some verses descriptive of his arms to be placed at the head of a history of the family, his answer was —

“The flanches, on our field of gules, Denote, by known heraldic rules, A race contented and obscure, In mediocrity secure, By sober parsimony thriving, For their retired existence striving,

• By well-judged purchases and matches, Far from ambition and debauches. Such was the life our fathers led; Their homely lesson, deep inbred In our whole moral composition, Confines us to a like condition.”

The lozenge i the mascle, and the nιstre are all derived from the fret or fretty, and do not appear originally to have been used singly.

The Lozenge is a square, set up diagonally like the diamond in playing cards. It is seldom used alone, and when the shield is covered with it, it is called lozengy.

Fitzwilliam: lozengy, argent and gules (fig. 72).

De Burgh: gules, seven lozenges vair conjoined 3,3,1.

The Mascle, or rather masculy, for originally it was so used, is said to represent a net.

Rokele of Suffolk: masculy, gules and ermine.

l ’ oges of Stoke-Poges: masculy, argent and gules.

De Quincy, earl of winchester: “gueles, six masclcs d’or, voydés du champ; " and afterwards, gules, seven mascles or, conjoined 3,3,1 (fig. 74).

The Rustre is of later introduction, and is not a common bearing-It is a lozenge pierced in its centre by a round hole.

Custance: or, a rustre sable (fig. 73).

The Fusil is an elongated lozenge, from the French fuseau, a spindle, and is supposed to represent a distaff charged with yarn. A very early example of its use is

Montacute: “d’argent avec ung fess engralé de geules d. trois pièces,” which speedily became “argent, three fusils conjoined in fess gules” (fig. 75).

william of waynflete and Wilson-Patten: fusilly, ermine and sable, a canton or (fig. 76).

It has been suggested that the Percys derived their fusils from their lordship of Spindleton.

Trefusis of Trefusis: argent, a chevron between three spindles sable.

The Roundel, if of metal, is a simple disk; if of colour, it is convex, half a globe. It is seldom borne singly, and is named specially from its colour.
[table]

The last four are almost unknown in English heraldry. Akin to these is the fountain, a disk barred wavy, argent and azure, to represent water. Although bezants, plates, hurts, and torteaux are given in early rolls of arms, their names do not always carry their colours. They are blazoned as roundels d’or, pelottes d’argent, torteaux de goules. The torteau is sometimes called a séruse. The pellet often stands for the roundel, and the bezant is called a talent, from a coin of that name current with the bezant in the East.

Alan La Zouch: Gules, bezanty. This was afterwards reduced to ten bezants, 4,3,2,1, with a quarter and sometimes a canton of Britanny, that is, “emine” (fig· 77).

Camoys: er, on a chief gules three plates (flg. 78).

Wellesley: gules, a cross argent between twenty plates, 5,5,5,5.

Baskerville of Old Withrington: argent, a chevron between three hurts (fig 79). Hurting: argent, ten hurts, 4,3,2,1.

Courtenay: or, three torteaux (fig. 62).

Babington: argent, ten torteaux, 4,3,2,1, a label azure (fig. 9).

Fulkyn: sable, on a cross between twelve billets argent three golpes.

Greville: sable, on a cross engrailed or five pellets.

Bridgeman: argent, ten ogresses, on a chief a lion rampant of the second. Stourton of Stourhead: sable, a bend or between three fountains (flg. 81).

In early lists the annulet is blazoned as a false roundel; thus Vipont is said to bear gules, six false roundels or.

Guttes or drops are represented pear-shaped with a tail like a Rupert’s drop, or the tears on funeral draperies. They are not found in the earliest coats. They, like roundels, are named from their colour, thus: or—gutté d’or; gules—gutte de sang; argent—gutté d’eau; sable—gutté de poix; azure—gutté de larmes; vert—gutté d’huile.

Malory: argent, a cross sable, gutté d’or.

Winterbottom: azure, gutté d'eau.

Kington: argent, gutté de larmes; on a chief azuré three barons’ coronets or (fig. 80).

Fitz of Fitzford: argent, gutté de sang, a cross of the same.

Chichester city: argent, gutté de poix, on a chief indented gules a lion of England.

Marshal: argent, on a fes.^ gules three drops emine.

The Billet or delve is a small parallelogram usually borne in numbers and set np on one end.

Coudray: gules, bi∏etty or.

Delves: argent, a chevron gules, fretty or, between three delves sable (fig. 82) [9:11:698] Somewhat akin to these subordinaries is a division of the field known as checquy, where the field is divided into small squares like a chess-board. Their number is not specified, but usually is made up of seven squares in a line, and in depth according to the length of the shield. Hugh, earl of Vermandois, is said to have borne checquy, or and azure, and as his daughter married Warren, it is possible that the earls of Surrey thence derived their well-known coat, warren: checquy, or and azure (fig. 83).

Tateshal: checquy, or and gules, a chief ermine.

Checquy was not confined to the field, but was also applied to the charges upon it.

Stuart: or, a fess checquy, argent and azure.

Where there is but one row of squares, the bearing is called gobonny or company, if of two rows, counter-company.

Gray: harry of six, argent and azure, a bend compony of the first and gules (fig. 84).

Fitz Roy: gules, a border quarterly, ermine and counter-compony, or and azure.

Common Charges.

Next to the purely heraldic figures connected with the shield and their diminutives and subordinaries, come those imported into heraldry as charges from all quarters, including an immense variety of objects, natural and artificial, beasts, birds, fishes, reptiles and insects, flowers, and the fruits of the field, chimaeras, astronomical and celestial figures, man and his parts, arms and armour, implements of war and the chase, ships, articles of dress, and a miscellaneous budget far too heavy to enumerate.

The rules for the placing of these charges are simple. If single, they stand in the centre of the shield; if two, in pale, or one over the other; if three, 2 and 1; if the number is longer the order must be specified (see fig. 85). The French carry the unexpressed understanding much further. With them, four pieces are placed 2 and 2; five pieces, in saltire; six are 3,2,1; seven are 3,3,1; eight are in orle; and nine are 3,3,3.

Animals.

The following rales are applicable to the blazoning of animals. Generally, unless otherwise specified, they are shown in profile. looking towards the dexter side; when to the sinister, the word counter is prefixed, “a lion counter-passant.” Animals back to back are “addorsed”; face to face, “confrontée”; facing the spectator, “gardant,” or “affrontée”; looking back, “regardant”; when rising out of the edge of an ordinary, “issuant ;” when out of the middle of it, ‘ ‘ naissant.” When the claws, horns, tongues, hoofs, or mane are shown of a special colour, the animal is “armed,” “corned,” “langued” or “lampassé,” “ungued,” or“crined.” Sometimes he is crowned royally or ducally, sometimes “collared,” “gorged,” or “accollée.” When wounded he is “vulned.”

When of its natural colour an animal is “proper,” but it maybe of any metal, colour, or fur, and divided by any partition lines. When a head or member is torιι off it is “erased.” When cut off “couped.” When men are clothed, they are “habited”; when nude, they are “salvage.”

Quadrupeds. —Of these the Lion is by far the most popular, nor is his popularity confined to England. He appears not only in the British arms, but in those of Spain, Holland, Denmark, Bohemia, and Saxony, and many lesser states. Of Edward II.’s 918 bannerets, 225 bear lions in some form or other. The favourite attitude is rampant, but he may be passant, saliant, statant, sejant, couchant, or dormant. About thirty varieties of attitude are enumerated by writers; but most are rarely if ever used, and indeed it is seldom the lion is other than rampant or passant. Sometimes he is borne “demi,” especially as a crest. His paws or jambs are also borae, and his tail. In one or two well-knoλvn instances on the Continent he is “déhaché,” that is, his head and paws and the tuft of his tail are cut off. When a member is borne upright, it is “erected.” As a set off to this dismemberment, in early rolls the lion is sometimes represented as two-tailed, or “queue furchée,” and there are examples of bicorporate and tricorporate lions, though not many. When above three lions are shown, they become lioncels or lions’ whelps, unless otheιwise specified.

It has been shown that as early as 1127 Henry I. used the lion as an ornament upon the shield he gave to his son-in-law, who bore those animals upon his brodekins, as did the early French kings the fleur-de-lys. Mr Planché has investigated this early use of the lion by Henry with great acuteness. A prophecy of Merlin, held to apply to that king, designated him as the Lion of Justice; his favourite residence and death-place was in the forest of Leon or Lyons in Normandy; his wife Adeliza was a daughter of Godfrey, duke of Louvain or Lowen, a name which certainly gave rise to the lion as the arms of that family.

William, earl of Gloucester, Henry’s grandson, sealed with a lion. Richard de Redvers, earl of Devon, who married a granddaughter of Henry, also bore a lion, as did Ranulph, earl of Chester, who married another grandchild. William d , Albini who married Henry’s widow, used the same animal. All this occurred at a period when armorial bearings were by no means an established institution, and when every great noble was taking it up, and quite open to assume a bearing. On the whole, therefore, it seems probable that to Henry I. was due the introduction of the lion into English heraldry. It has been seen that under Richard and John the lions became the settled arms of England, and this will account for the general adoption of the royal beast in English coats of arms. In heraldry a “lion passant gardant or” is always blazoned as “a lion of England.”

The identity of the lion of England with the leopard has been the subject of much controversy, and when Napoleon talked of driving the leopards into the sea he evidently used the word in disparagement of our national bearing. The early heralds, who probably were not zoologists, seemed to have confounded the lion with the leopard, and to have used the names according to the attitude of the animal. When rampant he was a lion, when in any other attitude, as passant, he was leo-pardé or a lion-as-a-leopard, but never drawn spotted like a real leopard. As the lion came more generally into use, and was borne in various attitudes, the allusion to the leopard was gradually dropped, though as late as the reign of Edward III. and Richard II. the royal crest was described as a leopard, and Henry V. had a Leopard herald. Among the greater barons of the 13th and 14th century, the lion was borne by the earls of Arundel, Cornwall, Devon, Hereford, Leicester, Lincoln, the Earl Marshal and the earl of Salisbury, as well as by scores of the lesser barons or knights. Sir Tristem, the knight of lionesse, bore a lion when

“Mordant with his might, with a lance un-light, He smote him in the lion."

Lew’is of Llanishen and Cromwell their cadet bore and bear sable, a lion rampant argent, a bearing sttll used by their cadets, the Lewises of Pennysivania, who migrated above two centuries ago (fig. 86).
[9:11:699]

Mathew of Castell-y-Mynach: argent, a lion rampant regardant sable (flg. 87>.

Everingham: gules, a lion rampant vair, crowned or.

Havering: argent, a Hon rampant queue furchée gules, gorged azure (fig. 88).

Capel: gules, a lion rampant between three cross ci osslets, fitchy, or. In allusion to which Lord Capel is described at the siege of Colchester :—

“There lion-like undaunted Capel stood, Beset with crosses in a field of blood.”

Sir Simon de Felbrigge, K.G.: or, a lion saliant gules (fig. 89).

Fitz Payne: gules, three lions passant in pale argent, debruised by a bendlet azure (tig. 90).

The lion statant is more usually seen on a crest, and is that of Percy and Talbot.

Tynte of Cefn Mably: gules, a lion couchant between six cross crosslets, argent, 3 and 3.

Ayleworth of Essex: gules, a lion dormant or.

Longspee, earl of Salisbury.: azure, six lioncels rampant or, 3,2,1 (fig. 91).

Edmond, earl of Lancaster: a tricorporate lion issuing from three parts of the escutcheon, united at the head, gardant in the fess point, or, armed and langued azure (fig. 92).

A Scottish seal of Chalmers, 1449; bears a demi-lion issuant from a fess, in base a fleur-de-lys.

Markham: azure, on a chief or a demi-lion rampant i-suant gules (fig. 93).

Sir Henry Eame, K.G.: or, out of the middle of a fess a lion rampant naissant gules, armed azure (fig. 94).

Wyndham: argent, a chevron between three lions’ heads erased or (fig. 95.

Newdigate: gules, three lions’ jambs erased argent (fig. 96).

Pinchbeke: sable, three lions’ tails erased erect argent (fig. 97).

The Leopard, that is, the real spotted animal, is seen now and then in coats of arms, but is of much later introduction than the lion, which is often called by that name. Thus Sir Reginald de Dunstan-ville is blazoned as bearing “gules, two leopards passant debruised of a bâton ;” these most certainly were lions. A coat of Astley was however, gules, a leopard rampant argent, in that case a real leopard. He is often called a pard.

Cantelupe: azure, three pards’ heads jessant fleurs-de-lys or (fig. 98). Wentworth: sable, a chevron between three pa ’ ds ’ faces or.

Hubard of Ipsley, who held under Cantelupe: sable, three pards' heads jessant fleurs-de-lys argent.

The heraldic Tiger is neither a common nor an early bearing. To the body of the wolf he adds the tail of a lion, and he is studded with tufts of hair.

The supporters of Hastings, earls of Huntingdon, are two man-tigers affrontés. Lone of Ellow bears azure, a tiger passant or.

Hunloke of Wingerworth: azure, a fess between three heraldic tigers' heads erased or.

The Wolf when saliant, is said to be “ravissant.”

Lovett of Astwell: gules, three wolves passant sable, in pale.

The wolf, the boar, the hart, and the hare were the four heraldic beasts of venery. Dame Juliana Berners says—

“Four maner beastys of venery there are:

The first of them is the hert, the second the hare,

The boar is one of them, the wolf, and not one moe.”

The Boar is the only beast besides the lion borne in the roll of Henry III., where Adam de Swyneburne bears “de goules, a trois testes de sanglier d’argent” (fig. 99), a bearing which, however, the family have long laid aside for “per fess gules and argent, two cinquefoils eounterchanged,” a coat derived from Umfraville. The hure or teste de sanglier is a common crest. The “glory of the tusky boar ’ is in his tusks, “dente timetur aper.” He is also borne whole.

Gilpin: or, a boar sable.

The boar was the cognizance of Richard III., with a thorn bush—

“The bristly boar

In infant gore τ . . ,, , . wallows beneath the thorny shade.”

It is the crest of most of the clan Campbell.

The Bear is also a beast of heraldry.

Beresford: argent, a bear rampant sable, muzzled, collared, and chained or Fitz Urse: or, a bear passant sable.

The Fox. williams: argent, two foxes saliant counter-saliant in saltire, gules, the dexter surmounting the sinister (fig. 100).

The Cat-a-Mbuntain, musion, or wild cat, was long preserved in Rockingham forest, the country of Catesby, the first of the well-known trio—

“The cat, the rat, and Lovel our dog.”

Catesby, however, bore argent, two lions passant gardant sable, crowned or. Keate: argent, three mountain cats passant in pale sable.

The musion was the emblem of Burgundy and the arms of an imprisoned cat were fabled to have been granted by Childebert to a knight who made prisoner Gundernar of Burgundy.

In the following dialogue from Feme’s Glory of Gcnerositie the reader will recognize an amusing passage in Quentin Durward.

“Paradis, the herald.—Therefore, I pray you, begin and tell your sovereign what coat armour this knight beareth?

“ Torquatus, a knight.—Methinks he beareth sable, a musion passant gardant or, oppressed with a fret gules of eight-parts, nayles argent (fig. 101).

“Columel, a ploughman.—Jezu, Zirl call you this arms? now by my vaye, c'had thought arms should not have been of such trifling things. Why, this is even the cat in the milk-house window. Full ill will her dayri thrive giffe she put zutche a vermin beast in trust to keep it.”

The Dog.— The mastiff or talbot supports the shield of the earls of Shrewsbury. “The talbot ever true and faithful to the crown.” In the fine brass of Sir Brian Stapleton at Ingham, 1432, the knight rests his foot upon a dog whose collar is marked “Jakke.” Burton of Falde: azure, a fess between three talbots’ heads erased or. Mauleverer of Allerton Mauleverer: gules, three greyhounds or terriers currant in pale argent.

The alaund or hunting dog was in great request. Those of Henry VIII. bore his amis and badges on their collars. Fienes, Lord Dacre, used it as a supporter.

The Stag and Hart were old, though not of the earliest bearings. The stag appears in the roll of Edward II. When in motion he is trippant; when lying down he is lodged. His antlers are his “attires ;” a pair of attires attached to a fragment of the skull bone forms ‘ ’ a massacre.” The head is usually borne full-faced, when it is said to be cabossed or cabaged.

Green of Green’s Norton: azure, three bucks trippant or.

Bullstrode of Bullstrode: sable, a stag's head cabossed argent, attired or, and between the attires a cross pâtée fltchy of the third, transfixed through the nostrils by an arrow of the last, barbed and feathered of the second. This is called a stag of St Hubert (fig. 102).

The kingdom of W iirtemberg: or, three attires of a stag barwise in pale sable. Cocks: sable, a chevron between three massacres argent.

Roper: per fess, azure and or, a pale and three roebucks' heads counterchanged. John Trie who, temp. Edward II., was son and heir of Alicia de Hertley, boro “a hart’s head cabossed.”

The stag’s head was the emblem and armorial bearing of the M i Kenzies, whose chief, the lord of Kintail, was called by the Highlanders “Caberfaigh

“Proud chief of Kintail,

Let the stag in thy standard bound wild in the gale.

The heraldic Antelope, or agacella, somewhat resembles a tiger, but has horns and hoofs. Brooke, Lord Cobham, had for a dexter supporter an agacella, horned, tusked, and armed or.

The Elephant.

Elpħinston: gules, an elephant passant argent, tusked < r.

Saunders of Welford: per chevron, sable and argent, three elephants’ heads erased counterchanged.

The Bull, or buffer, in his wild state was a formidable animal, and is used heraldically, though more frequently as a crest, supporter, or cognizance, than in arms—

“Mightiest, of all the beasts of chase That roamed in woody Caledon.”

Front de Boeuf, a real Norman name, probably bore no arms, though Scott appropriately gives him the bull’s head. The head cabaged was a Welsh bearing; and when the horns and hoofs are noticed, he is said to be armed or corned and ungued. The bull’s head is the crest of Hastings and Nevill, and the pied bull a well-known cognizance.

Sk(flfington: argent, three bulls’ heads erased sable, armed or (fig. 103).

The Calf.

Le Vele of Tortworth and St Fagans in Glamorganshire: argent, on a bend sable three calves or.

Calverley: argent, on a fess gules three calves or.

The Horse, the support of the equestrian order, does not appear in early coats of amis, although the winged horse was a cognizance [9:11:700] of the order of the Temple. A grey horse is a Hard, a bay a bayard. When in the field he is free, when in harness barded and caparisoned.

Trevelyan of Nettlecornbe, whose ancestor is supposed, in Cornwall, to have come out of the sea at the Land’s End ready mounted, incongruously enough, upon a land horse, bears gules, a demi land horse lssuant from the water, all proper.

Horsey of Mclcombe-∏orsey: azure, three horses' heads couped, bitied, and reined or.

The √4ss, probably the wild ass endued with sublimity in the book of Job, found a place on the shield of the old Cheshire family of Hockenhull, argent, an ass’s head erased sable.

The Ram.— Recently a valuable silver dish was fished up from Whittlesea Mere, having rams’ heads at each end, evidently once the property of the Abbey.

Ramsey Abbey, “Ramsey the rich," bore or, on a bend azure three rams’ heads couped argent, armed of the fleld.

The Sheep is occasionally seen, but the Lamb from its religious association was in general use. The Pascal Lamb was one of the cognizances of the Templars, and is adopted with equal propriety by the gentlemen of the long robe. As the “Lamb and Flag” it is known extensively in South Wales. Price of Park and other descendants of Jestyn ap Gwrgant bore it as a crest.

Lambton of Lambton: sable, a fess between three lambs trippant argent.

The fleece of the sheep gave name to the great Burgundian order, and the toison d’or was its jewel. It probably refers to the pastoral wealth of Burgundy, but is said to have been founded by Philip the Good, in allusion, not to the bad faith of Jason, but to the prowess of Gideon.

The Goat.— William de Capraville bore a goat “exsiliens." Thorwold of Marston: sable, three goats saliant argent.

The Coney.

Coningsby of Hampton Court: gules, three coneys argent.

The Otter.— L’outre was used as a supporter by Luttrel of Dunster. The Squirrel.

Xutshaw: argent, a squirrel sejant nibbling a nut, all proper, from a hatchment in Clay brook Church.

The Hedgehog, herison, ericius.—In the church of Gamelston, Notts, is a fine effigy in chain mail of the end of the 13th century, of one of the family of Heriz, and on the shield are three hedgehogs. They bore azure, three hedgehogs or. The· hedgehog is also borne by the Maxwells for the lordship of Herries.

The Mole.

Mitford of Milford: argent, a fess sable between three moles proper.

The Ermine, the fur of which is borne widely, is scarcely known in heraldry as an animal. The reader will, however, remember the three ermines in the windows of Waverley House.

Birds. —The bird of heraldry before all others is the Eagle, the symbol of the fourth evangelist. Its earliest and chief popularity was in Germany, where it was adopted by the empire and by many of the principal sovereign princes.

It appears but twice in the roll of Henry III., but after his brother Richard, earl of Cornwall, became king of the Romans, he adopted the eagle, which on that account was to be seen in all the armorial glass of the midland churches, and was widely copied in private coats of arms. His son Edmund, while bearing “Cornwall’’ for his arms, suspended his shield from the beak, and placed it on the breast of an eagle in reference to his father’s rank. In the roll of Edward II. there are forty-three examples of eagles.

The nobles of the old Holy Roman empire place their shields upon the breast of an eagle, as may be seen in England in the insignia of the duke of Marlborough as a prince, and of the earl of Denbigh and Lord Arundel of Wardour as counts, of that empire.

The imperial eagle is always represented with two heads, the origin of which is obscure. The emperor Frederick II. on his contemporary shield in Westminster Abbey has a single-headed eagle. The second head is supposed to have been produced by the dimidiation of two coats, each an eagle, but this is scarcely probable. The eagle of the house of Brandenburg has hut one head. Some of the North Wales gentry, headed by Sir Watkin Williams Wynn, place their shields upon the breast of an eagle, single-headed, and the practice is not unknown in Scotland. The seal of the widow of one of the Warwickshire Harpurs in the time of Edward 11, gives an eagle, and in his two claws shields of her husband’s arms and her own.

Besides the eagles of Austria, Brandenburg, Russia, imperial France, and the United States, the bird was the emblem of Este, Bohemia, and Moravia, of many of the German, Italian, and French nobles, and of many very ancient English and Scottish names, as Monthermer, Bedingfield, Biddulph, Glyn, Weston, in England, and Ramsay, Maxwell, and Carnegie, in Scotland. The great financiers Rothschild use an eagle for their arms.

The eagle is always shown “displayed,” that is, upright, with his breast to the front, and his legs, tail, and wings expanded,—what is commonly known as a spread eagle.

When the beaks and talons of birds of prey are specified, they are said to be beaked and armed. In the roll of Henry III., Sir Dru de Barenton bore sable, three eagles or, and his descendents in the reign of Edward II. had. increased the number to six and gave them argent. Piers Gaveston bore six eagles upon his shield and horse furniture.

Peter, earl of Richmond and Savoy, who built the Savoy Palace in 1250, and was uncle of Eleanor, queen of Henry III., on the shield of his monumental effigy at Aqua Bella bears an eagle for Savoy. The cross, the later arms of that house, appears on the pommel of his sword. Long before this, about 1142, when Mathieu de Montmorenci married Adela of Savoy, he added four alerions or eaglets to his arms, probably in compliment to his wife, who bore an eagle displayed; and certainly in 1206 the acknowledged arms of the house of Savoy were an eagle.

Parts of birds, especially of eagles, are borne, as the head, wings, legs, and feathers. When feathers are used, and the quill is of a special colour, they are said to be quilled. When a bird is leaving the ground it is “rising,” when on the wing it is “au vol,” when the wings are down it is “closed,” when open “disclosed.” Bedingfeld of Oxburgh: ermine, an eagle displayed barry argent and gules («g. 104).

Glynne of Hawarden: argent, a two-headed eagle sable (fig. 105).

Culcheth of Culcheth: argent, an eagle disclosed, preyant on a child in a mantle gules, wattled or. This is the crest of Stanley, well known in Lancashire as the bird and bantling.

Aubrey of Llantrithyd: azure, a chevron between three eagles' heads erased or. Seymour: gules, two eagles’ wings conjoined in lure or (flg. 106).^[4. Heralds differ about the blazoning of this coat. The old terms, gules, a pair of wings displayed or, were thought scarcely clear. York described it as gules, two wings conjoined in fess or. Ralph Brooke takes refuge in French with “Deux vols de l'aigle en-coeur; but “vol," says Camden, “is a complete pair of wings.” Guillim gives “a pair of wings inverted and conjoined.” who shall decide amidst so many wearers of the tabard’] l

Bray of Shere: argent, a chevron between three eagles’ legs erased à la quise (“cuisse,” that is, removed at the thigh) sable,· armed gules (fig 107).

The Ealcon, as an accessory to field sports, was much esteemed, and is often borne in heraldry. It is also called a gerfalcon, peregrine falcon, and tiercelet. The falcon is usually borne with the jesses or leather thongs about its legs, sometimes with a hood and bells. It is then jessed, hooded, and belled. When feeding it is “atprey.’’ The lure was a bunch of feathers towards which the bird was taught to return. On the seal of Alice, countess of Eu (1234-42), she bears on her hand a falcon with its jesses pendant. It was the custom to slip over the claws of the young birds a silver ring, which could not afterwards be removed. Two such rings were found at Castle Hedingham, the seat of the De Veres, engraved “Ox-en-forde.” One of gold found at Biggleswade bore “Sum regis Angliae,’’ and within the ring “et comitis Herfordiae.” However well trained, these birds were always liable to prove riflers, that is, not to return to the lure—

“For though thou night and day take of him hcde, And strew his cage faire and soft as silk, And give him sugre, hony, bred, and milke, Yet right anon so that his door is up He witl> his feet will spurren down his cup, And to the wood he will, and wormes,” <fcc.

Falconer of Halkerton bore originally gules, three hawks’ lures or. After a marriage with Douglas they bore or, a falcon’s head proper, issuant out of a man’s heart gules between three stars azure. The English Falconers bore argent, three falcons gules, jessed, belled, and hooded or (fig 108).

Dcgge: or, on a bend azure, three falcons rising argent, jessed and belled of the field.

Baker: argent, on a fess gules three falcons’ heads erased of the field. Ridley of Blaydon: gules, a chevron between three gos-hawks argent. Aidrington: sable, three hawks' lures penned, stringed, and ringed argent.

The Swan was the cognizance of the Bohuns. Humphrey, earl of Hereford, in 1319, bequeathed to his son “un lit entier de vert poudré de cynes blanches.” When gorged with a ducal coronet having a gold chain attached to it, it is called a cygnet royal. The swan was marked or nicked according to the rank of its owner. By a statute of 22 Edward IV. no man having less than five marks [9:11:701] per annum could lawfully keep a “game of swans. The keeper who looked after them was the ‘ ‘ gamester.”

Pitfield of Dorset: azure, a bend engrailed between two cygnets royal. Guest: azure, a chevron or between three swans’ heads erased proper.

The Peacock, paon, is more common as a crest than in the shield. He is usually represented with his tail spread, and is then blazoned as a “peacock in his pride,” as seen in the crest of Manners.

Pawnβ: argent, three peacocks in their pride proper.

Yeo of Devon bore argent, a chevron sable between three Turkey Cocks, tails expanded, proper.

The Pelican is also more common as a crest than in arms. When in profile she is usually vulning herself, and when full-faced on her nest feeding her young she is “a pelican in her piety.”

Carne of Nash: gules, a pelican in her piety or (fig. 109).

Pelham: azure, three pelicans vulning themselves proper.

The Ostrich is also better known as a crest as borne by Digby, or as a supporter by the earls of Buchan. The plume of ostrich feathers, the well-known cognizance of the Black Prince, gave rise io the arms of his natural son, Sir Roger Clarendon, who bore or, on a bend sable three ostriches’ feathers argent, passing through as many scrolls of the field.

Jervis of Devon: argent, six ostriches’ feathers, 3,2,1, sable.

The Stork.

Starkie of Huntroyde: argent, a bend between six storks sable.

The Heron is one of the few birds found in early coats of arms. Heron of Chipchass and Ford occurs in the roll of Henry III. One of the family was the husband of her of whom

“Fame whispered light tales” . .

at the court of James IV. They bore gules, three herons argent.

The Cormorant, or liver, appears with a double pun in the arms of Liverpool: argent, a liver sable, billed and legged gules, holding in his bill a bunch of laver vert.

The Sheldrake, also a water-fowl, was introduced into heraldry to suit Sheldon, mayor of London in 1676, who bore sable, a fess between three sheldrakes argent.

The Raven, corbeau, has been the bearing of Corbet from the beginning of armorial bearings.

Corbet of Moreton Corbet: or, a raven sable—'

“A raven sat on Corbet's armed crest.”

Ravenhill: argent, three mounts vert, on each a raven sable.

The Rook is occasionally borne, and sometimes conjointly with the piece known as the rook in chess.

Rook of Kent: argent, on a chevron engrailed between three rooks sable, as many chess rooks of the first.

The Owl, the bird of Minerva, but seldom condescends to figure in a coat of arms. The learned Sir Henry Savile however bore-Argent, on a bend sable three owls of the field.

Sir Francis Theobald of Barking, Castello’s “harurn linguarum callentissimus," bore sable, a fess embattled between three owls argent.

The Cock, more usual as a crest, is sometimes borne in arms. When his beak, comb, wattles or gills, and spurs are given, he is beaked, crested, wattled or jewlapped, and armed.

Cockaigne: azure three cocks argent, armed, crested, and jewlapped proper.

The Popinjay, papagay, or pye, is one of the earliest heraldic birds.

Curzon: argent, on a bend sable three popinjays or, collared gules.

Thwengo or Fitz Marmaduke: argent, a fess gules between three popinjays vert, beaked, legged, and collared of the second.

The Chough is in repute in Cornish heraldry; he is black, with red legs and beak.

Peniston: argent, three Cornish choughs sable, beaked and legged gules. Onslow: argent, a fess between six Cornish choughs proper.

The Shoveller, said to be a Cornish bird, is borne by the family of Herle, who came to Cornwall from West Herle in Northumberland, and probably therefore assumed their arms, argent, a fess gules between three shovellers proper, after their migration. The heiress married Hastings.

Tyrwhit: gules, three tyrwhits or.

The Swallow, or hirondelle, forms the very early coat of the Arundells, of whom William le Brito (1170) says—

“Hirundelae velocior alite, quae dat

Hoc agnomen ei."

“More swift than bird hight Arundel,

That gives him name and in his shield of arms is blazoned well,

He rides amid the armed troops, and with his spear in rest

(The staff was strong, the point right sharp) runs full upon the brest

Of Sir Guillaume.” P

Sir Thomas Arundell was by Rudolph II. (1595) created a count of the empire for military service against the Turks. The Arundells of Wardour bear sable, six swallows argent, 3,2,1.

Fishes. —The inhabitants of the water do not play a very important part in heraldry, and are scarcely known among the more ancient coats, although a special and interesting volume has been written by Mr Moule on the heraldry of fishes. When borne horizontally they are “naiant;” when vertically, “hauriant,” though this is not always expressed; when bent they are “em∙ bowed” as the dolphin in the crest of Courtenay.

The Pike, or luce, is the oldest example of a fish in heraldry.

Lucy of Charlecote, Shakspeare's “Justice Shallow”: gules, semée of cross crosslets, three luces hauriant argent (tig. 110).

The Dolphin, whatever his zoological position may be, is heraldically a fish, as is also the Whale. As the emblem of Dauphiné the dolphin was adopted with the name by the heirs-apparent of the old French monarchy, who quartered with tbe fleur-de-lys azure a dolphin hauriant or.

Fishacre of Fishacre: gules, a dolphin naiant argent.

Kendal of I’elyn: argent, a chevron between three dolphins naiant embowed sable.

Dean Swift says that his cousin Thomas Swift gave for his device a swift or dolphin twisted about an anchor with the motto “Festina lente.” This, however, was the device of the printer Aldus.

Whalley of Whalley: argent, three whales’ heads erased naiant sable.

The Barbel was also an early bearing, used by the counts of Bar, who bore azure, crusuly fitchy, two barbels erect embowed or, within a border engrailed gules,—a bearing found in the quarterings of many German princes.

The Herring occurs in the roll of Edward II.

Heringaud: gules, three herrings hauriant argent.

The manor of Earlton, Norfolk, was held by the service of presenting annually at the exchequer certain herring pies.

Roach.— Peter de Rupibus or Des Roches, bishop of Winchester, bore three roaches.

Conger.— Chief-Justice Gascoyne bore argent, on a pale sable a conger’s head erased or.

Trout.

Troutbeck: azure, three trouts fretted in triangle argent.

The Chabot, a sort of gurnet, was used as a badge by the family of Rohan-Chabot.

The Scallop, or escallop shell, is an old and popular charge, especially in Spain, as the emblem of St James of Compostella, which led to its being the sign of a pilgrim. The seal of the fraternity of St James at Wisby (about 1200) represents St James as a pilgrim with a scallop upon his scrip. Sir Walter Raleigh says—

“Give me my scallop shell of quiet, My staff of faith to walk upon.”

Scales: gules, six escallops argent, 3,2,1 (fig. 111).

Shelley: sable, a fess engrailed between three whelks or.

Reptiles, Insects, and Monsters. —Reptiles and Insects are charges rarely seen in early coats.

The Serpent is the bearing of the Visconti, dukes of Milan: argent, a serpent gliding in pale azure, crowned or, vorant an infant issuant gules.

The Snake or bisse, anguis.

Sir Wm. de Malbisse: three testes de bysses.

The usual bearing of the name of Vaughan in S. Wales is azure, three boys’ heads couped at the bust argent, wreathed about the neck with a snake proper. Bottreaux: argent, three toads (botraces) erect sable.

The Fly, musca.—Muschamp ofWooler bore argent, a chevron vert between three flies. This bearing is seen on a boss of the cloister at Canterbury, but the muscae are represented as butterflies, which loses sight of the allusion.

The Bee.— Both Sir Robert Peel and Sir Richard Arkwright appropriately placed a bee in their arms.

Chimoeras. — A chimaera is a modification of some existing animal, though often much more than “parce detorta” from its type. Of them the most celebrated is the winged lion of St Mark, the proud emblem of ancient Venice. Technically the bearing is “azure, a winged lion sejant 1 gardant, with a glory, or; in his fore paws an open book, thereon ‘ Pax tibi, Marce, Evangelista meus,’ over the dexter page a sword erect,—all proper.”

The Dragon, though not very much used in heraldry, is a chimaera of ancient date and much employed in early romance. He is thus described—

“There was a dragon great and gryrnrne, Full of fire and also of venynι; And as a lion then was his fete, His tayle was long and full unrnete; Between his head and his tayle was twenty-two foote withouten fail; His body was like a wine ton, He shone full bright against the sun; His eyes were bright as any glass, His scales were hard as any brass.” [9:11:702] The-dragon was a favourite standard with the Welsh princes, and used also by the Anglo-Norman sovereigns. He is drawn with four legs and wings, a long barbed tail usually knotted, and a body protected by scales. In English heraldry he is used chiefly as a crest. In Wales, Rhys Ap Tudor Mawr is said to have borne “argent, a dragon segreant sable.”

The Gryphon is popular both in romance and heraldry. He is an emblem of vigilance, and inhabited a mountain in Bactria and guarded much gold there. It was in defence of this that he

“Through the wilderness Pursued the Arirnaspian.”

He is drawn with the body and tail of a lion, the head of a cock, a pair of wings, and very long sharp claws. When on his hind legs he is segreant.

Morgan of Tredegar: or, a gryphon segreant sable (fig. 112).

Evelyn of wotton; azure, a gryphon passant and a chief or.

Cotton of Landwade: sable, a chevron between three gryphons’ heads erased argent.

The gryphon was an early cognizance of Redvers, earl of Devon, and was used statant by some branches of the Montacutes in the time of Henry III.

The Wyvern is a two-legged dragon with the body passing Bffinto a long tail barbed at the end and usually borne nowed or knotted. Drake: argent, a wyvern statant, tail depressed and nowed, gules (flg. 113).

Cockatrice.

Langley; argent, a cockatrice sable, combed gules.

The Unicorn or licorne abounds in Scottish heraldry, and was made the sinister supporter of the arms of Great Britain by James I.

“Ceste merveillose beste, Qui une corne a en ta teste Senefle nostre seigneur, Ihesu Crist nostre sauveur. C’est l’unieorne spirituel, Qui entre la vierge prist ostel.”

Harting: argent, a unicorn sejant sable, armed and ungued or.

The Mermaid.

Ellis: argent, a mermaid gules, crined or, in her right hand a comb, in her left a mirror, argent.

The Martlet, or merlotte, a small bird without legs, and always represented close. It is one of the oldest and commonest of charges, but seldom if ever borne singly (see Fleetwood, fig. 12).

Furnival of Farnham Royal: argent , a bend between six martlets gules.

Roger de Merley, roll of Henry III.: barry of ten, argent and gules, on a border azure eight martlets or.

Flowers and Fruits of the Earth. —Of these the palm was an emblem of victory; the laurel, of triumph; the oak, of strength; the olive, of peace; the cypress, of woe; the vine, of fecundity and joy; the lily, of purity; the daisy, of humility; while the holy

“Trefoil, St John’s wort, and dill Hinder witches of their will.”

Fleur-de-lys.— At the head of heraldic flowers, if flower indeed it be, is ik∖e fleur-de-lys (fig. 60), the Flos gladioli of Upton, said to have been brought down by an angel for the arms of France, and which was certainly used by Louis VII. and borne singly and in numbers by Philip Augustus. It may be allied to the lily—

“The lily, lady of the flowery field, Or fleur-de-luce, her lovely paramour or its original designation may have been “Fleur de Louis.” It was not at first popular either in Normandy or in England, occurring but twice in the roll of Henry III., and only twenty times in that of Edward II., nor was it until its assumption by Edward III. that it came into general use in England. The Cantilupes bore three fleurs-de-lys before they added the pards’ heads (fig. 98).

Digby of Coleshill: azure, a fleur-de-lys argent.

Portman of Orchard-Portman: or, a fleur-de-lys azure.

Beaumont, to show his claim to descend from the blood-royal of France, bears azure, semée of fleurs-de-lys, a lion rampant or.

Hawkins: argent, on a saltire sable a fleur-de-lys or.

New College, Oxford: sable, three lilies slipped argent.

The Rose {Flos florum) is a very popular charge in English heraldry, though in the roll of Henry III. it occurs but once, and in that of Edward II. only twelve times. Usually the flower is borne alone and full-faced, with five petals, and barbs and seeds between them. If a stalk is shown, it is usually “slipped,” that is, cut off obliquely.

Boscawen of Boscawen-Rose: ermine, a rose gules, barbed and seeded proper (fig H4).

Bilson, bishop of Winchester: azure, a rose and pomegranate impaled dimidiated, gules and or, barbed, seeded, stalked, and slipped counterchanged.

The rose is also used in the chaplet, a favourite head ornament, of which a good example may be seen upon the conical helmet of Humphrey de Bohun (1267), in Gloucester cathedral. After the gallant defence of Calais in 1348, in which Edward and the Black Prince served under Sir Walter Manny, the king was so pleased with the valour shown by his prisoner Eustace de Ribeaumont that he took a chaplet from his own head and gave it to Sir Eustace with his liberty, bidding him “wear it for a year for the love of me.” Greystoke: barry of six, argent and azure, three chaplets gules-

The Trefoil, Quatrefoil, Cinquefoil, and Sixfoil are all common charges, usually but not always borne, like the rose, without a stalk.

Harvey of Ickworth: gules, on a bend argent three trefoils slipped vert, vincent of Stoke D’Abernon: azure, three quatrefoils argent (fig. 115).

Robert de Bellomont, earl of Leicester (1191-1220), sealed with a cinquefoil, bearing on each foil an ermine spot; and Robert de Quincy, the son of one of Earl Robert’s sisters, bore “de goules ung quintefoil de hermyn."

Umfravile of Penmark: gules, a sixfoil or.

•The Thistle, which gives name to the Scottish order, is also an heraldic bearing in that country.

Leaves, feuilles, are borne by Leveson and Foulis; hazel leaves by Hazlerigge of Noseley; strawberry leaves, or fraises, by Fraser of Lovat; walnut leaves by Waller; oak leaves by Oakes; by Elmes of Lifford, elm leaves; rye and barley or orge by Rye and Grandorge. Bigland bears three ears of big.

wood and Borough bear trees rooted up or eradicated.

Borough of Chetwynd: gules, the stem and trunk of a tree eradicated and couped, sprouting in two branches argent.

When Queen Elizabeth visited Worcester the citizens transplanted a pear tree laden with fruit into the market-place, for which attention she added pears to the city arms. Warden abbey, Beds, was famous for a pear that bore its name and constituted its arms— azure, three Warden pears or. The kingdom of Granada bore argent, a pomegranate slipped proper. Serjeaux bore argent, a saltire sable between twelve cherries slipped gules.

The Garb, gerbe, or wheatsheaf, was a common bearing, especially in Cheshire. Sometimes the garb is banded of a different colour. Grosvenor: azure, a garb or.

Vernon of Shipbrook: or, on a fess three garbs of the field.

Celestial Figures. —The Sun was the cognizance of Louis XIV., with the overbearing motto, “Nec pluribus impar.” In heraldry this was blazoned as “the sun in his splendour.”

Jean de la Hay bore argent, the sun in his splendour gules.

Ralph de la Hay, temp. Henry IΠ., differenced this coat by bearing only a ray of the sun, “blanc, ung rey de soleil de goules.”

Sir John Aldarn, temp. Edward II.: azure, a ray of the sun or. In both examples the ray issues from the dexter chief, and is borne bendwise. It resembles a pile wavy.

John de Fontibus, bishop of Ely, 1220-25, bore the sun, moon, and seven stars, 2,1,2,1,2,1.

The Moon is always borne as a crescent, and usually with the concavity upwards. If this be to the dexter it is increscent, if to the sinister, decrescent. It is an early and general charge, though seldom borne singly.

Chapman: per chevron argent and gules, a crescent counterchanged.

Weld: azure, a fess nebulé between three crescents ermine.

Baron of co. Lincoln: azure, in chief two moons increscent and decrescent argent, in base an estoile or.

The seal of Sir Lawrence de Berkerolles,

1392, gives a chevron between three crescents (fig. 118).

The Star, or estoile, is usually shown with six rays, wavy, and is thus, and by not being nierced, distinguished from the mullet. If there be more rays the number must be given.

Ingllby of Ripley: sable, an es tile argent.

One of the branches of De la Hay bore ar gent, an estoile of sixteen rays gules.

Sir Francis Drake, in memory of his voyages, bore sable, a fess wavy between the arctic and antarctic pole stars argent.

Man and his Parts.— The full human figure is very rarely borne in coats of arms. In Scotland the Dalzells bear sable, a naked man with arms extended, proper; formerly he was borne suspended from a gibbet.

Wood · azure, three salvage men ambulant in fess, proper; in their dexter hands a shield argent charged with a cross gules, in their sinister a club resting on their shoulders, also proper.

Mr Way mentions an MS. at Melton, in which two knights are represented tilting before a French princess, one of whom bears for a coat three demoiselles caged in a basket.

Canning of Foxcote: argent, three blackamoors’ heads couped sable, capped or fretty gules.
[9:11:703]

Tremaine of Colacombe: gules, three dexter arms conjoined at the shoulder, flexed in triangle, or, fisted argent.

Maynard: argent, three sinister hands couped at the wrist gules.

Foljambe of walton bears a man’s leg for a crest.

The Isle of Man: gules, three legs armed in mail proper, garnished and spurred or, conjoined at the thighs and flexed in triangle, a bearing certainly in use as early as the reign of Edward I., and possibly earlier (fig. 116).

A very extraordinary bearing is that granted-to Peter Dodge of Stopworth, Cheshire, by Guyenne king-at-arms, 8th April, 34 Edward I, for services in battle, “Porter a son escu d’or et sables, barré de six pièces et ung pal gules, avec une mamelle de femme dégoûtante.” It is said to be the earliest example of a grant of arms by a herald. Happily for heraldry there are not many such.

Newton: sable, two shin bones saltire-wise, the sinister surmounted by the dexter, argent.

Douglas: argent, a man's heart gules, ensigned by a royal crown proper, on a ehief azure two stars of the first.

The “quinque vulnera” or five wounds of the crucifixion are a common ecclesiastical bearing on architectural shields, and several bishoprics bear figures of saints on their shields, but these are scarcely within the limits of proper heraldry. Thus the arms of the see of Chichester are—

Azure, Presbyter ’John mitred, seated on a tombstone, in his sinister hand a mound, his dexter extended, all or. In his mouth a sword fesswise argent, hilted and pomelled or, the point to the sinister.

Miscellaneous Objects.— Helmet.— The helmet completed the knight’s equipment. He wore “l’ecu au cou, son heaulme sur la tête, et son glaive au poing,” or,

"His helm of latoun bright,

His saddel was of revell bone,

His bridle as the sun shone, His spere was of fine cypress.”

Halliday of Hungerford: sable, three helmets argent, garnished or, with a border engrailed of the second. The motto referring to the omitted fourth helmet is exceedingly happy, “Quarta salutis."

Morion, or steel cap.

Brudenel of Dene: argent, a chevron between three morions sable.

Gauntlet.

Gunter of Tregunter: sable, three dexter gauntlets or.

The Sword is much used in heraldry; it was the oldest weapon and that most thought of. The soldier in all time was the man of the sword. Damascus, Cologne, Bilbao were in turn famous for the manufacture, as was among smiths Andrea di Ferrara. The swords of great soldiers have been celebrated: Bhowanee as the sword of Sivajee, Excalibar of Arthur, Taillefer of Coeur de Lion—

“Schwafurlama’s magic blade

Was by dwarfs at midnight made.”

There was also the weapon by which Roland, with “huge two-handed sway,” cleft the pass of Roncesvalles,

“And to the enormous labour left his name.”

The sword of Talbot bore “Sum Talboti pro vincere inimicos suos,”—“Bad Latin,” says Fuller, “on it, but good steel in it.” King John gave his own sword to the town of Lynn Regis with the inscription, “Ensis hic donum fuit regis Joannis, a suo ipsius latere datum.” The sword of heraldry is two-handed.

Kilpec of Kilpec: argent, a sword bendwise sable.

The Axe was reckoned a manly weapon—

“King Richard, as I understand, Yet he went out of Englonde, Let make an axe for the nones, Therwith to crush the Saracens bones.

Thereon were twenty pound of steele.”

The Danish battle-axe was famous. Walter de Plumpton held Plumpton by the tenure of a Danish axe that hung up in his hall there.

Hackluyt: gules, three Danish axes or.

Lance.— The arms granted to Shakespeare’s father were, or, on a bend sable a lance of the field.

Spear Head.— This is a common bearing among the Welsh of Glamorgan and Brecknock, and used by Jones of Fonmon: sable, a chevron between three spear heads argent, points embrued gules. It is quartered by Lewis of Greenmeadow, a cadet of Vau, and by others.

The Arblast, or cross-bow, was a most unpopular weapon, as requiring no strength or manliness for its use. Richard I. is generally said to have met his death from a cross-bow; but the earls of Aberdeen, who claimed to represent Bertrand de Gourdon, bear as r h ⅛Λj rest two arms drawin g a lon g bow. The cross-bow was forbidden by Innocent II. and the emperor Conrad at a council in 1139. Guillaume de Dôle, who wrote before 1 ‘200, says of this weapon—

“Par effort de lance et d ’ escπ, Conqueront toy ses ennemies. Ja arbalétriees nu fu mis, Por sa guerre li autoritez.”

Nevertheless as early as 1270 the master of the cross-bows was a great officer of the French crown.

Arblaster: ermine, a cross-bow in pale gules.

τ Th e -‰0, though formed of Spanish yew, was essentially an •English weapon. It occurs in heraldry, though scarcelyso frequently as might have been expected, and chiefly in allusion to a name. The belt or baldrick, sheaf of arrows, buckler, and sword completed the equipment of an archer—

“Their baudricks set with studs, athwart their shoulders cast, To which, under their arms, their sheaves were buckled fast; A short sword at their belt, a buckler scarce a span, who struck below the knee, not counted then a man.

All made of Spanish yew, their bows were wondrous strong;

They not an arrow drew, but was a clothyard long.

Of archery they had the very perfect craft.”

The bow was used by the English in the attack on the isle of Rhé in 1627.'

Bowes of Streatlam: ermine, three bows palewisc strung gules (fig. 117).

The Arrow.— Drayton describes

“Their arrows finely paired for timber and for feather, with birch and Brazil pierced, to fly in any weather; And shot they with the round, the square, or forked pile, The loose gave such a twang as might be heard a mile.”

The burgesses of Sheffield seal with a sheaf of arrows.

Birdbolt, or bozon.

William de Gresley held a manor “per unum arcum . . . et unam bozonem." Bozon of Barrowby: argent, three birdbolts gules, feathered or.

The Bheon, or broad arrow.

Sydney of Penshurst: or, a pħeon azure (fig. 119).

Floyer of Floyer’s-Hayes: sable, a chevron between three broad arrows argent.

In heraldry arrows are usually drawn as clothyard shafts. The pheon is always drawn with the head only.

Besides these, and also more or less connected with war and the chase, are the buckle, barnacle, calthrop, castle, fireball, hammer, horse-shoe, hunting horn, maul, pick, spur, stirrup, and some hundreds of miscellaneous objects, travelling so far out of the legitimate charges of heraldry as to include apples and acorns, beehives, and a turnstyle. A very few of the most ancient have been selected. Walter Agard held Tutbury under Henry III. by a white hunter’s horn, and bore for arms, argent, three hunters’ horns sable.

The Chain borne by the kings of Navarre, the puzzle and delight of French heralds, “gules, a trellis of chains or, in cross and saltire,” also blazoned “gules, a carbuncle closed and pomelled or,” or by the Spanish heralds—“cadenas d’oro atronesados en campo de sangre.”

The Annulet, said to be a link of mail.

Musgrave of Edenhall, derived from Vipont: azure, six annulets or, 3,2,1.

Lowther also derived his arms, or, six annulets sable, 3,2,1, from the same source.

Calthrop— a four-spiked implement, so arranged that when thrown on the ground one spike always stood upright. Calthrops were used to keep off cavalry. Bruce used them at Bannockburn, and among the stores at Dover castle, 16 Edward III., was a barrel containing 2900 calketrappes. Froissart says the English on one occasion supplied their place by sticking their spurs into the ground.

Horseman: or, three calthrops gules (fig. 120).

Castle.

Hill: ermine, on a fess sable a castle triple towered argent.

Comb— a singular bearing of high antiquity borne by Ponsonbv of Ponsonby and Tunstall of Thirland.

Cups.

Argentine: argent, three cups gules.

Cushions, oreilliers.

Earls of Moray: argent, three pillows gules.

Maheu de Redman, in the roll of Henry III.: de goules, .. t ois horeiler⅛-d , or. Possibly these are birds.

Tiara.— The Dukes d’Urbino bore a papal tiara.

Crowns (mural, naval, and others) and mitres are not uncommon in arms. The Berkeley crest is a mitre. The crancelin or crown of rue was used in 1150 by Saxony. Bernhard of Anhalt bore barry of eight or and sable, a crancelin vert.

Mullet.— This is usually called a spur rowel, but it was in use long before the rowelled spur. Besides being employed as a difference, it is a constituent of numberless coats of arms.

Assheton of Downham: argent, a mullet pierced sable.

But it is generally borne in numbers (see fig. 15).

The Lymphad or galley. The bearing of the Lords of the Isles, quartered by the dukes of Argyll for Lome, is argent, a lymphad, sails furled and oars in action, all sable, flags flying gules (fig. 121).

The Maunch, or lady’s sleeve—

“A lady’s sleeve high-spirited Hastings bore.”

The earls of Pembroke bore or, a maunch gules; those of Huntingdon bear argent, a maunch sable. It was borne also by Flamville, Wharton, Maunsel, Conyers, and many others. Bayard took a lady’s [9:11:704] sleeve and proclaimed it, with a valuable ruby, as a prize to be contended for. Bayard himself won it, and the lady wore it for his sake. Fig. 123 is from the seal of John de Hastings, 1291.

The Battering-ram is borne by the Berties, earls of Lindsey, sometime dukes of Ancaster, with the allusive motto, “Virtus ariete fortior” (fig. 122).

The Escarbuncle was a very early bearing of the Mandevilles. It is a cross of eight rays, set with knobs and the arms ending in fleurs-de-lys. In another form the ends are connected by cross-bars. The escarbuncle of the reign of Henry III. resembles the iron work on doors of that period.

Blount of Bitton: argent, two bars azure, over all an escarbuncle of eight rays gules, fleurette'e and pornettée or.

Among musical instruments the Clarion is borne by Granville, and is seen on tiles at Neath abbey. It resembles a pan-pipe. The Trumpet is seen on the fine Trumpington brass near Cambridge.

williams of Thame: azure, two organ pipes saltierwise, the dexter over the sinister, between four saltires argent

The Water Budget or bucket is an early charge identified, with the names of Ros and Rose. Ros, however, got it from the Trusbuts of Belvoir, who possibly bore it as lords of Watre in Holderness. Mr Planché has discovered a drawing of a pair of water budgets in actual use. They were of leather, and carried in pairs on a stick over the shoulder.

Debased Heraldry.

Of debased heraldry there is no lack of examples, and a few are ancient. Thomas de Insula, bishop of Ely (1345-61), bore gules, three bezants, on each a crowned king, robed sable, doubled eπnine, sustaining a covered cup in his right hand and a sword in his left, both or. No doubt, like the arms of the sees of Chichester and Salisbury, this extraordinary coat was meant to be painted on a banner. Camden granted a great number of coats, mostly of a complex character, and since his time heraldic taste has not improved. Tetlow (granted 1760) bore “on a book erect gules, clasped and leaved or, a silver penny argent, thereon written the Lord’s Prayer; at the top of the book a dove proper, in his beak a crowquill pen sable.” Other grants show negroes working in a plantation, Chinese porters carrying cinnamon, &c. The grants to Lord Nelson and his gallant captains, and to the elder Herschel, are utterly unheraldic. It can scarcely be wondered at that Lord Chesterfield, correcting the Garter of his day, remarked, “You foolish man, you don’t understand your own foolish business.”

Differences and Marks of Cadency.

The object of an armorial bearing having been to distinguish one iron-sheathed warrior from another, it was necessary to provide bearings for the members of a family, all entitled to take the paternal coat. This was managed by the introduction of a difference (French, brisure), usually some slight but well-marked alteration, sometimes by inverting the tinctures, sometimes by changing an ordinary or a smaller charge, as a bend for a fess, or a crosslet for a martlet. Where an heiress had been married a part of her coat was often introduced. The object was with a sufficient difference to show the connexion with the head of the house. The following examples are from the families of Hastings and Zouch. Females, who wore no armour, did not need distinguishing marks, and bore the coat unbroken. Sir John Hastings bore (see fig. 123) or, a maunch gules, called “le de plein armes.”

Sir William Hastings bore the same, with a label of Pembroke. Sir John Hastings bore the same, with a border of Valence. Sir Edmund Hastings bore the same, with a label vert.

Sir Nicholas Hastings bore the same, with a label azure.

Sir Miles Hastings bore or, a fess and a chief, three mullets gules. Sir Philip Hastings bore the same, with a label azure.

Sir Robert Hastings bore ermine on a chief azure, three mullets or.

The label of Pembroke and border of Valence show the match with the heiress of Valence, earl of Pembroke. Sir Miles formed a distinct branch, that of Daylesford, probably before armorial bearings were fixed; his descendants, however, returned to the maunch.

Sir Alan la Zouch bore gules, bezanty.

Sir William la Zouch bore the same, with a quarter ermine. Sir William la Zouch bore the same, with a label azure.

Sir Oliver la Zouch bore the same, with a chevron ermine. Sir Amory la Zouch bore the same, with a bend argent.

Sir Thomas la Zouch bore the same, on a quarter argent a mullet sable. ’ . ' -

The quarter ermine is to show the descent from the dukes ol Britanny.

These and many others of an early date are suitable foi their purpose; but, as armorial bearings became less actually useful, alterations of a different character crept in. The label, however, retained its place. It closely resembles the strap with pendants which from the saddle crossed the horse’s chest. The earliest example of its use is said to be by Geoffréy, son of Henry II., in 1153, but a more certain case is the seal of Saher de Quincy, though whether there borne as a charge or as a difference is uncertain. At Caerlavrock Maurice de Berkeley bore a blue label “parceque ces pere vivoit.” In Scotland William Fraser, in 1295, uses a label of three points and on each three roses or mullets, probably meant for “fraises” or strawberry leaves. The mullet, crescent, and fleur-de-lys are used as differences about the same time. The label, even then, was most frequently used by the eldest son, but occasionally he used the crescent, and the label was taken by the second son. The royal house generally used the label, but occasionally the border. Edward I., as prince, bore a label of five points azure; Edmund Crouchback his brother, who married a French princess, charged the label with fleurs-de-lys. His second son, Henry, bore England with a bendlet ermine. Thomas and Edward, second and third sons of Edward I., used labels. Edward IV., as prince, bore on his great seal a label of three, and on his counterseal one of five points. John of Eltham, his brother, bore England with a border of France. The Black Prince, who bore France and England quarterly, added a label argent, and Richard, during his father’s life, placed a cross of St George on the middle point. Lionel, third son of Edward III., having married the heiress of De Clare and De Burgh, used a label and on each point a canton gules, said to be the original arms of De Clare, and on his seal as earl of Ulster each point bore a cross for De Burgh. The number of points was matter of indifference, though usually confined to three. The label itself was, on the whole, and has continued to be, a mark for all the princes of the royal house.

Setting aside the royal family, a new system of differences came into use, and is touched upon by Upton early in the 15th century, though then but imperfect. He gives the crescent to the eldest son, and to the others the label with three or more points in succession. Dame Berners, in 1486, besides employing the billet, crosslet, and other marks, describes a method of differencing by “gerratting,” that is, powdering the field with billets or other charges, but the good lady’s coats are often mere fancies. The first regular appearance of the modern system is on the effigies of seven Beauchamp cadets in St Mary’s windows at Warwick. There the label, annulet, crescent, martlet, fleurde-lys, and mullet indicate the several cadets. The label is placed in chief, the rest on the fess point of each surcoat.

The modern marksnow regularly admitted are—(1) the label of three points; (2) the crescent; (3) the mullet; (4) the martlet; (5) the annulet; (6) the fleur-de-lys; (7) the [9:11:705] rose; (8) the cross moline; (9) the octofoil (fig. 124). The elder son of the elder son places a label upon a label, the second a crescent, and so on, so that the ninth son of a ninth son would bear an octofoil upon an octofoil, pointing out the relationship of each member to the parent stock; Practically, however, marks of cadency are but seldom used. The earls of Harrington indeed, descending from the second son of a second son, place a crescent upon a crescent. Lords Abergavenny and Braybrooke difference their Neville saltire with a rose, as springing from the seventh son of Ralph, earl of Westmoreland. On the other hand Lord Derby, though a cadet, bears his arms unbroken.

Harks of Illegitimacy are very various, and on the earlier coats not to be distinguished from differences. Probably the earliest English example is afforded by Wm. Longspee, natural son of Henry II., who bore six lioncels, no doubt derived from his father, though usually attributed to his wife Ela, heiress of the earldom of Salisbury. His counterseal bears the long sword whence he derived his name. The sons of Richard, brother of Henry 1II., bore their father’s lion of Poitou, inverting the colours, until Sir Geoffrey Cornwall took prisoner the duke of Britanny, when he changed his field to ermine. In the roll of Edward II., Sir John Lovel le Bastard bore Lovel, usually or and gules, with “un label d’azur.” Sir Roger Clarendon, son of the Black Prince, has already been mentioned (page 701). John Beaufort, son of John of Gaunt, bore per pale argent, and azure on a bend gules three lions of England, with his father’s label. After his semi-legitimization he bore England with a border gobonny argent and azure, the Lancaster colours. Arthur, Viscount Lisle, son of Edward IV., placed a bâton over his father’s arms. Sometimes the father’s coat was altered. Sir John Stanley bore a coat compounded of Stanley and Lathom. Sometimes a bâton sinister was added, sometimes a border. Strictly a natural son does not adopt his father’s quarterings, unless such as are habitually borne conjoined, as the royal arms. The descendants of Charles II. bear the whole arms with a bâton sinister or border; those of William IV. the bâton. With the house of Bourbon the bâton marked the cadets, the bâton sinister the bastards. Sir Gilbert Talbot (1569), son of a bastard son of Sir Gilbert Talbot, was allowed Talbot and the usual five quarterings of the family, with a bendlet sinister over the whole, but this is unusual.

Rules of Blazon.

To blazon a coat of arms is to describe it in the technical language of heraldry; and, although the works of the fathers of heraldic lore contain much irrelevant matter, and some confusion of arrangement, the rules of blazon, by whomsoever devised or perfected, are remarkable for their precision, brevity, and completeness. Great and successful care has been taken to produce clear and simple order, to avoid repetition, and to preserve a certain uniformity of arrangement through much complexity of detail. The technicalities arise in great measure from the use of terms once well known, and the language, as was to be expected, shows traces of the French and Franco-Norman channels through which the “gentle art” reached England.

First comes the description of the field, its colour, or the arrangement of the colours (if more than one), and the character of the partition lines when parted. Thus the “parma inglorius alba” would be blazoned “he beareth argent.” The coat of Waldgrave is per pale argent and gules; that of D’Ebroicis, earl of Gloucester, was “per pale dancette argent and gules.”

Next follow the charges, and first those of most importance and nearest the field, their name, number, and position (if an animal, its attitude), and finally the colour. The principal charge is that which occupies the principal position. Thus Backhouse of Keilet bore party per saltire, azure and or, a saltire ermine; Bigland of Bigland, azure, two ears of bigg or. Where the principal charge is an ordinary placed between smaller charges, it follows the field: Foliot,—or, a fess between two chevrons gules. The same rule holds where the ordinary is charged, as in Braithwaite of High Wray,—gules, on a chevron argent three cross crosslets fitchy sable; or when the two are combined, as Kerr of Cessford,—vert, upon a chevron between three unicorns’ heads erased argent, horned and crined or, as many mullets sable. Where the ordinary may be charged, but does not admit of being placed between charges, it is blazoned thus: Russell,—argent, a lion rampant gules, on a chief sable three escallops of the field. If the field be semée of figures lf.e., besprinkled with them in regular order) they follow it: Pierrepoint,—argent, semée of cinquefoils gules, a lion rampant sable. Had the cinquefoils been on the lion instead of on the field the blazon would have run, argent a lion rampant sable, semée of cinquefoils gules.

The arrangement of common charges has already been explained (page 698, fig. 85) if one, central; if two, per pale; if three, 2 and 1; if more, as must be specified, as in Babington (fig. 9). Such diminutives as are borne in pairs follow their ordinary: Cludde,—argent, a bend between four cotises sable. To avoid repetition, if a tincture occurs twice reference is made to the first: Scott of Abbotsford, —or, two mullets in chief and a crescent in fess, azure, within an orle of the last; and so if the same number of charges occurs twice, the words “as many” are used: Maling of Scarborough,—ermine, on a chevron vert between three hawks’ jesses as many roses argent. Upton, who wrote in Latin, is put to strange shifts to express his meaning. He thus blazons the arms of Mortimer (fig. 63) :—

“Portavit arma barrata, et caput scuti palatum est et angulatum de azorio et auro, cum quodam scuto simplici de argento.” In heraldic French this is, “11 portoit barrée et ungchef palée cunetée d’asur et d’or, et ung escu simple d’argent.”

The following, from Menestrier, is the full blazon of the arms of the old kings of France :—

D’asur a trois fleurs-de-lys d’or 2 and 1. Escu timbré d’un casque ouvert d’or placé de front, assorty de ses lambrequins d’or et d’asur, couronné de la couronne imperiale Françoise, entouré des colliers des ordres du St Esprit et St Michel, soutenu par deux anges vetus en Levites; la dalmatique des émaux de l’escu tenant chacun un baniere de France; le tout placé sous un grand pavillon d’asur fleurde-lisé d’or doublé d’ermines; le comble rayonné d’or et couronné de la couronne imperiale Françoise.

Le dit pavillon attaché à la baniere ou oriflamme du Royeaume. Cri du guerre, “Montjoye St Denis.” Devise, “Lilia non laborant neque nent,” alluding to the operation of the Salic law.

Marshalling Arms.

Marshalling is the disposing or arranging of such coats of arms as have to be included in one shield. Blazoning deals with the particulars of each coat, marshalling with its position as regards other coats. Arms maybe arranged per pale or impaled, or the shield maybe divided into as many squares as may be required, when it is said to be quartered. The first coat, that of the bearer, may or may not be repeated in the last quarter as may be required to make up an even number of squares, which, though not necessarv. is desirable.
[9:11:706]

For a time armorial bearings were purely personal, and intended to supply a want only felt by the wearer of armour. Hence, at first, females do not seem to have used them, and when a place was found for them on armorial seals, the coat was regarded as that of their father, and therefore not differenced. For a time they seem to have had a separate shield. On one of the seals of Margaret of France, queen of Edward L, his three lions are displayed upon the point of her tunic, and on her right hand is a shield of France, on her left, one with a lion rampant. On the reverse is a shield of England, and around it, outside, a border of France. Margaret Bruce of Skelton married Robert de Ros. Her seal (1280) bears her effigy, somewhat defaced, so that nothing can be distinguished on her dress, but on her right is a shield of Ros, on her left one of Bruce.

A well-known seal, date about 1347, is that of Joan, daughter of Henry count of Bar, by Eleanor daughter of Edward I. by Eleanor of Castile. Joan was widow of Warren, earl of Surrey. Her seal is circular, with nine compartments. In the centre is Warren for her husband; above and below, England for her grandsire; right and left are two barbels for her father. These four are on lozenges. In the four corner compartments are—(1) and (4) a lion for Leon, and (2) and (3) a castle for Castile, for her grandmother. This is a sort of nebulous quartering.

To this succeeded the allotment to the wife of the sinister half of the husband’s shield, displayed as though two shields had been divided vertically and united, omitting therefore the adjacent half of each coat. This is called dimidiation, and the shields so joined constitute an impalement. Another seal of Margaret of France illustrates this practice. In it half of England impales half of France. There is a good example of dimidiation in the tomb of William de Valence at Westminster, where Valence impales Clermont-Nesle, both dimidiated. An early German seal combines half an eagle with half a lion in this way. The arms of the Cinque Ports are remarkable examples of dimidiation. In each, the lions of England are dimidiated with the arms of the special Port. That of Hastings (fig. 125) is party per pale dimidiated, Dexter, gules, three lions passant gardant or; Sinister, azure, three demi-hulks of ships argent. Sometimes one of the coats only was dimidiated. Eleanor (Montendre) was widow of Guy Ferre. Her seal (1348) has a shield of Ferre, a cross moline and over it a bâton, dimidiated, impaling Montendre, a lion within an orle of trefoils. The lion is whole. The seal of Elizabeth, wife of Sir Lawrence Berkerolles (fig. 126),—azure, a chevron or, between three crescents argent, impaling a lion rampant,—is a good example of an impalement without dimidiation (date 1392).

Usually the lady has the sinister side, but in the seal of Marion, wife of Sir William Dalziel (1392) this is reversed, as it is in the impaled shield of John of Gaunt, where his wife, a daughter of Peter of Castile and Leon, has the dexter side. Dimidiation is not applicable to all coats. A canton on the sinister coat would be lost, and a chevron be converted into a bend. The tressure, orle, and border were usually, not always, dimidiated; and although this form of impalement has fallen into disuse, these charges are still borne dimidiated, as may be seen with the border and tressure on the tomb of Mary, queen of Scots.

When the lady was the last of her race, various modes were devised for the conservation of her name and arms. Thus on the death (1193) of Robert de Lacy, last of the line of Pontefract, John, constable of Chester, half-brother to Robert by his mother, took the name and arms of Lacy, and was ancestor of the earls of Lincoln of that name. In the same century Isabel, heiress of Earl Warren, married Hamelin Plantagenet, who took the name, and their children bore the arms of Warren; and so with the Mandevilles, earls of Essex.

Sometimes a coat was compounded of the two families. Thus Mr Planché is of opinion that the bend was added to the paternal coat of Bohun, on the marriage with the heiress of Milo, earl of Hereford. Scottish seals show many examples of such composition. Eustacea Colvile, widow of Reginald le Chein, in 1316, bore a cross moline, square pierced, for Colvile, between four cross crosslets fitchy for Chein. About the middle of the 14th century began the practice of placing the arms of females upon a lozenge. As early as 1347 Elizabeth D’Arcy so bears her arms, as in 1356 does Maud Fitz Payne. The seal of Joan Beaufort, widow of James I., affords the earliest Scottish example.

The first step towards a regular method of preserving heraldically the memory of a family extinct in the male line seems to have been taken in Spain by a process now known as quartering. Eleanor of Castile, queen of Edward I., has upon her tomb a shield divided into four quarters, in the first and fourth of which is Castile, and the second and third Leon. The practice, though not finally regulated, was approved, for on the seal of the “She-wolf of France,” queen of Edward II., the shield is quartered (1) England, (2) France, (3) Navarre, (4) Champagne, mixing up confusedly the arms of husband and wife, as they also are upon the shield of Philippa of Hainault, queen of Edward TIL, who bore quarterly, (1) and (4) England, (2) and

(3) Hainault and Holland. A very early instance of regular quartering occurs in the will of Humphrey Bohun, earl of Hereford, dated 11th August 1319, by which he bequeaths a courte-point quartered with the arms of England and Bohun. This is five years before the accession of Edward III., and makes it probable that the quartered coat of William de Foix at Winchester is original.

Under Edward III. quartering came into general use. The king led the way by quartering France and England, and the earl of Pembroke followed, quartering Hastings and Valence. John Hastings, his son, commemorated on his shield his father’s match with Ann daughter of Margaret, duchess of Norfolk, a co-heir of Thomas of Brotherton, and this affords an early instance of the precedence often given in quartering to the royal arms. John Hastings bore quarterly of four—(1) and (4) Brotherton (Plantagenet), (2) Hastings, (3) Valence; and, on another example—(1) and

(4) Brotherton, (2) and (3) Hastings quartering Valence. This latter arrangement of sub-quartering shows a considerable advance in the system. Henry IV. combined quartering with dimidiation in a shield long preserved in the window of Christ Church, Newgate, which bore France and England quarterly, impaling France with a bend gobonny, and Navarre quarterly, dimidiated, for Joan of Navarre. In this case the 1st and 3d quarters were removed, and the sinister bearings thus reduced to what may be better blazoned as party per fess, (1) Navarre, (2) France. The French sometimes quartered diagonally, called “Écartèle en sautoir.” The old kings of Sicily thus divided their shield: party per saltire, (1) and (4) Aragon, (2) and (3) Swabia. This plan never found favour in England, where [9:11:707] a regular system of quartering sprang up, and has continued in use. A quartered shield, though of no special family, is shown by fig. 12.

At first the arms of an heiress were impaled by her husband, but latterly they were placed on a central inescutcheon designated an escutcheon of pretence. The children divided the shield into four quarters, and placed the paternal coat 1 and 4, the maternal 2 and 3. If a second heiress came in, she was placed in No. 3; if a third, in No. 4; if more, the shield was divided as required. The following pedigree will explain the system. In it all the descents that did not bring in an heiress are omitted.
[table]

1. Monthermer: or, an eagle displayed vert.

2. Montacute: argent, three fusils conjoined in fess gules.

3. Neville: gules, a saltire argent.

4. Newburgh: checquy or and azure, a chevron ermine.

5. Mauduit: argent, two bars gules.

6. Beauchamp: gules, a fess between six cross crosslets or.

7. Le Despenser: quarterly, 1 and 4 argent, 2 and 3 gules, a fret or, over all a ribbon sable.

8. De Clare: or, three chevrons gules.

9. Clarence: quarterly France and England, a label of three points argent, each charged with a canton gules.

10. Gloucester: quarterly France and England, a label of three points ermine, on each point a canton argent.

The armorial bearings of each generation will be as follows :—

1. Monthermer alone. 2. Montacute impaling Monthcrmer. 3. Neville impaling quarterly, 1 and 4 Montacute, 2 and 3 Monthermer. 4. Newburgh alone. 5. Mauduit impaling Newburgh. 6. Beauchamp impaling quarterly, 1 and 4 Mauduit, 2 and 3 Newburgh. 7. Le Despenser impaling

6. R._ Beauchamp: quarterly of four—1 and 4 Beauchamp, 2 Mauduit, 3 Newburgh impaling quarterly of four—1 and 4 Le Despenser, 2 and 3 De Clare.

3. R. Neville: quarterly of four—1 and 4 Neville, 2 Montacute, 3 Monthermer; impaling quarterly of six—1 and 6 Beauchamp, 2 Mauduit, 3 Newburgh, 4 Le Despenser, 5 De Clare.

9. George, duke of Clarence: France and England quarterly, impaling Isabel Neville quarterly of nine—1 and 9 Neville, 2 Montacute, 3 Monthermer, 4 Beauchamp, 5 Mauduit, 6 Newburgh, 7 Le Despenser, 8 De Clare.

The above, being a well-known and very noble pedigree, has been selected toillustrate the system of quartering, which is explained by the shield (fig. 127), thus emblazoned :—

1, George, duke of Clarence; 2, Neville, who brings in 3, Montacute; 4, Monthermer; 5, Beauchamp, who brings in 6, Mauduit; 7, Newburgh; 8, Le Despenser; 9, De Clare.

Unfortunately the several bearers of these arms were fanciful, and sometimes gave precedence to one and sometimes to another coat, and indeed never used the whole, which would have crowded their shields and caparisons. The four woodcuts f figs. 128-31, will illustrate this.

They represent the great seals of Richard Beauchamp, earl of Warwick, who married Isabel le Despenser, and Richard Neville, carl of Warwick, who married Anne Beauchamp.

Beauchamp quarters the arms of his wife, but makes De Clare impale Le Despenser, while he himself impales Newburgh. The blazon would thus be quarterly of four grand quarters—I. and IV., Beauchamp impaling Newburgh; II. and III., De Clare impaling Le Despenser (fig. 128). On the counterseal (fig. 129) the earl bears on his shield Beaucha mp and Newburgh quarterly, and on his caparisons Beauchamp, Newburgh, De Clare, and Le Despenser also quarterly.
[9:11:708]

The other is the seal of the king-maker. As lord of Glamorgan he gives precedence to De Clare and Le Despenser, and hears quarterly of four grand quarters—I. and IV. quarterly, De Clare and Le Despenser; II. and HL, Montacute and Monthermer; Neville not appearing at all. The crests are those of Beauchamp and Montacute. The remaining supporter is the Neville hull, muzzled, and below are ragged staves for Beauchamp (fig. 130).

The counterseal gives on the shield Neville above with a label, and the swan crest on the helmet. The caparisons are quarterly of four grand quarters: I. quarterly—1, effaced; 2 and 3, Newburgh charged with five pards’ heads, jessant fleurs-de-lys for Cantelupe; 4, Beauchamp; II. and III.—1 and 4, De Clare; 2 and 3, Le Despenser; IV.—1 and 4, Beauchamp; 2 and 3, Newburgh (fig. 131).

The rules were also departed from where the royal arms were quartered, as by Devereux, Hastings, and Stafford, when it was usual to place them in the first or second quarter out of their genealogical order. Also in certain cases the quarterings of an heiress are not broken up, but borne combined as a sub-quarter, sometimes called a grand quarter. Thus the royal arms always form a special quarter, and probably the arms of Howard, quartering, as they always do, Brotherton, Mowbray, and Warren, would be so treated.

Tlιe English mode of quartering is defective, inasmuch as it affords no proof of purity of descent on both sides. A new man whose father married a Talbot or Clinton heiress would combine their ancient quarterings with his new coat, and few would be the wiser. On the Continent and in Scotland the system is far more perfect, and the quarterings include all ancestors and ancestresses of every kind. Thera a man who can prove the arms of his father and mother has two quarters ; of his grandfather and grandmother, four; and so on. The following scheme, supplied from the family records of Mr C. J. Middleton, registrar of the prerogative court, the representative in the male line of a Scottish family, the Middletons of Fettercairn, two of whom were earls of Middleton, will explain this. It gives, or nearly gives, the well-known “seize quartiers,” without which, in former days, scarcely any important office was ever to be obtained :—

The arms are thus marshalled (fig. 132) :—

When John de Foix, count of Candale, was about to marry Joan, daughter of William de la Pole, duke of Suffolk, by Alice Chaucer, the “probatio nobilitatis” was sought for, though with little success, in England [9:11:709] “1, Petitur informatio lineoe De la Pole, et primo quaenam fuerit mater G 1 , de la Pole; 2^o. Quinam fuerint ejusdem pater et mater; 3 tio ∙ Quaenam fuerit uxor Thomae Chaucer seu mater Aliacie, &c. . . . Placebit arma gentilitia familiarum Pole, Chauceri, et aliarum, quae apponuntur in superioribus loculamentis, indicare, aut pictura cum debitis coloribus, aut scriptura, per armorum figuras et colores.”

This sort of’ escutcheon at once placed before the eye the heraldic history of the family for four generations.

Bishops, deans, kings-at-arms, and the heads of certain corporations weir their paternal arms impaled by those of their office. No provision is made for the wife.

Single women or widows bear their arms upon a lozenge. Widows and peeresses use their husband’s supporters. Peeresses in their own right use their own. But no lady uses crest or motto.

A commoner who marries a peeress in her own right uses two shields. On the dexter are his own arms with those of his wife on a scutcheon of pretence ensigned with her coronet; on the sinister the lady’s arms alone on a lozenge with supporters and coronet. If the lady be only a dowager peeress, and not an heiress, there are also two shields. On one the husband impales her arms in the ordinιry way; on the other are the lady’s arms, <fcc., as a widow, impaled by those of her first husband, with his supporters and coronet, but no crest, and the arms in a lozenge.

A baronet of England or Ireland bears a sinister hand couped gules on an inescutcheon or a canton. It is blazoned “argent, a sinister hand, couped at the wrist and ap-paumée, gules.” Those of Nova Scotia bear argent on a shield of pretence, Scotland ensigned with a crown.

Bacon of Redgrave, the premier baronet, bears gules, on a chief argent two mullets pierced sable (fig. 133).

A knight of an order surrounds his shield, usually a cartouche, with the ribbon and motto of the order. If married he takes a second and sinister shield, and thereon impales his wife’s arms, the whole within a plain ribbon.

A widower marrying a second wife divides his shield tierce per pale, and places his own arms in the centre, his first wife’s on the dexter, his second’s on the sinister side. For a greater number there is no strict rule. A certain Sir Gervase Clifton who survived seven wives, placed himself in the centre of the shield, and his wives around him. The widow of two husbands may divide her lozenge tierce per pale, and place her first husband on the dexter side, her second in the centre, and herself in the sinister place; or she may divide the dexter half on her lozenge per fess, and place the arms of the first husband above, and those of the second below.

Appendages.

These include whatever is borne outside the shield, as the crest, badge, motto, supporters, helmet, coronet, and some other additions. Strictly speaking, armorial bearings are confined to the contents of the shield; and heralds have never regarded the appendages as of the same importance.

The Crest was the ornament of the headpiece, and afforded protection against a blow. In early rolls of arms it is not noticed. In early seals when it appears it is rarely heraldic. Richard I. wears a sort of fan-shaped ornament, but has a lion passant gardant on the front of his helmet. Edmund Crouchback in 1296 uses distinctly a crest. Of fourteen seals of horsemen in complete armour appended to the barons’ letter to the pope in 1301, three only have regular crests, although many have plumes. The three are—Thomas earl of Lancaster and Ralph earl of Gloucester, men of high rank, and Sir John St John, a great military commander. In the 14th century they became general. In 1355 the count of Hainault presented to Edward III. “unam galeam pretiosam cum apparatu quam idem comes solebat in capite suo gestare.” This was the crest of the eagle seen on the count’s seal, and which the king regranted at the fords of Annan to Montagu, earl of Salisbury. Edward himself used the lion, which has continued to be the crest of the English sovereigns. Adam de Blencowe (1356-7) had a grant of arms and crest of the Greystoke bearings from William, lord of Greystoke.

Richard Beauchamp, earl of Warwick (died 1439), rests his feet upon the crests of the bear and griffin for Warwick and Montagu. His paternal crest, the swan’s head out of a ducal coronet, is placed upon his helmet, beneath his head. The dragon and wyvern were common crests, and the plume of feathers is still used by Scrope and Courtenay. Ralph, LordNeville of Raby, used the bull’s head in 1353; Hastings, a bull’s head in 1347. Crests were, like arms, allusive. Grey of Wilton used a “gray” or badger; Lord Welles, a bucket and chain; Botreaux, a buttress. The crest was sometimes placed on a ducal coronet, sometimes rises out of a wreath or torse of the colours of the arms. The coronet below the crest is not a mark of rank. In Carlisle cathedral is the crest of Davidson, a bird rising out of an earl’s coronet. This, however, is rare; the coronet so used is generally ducal. Crests were granted and bequeathed. In Germany it is usual to bear the crests of the “seize quartiers” or some of them. This of course is inconsistent vith the actual use of the crest in war. At first crests were confined to persons of rank, but they have long been included in every grant of arms. In England two or more can only legitimately be borne when the bearer has from the crow n a grant of name and arms in addition to his own, as Chetwynd-Talbυt, Fitz-Alan-Howard.

With the crest is usually combined some flowing drapery known as the “panache,” “mantling,” or lambrequin. This seems to have served to protect the helmet from heat and dust, and was also ornamental. It is represented in great perfection on tombs of the 15th and 16th centuries, commonly of some brilliant colour with a lining and tassels. The tilting helmet which supports the head of the effigy of Humphrey de Bohun (died 1267), at Gloucester, is accompanied by a grand early specimen of the lambrequin.

The Badge or Cognizance was not worn on the helmet, but displayed upon the persons of the retainers of great barons, and sometimes used to ornament the shield or seal. At the celebrated judicial combat at Coventry before Richard II. in 1398, Henry of Lancaster appeared wdth his housings of blue and green embroidered with swansand antelopes, his badges; and Mowbray had housings of crimson velvet, embroidered with silver lions and mulberry trees, his badges. The bear was the Beauchamp badge, derived possibly from Urso D’Abitot. They also used the ragged staff and the combination of the two.

The seal of Richard III., 1484, as lord of Glamorgan, exhibits the boar as a supporter, and the counterseal repeats it as a badge (figs. 134, 135). This seal well illustrates various heraldic points. Its blazon is per pale, baron and femme; baron, France modern and England quarterly, over all a label of three points; femme, per fess, Beauchamp, and checquy, on a chevron five pards’ heads jessant fleurs-de-lys, for Newburgh combined with Çantilupe. The same arms are repeated on the shields and caparisons of the counterseal. Richard married Anne Neville, but the Neville saltire does not appear, only the arms of Beauchamp and Newburgh, both of whom were earls of Warwick.

“The rampant bear chained to the ragged staff” was inherited by the Nevilles and Dudleys, and granted about 1759 to the Grevilles as the owners of Warwick castle. Pelham used a buckle, Percy a crescent, Boucher, Bowen, Dacre, Heneage, Hungerford, Lacy, Stafford, Wake, and [9:11:710] Harrington used the knots that bear their names. Gower designates the great nobles of his day by their badges, as is done in the following satirical lines written about 1449 :—

The rote^[5. Duke of Bedford.] is ded, the swan^[6. Beaufort, duke of Somerset.] is goon, The fiery cressett^[7. Bohun, for duke of Gloucester.] hath lost his lyght, Therefore Inglond may mak gret mone, Were not the helpe of God Almight. The castell^[8. Cardinal Beaufort.] is wonne, where care begoun The portecolys^[9. Duke of Exeter.] is leyde a doun; Yclosed we have oure Velvette hatte^[10. Duke of Norfolk.], That kepyd us from mony stormys brown. The white lion^[11. Rouen.] is leyde to slepe, Thorough the envy of the ape clogge^[12. Duke of Suffolk.], and so on, through interminable further instances.

The Scottish clans wore native plants for their badges: Chisholm, the alder; Menzies, the ash; M‘Intosh, the box, <fcc.

The Motto.— In times when each chief tenant under the crown brought his own tenants into the field, and led them, distinct war-cries were common. The royal cry was “St George for England.” The French cried, “Montjoye St Denis ;” the cri de guerre of Bauffrement was their name; that of Barr, “Au feu”; Seyton, “St Bennet and Set on.” The common Highland cry or slogan was “Claymore”; that of the Medici, “Palle, palle,” alluding to their arms. The motto succeeded to this (1291); Bruce of Annandale used “Esto fortis in bello”; Courtenay, “Passez bien devant’’; Hastings, “Honorantes me honorabo;” Kirkpatrick used the crest of the bloody dirk with the motto “I mak sicker.” The Warren motto, alluding to the earls’ resistance to the “quo warranto,” was “tenebo ;” Vernon, “God save the Vernon,” ill exchanged for “Vernon semper viret” The Scottish borderers, who lived by harrying their neighbours by moonlight, used stars and crescents for their arms, and such mottos as “Reparabit cornua Phoebe” for Scott of Harden, or “Watch weel” of Halyburton. In modern times Sir Dudley Ryder died while his patent of peerage was under seal. It was given to his son, who adopted as a motto “Fides servata cineri.”

Supporters are now placed on either side of the shield, and are usually animals or human figures. They seem to have arisen from the ornaments introduced by the seal engraver, and became heraldic with the practice of quartering. The seal of Edmund Crouchback bears a shield flanked by two wyverns, probably ornaments. That seal (1286) and the seal of Henry of Lancaster in 1300 contain both crest and helm, lambrequin and supporters. The seal of Catherine, queen of Henry IV., has two antelopes, and her husband as prince used two swans. At Naworth the family supporters, of gigantic size, support the principals of the roof of the hall. Under the house of Tudor many families of knightly rank, as Babington, Stanhope, and Luttrel, used supporters, but at this time supporters are only granted to peers, knights of the garter, grand crosses of the bath, Nova Scotia baronets, and a few private persons who hold them by prescription. In Scotland they are used by heads of clans and by a few lowland families. .Fletcher of Saltoun uses two griffins.

Another appendage is the Eagle, upon which some North Wales families place their shields, and the double-headed variety so used by nobles of the Holy Roman empire.

The Livery has long lost its early signification, and is used only for the dress of the retainers in their lord’s colour. At Richard III.’s coronation 8000 badges of the white boar were wrought upon liveries of fustian. A statute of Henry IV. forbade the use of liveries under heavy penalties, but they reappeared in the Wars of the Roses. Richard III. used “collars of livery,” but these were for persons of rank. One remains upon a Neville effigy at Brancepeth.

Crowns, Coronets, and Symbols of Panic.— The crown is the head attire of a sovereign prince. It is usually closed at the top by four arched bars called diadems, and surmounted by a globe and cross. Edward IV. is said to have first closed the English crown. That now in use is a circle of gold, jewelled, edged above with crosses patce and fleurs-de-lys alternate, and closed above with four bars and the cross and globe called in Germany the Reichsapfel (fig. 136). Since the Restoration the crown of the Princes of Wales has been surmounted by two bars, also with the Reichsapfel (fig. 137). They also use the plume of three ostrich feathers, with the words “Ich dien,” adopted by the Black Prince (fig. 138). Figs. 139 and 140 give representations of the imperial crown of Austria and the crown of the old kings of France. The Pope places three crowns over his mitre or tiara (fig. 141), said to have been severally assumed in 1295, 1335, and 1411. The crown imperial of Charlemagne maybe seen on a scutcheon of pretence on the arms of Hanover, as the [9:11:711] elector’s badge of arch-treasurer. The doges of Venice and Genoa bore a peculiar cap or toque, seen in Greek statuary, and upon the figures on the arch of Constantine.

The coronet is the head attire of a noble. In England those of princes of the blood are bordered with crosses pâtée and fleurs-de-lys under a regulation of 13 Charles II. (fig. 143). The princesses alternate the same ornaments with strawberry leaves (fig 144).

The coronet of a duke is bordered with eight strawberry leaves (fig. 145); that of a marquis with four alternating with four pearls placed on low points (fig. 146). An earl’s coronet· has eight strawberry leaves alternating with eight pearls upon tall points (fig. 147). The viscount borders his coronet with an indefinite number of pearls, set close upon the rim (fig. 148). The baron’s coronet, granted to the order by Charles II., carries six pearls placed on the rim at equal intervals,—four being seen at once (fig. 149). These coronets are all lined with ermine, and enriched with jewels. On occasions of state, when not worn by the peer, they are carried before him on a cushion.

The eldest sons of peers above the rank of viscount wear the coronet due to their father’s second title. The crowns of the kings at-arms are of gold, bordered with and encircled by the motto “Miserere mei, Domine.” The ducal, as an ancient form of coronet, is often used without reference to rank, as the base for a crest. It was so used by Sir Simon de Felbrigge in 1442.

A bishop has neither crest nor coronet, but ensigns his arms with a mitre. The bishops of Durham, while palatines, placed their mitre in a ducal coronet, as—though without authority—do the archbishops (fig. 150). The Berkeley crest is a mitre. The ancient mitre was low, and of linen stiffened with vellum. The central band and the margin, embroidered with fleurs-de-lys or other patterns, were called the orphreys. The pendent side ribbons were the “infulae.” Prelates of the church of Rome ensign their shields with a hat, the tassels of which indicate their rank. A cardinal has four rows of red tassels, arranged 1, 2, 4, 8, or 15 on each side; an archbishop the same, but green. A bishop has three rows, an a∣>bυt two; the abbot’s hat is black. Prelates and legates place a patriarchal cross in pale behind their shield.

The Helmet also indicates the rank of the wearer. It is placed above the shield, and beneath the crest. The sovereign and the royal family bear the helmet full-faced or affrontée with six bars, all of gold (fig. 151). Those of dukes and marquises are of gold with five steel bars (fig.

152) . The lesser nobles have silver helmets borne in profile with gold ornaments and four silver bars. Those of baronets and knights are of steel, full-faced and open (fig.

153) . An esquire’s helmet is of steel, represented in profile, with the vizor closed (fig. 154). These distinctions were probably introduced after the Restoration.

The Mantling is a sort of cloak or mantle of fur extended behind the shield, and sufficiently ample to include the whole achievement. Those of sovereigns are of gold doubled with ermine, and are called “pavilions.” Peers’ mantlings are of crimson velvet, doubled with white fur and barred with ermine spots; a duke has four bars, a marquis three and a half, an earl three, a viscount two and a half, and a baron two. Commoners use red mantlings lined with white fur. The prior of St John, whose place was on the right of the temporal barons, used a sable mantling doubled with murrey. The pavilion of France was of blue velvet, powdered with gold fleurs-de-lys, and lined with ermine. Such a mantling may be seen behind the arms of Beaumont in Rothley Temple chapel, in right of their descent from the blood-royal of France.

Certain officers of state accompanied their armorial shields with exterior marks of their rank. The Earl Marshal placed two truncheons saltirewise behind his shield, tipped above with the arms of England, and below with his own arms. His deputy places one truncheon in bend dexter.

In Scotland the Lord High Constable, the earl of Errol, places on either side of his shield an arm issuant from a cloud, and grasping a sword. Under the old monarchy the French colonels commandant placed the standards of their regiments saltirewise behind their shields.

The Lords High Admiral have been variously distinguished. Thomas de Berkeley bears on his brass a collar of tritons. Thomas, duke of Exeter, sealed with a ship and his arms on the mainsail. The anchor in some form or other was a common emblem.

Merchants’ marks are scarcely heraldic, though they took the place of arms with the trading classes. They were usually monograms of the name or initials. They were protected by law as marks on goods, and are seen on merchants’ tombs and sometimes in architecture.

Funeral Escutcheons.

Some of the.most valuable records in the College of Arms are the certificates of funerals conducted under their superintendence and authority. These gorgeous and expensive ceremonials have happily fallen into disuse, save on very rare occasions, and for royal persons or eminent public characters. The last private funeral conducted with anything like the ancient ceremonial was that of Charles, earl of Shrewsbury, in 1828. All that is now usual is the suspension of a shield of arms in a large black lozenge-shaped frame called a hatchment or achievement against the wall of the house of the deceased. It is usually placed over the entrance at the level of the second floor, and remains for from six to twelve months, when it is removed to the parish church. Even this custom, scarcely consistent with living in hired houses and burying in cemeteries, is falling into disuse, though still not uncommon.
[9:11:712]

If for a bachelor, the hatchment bears upon a shield his arms, crest, and other appendages, the whole on a black ground. If for a single woman her arms are represented upon a lozenge, bordered with knotted ribbons, also on a black ground. If the hatchment be for a married man (as in fig. 155), his arms upon a shield impale those of his wife; or if she be an heiress they are placed upon a scutcheon of pretence, and crest and other appendages are added. The dexter half of the ground is black, the sinister white. For a wife whose husband is alive the same arrangement is used, but the sinister ground only is black. For a widower the same is used as for a married man, but the whole ground is black; for a widow the husband’s arms are given with her own, but upon a lozenge, with ribbons, without crest or appendages, and the whole ground is black. When there have been two wives or two husbands the ground is divided into three parts per pale, and the division behind the arms of the survivor is white. Colours and military or naval emblems are sometimes placed behind the arms of military or naval officers. It is thus easy to discern from the hatchment the sex, condition, and quality, and possibly the name of the deceased.

In Scottish hatchments it is not unusual to place the arms of the father and mother of the deceased in the two lateral angles of the lozenge, and sometimes the 4, 8, or 16 genealogical escutcheons are ranged along the margin.

Undertakers are fond of substituting “In coelo quies” or some such commonplace for the family motto. This is irregular.

The literature of heraldry commences with the treatises of Sassoferrato about 1358, De Fosse in the reign of Richard 11., and Upton about 1441, all written in Latin and printed by Sir E. Bysshe in 1654. They are followed, by the Boke of St Albans, written by Dame Juliana Berners, prioress of Sopwell, and printed in 1486. These, especially those of Upton and Dame Juliana, are valuable. The lady writes in a mixture of early English and Latin, but her descriptions are intelligible and copious. These writers were followed by a crowd of others, of whom the chief were Gerard Leigh, Ferne, and Morgan, who wrote in the latter half of the 16th century. Their great aim was to elevate their subject by tracing back the use of armoiries to the patriarchs and heroes of Jewish and pagan antiquity, whom they invested with coats of arms on the type of those used by Norman barons. There are traces of this folly in Dame Juliana, but it reached its height in the writings of her successors, and was not quite extinguished when Guillim wrote his Display of Heraldry in. 1610. Guillim, whose work is still a standard, wrote in English, but as late as 1654 and 1688 Spelman, in his Aspilogia, and John Gibbon strove hard to restore the use of a dead language upon a subject to which it was eminently unsuitable. In 1722 and 1780 were published the excellent volumes of Nisbet, chiefly relating to Scotland, and of Edmondson, whose list or ordinary of bearings was long very useful to those who seek to identify the name to which a coat belongs, until superseded by the very laborious and far more complete work of Papworth.

Recently the same critical spirit that has pervaded the works of our historians has been applied with equal diligence to the whole subject of heraldry; a number of authors, led by Planché, Boutell, Seton, Nichols, and Lower, have set aside all the fabulous pretensions and baseless assertions of the earlier writeιs, have sifted the old evidence and adduced much that is new. The whole subject of heraldic and quasi-heraldic seals has been brought under notice by the publication of Laing’s fine plates of Scottish seals; and it may truly be said that the real origin and growth of the use of armorial bearings is placed before the reader in the books of these writers in a truthful and most attractive form.
