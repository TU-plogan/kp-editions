HALIBURTON, Thomas Chandler (1796-1865), long a judge of Nova Scotia, and a popular literary satirist, was born at Windsor, Nova Scotia, in 1796, and received his education there, at King’s College. He was called to the bar in 1820, and took part in the legislature of his native province as a member of the House of Assembly. He distinguished himself as a barrister, and in 1828 was promoted to the bench as a chief-justice of the common pleas. But it is as the brilliant humorist and satirist that he is now remembered; for his labours alike as a barrister and a member of parliament were limited to his own province, and could scarcely beget anything beyond a local reputation. Yet confined as he thus was to so narrow a sphere, a true estimate of its disadvantages is necessary in order to do justice to the vigorous individuality of his writings. He was a native of what was then a small and isolated maritime province, detached from Canada. Its exports consisted chiefly of lumber and the produce of its fisheries; and with those trade was carried on with Great Britain, the West Indies, and the United States. Its entire population at the time when Haliburton was called to the bar, including Indians, African refugees from the States, and the Acadian descendants of the original French population, did not amount to 97,000. The English settlers were largely composed of refugees from the former British colonies, animated by the strong Conservative sympathies of the old colonial loyalists. The French Acadians were Roman Catholics, and their national traditions and religion equally tended to alienate them from the neighbouring republic.

In politics Haliburton adhered through life to the Conservative party; and the influence of his early associations is traceable in most of his writings. He was still at the bar when he wrote An Historical and Statistical Account of Nova Scotia, in 2 vols. Canada, it will be remembered, then consisted of Upper and Lower Canada only, and, with the French population of the latter and nearer province, was even stranger to the Nova Scotian than the New England States. The leisure which judicial duties secured admitted of literary relaxations in which Judge Haliburton’s fine sense of the humorous had free play; and in 1835 he contributed anonymously to a local paper a series of letters professedly depicting the peculiarities of the genuine Yankee. These sketches, which abounded in clever pictur-ings of national and individual character, drawn with great satirical humour, were collected in 1837, and published under the title of The Clockmaker, or Sayings and Doings of Samuel Slick of Slickville. A second series followed in 1838, and a third in 1840. The Attache, or Sam Slick in England (2 vols. 8vo), was the result of a visit there in 1841. This also was followed up by a second series in 1844. His other works include— The Old Judge, or Life in a Colony; The Letter Dag of the Great Western; Ride and Misrule of the English in America; Traits of American Humour ; and Nature and Human Nature.

While the judge was thus diligent in such literary recreations, he continued to secure popular esteem in his judicial capacity. In 1840 he was promoted to be a judge of the supreme court; but within two years he resigned his seat on the bench, removed to England, and after a time entered parliament as the representative of Launceston, in the Conservative interest. His literary reputation awoke expectations which were not fulfilled. The bar has rarely proved to be an apt school for training the parliamentary debater, and he was too far advanced in life to adapt himself to the novel requirements of the English House of Commons. The last time he spoke he was listened to with interest on the Canadian defences. But the tenure of his seat for Launceston was brought to an end by the dissolution of the parliament in 1865, and he did not again offer himself to the constituency. His death followed in the month of August of the same year, at Gordon House, Isleworth, when he was in his seventieth year.^[1. Judge Haliburton was descended from the branch of the Newmains and Merton family which figures in the genealogical memorials of the Haliburtons in their relation to that of Sir Walter Scott, whose paternal grandmother was Barbara Haliburton. The note of all the families of the name drawn up by the father of the poet and novelist was prepared in reply to inquiries of the father of Judge Haliburton, with a view to the establishment of his claims to certain family property. Of a younger branch of the Newmains family that went to Jamaica, one member removed to Massachusetts. A son of his, the father of the judge, migrated to Nova Scotia, and there, in 1790, he revived old hereditary rights, and reclaimed relationship with the original Scottish stock.]
