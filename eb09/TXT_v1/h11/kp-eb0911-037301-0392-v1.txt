HAHN, August (1792-1863), German Protestant theologian, was born March 27, 1792, at Grossosterhausen near Eisleben, and after attending the Eisleben gymnasium, entered the university of Leipsic as a student of theology in 1810. After holding an educational appointment in Wittenberg for some time, he in 1819 was nominated professor extraordinarius of theology at Königsberg, and in the following year received a pastoral charge and a superintendency in that city. These posts, however, he soon τesigned on his promotion in 1821 to be professor ordinarius. In 1826 he removed as professor of theology to Leip3i'c, where, hitherto distinguished only as editor of Bardesanes, Marcion, and Ephraem Syrus, he came into extraordinary prominence as the author of a treatise, De rationalismi qn/i dicitur vera indole et qua cum naturalismo contineatur ratione (1827), and also of an Offene Erklärung an die Evangelische Kirche zunächst in Sachsen u. Preussen (1827), in which he endeavoured to convince the rationalists that it was their duty voluntarily and at once to withdraw from the national church. In 1833 Hahn was called to Breslau as theological professor and consistorial councillor, and in 1844 he became “general superintend- ent” of the province of Silesia. He died at Breslau on May 13, 1863. Though uncompromising in his “supranaturalism,” he did not altogether satisfy the men of his own school by his own doctrinal system. The first edition of his Lehrbuch des christlichen Glaubens (1828) was freely characterized as lacking in consistency and as detracting from the strength of the old positions in many important poflats. Many of these defects, however, he is considered to have remedied in his second edition (1857). Among the other literary labours by which Hahn is best known are his edition of the Hebrew Bible (1833) and his Bibliothek der Symbole und Glaubensregeln der apostolisch-katholischen Kirche (1842; 2d ed. 1877). A volume of Predigten was published in 1852.
