HERMANNSTADT (Hungarian Nagy-Szeben, Latin Cibinium), chief town of an Hungarian county of the same name, is advantageously situated on the Szeben, an affluent of the Aluta, about 72 miles S.E. of Kolozsvär (Klausenburg), and is the terminus of the Kapus and Nagy-Szeben branch line of railway, in 45° 48' N. lat. and 24° 9' E. long. It is the see of a Greek Orthodox bishop, the meeting place of the Lutheran consistory for the Transylvanian circle, and the headquarters both of the honvéd(or “defence-militia”) and of the regular infantry and artillery of the district; and it also possesses royal courts of law and assizes, and offices of finance, assay, state survey, and engineering. Hermannstadt has a somewhat mediaeval appearance, the streets being often narrow, and the houses built in the old German style. Of the squares the most striking is the large quadrangular market-place. The public buildings comprise Roman and Greek Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Calvinist, and Lutheran churches, a royal law academy, both Roman Catholic and Lutheran gymnasia, a Greek Orthodox seminary for priests, a hospital for the insane, foundling and orphan homes, Franciscan and Ursulan retreats, a house of correction, civil and military hospitals, county and town halls, the infantry and large new artillery barracks, the town theatre, the “Transylvania” assurance office, the “Albina” bank, and, above all, the Bruckenthal palace with its fine museum and library. Among the industrial establishments are factories for the preparation of soap, candles, soda, sulphuric acid, bone-dust, paper, cloth, linen, leather, caps, boots, combs, and building materials. There are also printing houses, tanneries, and rope-walks, several distilleries, and a large brewery. A brisk trade is carried on both at the regular weekly markets and at the special fairs. The civil population in 1870 was 18,998, of whom about two-thirds were of German (Saxon) and the remainder of Roumanian and Magyar extraction.

The German name of the town is traceable to Hermann, a citizen of Nuremberg, who about the middle of the 12th century established a colony on the spot. In the 13th century it bore the name of Villa Hermanni. Under the last monarchs of the native Magyar dynasty Hermannstadt enjoyed exceptional privileges, and soon became a thriving centre of trade, its commerce with the East rising to considerable importance. In the course of the 15th and 16th centuries it was several times besieged by the Turks. In 1610 it suffered at the hands of the Transylvanian prince Gabriel Bathori. At the beginning of 1849 it was the scene of several engagements between the Austrians and Hungarians; and later in the year it was several times taken and retaken, by the Russians and Hungarians, the latter being eventually forced to yield to overwhelming numbers, August 6.
