HÄRING, Wilhelm (1797-1871), German novelist, known as Wilibald Alexis, was born at Breslau, June 23, 1797. He attended the Werder gymnasium in Berlin, and served as a volunteer in the campaign of 1815. On his return he studied law for some time at the universities of Berlin and Breslau, but he soon gave up the legal profession and devoted himself to literature. He made some attempt to add to his income by practical undertakings, but they were rarely successful. He was fond of travel, and happened to be in Italy with his wife during the Revolution of 1848, the progress of which he had an opportunity of watching in Rome, Florence, and Naples. In 1852 he transferred his residence from Berlin to Arnstadt in Thuringia. Here he was laid low by paralysis of the brain, and after many years of suffering died on the 16th September 1871. Häring began his literary career in 1823 with a historical romance, Walladmor, which was given out as the work of Sir Walter Scott.^[1. One of the interlocutors in the jocular “Introduction” to Scott’s Betrothed (1825) supposes Wαllαd∩nor it to have been the work of Dousterswivel, by the help of the steam-engine.”] It rapidly became popular, and was translated into several languages, including English. He next published Schloss Avalon, which he attributed to the same author. Soon afterwards he issued a number of very successful short stories and several books of travel, and for a time he indicated a preference for the polemical tendencies of the school of Young Germany. In Cabanis, however, which appeared in 1832, he entered the special field of historical romance in which he was destined to achieve his highest fame. From 1840 onwards he published at short intervals a series of romances, each of which deals with some particular epoch in the history of Brandenburg. Among them may be named Der Boland von Berlin (1840), Der falsche Waldemar (1842), Der Werwolf (1848), Ruhe ist die erste Bürgerpflicht (1852), Isegrimm (1854), and Dorothe (1856). These tales are not only full of patriotic feeling, but in all of them the interest is well sustained and the characters are drawn with a bold and firm hand. His Gesammelte Werke have been issued in Berlin in 20 volumes.
