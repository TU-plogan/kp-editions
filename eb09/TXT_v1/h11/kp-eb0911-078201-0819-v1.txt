HESTIA, a Greek goddess, who is probably the latest in origin of the greater deities. She seems to belong to a particular stage in the advance of civilization, and to embody the religious sanction that confirmed the social system then reached. When we compare her worship with that of Agni, the nearest parallel in the Vedic period, we see that the Greeks made this advance after they had separated from the Aryan conquerors of India. Agni is invoked in the Rig Veda as the brother, friend, and helper of men, as dwelling with them and mediating between them and the gods. But beyond this Hestia is the hearth-fire as the centre of an association, wider or narrower, which meets in common at the hearth. She is not mentioned in Homer; in the Odyssey sometimes one swears by Zeus, the table and the hearth, i.β., by Zeus as the god of the family both in its external relation of hospitality and its internal unity round its own hearth. Hence we have the Zeus ΐστιώναξ, εστιoυχo<s, lφlστa>s. The former of these two ideas is too delicate and fine ever to become more than a mere aspect of Zeus, but the second gradually formed itself into a distinct worship, in which the already existing worship of the fire was merged. The fact that Hestia is not mentioned in Homer shows that her worship was not so universally acknowledged at the time which these poems reveal to us. Perhaps we may see in the connexion of the Latin Jupiter and Vesta at Lavinium a relic of the original connexion of the two; and the fact that the worship of this same goddess under the same name (they are only two forms of the feminine of the passive participle of the root vas, burn) is found in Latium and Greece affords strong evidence of a specially close connexion between the two races. We find therefore in Hestia relics of the old pre-Greek worship; she is the altar-fire, presiding over all sacrifices, and sharing in the honours of all the gods. The opening sacrifice was offered to Hestia; to her at the sacrificial meal the first and the last libations were poured. The fire of Hestia was always kept burning, or if by any mischance it were extinguished, only sacred fire made by friction, or got direct from the sun, might be used to rekindle it (see Kuhn, Herabkunft'). But beyond this she is the goddess of the family union, the personification of the idea of home (see Weicker, Gr. Goth, ii. 694), the protectress along with Zeus of the suppliants who fled for refuge to the hearth. To her therefore is ascribed the art of housebuilding. Hestia and Hermes are often united as the representatives of home and private life on the one hand, and of all business and outdoor life on the other. The city union, moreover, is just the family union on a large scale; it has its centre in the prytaneum, where the common hearth-fire round which the magistrates meet is always burning, and where the sacred rites that sanctify the concord of city life are performed. From this fire, as the representative of the life of the city, was taken the fire wherewith that on the hearth of a new colony was kindled. As patroness of the deliberations held in the prytaneum, Hestia is surnamed βονλαiα, Even larger unions than the city had their central fire: in Tegea was the Hestia of the Arcadians; and it is probable that the Achaeans had theirs at Aeginium. In the later mystic philosophy Hestia became the hearth of the universe, the eternal fire at the centre of the world.

As Hestia had her home in the prytaneum, special temples to her rarely occur. There was one in Hermione, where the only symbol of the goddess was a fire always burning on the hearth. We also hear of her house at Olympia. Her statue stood in the prytaneum at Athens beside that of Peace. Though many statues of the Roman Vesta are preserved, more or less based on the Greek conception of Hestia, yet no really Greek representation of the goddess has come down to us.
