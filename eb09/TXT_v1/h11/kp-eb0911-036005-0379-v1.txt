HADAD, the name of a Syrian deity, is met with in Scripture as the name of several human persons; it also occurs in the compounde Benhadad, Hadadrimmon, and Hadadezer. The etymology of the word, of which Hadar, Ader, and Arad appear to be incorrect variations, is obscure; the divinity primarily denoted by it, however, according to Philo of Byblos (Müller, Fr. Hist. Gr., iii. 569; cf Macrob., Saturn., i. 23), is the king of the gods, the greatest and highest, the sun; and these interpretations seem to point to some such radical meaning as unicus. The Syrian kings of Damascus seem to have habitually assumed the title of Benhadad, or son of Hadad (three of this name are mentioned in Scripture), just as a series of Egyptian monarchs are known to have been accustomed to call themselves sons of Ammon-Ra. The word Hadadrimmon, [9:11:361] for which the inferior reading Hadarrimmon is found in some MSS., in the phrase “the mourning of (or at) Hadadrimmon” (Zech. xii. 11), has been a subject of much discussion. According to Jerome and all the older Christian interpreters, the mourning for what occurred at a place called Hadadrimmon (Maximianopolis) in the valley of Megiddo is meant, the event alluded to being generally held to be the death of Josiah; but since Hitzig and Movers the opinion has been gaining ground that Hadadrimmon is merely another name for Adonis or Thammuz, the autumn sun-god, the allusion being to the mournings by which the Adonis festivals were usually accompanied ( Hitzig on Zech, xii. 11, Isa. xvii. 8; Movers, Phönizier, i. 196).

Full materials for the whole discussion will be found in Baudissin’s Studien zur Sem. Religionsgcsch. (1876), Abh. v. This author, however, has considerably modified his views in Herzog and Plitt’s 7?. E., s. v., having in his earlier essay been misled in important points by statements of Schrader (Keilinsch. und A. T., pp. 101 seq.), which have since been found to require correction (see Gutschmidt, Neue Beiträge, p. 47 seq. ; Wellhausen’s criticism of Baudissinin Gott. Gel. Anz. (1877), Stück 6; Schrader, Keil·rn. und Geschichtsforsch. (1878), pp. 371 scq., 538 seq.
