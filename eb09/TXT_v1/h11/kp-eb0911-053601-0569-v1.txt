HAWTHORN (Anglo-Saxon, haga-, hoeg-, or hege-thorn), Cratoegus, L., a genus of plants of the natural order Posaceoe and sub-order Pomeoe. The common hawthorn, termed also whitethorn, quickthorn, quickset, and May tree, May bush, or May (German, Hagedorn and Christdorn; French, Aubépine), C. Oxyacantha, L., is a shrub or small tree having a smooth blackish bark; numerous branches, beset usually with thorns, which represent aborted twigs; alternate, long-stalked, obovate-wedge-shaped, 3- or 5-lobed, incised or serrate smooth leaves; flowers sweet-scented, arranged in corymbs, and having caducous bracts, broad, white, pink, or scarlet petals, and 1 to 3 styles; and fruit or “haw” an oblong or nearly globular mealy pome, commonly dark red, but occasionally yellow, black, or even greenish-orange or dull white, and of 1 or 2 cells. The common hawthorn is a native of Europe as far north as 60⅛ o in Sweden, and of North Africa, Western Asia, and Siberia, and has been naturalized in North America and Australia. It thrives best in dry soils, and in height varies from 4 or 5 to 12, 15, or, in exceptional cases, as much as between 20 and 30 feet. There are several varieties of the plant. It may be propagated from seed or from cuttings. The seeds must be from ripe fruit, and if fresh gathered should be freed from pulp by maceration in water. They germinate only in the second year after sowing; in the course of their first year the seedlings attain a height of 6 to 12 inches. In England the hawthorn has been employed for enclosure of land since the Roman occupation, but for ordinary field-hedges it is believed it was not generally in use till about the end of the 17th century. James I. of »Scotland, in his Quair, ii. 14 (early 15th century), mentions the “hawthorn hedges knet” of Windsor Castle. The first hawthorn hedges in Scotland are said to have been planted by soldiers of Cromwell at Inch Buckling Brae in East Lothian, and Finlarig in Perthshire. On the planting and use of hawthorn fences, see Agriculture, vol. i. pp. 296, 310. The wood of the hawthorn is white in colour, with a yellowish tinge. Fresh cut it weighs 68 lb 12 oz. per cubic foot, and dry 57 lb 3 oz. It can seldom be obtained in large portions, and has the disadvantage of being apt to warp; its great hardness, however, renders it valuable for the manufacture of various articles, such as the cogs of mill-wheels, flails and mallets, and handles of hammers. Both green and dry it forms excellent fuel. The bark possesses tanning properties, and in Scotland in past times yielded with ferrous sulphate a black dye for wool. The leaves are eaten by cattle, and have been employed as a substitute for tea. Birds and deer feed upon the haws, which are used in the preparation of a fermented and highly intoxicating liquor, and for their astringency are sometimes resorted to in dysentery. The hawthorn serves as a stock for grafting other trees. As an ornamental feature in landscapes, it is worthy of notice; and the pleasing shelter it affords, and the beauty of its blossoms, have frequently been alluded to by poets. The custom of employing the flowering branches for decorative purposes on the first of May is of very early origin; but since the alteration in the calendar (see vol. iv. p. 677) the tree has rarely been in full bloom in England before the second week of that month. In Cornwall, however, in 1846, the flowers, though scarce, were gathered on the 18th April; and in the Scotch Highlands they may be seen as late as the middle of June. The hawthorn has been regarded as the emblem of hope, and its branches are stated to have been carried by the ancient Greeks in wedding processions, and to have been used by them to deck the altar of Hymen. The supposition that the tree was the source of Christ’s crown of thorns gave rise doubtless to the tradition current among the French peasantry that it utters groans and cries on Good Friday, and probably also to the old popular superstition in Great Britain and Ireland that ill-luck attended the uprooting of hawthorns. Branches of the Glastonbury thorn, C. Oxyacantha, var. proecox, which flowers both in December and in spring, were formerly highly valued in England, on account of the legend that the tree was originally the staff of Joseph of Arimathea (see Glastonbury, vol. x. pp. 674, 675). Sub-species of C. Oxyacantha are C. rnoηogyna, Jacquin, and C. oxyacanthoides, Thuill. C. Pyracantha and C. Crus-galli are among the cultivated species of Cratoegus.
