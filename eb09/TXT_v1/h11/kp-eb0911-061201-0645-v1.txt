HEEREN, Arnold Hermann Ludwig (1760-1842), an eminent German historian, was born 25th October 1760 at Arbergen near Bremen. He studied philosophy, theology, and history at Göttingen, and thereafter travelled in Italy, France, and the Netherlands. In 1787 he was appointed one of the professors of philosophy at Göttingen, and he afterwards was chosen aulic councillor, privy councillor, <tc., received in short those rewards which are the lot of successful German scholars. He died 7th March 1842. Heeren’s great merit as an historian was that he regarded the states of antiquity from an altogether fresh point of view. He examined their economic relations, their constitutions, their financial systems, and thus was enabled to throw quite a new light on the development of the old world. He possessed vast and varied learning, perfect calmness and impartiality, and great power of historical insight. A French critic has thus briefly summed up his merits—“He had all the qualities of the historians of his nation without their defects, and there is not a French historian superior to him in clearness of thought and method of composition.”

Heeren’s chief works were— Ideen uber Politik, den Verkehr, und den Handel der vornehmsten Völker der alten Welt (2 vols., Gott., 1793-1796; 4th ed., 5 vols., 1824-26; English trans., Oxford,

1833); Geschichte des Studiums der elassischen Literatur sed dem Wiederaufleben der Wissenschaften (2 vols., Gött., 1797-1802; newed., 1822); Die Geschichte der Staaten des Alterthums (Gott., 5th ed., 1826; English trans., Oxford, 1840); Geschichte des europäischen Staatensystems (Gott., 1800; 5th ed., 1830; English trans.,

1834); Versuch einer Entwickelung der Folgen der Kreuzzuge (Gott., 1808, and, in French, Paris, 1808, a prize essay of the Institute of France). Besides these Heeren wrote brief biographical sketches of Joh. von Miiller (Leipsic, 1810), Spittier (1812), and C. G. Heyne (Gött., 1813), founded with Ukert the famous historical collection Geschichte der europ. Staaten (Gotha, 1819, and following years), and contributed many papers to learned periodicals. A collection of Heeren’s Historische Werke was published in 15 vols., 1821-26.
