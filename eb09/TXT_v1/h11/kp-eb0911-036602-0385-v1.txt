HAeMORRHOIDS (from αtp,α, blood, and peω, to flow), commonly called piles, a frequent and distressing malady. Two varieties are described. They are named from their situation external and internal, as they are without or within the opening of the anus. The external pile is an overgrowth of the thin dark-coloured skin round the opening; there is most frequently more than one present; the skin, lax and redundant, hangs in folds. The internal pile lies altogether within the opening, although it may appear externally protruding through the anus when any pressure from above is applied, as when the patient strains at stool. It is covered by, and composed of an overgrowth of, the mucous membrane lining the bowel. There may be several internal piles. The internal pile is sessile or pedunculated. The external pile is of a pale colour. The internal pile is moist, vascular, and of a cherry-red colour; it is apt to inflame, and the inflammation is associated with heat, pain, and general uneasiness. Ulceration and bleeding are common symptoms of the internal pile, hence the term “bleeding” or “bloody piles.” Both varieties are probably due to the same primary cause—an enlargement of the veins in this region. Any cause which, by pressing on the large abdominal veins, retards the upward flow of blood to the heart will give rise to piles; such are constipation, disease of the liver, pregnancy. General weakness involving a want of tone in the blood-vessels may act as a predisposing cause. The exciting cause is frequently exposure to damp, [9:11:367] as from sitting on the wet ground. Piles are only a symptom, and in their treatment this should be kept in view; remove the cause and the piles will disappear. The local treatment is palliative or radical. The palliative treatment consists in attention to the state of bowels, cold bathing, astringent injections, lotions, and ointments. The radical treatment consists in their removal; the external pile is cut off, the internal pile is tied or clamped and cauterized. Both methods have their advocates; the radical treatment should not be undertaken until palliative treatment has failed. When in a state of inflammation the treatment consists in hip baths, hot fomentations, and poidtices. The introduction of a morphia suppository often relieves the uneasiness. Both varieties are often met with in the same individual; when this is the case both should be removed by operation at one time. The internal piles are apt to return if the predisposing cause is still in existence. Piles are apt to be confounded with other surgical diseases in this region, as fissure or ulcer, prolapse, polypus, or cancer. This is not the place to point out the distinguishing features of these different maladies; the patient should consult a surgeon. There is a form of pile situated just at the verge of the anus, where the skin joins the mucous membrane: its onset is sudden, and due to the rupture of a blood-vessel; the blood is extravasated and clots; a small, tense, painful swelling of a bluish colour is seen at the edge of the anus. This may be relieved by hot fomentations, or the pile may be laid open and the clot turned out by gentle pressure.
