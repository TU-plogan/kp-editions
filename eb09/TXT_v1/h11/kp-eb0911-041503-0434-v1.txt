HAMILTON, Robert (1743-1829), an able writer on political economy and finance, was born at Pilrig, Edinburgh, on the 11th June 1743. He was of good family, his grandfather, William Hamilton, professor of divinity and afterwards principal of Edinburgh University, having been a cadet of the family of Preston. He received an excellent education, and specially distinguished himself in the classes of mathematics at the university of Edinburgh, then under Professor Matthew Stewart. Although desirous of following a literary life, he was induced to enter the banking-house of Messrs Hogg in order to acquire a prae-tical[9:11:416] knowledge of business. In 1766 lie was disappointed in his effort to obtain the mathematical chair at Aberdeen university, but three years later he gave up business pursuits and accepted the rectorship of Perth academy. In 1779 he was presented to the chair of natural philosophy at Aberdeen university. For many years, however, by private arrangement with his colleague Professor Copland, Hamilton taught the class of mathematics. In 1817 he was presented to the latter chair. For some years before his death in July 1829 he had retired from the active business of his chair, and quitted his privacy only at rare intervals to take part in important affairs concerning the college.

Hamilton’s most important work is the Essay on the National Debt, which appeared in 1813 and was undoubtedly the first to expose the economic fallacies involved in Pitt’s policy of a sinking fund. It is still of value. A posthumous volume published in 1830, The Progress of Society, is also of great ability, and is a veιy effective treatment of economical principles by tracing their natural origin and position in the development of social life. Some minor works of a practical character {Introduction to Merchandize, 1778; Essay on JVar and Peace, 1790) are now forgotten.
