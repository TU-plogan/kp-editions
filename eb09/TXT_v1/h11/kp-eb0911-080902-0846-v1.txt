HIGDON, or Higden, Ranulf, was a Benedictine monk of the monastery of St Werberg in Chester, in which he lived, it is said, for sixty-four years, and died “in a good old age,” probably in the year 1363. He was buried, we are told in a note prefixed in the 16th century to the MS. of his work belonging to the library of Christ Church, Oxford, “in St Werberg’s Church (now Chester Cathedral), on the south side of the church near the choir, not far from the door which leads into the churchyard; an arch was made for him in the wall, and on the wall is the inscription, ‘Non hie sub muro, sed subter marmore duro.’” This monument, extant in the 16th century, seems now to have entirely disappeared. Higdon was the author of a long chronicle, one of several such works based on a plan taken from Scripture, and written for the amusement and instruction of the society to which the compiler belonged. Its chief interest perhaps lies in the fact that it closes the long series of general chronicles, which were soon put completely out of date by the invention of printing. It is commonly styled the Polychronicon, from the longer title Ranulphi Castrensis, cognomine Higdon, Polychronicon {sive Historia Ρolycratica) ab initio mundi usque ad mortem regis Edwardi III. in septem libros dispositum. The work is divided into seven books, in humble imitation of the seven days of Genesis, and, with exception of the last book, is a summary of general history, a compilation made with considerable style and taste. It seems to have enjoyed no little popularity in the fifteenth century. The Christ Church MS. says that Higdon wrote it down to the year 1342; the fine MS. at Christ’s College, Cambridge, states that he wrote to the year 1344, after which date, with the omission of two years, John of Malvern, a monk of Worcester, carried the history on to 1357, at which date it ends. According, however, to its latest editor, Higdon’s part of the work goes no further than 1326 or 1327 at latest, after which time it was carried on by two continuators to the end. Gale in his Quindecim Scriptores published that portion of it, in the original Latin, which comes down to 1066; an English translation of the whole was made by John of Trevisa, and printed by Caxton at his press in Westminster in 1482, with the addition of an eighth book. There is also an anonymous English translation of the work. The whole is being at this time carefully edited by Professor Lumby, B.D., under the authority of the Master of the Rolls; six volumes have appeared, 1865-1876.
