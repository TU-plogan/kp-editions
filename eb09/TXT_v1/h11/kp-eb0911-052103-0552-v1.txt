HAUG, Johann Christoph Friedrich (1761-1829), a German epigrammatist, was born March 19, 1761, at Niederstotzingen in Würtemberg, and received his early training from his father, who was afterwards professor and preacher at Stuttgart. From the gymnasium in this city Haug passed in 1776 to the Prince Charles academy, where he had Schiller as a fellow scholar, and, after finishing the philosophical and philological course, he devoted himself to the study of legal science with so much success that lie attracted the attention of the duke. In 1784 he was appointed secretary of the private closet to his patron, in 1791 received the title of curial and palatine count, in 1794 became the duke’s private secretary, and in 1817 was made Hofrath or aulic councillor and librarian of the public library at Stuttgart. In 1827 he travelled through northern Germany, and on 30th January 1829 he died. Haug began his career as an author by publishing Sinngedichte von Friedrich Hophthalrnos (Frankfort, 1791), the pseudonym Hophthalmos being a jocular Greek equivalent of his own name {Aug, the eye, equal to Ophthalmos, and therefore Haug equal to Hophthalmos).

Among his later works, which are as often characterized by a love of fun as by power of wit, it is enough to mention Epigramme und vermischte Gedichte, Berlin, 1805; Hundert Epigramme auf Aerzte die Keine sind, Zurich, 1806; Epigrammatische Spiele, 1807; Taschenbuch dem Bacchus und locus geweiht, Stuttgart, n.d.; Magische Laterne, Brünn, 1820; Panorama der Laune und des Witzes, Tübingen, 1826; and, perhaps more famous than any, Zweihundert Hyperbeln auf Herrn Wahls ungeheure Nase, Stuttgart, 1804, new edition, Brünn, 1822. Along with Weisses, Haug published Epigrammatische Anthologie, Stuttgart, 1807-1809, 10 vols. A selection from his poems appeared at Hamburg, 1827, 2 vols.
