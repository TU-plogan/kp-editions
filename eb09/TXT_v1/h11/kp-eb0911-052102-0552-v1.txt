HAUFF, Wilhelm (1802-1827), a popular German novelist, was born at Stuttgart, 29th November 1802. Having lost his father, who was a Government official, at the age of seven, he repaired with his mother to Tübingen, where he frequented the Schola anαtolica. In 1818 he was sent to the Klos ’ erschule at Blaubeuren, and two years later he entered the seminary of Tübingen. After having completed, in 1824, his philosophical and theological studies and taken his degree, he acted for two years as private tutor, and assumed, in January 1827, the editorship of the Morgenblatt . In the following month he married, and led a happy and quiet life, which was ended by a fatal illness on 18th November of the same year. Hauffs literary activity is comprised within the short space of about two years. In his Märchenalmanach for 1826 he published the Fairy Tales he used to relate to his pupils during his tutorship. They were distinguished by an originality of conception, a playful though somewhat fantastic humour, and an elegance of style, not usually met with in similar productions. Those fanciful tales founded his fame as a narrator, and form, together with his subsequent novels, several of which belong to the same species, the basis of his permanent reputation as an author. His next publication, Mittheilungen aus den Memoiren des Satans, “Extracts from the Memoirs of Satan” (2 vols. 1826-27), was of a fragmentary kind, but gave additional proof of his talent as a humorist. In 1826 he wrote a novel— Der Mann im Monde, “The Man in the Moon”—with the intention of satirizing and parodying the sentimental sensualism of Clauren; but in the course of composition the projected parody became a regular imitation, and, as he issued the novel under the name of that romancer, the latter brought an action against him for the abuse of his name, and gained his lawsuit. Hauff succeeded, however, in morally annihilating that maudlin narrator by his witty Controverspredigt, “Controversial Sermon” (1826). Animated by the genius of Sir Walter Scott, Hauff wrote a historical romance called Lichtenstein (1826), which illustrated the most interesting period in the history of Würtemberg, and, being one of the first historical German novels, acquired, in spite of its weakness as a literary composition, great popularity throughout Germany. His fanciful work, Phantasien im Bremer Rathsheller (1827), is pervaded, especially in the first portion of the book, by an exuberant spirit of conviviality, which exercises a cheering effect on the reader; but his most perfect fiction is the Bettlerin vom Pont-des-Arts. Hauff’s works have gone, collectively and separately, through many editions, and some of his shorter poems have become regular “Volkslieder.”
