HEINSE, Johann Jacob Wilhelm (c. 1746-1803), German romance writer, was born at Langenwiesen in the Thuringian Forest, February 16, 1746, or, according to some accounts, February 15, 1749. He was educated at the gymnasium of Schleusingen, and afterwards, through many privations, studied law at Jena and Erfurt. At Erfurt he became known to Wieland, and through Wieland’s recommendation to the poet Gleim, who, attracted by some of Heinse’s early literary attempts, offered him assistance and a home; but at this time he made the acquaintance of an adventurer, Captain von der Goltz, and was induced to accompany him on his travels. Von der Goltz easily succeeded in corrupting the taste and misdirecting the talents of the young author, and the baneful influence of this friendship pervades Heinse’s writings. After parting with Von der Goltz Heinse returned for a time to Langenwiesen, and afterwards obtained, with Gleim’s assistance, under the feigned name of Rost, a tutorship in the family of Von Massow at Quedlinburg, which, however, he did not keep very long. In 1774 he went to Düsseldorf to assist J. G. Jacobi in the production of the ∕ris journal. Tn 1780 he obtained from Jacobi leave and the necessary funds to travel in Italy. There he remained three years, living chiefly at Rome, where he was intimate with the painter Müller. In 1789 he obtained the post of reader to the elector of Mainz, who afterwards made him councillor and librarian. He died at Aschaffenburg, June 22, 1803.

Heinse’s works are— Sinngedichte, Halberstadt, 1771; Begebenheiten des Enkolp, translated from the Satiricon of Petronius, 2 vols., Schwabach, 1773; Die Kirschen, after Dorat’s Cerises·, Laidion, oder die Elcusinischen Geheimnisse, Lemgo, 1784; prose translations of Tasso’s Jerusalem Delivered, 4 vols., 1781, and Ariosto’s Orlando, 4 vols., 1782; Ardinghello und die glückseligen Inseln, 2 vols., Lemgo, 1787; Hildegard von Hohcnthal, 2 vols., Berlin, 1795; Anastasia und das Sehachsp>icl, 2 vols., Frankfort, 1803. A collection of his entire works was published at Leipsic in 1838 in 10 vols., and another edition in 1857 in 5 vols.
