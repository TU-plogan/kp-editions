HEMSTERHUIS, Tiberius (1685-1766), philologist and critic, was born on January 9, 1685, at Groningen in Holland. His father, a learned physician, recognizing the abilities of his son, gave him so good an early education that, when he entered the university of his native town in his fifteenth year, he speedily proved himself to be the best student of mathematics. After a year or two at Groningen, he was attracted to the university of Leyden by the fame of Perizonius; and while there he was entrusted with the flattering duty of arranging the manuscripts in the library. Though he accepted an appointment as professor of mathematics and philosophy at Amsterdam in his twentieth year, he had already directed his attention to the study of the ancient languages. In 1706 he completed the edition of Pollux’s Onomasticon begun by Lederlin; but the praise he received from his countrymen was more than counterbalanced by two letters of criticism from Bentley, which mortified him so keenly that for two months he refused to open a Greek book. In 1717 Hemsterhuis was appointed professor of Greek at Franeker, but he did not enter on his duties there till 1720. In 1738 he became professor of national history also. Two years afterwards ho was called to teach the same subjects at Leyden, where he died, April 7, 1766. Hemsterhuis deserves special note for reinstating the study of Greek in its honourable place among his fellow-countrymen, while he was also the founder of a laborious and useful Dutch school of criticism, of which Valckenaer, Lennep, and Ruhnken are the most famous disciples.

His chief writings are the following :— Luciaηi Colloquia et Timon, 1708; Aristophanis Plutus, 1744; Notae, <kc., ad Xenophontem Ephesium in the Miscellanea Critica of Amsterdam, vols, iii. and iv.; Observationes ad Chrysostomi Homilias; Orationes, 1784; a Latin translation of the Birds of Aristophanes, in Kuster’s edition; notes to Bernard’s Thomas Magister, to Alberti’s Hesy∙ chius, to Ernesti’s Callimachus, and to Bunnann’s Propertius. See Elogium T. Hemsterhusii (with Bentley’s letters) by Ruhnken, 1789; and Supplementa Annotationis ad Elogium T. Hemsterhusii, &c., Leyden, 1874.
