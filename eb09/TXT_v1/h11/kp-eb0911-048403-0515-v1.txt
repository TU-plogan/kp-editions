HAROLD I., surnamed Fairhaired (Harald Haarfager), the founder of the old royal dynasty of Norway, succeeded his father, Halfdan the Black, as jarl about the year 863. His ambition to become king is said to have been awakened by the refusal of Gyda, daughter of Eric of Hadaland, to marry him until he had made himself ruler of all Norway, as Gorm had of Denmark, and Eric of Sweden; and he vowed that he would never clip nor comb his hair until he had fully achieved his task. After he had subdued all the jarls, he sent for Gyda and made her one of his wives, and had his hair cut at a feast in More by Jarl Rögnwald, who then gave him the name of Haarfager. During the wars of Harold with the jarls many of the Norsemen left their country and settled in Iceland, the Faroe Islands, the Orkney and Shetland Islands, and even in the Hebrides of Scotland, from whence they returned and committed many sea robberies in Norway. Harold therefore fitted out a great expedition, conquered and slew the vikings, and made himself ruler over all these Norse settlements. During his absence on another expedition against Jarl Einar of Orkney his sons made war on one another, and also committed many acts of violence against his jarls. Accordingly on his return, finding it difficult to keep them in check, Harold resolved to give them separate provinces to govern, and about the year 893 called together a great “thing,” at which he conferred on each the title of king, with a seat higher than that of the jarls, he himself retaining the sovereignty of the whole country. He also made Eric Bloodyaxe his heir, and took him to live with Him; and about his eightieth year, when he found himself no longer able to discharge his kingly duties, he transferred the whole government to Eric and gave him the royal seat. Harold died three years afterwards about the year 933.
