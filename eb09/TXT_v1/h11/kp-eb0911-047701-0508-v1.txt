HARE, Julius Chakles (1795-1855), theological writer, was born at Valdagno, near Vicenza, in Italy, on the 13th of September 1795. He came to England with his parents in 1798, but in 1804-5 spent a winter with them at Weimar, where he met Goethe and Schiller, and received a bias to German literature which influenced his style and sentiments throughout his whole career. On the death of his mother in 1806, Julius was sent home to the Charterhouse in London, where he remained till 1812, when he entered Trinity College, Cambridge. There he became fellow in 1818, and after some time spent abroad he began to read law in London in the following year. In 1822 he was appointed assistant-tutor at Trinity College, which position he retained for ten years. Turning his attention from law to divinity, Hare took priest’s orders in 1826; and, on the death of his uncle in 1832, he succeeded to the rich family living of Hurstmonceaux in Sussex, where he accumulated a library of some 12,000 volumes, especially rich in German literature. Before taking up residence on his parish he once more went abroad, and made in Rome the acquaintance of the Chevalier Bunsen, who afterwards dedicated to him part of his work, Hippolytus and his Age. In 1840 Hare was appointed archdeacon of Lewes, and in the same year preached a course of sermons at Cambridge {The Victory of Faith), followed in 1846 by a second, The Mission of the Comforter. Neither series when published attained any great popularity. Archdeacon Hare married in 1844. In 1851 he was collated to a prebend in Chichester; and in 1853 he became one of the queen’s chaplains. He died January 23, 1855.

Julius Hare belonged to what has been called the “Broad Church party,” though some of his opinions approach very closely to those of the Evangelical Arminian school, while others again seem vague and undecided. He was one of the first of his countrymen to recognize and come under the influence of German thought and speculation, and, amidst an exaggerated alarm of German heresy, did much to vindicate the authority of the sounder German critics. His writings, which are chiefly theological and controversial, are largely formed of charges to his clergy, and sermons on different topics; but, though valuable and full of thought, they lose some of their force by the cumbrous German structure of the sentences, and by certain orthographical peculiarities in which the author indulged. In 1827 Guesses at Truth by Two Brothers ^[1. Julius Hare’s co-worker in this book was his brother Augustus William Hare (1792-1834), who, after a distinguished career at Oxford, was appointed rector of Alton Barnes, Wiltshire. He died prematurely at Rome in 1834. He was the author of Sermons to a Country Congregation, published in 1837.] appeared. Hare assisted Thirl wall, afterwards bishop of St David’s, in the translation of the 1st and 2d volumes of Niebuhr’s History of Rome (1828 and 1832), and published a Vindication of Niebuhr's History in 1829. He wrote many similar works, among which is a Vindication of Luther against his recent English Assailants, 1854. In 1848 he edited the Remains of John Sterling, who had formerly been his curate. Carlyle’s Life of John Sterling was written through dissatisfaction with the “Life” prefixed to Archdeacon Hare’s book. Memorials of a Quiet Life, published in 1872, contain accounts of the Hare family.
