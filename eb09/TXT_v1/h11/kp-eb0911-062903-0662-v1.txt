HELDER, or The Helder, a township of the Netherlands at the northern extremity of the province of North Holland, directly opposite the island of Texel. Since 1819 it has been the terminus of the North Holland Canal, and it is now connected (since 1865) by railway with Alkmaar and Haarlem. Its fortifications and its dykes are both constructed on an extensive scale, the former comprising four batteries and five forts, and the latter being the most striking on the whole coast. A garrison of 7000 to 9000 men 13 necessary for the defence of the place, and 30,000 men could be accommodated within the lines. The harbour, called the Nieuwe Diep, is one of the best in Europe. Its area is 6560 feet long by 330 to 490 broad, and it has depth enough for the largest vessels, which are admitted to the North Holland Canal by the Koopvaarders sluice. The Government arsenal comprises an extensive wet dock, a dry dock, and auxiliary establishments. Besides eight churches and a synagogue Helder possesses a palace for the board of marine, a royal institute for the education of naval cadets, a marine hospital, an orphan asylum, a town-house erected in 1836, and a meteorological observatory. The industries of the place are those usual in a flourishing seaport. Previous to 1819 the population was not much more than 2000, bat since then it has rapidly increased. In 1870 the suburbs of Willemsoord, Nieuwe Diep, Nieuwstad, and the Canal Road being included, the total amounted to 16,205. As a commune it numbered 18,366 in 1870 and 20,104 in 1874.

Helder was originally an offshoot of the now decayed town of Huιsduinen. The first church was built in 1624, and though the harbour became a favourite resort of the whale fishers, it was not till the construction of the Nieuwe Diep between 1770 and 1780, and its adoption in 1781 as a war harbour, that the prosperity of the place was secured. Under the Batavian republic the fortifications were extended and strengthened, and Napoleon still further improved them. In 1799 the English, under Abercromby, assisted by the Russians, drove out the French and secured the capitulation of the Dutch fleet in the Zuyder Zee.
