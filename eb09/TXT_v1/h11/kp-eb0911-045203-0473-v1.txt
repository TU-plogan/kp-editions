HANWAY, Jonas (1712-1786), an English traveller and philanthropist, was born at Portsmouth, but he was still a child when the death of his father, a victualler by trade, caused his mother to remove with her family to London. At the age of seventeen the boy was apprenticed to a merchant in Lisbon, and he remained there till he entered business for himself. In 1743, after he had been for some time again in London, he became a partner with Mr Dingley, a merchant in St Petersburg, and in this way had his attention turned to the trade between Russia and Persia. Leaving St Petersburg on the 10th of September 1743, and passing south by Moscow, Zuritzin, and Astrakhan, he embarked on the Caspian on November 22d, and arrived at Astrabad on December 18th. Here his difficulties began. The town was attacked and captured by a rebel, Mohammed Hassan Beg; his goods were seized, and it was only after great privations that he reached the camp of the Shah Nadir. Obtaining an order for the restoration of his goods he returned to Astrabad, and succeeded in recovering about 85 per cent, of their original value; but he was obliged to retrace his steps, and after a painful journey, during which he was attacked by pirates, detained by sickness, and obliged to perform six weeks’ quarantine, [9:11:453] he arrived at St Petersburg July 9, 1750 The autumn of that year he spent travelling in Germany and Holland, and on October 28th he landed in England, where the narrative of his travels published in 1753 soon made him a man of note. The rest of his life was for the most part spent in London, and his leisure was devoted to the advocacy and support of all kinds of useful and benevolent enterprises. In 1762 he was appointed one of the commissioners for victualling the navy, and on his resignation in 1783 he received the whole of his salary as a pension. He died September 5, 1786. Hanway was naturally a healthy and active man; in Russia he was known as the handsome Englishman; but the efforts of his travels in Persia rendered him somewhat of a valetudinarian. He is popularly known as the first Englishman to carry an umbrella in his native country; this he persisted in using in spite of all the efforts of the hackney coachmen to hoot or hustle him into conformity. He succeeded in writing down the custom of giving vails; and in his Journey from Portsmouth to Kingston he attacked the pernicious habit of tea-drinking, which, however, found an able and ardent defender in Dr Johnson. In 1757 he took an active part in founding the Marine Society, the object of which was to fit out poor boys and men for the navy; he was one of the originators of the Magdalen Hospital; it was due to his continued efforts that the Act of George III. was passed for the better treatment of the parish infants; and in 1785 he took up the lamentable case of those little chimney-sweeps whose dangerous occupation is now a thing of the past. The method of solitary confinement for prisoners found in him one of its earliest advocates, and in various other ways he sought to improve the chances of the criminal population. “Every man,” was his theory, “is capable of good if properly treated. If doing justice to an offender implies an attempt to reform him by using the proper means, by parity of reasoning the using of improper means is doing injustice.” Hanway’s writings are of little value except for the sake of the causes which they supported; while effective as pamphlets, they lack both style and method, and are apt to run over into platitudinous moralizings. See Pugh, Remarkable Occurrences in the Life of Jonas Hanway, 1787.
