HETTSTADT, or Hettstedt, a town of Prussian Saxony, in the circle of Mansfeld, and the government district of Merseburg, is situated on both banks of the Wipper, about 23 miles N.W. of Halle. It is the seat of a commission of justice, and has manufactures of machinery, pianofortes, and artificial manure. The population in 1875 was 5988. In the neighbourhood are mines of argentiferous copper, and the surrounding district and villages are occupied with smelting and similar works. Silver and sulphuric acid are the other chief products; nickel and gold are also found in small quantities. Hettstadt is mentioned as early as 1046; in 1220 it possessed a castle; and in 1380 it received the privileges of a town. When the countship of Mansfeld was sequestrated, Hettstädt came into the possession of the Saxons, from whom it passed to the Prussians in 1815.
