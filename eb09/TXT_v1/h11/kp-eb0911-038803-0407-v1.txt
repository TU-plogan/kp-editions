HALL, Basil (1788-1844), British traveller and miscellaneous writer, was born at Edinburgh, December 31, 1788. His father, Sir James Hall of Dunglass, was author of an essay on Gothic Architecture, and contributed to the Royal Society of Edinburgh, of which he for a time was president, several ingenious papers on geology, in support of Hutton’s theory as against that of Werner. His mother was Helen, daughter of Dunbar, fourth earl of Selkirk. Basil Hall was educated at the High School of Edinburgh, and in 1802 entered the navy, where he rose to the rank of post-captain in 1817. By observing the ethnological as well as the physical peculiarities of the countries he visited, he collected the materials for a very large number of scientific papers, which he contributed to various journals and encyclopaedias. In 1816 he commanded the sloop “Lyra,” which accompanied Lord Amherst’s embassy to China; and in this vessel he performed the cruise which he describes in the most popular and perhaps the most interesting of his works— An Account of a Voyage of Discovery to the West Coast of Corea and the Great Loo-choo Island in the Japan Sea (London, 1818). In 1820 he held a command on the Pacific coast of America, and in 1824 published two volumes of Extracts from a Journal written on the Coasts of Chili, Peru, and Mexico in the years 1820-21-22. Retiring on half-pay in 1824, Hall in 1825 married a daughter of Sir John Hunter, and in her company travelled (1827-28) through the United States. In 1829 he published his Travels in North America in the years 1827 and 1828, a book almost as popular as his first, less from its intrinsic merit than from the violence with which it was assailed by the American press for its views of American society. Schloss Hainfeld, or a Winter in Lower Styria (1836), is partly a romance, partly a description of a visit paid by the author to the castle of the Countess Purgstall. Spain and the Seat of War in Spain appeared in 1837. The Fragments of Voyages and Travels (9 vols.) were issued in three detachments between 1831 and 1840. Captain Hall was a fellow of the Royal Societies of London and Edinburgh, and a member of the Astronomical Society of London, and has left a number of scientific and miscellaneous writings besides those mentioned. His last work, a collection of sketches and tales under the name of Patchwork (1841), had not been long published before its author was seized with insanity, from which he was only released by his death, in Haslar Hospital, Portsmouth, September 11, 1844.
