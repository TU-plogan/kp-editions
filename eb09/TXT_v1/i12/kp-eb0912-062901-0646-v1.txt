ICHNEUMON (Herpestes'), a genus of small carnivorous mammals belonging to the family Viverridoe, and resembling the true civets in the elongated weasel-like form of the body and iu the shortness of the limbs. There are, according to Gray (British Museum Catalogue, 1869), 22 species of ichneumons, the great majority of which are confined to the African continent, the remainder occurring in Persia, India, and the Malay archipelago, and one, the Andalusian ichneumon (H. Widdringtonii, Gray), in the Sierra Morena of Spain, the last probably an African straggler. The Egyptian and Indian ichneumons are the forms best known. The former (Herpestes ichneumon, L.) is an inhabitant of Egypt and the north of Africa, where it is known to foreign residents as “Pharaoh’s rat.” When full grown it is about the size of the domestic cat. It is covered with a fur of long harsh hairs of a tawny grey colour, darker on the head and along the middle of the back, its legs reddish and its feet and tail black. It feeds on rats and mice, birds and reptiles, and for this reason is occasionally domesticated. Its fondness for eggs leads it to search for those of the crocodile, buried as these usually are beneath a thin covering of sand on the river banks; and its services in thus checking the multiplication of those reptiles were so appreciated bythe ancient Egyptians that they regarded the ichneumon as a sacred animal, and when it died buried it, says Herodotus, “in holy repositories.” It is, however, equally fond of poultry and their eggs, and its depredations among fowls considerably detract from its undoubted merits as a vermin-killer. During the inundations of the.Nile it is said to approach the habitations of man, but at other seasons it keeps to the fields and to the banks of the crocodile-frequented river. The Indian ichneumon or mungoos (Heτpestes griseus, Desm.) is considerably smaller than the Egyptian form; its fur is of a pale grey colour, the hairs being largely white-ringed, while the cheeks and throat are more or less reddish. Like the preceding species, it is frequently domesticated, and is then put to a similar use. It is especially serviceable in India as a serpent killer, destroying not only the eggs and young of these creatures, but attacking without hesitation and killing the most venomous adult snakes. The fact that it invariably survives those encounters has led to the belief that it either enjoys immunity from the effects of snake poison, or that after being bitten it has recourse, as the Hindoos have always maintained, to the root of a plant as an antidote. Neither of these suppositions has stood the test of scientific examination, for it has been found that when actually bitten it falls a victim to the poison as rapidly as other mammals, while there is no trustworthy evidence of its seeking a vegetable antidote. The truth seems to be that the mungoos by its exceeding agility and quickness of eye avoids the fangs of the snake while fixing its own teeth in the back of the reptile’s neck. The whole Thanatophidia of India stand in awe of this tiny but tenacious mammal, and seek to escape from its presence. The mungoos, on the other hand, never hesitates to attack; the moment he sees his enemy, “his whole nature,” says a recent spectator of one of those fights, “appears to be changed. His fur stands on end, and he presents the incarnation of intense rage. The snake invariably attempts to escape, but, finding it impossible to evade the rapid onslaught of the mungoos, he raises his crest and lashes out fiercely at his little persecutor, who seems to delight in dodging out of the way just in time. This goes on until the mungoos sees his opportunity, when like lightning he rushes in and seizes the snake with his teeth by the back of the neck close to the head, shaking him as a terrier does a rat. These tactics are repeated until the snake is killed.” The mungoos is equally dexterous in killing rats and other four-footed vermin.
