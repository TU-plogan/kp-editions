ILLE-ET-VILAINE, a maritime department of France, formed out of part of the old province of Brittany, is situated on the north-west coast, between 47° 38' and 48° 37' N. lat. and l 0 and 2° 14' W. long. It is bounded on the N. by the sea and the department of Manche, on the E. by Mayenne, on the S. by Loire-Inférieure, and on the W. by Morbihan and Côtes-du-Nord. It takes its name from its two principal rivers, the Hie and the Vilaine. The former joins the Vilaine at Rennes after a course of 18 miles through the department, and the latter, which rises in Mayenne, flows past the towns of Vitré, Rennes, and Redon. The stream is tidal up to the port of Redon, and is navigable for barges as far as Rennes. The Vilaine receives the Men and the Seiche, which are both navigable. There are two other navigable streams, the Airon and the Rance. The Hle-et-Rance canal connects the town of Rennes with those of Dinan and St Malo. The department forms one vast plateau, broken by ranges of low hills, which decline on the one side to the English Channel and on the other to the Bay of Biscay. The sea-coast line is partly rocky and partly marshy, the marshy portions being in many places defended against the encroachments of the sea by artificial dams. There are also morasses in many parts of the interior, with a number of stagnant lakes, a circumstance which renders the atmosphere very humid. The sky is seldom bright, for the south-west winds, while they keep the temperature mild, also bring frequent showers, and in spring and autumn thick fogs prevail. The soil is thin and not very fertile, but lately has been improved by the use of artificial manure. The only truly fruitful portion is that round Doi. About two-thirds of the soil is under culture, one-ninth in meadows, one-fifteenth in wood, and one-sixth waste. Cereals of all kinds are grown, but the principal are wheat, rye, and barley. Potatoes, flour, and hemp are also largely grown, and tobacco is cultivated to some extent. Apples and pears are the principal fruit, and the cider of the canton of Doi has a high reputation. The vine is cultivated in the southern districts. Cheese, said to equal Gruyère, is made in considerable quantities, and the butter of Rennes has a reputation equal to that of the best in France. Large numbers of horses and cattle are raised. The horses belong to the small hardy Breton breed, and are much in demand as post and artillery horses. Notwithstanding the extent of heath land very few sheep are kept. The principal manufactures are leather, sea-salt, glass, paper, and linen. Iron ore is obtained in considerable quantities, and there are also lead and zinc mines, as well as slate quarries. The population is of Celtic origin, and the dialect is a mixture of Celtic and French. Ille-et-Vilaine is divided into the arrondissements of Fougères, St Malo, Montfort, Redon, Rennes, and Vitré, with 43 cantons and 350 communes. The chief town is Rennes, and the principal seaport St Malo. The department has an area of 2597 square miles. The population in 1872 was 589,532, and in 1876 it had reached 602,712.
