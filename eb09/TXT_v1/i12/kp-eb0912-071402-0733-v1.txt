IMBROS, or Imvro, an island in the Aegean Sea, lying west of the southern end of the Thracian Chersonese, [9:12:715] about 14 miles from the mouth of the Dardanelles. To the north-west, at a distance of 17 miles, lies the island of Samothraki; and about the same distance to the southeast is Lemnos. The area of Imbros is estimated at 105 square miles, and its population, which is mainly of Greek origin, is about 10,000. With its bare mountain ridges and sides it has no small similarity to Attica. Hagios Ilias, or St Elias, is the highest summit, 1859 feet above the sea-level. According to Franz von Loher about a third of the island could be turned into a very garden by an industrious and skilful race; but at present not more than one-tenth is under cultivation. Wheat, barley, and oats are grown, as well as a dye-plant locally called bouia. A German company is working lignite in the island. The only stream of importance has surrendered its ancient name of Ilissus for the simple appellation of p,eγdλos ποταμός or Big River. The valley through which it flows is the only considerable tract of arable land in the island, and contains the four villages of Theodoro, Kastro, Gliki, and Panagia. Kastro, which lies on the coast, is the site of the ancient town which bore the same name with the island; but the only remains of antiquity are part of the mole, portions of the town-wall, and a number of tombstones. A hill above the town presents with its summit so great a likeness to a mediaeval castle that it has frequently been described as such. The archaeological investigations of Conze have brought to light a few inscriptions of secondary interest, which mainly serve to confirm the Attic character of Imbrian civilization. Attic and Trojan coins are not unfrequent; and traces are found of the worship of the Cabiri, Cybele, and Zeus Hypsiotes. Imbros plays no great part in history; though the name occurs as early as the Iliad and the Homeric Hymns. Herodotus mentions its subjugation to the Persians by Otanes. In later times it was distinctly recognized as an Athenian colony. The numerous watch-towers and diminutive strongholds observed throughout the island would indicate that it had its share in the busy warlike existence of the Middle Ages. Along with Samothraki, Lemnos, and Hagiostrati, Imbros belongs administratively to the Vilayet of the Islands, or Jesair bahr i Safid of Asiatic Turkey. It is the seat of a metropolitan of the Greek Church, with the title of exarch of the Aegean.
