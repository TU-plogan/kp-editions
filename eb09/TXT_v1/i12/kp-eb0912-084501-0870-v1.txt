INDORE, or the Territories of the Mahârâjâ of Holkar, is one of the principal native states in India, under the Central India Agency. The name of the state is taken from that of the capital Indore, 22° 42' N. lat., 75° 54' E. long. The territory consists of many isolated tracts; but since 1861 arrangements have been made to concentrate the state as much as possible, and lands which were formerly held by Holkar in Ahmednagar district and in the Deccan have been exchanged for districts and pärgands bordering on the Nerbudda (Narbadâ) river and the tract in which Indore town is situated. The area of the whole of Holkar’s territories is estimated at 8075 square miles. Of these districts, those situated to the north are drained by the river Chambal and its feeders, those to the south by the Nerbudda. The tracts are fertile, producing in abundance excellent wheat and other grains, pulse, sugar-cane, cotton, and opium. The poppy is so generally cultivated that, when in bloom, it gives the country the appearance of a vast garden. Tobacco is also grown to a great extent, and is of admirable quality.

The great Vindhyâ range traverses the southern division of Holkar’s dominions, in a direction from east to west, a small portion of the territory lying to the north of the mountains, but by much the larger part to the south. The latter is a portion of the valley of the Nerbudda, and is bounded on the south by the Sâtpura mountains. Basalt and other volcanic formations predominate in both ranges, although there is also much sandstone. The Nerbudda traverses Indore from east to west; and the valley at Mandlesar, in the central part of the district, is between 600 and 700 feet above the sea. The general appearance of the country is that of an undulating valley intersected by low rocky ranges, in some parts thickly clothed with stunted jungle, which also covers considerable tracts in the plains. The forests of the state form two belts, the southern and the northern. The former, which is considered unhealthy, borders on the Sâtpura range, and the latter, a healthy tract, on the Vindhyâ hills. From its inter-tropical position, the climate of Indore is sultry, the thermometer ranging from 60° to 90 υ Fahr, in the house. For some months from the close of the periodical rains, malaria is so deadly in the jungles that no European ventures into them.

Besides the rùling tribe of Marhattâs, the population comprises many other classes of Hindus, a few Mahometans, and a considerable number of Gonds and Bhils. The ÀTndhyâ and Sâtpura ranges are peculiarly the country of the Bhils, who are considered to have been the earliest occupiers of the soil. This race is one of the wildest in India, its people living for the most part on vegetables and game, or on the plunder of their more civilized neighbours. They have, however, of late years been brought into more peaceful habits of life. The population of Holkar’s territories was estimated in 1875 at 635,450. The revenue in 1875-76 amounted to £459,800, and the disbursements to <£405,100. The number of schools in 1876 was 77, attended by 3235 pupils, costing the state £3000. The principal educational establishment is the Râjkumâr college, for the education of the sons of the chiefs and nobles of Central India. The institution is maintained by the British Government, and is located within the grounds assigned for the purposes of the “Residency.” The governor-general’s agent for Central India has his headquarters at Indore town. A branch line from the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, known as the Holkar State Railway, runs from Khandwa junction to Indore, The principal engineering works are the ascent of the Vindhyâ range and the bridge over the Nerbudda river. From Indore the line is taken up by the Neemuch Railway through part of Sindhia’s dominions, connecting Indore with Nasirâbâd, and finally with Delhi and Agra, The chief means of communication are the Bombay and Agra Trunk Road, which runs through Indore, with branches at Mhow and Dhar, &c.; another road, 80 miles in length, joins Indore with Khandwa, crossing the Nerbudda by ferry.

There are cotton mills at work in the state, which have proved a regular source of income, as they turn out cloth for which there is a ready market. In 1878 the number of spindles was 10,000. Indore city contains a charitable and leper’s hospital, and a dispensary. Cholera frequently prevails.

History. — The founder of this dynasty was Malhar Râo, the son of a shepherd, who lived in the village of Hol, in the Deccan, whence he derived the surname of Holkar, the adjunct “kae,” “kar,” or “kur” signifying inhabitant. Disdaining his father’s occupation, he enlisted in a trooj of horse; his rise was rapid, and he eventually became one of the most distinguished leaders in the first Marhattâ in vasion of northern India, and obtained many possessions north of the Nerbudda and about Indore by grant fron the peshwâ. At his death he was succeeded by his grand son Malli Râo, who died shortly after his accession. Alii Bâi, the mother of Malli Râo, then took the management of affairs, and appointed as commander of her army Malhaι Tùkaji Holkar, a chief of the same tribe as, but in no waj related to, Malhar Râo. Alia Bâi died in 1795, and was not long survived by Tùkaji Râo, after whose death the power of the house of Holkar was nearly extinguished b} family quarrels and the dissensions which distracted tht Marhatta confederacy at the close of the last century. The fortunes of the family were, however, restored b) Jeswant Râo, an illegitimate son of Tùkaji Holkar, who. after a signal reverse from the army of Sindhia, employed European officers to introduce their discipline into his army, and in 1802 defeated the united forces of Sindhia and the peshwa at the battle of Poona. Twice Holkar attacked British territory, but was totally routed, and finally was forced to sign a treaty on the banks of the Biâs, by which he was stripped of many of his conquests. He died insane in 1811, and was succeeded by his son Malhar Râo, during whose minority the state was torn by the most violent dissensions, and overrun by Pindâris. The army mutinied, and British intervention became necessary to restore the government Malhar Râo dying in 1833 without issue, his wife and mother adopted Martaud Râo Holkar as his successor. He was summarily deposed by Hari Râo, a cousin of Malhar Râo, whose accession was welcomed by the troops. His rule was a tissue of intrigue and disorder. He died in 1843, and his adopted son, who succeeded him, died in a few months, leaving no heir. The succession was declared to rest with [9:12:846] the British Government, and Tùkaji Râo (the present mahârâjâ), at that time eleven years old, was selected and placed on the gadi. Holkar maintains a military establishment of 3100 regular and 2150 irregular infantry, 2100 regular and 1200 irregular cavalry, and 340 artillerymen, with 24 field guns equipped.
