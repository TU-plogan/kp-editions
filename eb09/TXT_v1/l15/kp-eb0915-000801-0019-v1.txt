LOT, the ancestor of Moab and Ammon, was the son of Haran and grandson of Terah, and accompanied his uncle Abraham in his migration from Haran to Canaan. At Bethel^[1. In Gen. xii. 10 sq., where Abraham’s visit to Egypt is recorded, there is no mention of Lot, and Wellhausen {Jαhrb. f. Ώ. Theol., 1876, p. 413) has made it probable that this episode is no part of the Jahvistic narrative, to which the history of Lot mainly belongs.] Lot separated from Abraham, and, while the uncle went on to Hebron, the nephew settled in the district of Sodom. When Jehovah was about to destroy Sodom and the other cities of the plain two divine messengers appeared, spent the night in Lot’s house, and next morning led Lot, his wife, and his two unmarried daughters out of the city. His wife looked back and was changed to a pillar of salt,^[2. Such a pillar in the neighbourhood of Usdum is described by Lynch, Narrative, p. 307. See also Robinson, Bib. Res., 2d ed., ii. 108.] but Lot with his two daughters escaped first to Zoar and then to the mountains east of the Dead Sea, where the daughters, supposing themselves the only survivors of the catastrophe that had destroyed their home, planned and executed an incest by which they became mothers. The sons were the ancestors of Ammon and Moab. Such is the outline of the Jahvistic history of Lot, which the priestly narrator epitomizes in a few words, the only statement peculiar to his narrative being that in Gen. xi. 27-32. The account of Chedorlaomer’s invasion and of Lot’s rescue by Abraham belongs to an independent source, the age and historical value of which has been much disputed. See on the one hand Ewald, Geschichte, vol. i., and Tuch in his Genesis, and in an essay originally published in Z.D.MH., vol. i., and reprinted in the second edition of his Genesis, and on the other hand the essay in Nöldeke, Untersuchungen, and Wellhausen, ut supra, p. 414.

The name Lot (tD⅛) signifies “a veil,” which has led Goldzieher, Mythologie, p. 216 sq., to the arbitrary hypothesis that the story of Lot and his daughters is a myth about the night. Lot and his daughters passed into Arabic tradition from the Jews. The daughters are named Zahy and Ra'wa by Mas'ûdy, ii. 139; but other Arabian writers give other forms.
