LUND, a town of Sweden, in the län of Malmöhus, lies at a distance of 10 miles by rail north-east from Malmö. It is chiefly remarkable for its university, the second in Sweden, founded by Charles XI. in 1666, with faculties of philosophy, law, medicine, and theology; the number of students ranges from 500 to 600. The library contains about 100,000 volumes and 2000 MSS., and there are valuable collections in archaeology and natural history. Among the more distinguished of its professors may be mentioned the names of Puffendorf and the poet Tegner. Linnaeus was one of its alumni. The cathedral, a Byzantine structure, dedicated to St Lawrence, and said to be on the whole the finest church in Scandinavia, was founded about the middle of the 11th century, and consecrated in 1145. The crypt under the transept and choir is one of the largest in the world. The town has little else of interest to show. The statue of Tegner stands in the Tegner’s Plats, and the house in which he lived from 1813 to 1826 is indicated by a stone slab with an inscription. The manufactures of Lund (woollen cloth, leather, tobacco, sugar, &c.) are unimportant. The population in December 1878 was 13,611.

Lund (Lοηdiηum Gothorum), the “Lunda at Eyrarsundi” of the Egil’s Sαgα, was in EgiΓs*time (about 920 A.D.)a place of considerable importance; one gathers that, if not actually a seaport, it was at least nearer the Sound then than at present. In the middle of the 11th century it was made a bishopric, and in 1103 it was advanced to the dignity of an archiépiscopal see, the archbishop receiving primatial rank over all Scandinavia in 1163. The archbishop of IJpsala is now primate of Sweden, Lund since 1536 having been reduced to the rank of an ordinary bishopric, and lost its quondam title of “Metropolis Daniae.”
