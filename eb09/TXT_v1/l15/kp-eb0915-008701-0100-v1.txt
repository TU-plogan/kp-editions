LUXEMBURG, a grand-duchy of Europe, governed under a special constitution by the king of the Netherlands, is bounded on the N. and E. by Rhenish Prussia, S. by Lorraine and the French department Meurthe-et-Moselle, and W. by Belgian Luxemburg. It measures 32 miles from Hartelingen to Rosport, both on the Sure, and 50 miles from Rumelange in the south to Weiler in the north. The surface contains 639,000 acres (998 square miles), of which 293,554 acres are arable, 61,033 meadowland, 143,812 woodland, 54,135 coppice, and 540 vineyards. The hills in the south of the duchy are a continuation of the Lorraine plateau; and the northern districts are crossed in all directions by outrunners from the Ardennes. With the exception of the Chiers, which flows into the Meuse near Sedan after a course of 50 miles, the streams all drain into the Moselle, which forms the boundary between Luxemburg and the Rhine province for about 20 miles. The Sure or Sauer, the most important stream in the duchy, rises at Vaux-les-Rosières in Belgian Luxemburg, crosses the duchy, and forms the eastern boundary from the confluence of the Our till it joins the Moselle after a course of 50 miles, during which it receives the Wiltz, the Woltz, the Alzet, &c. At Mondorf there are mineral wells and a bathing establishment. The soil of Luxemburg is generally good; the southern districts are on the whole the most fertile as well as the most populous. Building materials of all sorts are obtained throughout the duchy, and in the south there is iron-ore of fair quality— the mining area at present occupying from 8000 to 10,000 acres. Galena is worked on the frontier between Ober-wampach and Longville, and antimony at Gösdorf near Wiltz. Since 1842 Luxemburg has been included in the Zollverein, and its principal dealings are, consequently, with Germany. Besides the iron furnaces,—situated all of them in the south near the Lorraine plateau,—the industrial establishments of the country comprise a large number of tanneries, a dozen weaving factories, an important glove-making factory, a pottery, paper-mills for all sorts of paper, breweries and distilleries, and two sugar refineries. A German patois mixed with French words is spoken throughout the country; ’but French, which is universally employed by the commercial community, is also the common speech of all classes on the French and Belgian frontiers. Though perfect liberty of worship prevails, Roman Catholicism is almost the sole form of religion in the duchy, the only dissenters worthy of note being the Protestant Prussian employés and about three hundred Jewish families. The government is in the hands of the grand-duke, who sanctions and promulgates the laws. Between 1850 and 1879 the king of the Netherlands was represented in his grand-ducal functions by his brother Prince Henry; but since the prince’s death he has resumed the personal direction of affairs. The grand-duchy is a neutral and independent state, and its crown hereditary in the Nassau family (Treaty of London, March 11, 1867). A house of representatives and a council of state, named by the grand-duke, compose the administrative body. The representatives, to the number of forty-four, are chosen by the people in the proportion of one for from 4000 to 5500 inhabitants. No law can be passed without the consent of the house of representatives. Bills are introduced by the grand-duke, but the house has also the right of initiative. A single battalion (150) of Luxemburg chasseurs composes the grand-ducal army,—all voluntary recruits. The gendarmerie also consists of about 150 men. There are two courts of first instance in the duchy,—one at Luxemburg, the other at Diekirch,—and a high court and a court of appeal, both at Luxemburg. Criminals appear before the court of assize at Luxemburg. By grand-ducal decree the order of the Crown of Oak was instituted for the duchy, December 29, 1841, and that of the Golden Lion, February 5, 1858. The communal councils are under the supervision of the district commissioners, who are subject in turn to the minister of the interior. The administration of the town of Luxemburg depends immediately on the Government. Education is in a flourishing state: there are 642 primary schools attended by 31,000 pupils; Luxemburg has a normal school and an athenaeum; Diekirch and Echternach have each a gymnasium. The bishopric of Luxemburg, containing 13 diaconates, subdivided into 253 parishes, holds its authority directly from the Holy See. From 6,000,000 to 7,000,000 francs is the annual amount of the state budget, and the public debt was 12,000,000 francs in 1863. Since 1854 there has been a grand-ducal bronze coinage.

The following table shows the administrative divisions and the population (total, 205,158) according to the census of 1875.

Next to the capital come Echternach with 3920, and Diekirch with 3130 inhabitants,—both worthy of note for their blast furnaces. At Echternach an annual procession is held in honour of St Willibrord, dating from 1374. Grevenmacher is the centre of a great wine district.

The Luxemburg territory as well as the country of Ardenne was included in Belgica Prima at the first division of Gaul by Angustus in 27 B.c.; during the Frankish period it formed part first of Austrasia, then of Lorraine, and then of Lower Lorraine. On the dismemberment of ancient Austrasia the countship of Ardenne fell to Ricuin; and, when after Ricuin’s death his children divided his possessions, Ardenne .proper was obtained by Count Sigfried (Sigefroi). The county of Luxemburg, as Ardenne came to be called after the chief town, was raised to be a duchy in 1354, and existed as an independent state till 1451, when it was seized by Philip, duke of Burgundy. The dynasty which he displaced had been ambitious and active, and had, in the person of Henry VII., attained the imperial dignity, and in that of John ascended the •throne of Bohemia. As a Burgundian possession Luxemburg [9:15:88] came to the house of Austria, and, after forming part of the archduchy governed by Albert and Isabella, 1598-1632, followed the fate of the Spanish Netherlands till it was ceded by the treaty of Utrecht to the house of Hapsburg, It was deprived of Thionville, Moutmedy, Damvilliers, I voix, and Marville by the treaty of the Pyrenees (1659) in favour of France; and Louis XIV. occupied the town and great part of the province from 1684 till the treaty of Ryswick (1697). Seized by the French in 1793, it went in the main to form the department of Forêts. On the 16th March 1815 William I. declared himself king of the Netherlands and duke of Luxemburg, and his claims were sanctioned by the treaty of Vienna,—Luxemburg being considered compensation for the loss of the small principalities of Hadamar, Siegen, Dietz, and Nassau-Dillemburg, the surrender of which to Prussia had deprived William of his place in the Germanic confederation. The fortress was assigned, to the confederation itself, and was garrisoned by six' thousand men, of whom one-fourth belonged to the grand-duke and three-fourths to the confederation. From the recognition of Belgian independence in 1830 to the treaty of London in 1839, matters were still more complicated; there were two governments in Luxemburg—one at Luxemburg, acting for the grand-duke, and the other at Arion, acting for Belgium. By the treaty of London about 1218 square miles of the duchy with 149,571 inhabitants were transferred to Belgium, the German confederation and King William being compensated with parts of Limburg. On the dissolution of the confederation the duchy became free from its connexion with Germany, but the fortress remained in the hands of Prussia. A diplomatic contest for possession of the duchy took place between France and Prussia; and the matter became the object of a special conference of the plenipotentiaries of the great powers, Holland, Belgium, and Italy, in 1867. The result was that the neutrality of Luxemburg was guaranteed and the military importance of the town destroyed. The actual demolition of the fortifications evacuated by the Prussians in September 1867 did not take place till 1872.

Luxemburg, the capital of the grand-duchy, lies 34 miles north of Metz and 25 south-west of Treves, in a position as remarkable for natural beauty as fot military strength. The main part of the town is built on a rocky table-land terminating precipitously towards the north-east and south; the modern portions, known as Pfaffenthal, Clausen, and Grund, lie 200 feet below, in the valley of the Alzetle. Till their demolition in terms of the treaty of 1867 the fortifications, on which the engineers of three centuries had expended their skill, were the great feature of the place; in point of strength they ranked, according to Carnot, second only to those of Gibraltar, and like them they were to a great extent hewn out of the solid rock. The site is now occupied partly by a fine public park, partly by new districts of handsome houses, which give the city more of the outward appearance of a capitaL Among the buildings of historical interest are the cathedral of Notre Dame, erected by the Jesuits in 1613;' the church of St Michel, dating from 1320; the Government-house, built in 1443, and still regularly occupied by the legislative assemblies; the town-house, built in 1830; the law courts, dating from 1565, but serving till 1795 as the residence of the governor of Luxemburg; and the athenaeum, built in 1594, and now (1882) attended by 500 to 600 pupils. The population of the city and suburbs, which was 15,930 in 1875, is now estimated at 19,000.

Luxemburg (formerly called Liitzelburg) appears in 738 as ae castle presented to the abbey at Treves by Charles Martel. Thetown grew up in the course of the 10th century, and soon began to surround itself with walls; but it was not till 1503 that a regular system of fortifications was commenced, and the principal features· of the modem fortress were due to Vauban, who accompanied Créqui in his capture of the place in 1664. Extensive additions were made to the works in 1728-34.
