LOTHAIR the Saxon, German king and Roman emperor, was originally count of Suplinburg. In 1106 he was made duke of Saxony by the emperor Henry V., against whom he afterwards repeatedly rebelled. After the death of Henry V. in 1125, the party which supported imperial in opposition to papal claims wished to grant the crown to Duke Frederick of Swabia, grandson of Henry IV. The papal party, however, headed by Archbishop Adalbert of Mainz, managed to secure the election of Lothair, who obtained their favour by making large concessions by which he was afterwards seriously hampered. In 1133 he was crowned emperor in Rome by Innocent II., whom he had supported in a disputed papal election. In later times the church pretended that he had done homage to the pope for the empire, but what he really received in fief was the hereditary territory of the Countess Matilda. Meanwhile he had been engaged in bitter strife with the Hohenstaufen family, from whom he had demanded the allodial lands which they had inherited from the emperor Henry V. Duke Frederick of Swabia, and his brother Conrad, had resisted these pretensions; and Conrad had even been crowned king in Milan. The quarrel was ultimately settled by the lands in dispute being granted in fief to the house of Hohenstaufen. In order to strengthen his position, Lothair had given his daughter Gertrude (a child of eleven) in marriage to Henry the Proud, duke of Bavaria, whom he made also duke of Saxony. Henry was further enriched by receiving the hereditary and imperial territories of the Countess Matilda, so that the Guelphs became by far the most powerful family in the empire. Lothair secured other important adherents by giving North Saxony (afterwards Brandenburg) to Albert the Bear, and Thuringia (which he took from Landgrave Hermann) to Count Louis. In his relations to the neighbouring populations Lothair acted with great vigour. The duke of Bohemia and the duke of Poland were compelled to do homage, and the margraviate of Meissen and the county of Burgundy he gave to two of his supporters, the former to Count Conrad of Wettin, the latter to Duke Conrad of Zähringen. The kingdom of the Abotrites he granted to the Danish king Cnut; and Cnut’s successor Magnus was forced to accept it as a fief of the empire. In 1136 Lothair undertook a second expedition to Italy for the defence of Pope Innocent II. against Roger of Sicily, and after accomplishing his object he died on the 3d of December 1137, in an Alpine hut near Trent, on his way back to Germany. During his reign the papacy gained ground in its rivalry with the empire, but he displayed courage and resource in maintaining the rights of the crown against all his secular opponents.
