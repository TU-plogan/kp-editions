LUSATIA (German, Lausitz) is a common name applied to two neighbouring districts in Germany, Lusatia Superior and Lusatia Inferior (Oberlausitz and Niederlausitz), belonging in part to Prussia and in part to Saxony. The country now known as Upper Lusatia was occupied in the 7th century by the Milcieni, a Slavonic tribe. In the 10th century it was annexed to the German kingdom by the margraves of Meissen, and from this time for several centuries it was called Budissin (Bautzen), from the name of the principal fortress. In the 11th and 12th centuries Budissin changed hands several times, being connected at different periods with Meissen, Poland, and Bohemia. The emperor Frederick I. granted it in 1158 to King Ladislaus of Bohemia, and under him and his immediate successors it was largely colonized by German immigrants. Between 1253 and 1319 it belonged to Brandenburg, to the margrave of which it was given in pledge by Ring Ottocar II. of Bohemia; and in 1268 it was divided into an eastern and a western part—Budissin proper and Görlitz. In 1319 Budissin proper was restored to Bohemia, which also recovered Görlitz in 1346. It was during this period that the fortunes of Budissin were associated with those of the country afterwards called Lower Lusatia, but originally Lusatia. It was inhabited by a Slavonic tribe, the Lusici, and reached in the earliest times from the Black Elster to the Spree. The Lusici were conquered by Margrave Gero in 963, and their land was soon formed into a separate march, sometimes attached to, sometimes independent of, the march of Meissen. In 1303 it passed, as Budissin had done, to Brandenburg, and in 1373, after several changes, it fell into the hands of the emperor Charles IV. as king of Bohemia. During the Hussite wars the people of Lusatia and Budissin remained loyal to the Roman Catholic Church, and in 1467 they recognized as their sovereign King Matthias of Hungary. Twenty-three years later they were again united to Bohemia, but in the meantime they had received from the Hungarian Government the names which they have since retained. In the 16th century the Reformation made way rapidly in Lipper Lusatia, and the majority of the people became Protestants. The two countries were «conquered in 1620, with the sanction of Ferdinand II,, by the Saxon elector, John George I., to whom they were ceded in 1635, the emperor as king of Bohemia retaining a certain supremacy for the purpose of guarding the rights and privileges of the Roman Catholic Church. In 1815 the whole of Lower Lusatia and the half of Upper Lusatia were transferred from Saxony to Prussia. Lower Lusatia has 395,800 inhabitants, of whom 50,000 are Wends; the portion of Upper Lusatia belonging to Prussia has 243,500 inhabitants,of whom 32,000 are Wends. There are 300,000 inhabitants, including 50,000 Wends, in Saxon Upper Lusatia. Laws relating to Upper Lusatia, which are passed by the Saxon Parliament, must still be .submitted to the Lusatian diet at Bautzen.
