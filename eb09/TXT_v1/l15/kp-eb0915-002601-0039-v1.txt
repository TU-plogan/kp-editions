LOUVAIN, a town of Belgium in the province of Brabant, 18 miles east of Brussels, on the Liège and Cologne Railway, and on the river Dyle. The population in 1880 was 34,700. Louvain possesses some fine specimens of Gothic art,—the town-hall, which displays a wealth of decorative architecture almost unequalled on the Continent, and the collegiate church of St Pierre, with some fine sculptures and panels by Quentin Matsys. The general aspect of the town to the casual observer is dull and cheerless; the newer portions, extending between the town-hall and station, consist of broad streets of monotonous regularity, while the old mediaeval quarter, despite its historic interest, is somewhat dingy and lifeless. Louvain has a market for corn and cattle as well as for cloth wares; wood carving is also carried on; but the chief industry of the locality is brewing, the Louvain beer, a lemon-coloured frothy beverage, being held in high repute in the country. Tn the world of science Louvain holds honourable rank, having a celebrated university, an academy of painting, a school of music, extensive bibliographic collections, a museum of natural history, and a botanical garden. The university, a stronghold of the Roman Catholic faith, was first instituted in 1425, and soon grew famous among the learned of all nations. In the 15th and 16th centuries not less than six thousand students flocked thither yearly, and it became the nursery of many illustrious men. Swept away for a time by the first French Revolution, it was reestablished in 1835; and, though less conspicuous than in bygone ages, and more generally confined to the instruction of the youth of Belgium, it is yet of considerable importance in the country as the only Catholic university, and one of the main supports of the Conservative party.

Like Bruges and many other Flemish towns, Louvain was at one time a great and flourishing city, with a population of 200,000 souls, and one of the principal markets of the Continent. The turbulent spirit of the people, their frequent outbreaks against their rulers, and in particular the massacre of the patricians in 1378, were the chief causes of its decline. Duke Wenceslaus of Brabant, in a spirit of revenge after the last-mentioned rising, imposed so heavy taxes upon the people that they emigrated in large numbers. A hundred thousand weavers left the country, carrying abroad, mainly to England, the secrets of their trade; and from that period the material prosperity of Louvain has steadily diminished.
