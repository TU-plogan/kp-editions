+=====================================================================+


LYCURGUS, one of the ten great Attic orators, was born about 396-93 b,c. His father was named Lycophron, and he belonged to the old Attic family of the Eteobutadae. He is said to have been a pupil both of Plato and of Isocrates. His early career is quite unknown, but after the real character of the great struggle with Philip of Macedon was becoming manifest he was recognized along with Demosthenes and Hyperides as one of the chiefs of the national party. He left the care of external relations to his colleagues, and devoted himself to the internal organization and the financial administration of the state. He managed the finances of Athens for twelve successive years, being chosen ταμ,iας ττ)ς κοινήν προσόδου, probably, in 341 B.c., for a term of four years, and in the two succeeding terms, when the actual office was forbidden him by law, directing it through a nominal official chosen from his party. Part of one of the deeds in which he rendered account of his term of office is still preserved in an inscription (Corp. Inscr. Gr., i. No. 247 ; Corp. Inscr. Λtt., ii. pt. 2, No. 289). During this time 18,900 talents passed through his hands, and he raised the public income to 1200 talents yearly. His integrity and his skilful management were highly appreciated by the people, who refused to deliver him up when Alexander the Great demanded his surrender; many private persons deposited money under his charge. He was also appointed to various other offices connected with the preservation and improvement of the city. He was very strict in his superintendence of the public morals, ajιd passed a sumptuary law to restrain extravagance. On the other hand he showed a noble and liberal spirit in all that concerned public expenditure; he did much to beautify and improve the city by fine buildings; and he passed a famous law ordering that statues of the three great tragedians should be erected, and that a careful edition of their tragedies should be made and preserved among the state archives.

Lycurgus was a man of action and not of words: his orations, of which fifteen were published, are criticized by the ancients for their awkward arrangement of matter, harshness of style, and the tendency to digressions about mythology and past history, while the noble spirit and the lofty morality that breathe through them are highly praised. Only one of the orations, that against Leocrates, has been preserved, and fully bears out the criticism of the ancients. He was evidently one of the last examples of the finest Athenian type—full of religious feeling, as became one of the Eteobutadae·, the family in which the priestlιood of Athene Polias was hereditary, proud of the history and the religion of his country, and resolved to act worthily of it and to make others do the same, severe and stern in his treatment of offenders and frequently prosecuting them in the public courts, but generous and liberal in all that concerned the glory of Athens.
