D’AMBOISE, George (1460-1510), a French cardinal and minister of state, was born in the year 1460. He belonged to a noble family possessed of considerable influence, and he was only fourteen when his father procured for him the bishopric of Montauban, and Louis XI. appointed him one of his almoners. On arriving at manhood D’Amboise attached himself to the party of the duke of Orleans, in whose cause he suffered imprisonment, and on whose return to the royal favour he was elevated to the archbishopric of Narbonne, which after some time he [9:6:794] changed for that of Rouen. On the appointment of the duke of Orleans as governor of Normandy, D’Amboise became his lieutenant-general; and he has the credit of having freed the province from the bandits which infested it, and of having diminished the oppression of the nobles, who consequently (during his absence in Italy) petitioned the king against him. In 1494 the duke of Orleans mounted the throne as Louis XII.; and D’Amboise was suddenly raised to the high position of cardinal and prime minister. His administration was, in many respects, well-intentioned and useful. Having the good fortune to serve a king who was both economic and just, he was able to diminish the imposts, to introduce order among the soldiery, to establish the Great Council for the trial of cases in which one of the parties possessed authority that overawed the ordinary courts, and otherwise to improve the execution of justice. He was also zealous for the reform of the church; and it is greatly to his credit that he did not avail himself of the extremely favourable opportunities he possessed of becoming a pluralist. He regularly spent a large income in charity, and he laboured strenuously to stay the progress of the plague and famine which broke out in 1504. His foreign policy was animated by two aims—to increase the French power in Italy, and to seat himself on the Papal throne; and these aims he sought to achieve by diplomacy, not by force. He, however, sympathized with, and took part in, the campaign which was commenced in 1499 for the conquest of Milan. Soon after he was made legate a latere; and on the death of Alexander VI. he aspired to the Papacy. He had French troops at the gates of Rome, by means of which he could easily have frightened the conclave, and induced them to elect him; but he was persuaded to trust to his influence; the troops were dismissed, and an Italian was appointed as Pius III.; and again, on the death of Pius within the month, another Italian, Julius II., was chosen. In 1508 France, still under the ministry of D’Amboise, joined the League of Cambray against Venice; and it was on his journey into Italy that he was seized at the city of Lyons with a fatal attack of gout in the stomach. He died there at the age of fifty on the 25th May 1510.

DAMIENS.Robert FRAN9Ois(1715-1757),who attained notoriety by his attack on Louis XV. of France in 1757, was born in a village near Arras in 1715, and early enlisted in the army. After his discharge, he became a menial in the College of the Jesuits in Paris, and was dismissed from this as well as from other employments for misconduct. Indeed his conduct was such as to earn for him the name ol Robert le Diable. During the disputes of Clement XI. with the Parliament of Paris, the mind of Damiens seems to have been excited by the ecclesiastical disorganisation which followed the refusal of the clergy to grant the sacraments to the Jansenists and Convulsionnaires • and he appears to have thought that peace would be restored by the death of the king. He, however, asserted, perhaps with truth, that he only intended to frighten the king without wounding him severely. In January 1757, as the king was entering his carriage, lie rushed forward and stabbed him with a knife, inflicting only a slight wound. He made no attempt to escape, and was at once seized. He was condemned as a regicide, and sentenced to be torn in pieces by horses in the Place de Greve. Before being put to death he was barbarously tortured with red-hot pincers, and molten wax, lead, and boiling oil were poured into his wounds. After his death his house was razed to the ground, his brothers and sisters were ordered to change their names, and his father, wife, and daughter were banished from France.
