DARES, a Trojan priest of Hephaestus, who lived at the time of the Trojan war, and to whom was attributed an ancient account of that war which was extant in the time of .ZElian. A work in Latin, purporting to be a translation of this account, and entitled Daretis Phrygii de Excidio Trojce Historia, was much read in the Middle Ages, and was then ascribed to Cornelius Nepos; but the language i3 extremely corrupt, and it belongs to a period much later than the time of Nepos. It is commonly published together with the work of Dictys Cretensis. See the edition (which has an essay upon Dares) by A. Dederich, who is inclined to ascribe the work to a Roman of the 5th, 6th, or 7th century (Bonn, 1837).
