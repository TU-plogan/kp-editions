DANIELL, John Frederick (1790—1845), an eminent chemist and physicist, was born in London on the 12th March 1790. From his father, a barrister, he received an excellent classical education; but having from his early years displayed a preference for natural science, he entered a sugar refinery, where he soon effected important improvements in the process. He studied chemistry under Professor Brande, in conjunction with whom he started in 1816 the journal which, shortly after its commencement, became favourably known to scientific men as the Quarterly Journal of Science and Art. To this he contributed numerous articles on chemistry and meteorology, including, under the latter head, an interesting account of the ingenious and delicate dew-point hygrometer which is known by his name. In 1823 he collected and published his Meteorological Essays, which excited much interest as one of the first attempts to explain the phenomena of the weather on the broad and sure basis of physical science. In 1824 he published an Essay on Artificial Climate considered in its Applications to Horticulture, which was the means of effecting a radical change in the treatment of tropical plants in colder regions, by showing the necessity of a humid atmosphere in hothouses. As managing director of the Continental Gas Company he interested himself in the manufacture of gas for illuminating purposes, and invented a method of extracting it from resin, which was in practical use for a time. He was one of the founders of the Society for Promoting Useful Knowledge, for which he wrote a treatise on chemistry. In 1831 he was appointed first professor of chemistry in the newly founded King’s College, London. During the succeeding years he was engaged in a series of investigations on heat and electricity, which were of great value in their practical applications. For his register pyrometer, devised to measure high temperatures, he was awarded in 1832 the Rumford medal of the Royal Society. Soon afterwards he received the Copley medal for his invention of the sulphate of copper or constant battery, which, as a substitute for Wollaston’s, effected an immense improvement in the apparatus of voltaic electricity. The Royal medal, the only other honour of the kind in the gift of the society, was bestowed upon him in 1842. In 1839 appeared his Introduction to the Study of Chemical Philosophy, which dealt very ably with the theory of molecular forces. Four years later the honorary degree of D.C.L. was conferred upon him by the university of Oxford. He had received in 1839 another honour of a different kind in being chosen foreign secretary of the Royal Society. He died suddenly of apoplexy while attending a meeting of the council of the society on the 13th March 1845.
