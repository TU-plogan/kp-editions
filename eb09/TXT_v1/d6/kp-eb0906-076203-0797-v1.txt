DAHL, or Dale, Vladimir Ivanovitch (1802-1872), a Russian author and philologist of high reputation, was born of Scandinavian parentage in 1802, and received his education at the Naval Cadets’ Institution at St Petersburg. He joined the Black Sea fleet in 1819; but at a later date he entered the military service, and was thus engaged in the Polish campaign of 1831, and in the expedition against Khiva. He was afterwards appointed to a medical post in one of the Government hospitals at St Petersburg, and was ultimately transferred to a situation in the civil service. The latter years of his life were spent at Moscow, and he died there on November 3 (October 22), 1872. Under the name of Kossack Lugansky he obtained considerable fame by his stories of Russian life,— The Dream and the Waking, A Story of Misery, Happiness, and Truth, The Door-Keeper (Dvernik), The Officers Valet (Denshchik). His greatest work, however, was a Dictionani of the Living [9:6:763] Russian Tongue (Tolkovyi Slovar Zhivago Velikorusskago Yasika), which appeared in four volumes between 1861 ani 1866, and is of the most essential service to the student of the popular literature and folk-lore of Russia. “It is impossible,” says Mr Ralston, “to praise too highly this magnificent work—one to which he devoted during a great part of his lifetime what was truly a labour of love.” It was based on the results of his own investigations throughout the various provinces of Russia,—investigations which had furnished him with no fewer than 4000 popular tales and upwards of 30,000 proverbs. Among his other publications may be mentioned Bemerkungen zu Zimmermann's Entwurf des Kriegstheaters Russlands gegen Khiwa, published in German at Orenburg, and a Handbook of Botany, Moscow, 1849. A collected edition of his works appeared at St Petersburg in 8 volumes, 1860-61.
