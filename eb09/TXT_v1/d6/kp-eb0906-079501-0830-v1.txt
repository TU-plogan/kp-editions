DAMIRON, Jean Philibert (1794-1862), a French writer on philosophy, was born at Belleville in 1794. At nineteen he entered the normal school, where he studied under Burnouf, Villemain, and Cousin. After teaching for several years in provincial towns, he came to Paris, where he lectured on philosophy in various institutions, and finally became professor in the normal school, and titular professor at the Sorbonne. In 1824 he took part with Dubois and Jouffroy in the establishment of the Globe; and he was also a member of the committee of the society which took for its motto Aide-toi, le Ciel t’aidera. In 1833 he was appointed chevalier of the Legion of Honour, and in 1836 member of the Academy of Moral Sciences. Damiron died at Paris on the 11th January 1862.

The chief works of Damiron, of which the best are his accounts of French philosophers, are the following:—An edition of the Nouveaux Melanges Philosophiques de Jouffroy (1842), with a notice of the author, in which Damiron softened and omitted several expressions used by Jouffroy, which were opposed to the system of education adopted by the Sorbonne, an article which gave rise to a bitter controversy, and to a book by Pierre Leroux, De la Mutilation des Manuscrits de M. Jouffroy (1843); Essai sur l'histoire de la philosophic en France au XIX. siécle (1828, 3rd ed. 1834); Essai sur l'histoire de la philosophic en Franceau X VII. siécle (1846); Mémoires à servir pour l'histoire de la philosophic en France au X VIII. siécle (1858-64); Cours de philosophic; De la Providence (1849, 1850).
