D, in the English alphabet, the fourth letter, and the third consonant, represents the dental sonant sound, to which T is the corresponding surd (see B). It is the fourth letter also in the Hebrew, Chaldee, Samaritan, Syriac, Greek, and Latin alphabets. The form of our D is the same as that of the Latins; and the Latin D is no other than the Greek Δ; in old Latin, and in several of the Greek alphabets, including those of South-Western Italy, from which the Roman alphabet was borrowed, we find the form ⊳: the right hand corner was rounded for convenience of writing. The Greek symbol, again, is borrowed from the ancient Phoenician character, called in Hebrew Daleth. D is found in English (according to Grimm’s law) where 0 will be found in Greek, and f in Latin: thus our deer is the Greek θήρ and Latin fera. In Old High German the corresponding word was rightly spelt with a t (tior); but this is now spelt thier, though the sound is the same. By the same law d appears in Greek and Latin where we find t in English and z in High German: thus we have δ ύo , duo, two, zwei. D sometimes became l in Latin; thus Ulysses represented ’Oδυσσεύς; sometimes it became r, as in arbiter for ad-biter. In praenomens D stood for Decimus, and in the titles of emperors for Divus. It is also a numeral letter, representing five hundred. This may arise from the circumstance that the letter D is analogous in form to IO, the half of CIO. which is the Roman numeral expression for a thousand. With a dash placed on the top thus, D, its value is increased tenfold, or, in other words, it stands for five thousand. Used as an abbreviation, D has various significations, for which see the article Abbreviations.
