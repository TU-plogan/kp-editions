DANNECKER, Johann Heinrich von (1758-1841), one of the best German sculptors. He was born at Stuttgart, where his father was employed in the stables of the duke of Wurtemberg, 15th October 1758. The boy was entered in the military school at the age of thirteen, and continued there two years, when, his bias and hi3 talent having manifested themselves, he was allowed to take his own way, although there had been some idea of making him a dancer. Once freed from his juvenile difficulties his success was pretty secure, and we find him at once associating with the young sculptors Scheffauer and Le Jeune, the painters Guibal and Harper, and also with Schiller, and the much-admired musician Zumsteeg. His busts of some of these are good; that of Schiller is well known. In his eighteenth year he carried off the prize at the Concours with his model of Milo of Crotona, the strong man who died by having his hand caught in the rent stump of a tree, a favourite subject with young sculptors. On this the duke made him sculptor to the palace (1780), and for some time he was employed on child-angels and caryatides for the decoration of the reception rooms. This work did not please him very much, and in 1783, in his twenty-fourth year, he left for Paris with Scheffauer, and placed himself under Pajoufor a time. His Mars, a sitting figure sent home to Stuttgart, marks this period; and we next find him, still travelling with his friend, at Rome in 1785, where he settled down to work hard for five years, during which his position in the future art history of his native land was securely made. Goethe and Herder were then in Rome and became his friends, as well as Canova, who was the hero of the day, and who had undoubtedly a great authoritative influence on his style. His marble statues of Ceres and Bacchus were done at this time. These are now to be seen in the Residenz-schloss, at Stuttgart. While in Rome his study of the antique was very careful and intelligent, although Canova was so much admired by him, and on his return to Stuttgart, which he never afterwards quitted except for short trips to Paris, Vienna, and Zurich, the double influence of these opposite forces is apparent in his works. We may mention some of these. The first was a Girl Lamenting her Dead Bird, which pretty light motive was much admired. Afterwards, Sappho, in marble for the Lustschloss, and two Offering-bearers for the Jagdschloss; Hector, now in the museum, not in marble; the Complaint of Ceres, from Schiller’s poem; a statue of Christ, worthy of mention for its nobility, which has been skilfully engraved by Amsler; Psyche; Kneeling Water Nymph; Love, a favourite he had to repeat. These stock subjects with sculptors had freshness of treatment; and the Ariadne, done a little later, especially had a charm of novelty which has made it a European favourite in a reduced size. It is perhaps the contrast between the delicacy of the female human form and the subdued rude force of the panther she rides that attracts our admiration; but it is probable that this group, like Canova’s Graces, will always retain its popularity. It was repeated for the banker Von Bethman in Frankfort, where it now appears the ornament of the Platz. Many of the illustrious men of the time were modelled by him. The original marble of Schiller is now at Weimar; after the poet’s death it was again modelled in colossal size. Lavater, Metternich, Countess Stephanie of Baden, General Benkendorf, and others are much prized. Dannecker was director of the Gallery of Stuttgart, and received many academic and other distinctions. So far his life had been prosperous, but as the evening drew on his mind became troubled and at last obscured. His health had suffered while working very closely on a large monumental statue, and long before his final year he was altogether prostrated. During this sad period he rallied, but his memory and power of observation faded again, and his death was long expected. This took place at last in 1841, in his eighty-third year.
