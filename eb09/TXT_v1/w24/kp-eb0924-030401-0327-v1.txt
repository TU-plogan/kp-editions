W is simply double v, so far as the form goes; but its value, like its name, is double u, and it dates back to a time when u and v had not been fully differentiated, one into a vowel, the other into a consonant (see under U). The oldest form of the letter was uu, sometimes u only; e.g., uulfheard, uilfrith, in the Liber Vitae, 9th century. Later, a peculiar symbol appears, Ҏ, called “wen”; this belonged to the runic alphabet, which the Latin superseded: it undoubtedly represented the w -sound. It died out about 1300, probably through the influence of French copyists. As early as the 11th century we find vv, later w.

The sound denoted by W is a voiced labial, formed by rounding the lips so much that the voice cannot escape without friction. In the nature of the case no hard and fast line can be drawn between it and the vowel u (any more than between i and y) : it is impossible to say exactly at what point the open position of the lips for u ceases and sufficient closure for a definite consonant begins. We may perhaps mark out three noticeable sounds :—(1) the clear vowel u ; (2) a consonant u, equivalent to a “glide” in the diphthongs “eu,” “ou,” &c., i.e. , a sound which is held not long enough to be a vowel as forming a syllable by itself, yet without sufficient friction to make a consonant; (3) the consonant w. The difference between (2) and (3) may be illustrated by the initial sounds of French “oui” and English “we”; the ou in “oui” is a consonant u∙, it does not make a syllable distinct from the following i, and so it is not a vowel; yet it is quite distinguishable from the w in “we.” It is probable, from some slight indications, principally in Sanskrit, that both (2) and (3) were sounds of the Indo-European language. But it could hardly be supposed that they would be kept rigorously distinct in the derived languages; they lie too near together.

It has been already pointed out (see article U) that the representatives of the sound w varied much in the different languages. In Greek we find Ӻ and sometimes ν (as in εὒαδε, &c.); in Latin there was no symbol to distinguish it from the vowel u. The English varieties are mentioned above.

For the history of this sound in connexion with the velar k of the original speech see article Q. This sound died out in most of the derived languages, but left traces in Greek—(1) in the symbol koppa, (2) in the phonetic change called “labialism,” by which the slight labial of the original sound developed and eventually changed the guttural explosive into a labial, e.g., k w ou became πoυ. Similarly in Italy the Latin qu of “qui,” “quantus,” &c., preserved the original symbol and sound, whereas the Oscan and Umbrian agreed with the Greek in labializing.

In English the w -sound has commonly held its own. It has survived in writing, even in the almost impossible combination wr, as in “wrath,” “write,” “wreck,” “wretch,” but the sound is lost. In several Old English words the combination cw was exchanged for qu, as was natural under French influence, e.g., quoth (O.E. cwae đ ), quell (O.E. cwellan), queen (O.E. cwên).

The digraph wh denotes the voiceless sound corresponding to the voiced w. In the great majority of cases where it occurs it represents original H, as in who, what (original base k w a) ; these were originally written hwá, hwaet; so also “while” was “hwil,” “wheeze” was “hwaes” (Lat. ques-tus). In similar combinations with l and r the h has been lost, as in “loud,” formerly “hlúd” (κλυτός), raven (hraefn), ring (bring); and in hw the h seems to have robbed the w of its voice (a result denoted by the writing wh), and then fallen off here also as an independent sound.
