WESSEL. Wesselus Gansfortius ^[1. The surname is from Gansfort or Gösevort, a Westphalian village from which his family came; the Christian name is the equivalent of the Greek Basilius.] was born at Groningen in 1400 (Hardenberg), in 1419 (Suffridus Petri), or in 1421, and on the death of his parents was adopted by a noble lady, Oda Clantes, who sent him along with her only son to the famous school at Deventer, which was under the supervision of the Brothers of Common Life, and was in close connexion with the convent of Mount St Agnes at Zwolle, where then lived Thomas a Kempis, [9:24:505] the author of the Imitatio Christi. At Deventer, where the best traditions of the 14th-century mysticism were still cultivated, Wessel imbibed that earnest devotional mysticism which was the basis of his theology and which drew him irresistibly, after a busy life, to spend his last days among the Friends of God in the Low Countries. From Deventer he went to Cologne to be taught the Thomist theology, which was fondly cherished in that famous Dominican school; and there he learnt realism, which, although he afterwards became a nominalist in metaphysics, always coloured his theology. At Cologne too he came in contact with humanism. He learnt Greek and Hebrew from monks who, it is said, had been driven out of Greece. The Thomist theology sent him to study Augustine, and his Greek reading led him to Plato, and from both of these great thinkers he learnt much that went to enrich his own theological system. The echoes of the din raised in Paris by the disputes between the realists and the nominalists reached Wessel in Cologne, and a desire to mingle in the fray, or perhaps to learn on which side truth was, induced him to go to Paris, where he remained sixteen years, scholar and teacher. There he eventually took the nominalist side, prompted as much by his mystical anti-ecclesiastical tendencies as from any metaphysical insight; for the nominalists were then the anti-papal party. A desire to know more about humanism sent him to Rome, where we find him in 1470 the intimate friend of Italian scholars and under the protection of Cardinals Bessarion and Della Rovere (afterwards Pope Sixtus IV.). It is said that Sixtus would have gladly made Wessel a bishop, but that he had no desire for any ecclesiastical preferment. From Rome he returned to Paris, and speedily became a famous teacher, gathering round him a band of enthusiastic young students, among whom was Reuchlin. As old age approached he came to have a growing dislike to the wordy theological strife which surrounded him, and turned away from that university discipline, “non studia sacrarum literarum sed studiorum commixtae corruptiones.” After thirty years of academic life he went back to his native Groningen, and spent the rest of his life partly as director in a nuns’ cloister there and partly in the convent of St Agnes at Zwolle. He was welcomed as the most renowned scholar of his time, and it was fabled that he had travelled through all lands, Egypt as well as Greece, gathering everywhere the fruits of all sciences—“a man of rare erudition,” says the title page of the first edition of his collected works, “who in the shadow of papal darkness was called the light of the world.” His remaining years were spent amid a circle of warm admirers, friends, and disciples, to whom he imparted the mystical theology, the devotion to higher learning, and the deep devotional spirit w’hich characterized his own life. He died on October 4, 1489, with the confession on his lips, “I know only Jesus the crucified.” He is buried in the middle of the choir of the church of the “Geestlichen Maegden,” whose director he had been.

Wessel has been called one of the “reformers before the Reformation,” and the title is a true one if by it is meant a man of deeply spiritual life, who protested against the growing paganizing of the papacy, the superstitious and magical uses of the sacraments, the authority of ecclesiastical tradition, and that tendency in later scholastic theology to lay greater stress in a doctrine of justification upon the instrumentality of the human will than on the objective work of Christ for man’s salvation. His own theology was, however, essentially mediaeval in type, and he never grasped that experimental thought of justification on which Reformation theology rests.

See Vita Wesseli Grοningensis, by Albert Hardenberg, published in an incomplete form in the preface to Wessel’s collected works, Amsterdam, 1614 (tins preface also contains extracts from the works of several writers who have given facts about the life of Wessel); Muurling, Com. Uist. Theol. de Wesseli Gans-fortii Vita, &c., 1831; Ullmann, Reformers before the Reformation (the second volume of the German edition is a second and enlarged edition of a previous work, entitled Johann Wessel , ein Vorgänger Luther's, 1834); Friedrich, Johann Wessel, ein Bild aus der Kirchengeschichte des 15ten Jahrhunderts, 18G2; Ritschl, History of the Christian Doctrine of Justification and Reconciliation (Edin., 1872). Wessel's two most important writings are his Treatise on Prayer (De Oratione) and his Scala Meditationis.
