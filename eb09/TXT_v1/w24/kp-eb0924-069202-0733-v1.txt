WRIGHT, Thomas (1810-1877), antiquary, was born at Ludlow, in Shropshire, 21st April 1810, and was descended from a Quaker family formerly living at Bradford, in λ orkshire. He was educated at the old grammar school at Ludlow, and afterwards at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated in 1834. While at Cambridge he contributed to the Gentleman's Magazine and other periodicals, and in 1835 he came to London to devote himself to a literary career. His first separate work was Early English Poetry in Black Letter, with Prefaces and Notes, 1836, 4 vols. 12mo, which was followed during the next forty years by a very extensive series of publications, many of lasting value. He helped to found the British Archaeological Association and the Percy, Camden, and Shakespeare societies. In 1842 he was elected corresponding member of the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres of Paris, and was a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries as well as member of many other learned British and foreign bodies. In 1859 he superintended the excavations of the Roman city of Uriconium, near Shrewsbury, of which he issued a description. He died at Chelsea, 23d December 1877, in his sixty-seventh year. A portrait of him is in the Drawing Room Portrait Gallery for October 1, 1859. His fertility was remarkable, and the list of seventy-eight articles in Allibone’s Dictionary (1871, iii. pp. 2864-67) includes examples of almost every department of literature. He was a great scholar, but will be chiefly remembered as an industrious antiquary and the editor of many relics of the Middle Ages. In the British Museum catalogue are 121 references under his name.
