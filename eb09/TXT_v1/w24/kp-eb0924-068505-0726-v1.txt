WOTTON, William (1666—1726), is now remembered chiefly for his part in the famous “Battle of the Books,” but to his own generation his Reflections upon Ancient and Modern Learning was only one of many proofs of his extraordinary amount and variety of scholarship. Born in 1666, the son of an English clergyman, rector of Wrentham, in Suffolk, he was one of the.wonders of his age in precocity. He could translate from several languages at the age of five. He was under ten when he was sent to Cambridge, and he took the degree of B.A. at the age of twelve years and five months, having already created such a sensation by his linguistic attainments that Latin poems were addressed to him as a prodigy. In the Battle of the Books he took a judicious middle course between the extreme champions, Fontenelle [9:24:686] and Temple, making a succinct, elaborate, and careful comparison between ancients and moderns in oratory, poetry, mathematics, philosophy, astronomy, anatomy, botany, and other arts and sciences. His Refections, the first edition of which appeared in 1694, show that his prodigious memory was not confined to languages, and that he possessed also strong judgment and argumentative power. The treatise may still be read with interest, as a survey of the state of various sciences at the close of the 17 th century. Wotton, who was made D.D. in 1707, wrote also on subjects so diverse as fossils and Welsh laws, besides producing various historical works. He was engaged on his translation of the Welsh laws at the time of his death, which took place in 1726.
