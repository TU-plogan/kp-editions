WINNIPEG, capital of the province of Manitoba, in the Dominion of Canada, stands at the confluence of the Red River and the Assiniboine, in 49° 56' N. lat. and 97° 7' W. long., and 764 feet above the sea. Its name is taken from Lake Winnipeg (Ojibway, Win, “muddy,” and W⅛>i, “water ”). The waters of the Red River reach the lake 45 miles north of the city. For some five miles north of “the Forks,” as the junction of the rivers was formerly called, lay the old Red River colony of Lord Selkirk, founded in 1812 (see vol. xx. p. 315). Five fur traders’ or colonists’ forts have stood within the city limits:—(1) Fort Rouge (1736), of the French voyageurs; (2) Fort Gibraltar (1804-15), built by the north-west traders of Montreal; (3) Fort Douglas (1813-35), Lord Selkirk’s fort; (4) old Fort Garry (1821-35), of Hudson’s Bay Company; and (5) new Fort Garry (1835-82). The transfer of Rupert’s Land to Canada in 1870 led to the formation of the province of Manitoba. Then, too, Winnipeg was begun as a village, half a mile north of Fort Garry. The city is built on the prairie; a part of the site was swampy, but is being well drained. The city includes both sides of the Assiniboine, but on the east side of the Red River there is an independent corporation, the town of St Boniface, which is virtually a suburb. St Boniface, w ith 1449 inhabitants, was first settled by Lord Selkirk’s German De Meuron soldiers in 1817. The growth of Winnipeg has been remarkable. Living on its site in 1871 there were but 241 souls. As Canadian immigration increased the village grew, and in 1873 it was incorporated as a city, in the face of strenuous opposition by the Hudson’s Bay Company. The census of 1881 gave the city 7985 inhabitants. In the following year Winnipeg, as being the central point of the Canadian Pacific Railway, which connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, became a place of great prospective importance. An enormous rise in values took place. The population of the city doubled in a few months, and the wildest speculation took place. This inflation, locally known as “the boom,” caused much damage, and in the following year the collapse brought down almost all the business men of the city. The population diminished very rapidly, but has risen again, and is now increasing. The census of 1886 gave Winnipeg 20,238 inhabitants. The city has water, gas, electricity, and ample fire protection, and architecturally presents a fine appearance. Main Street, which is 132 feet wide and block-paved for a mile, is stated to be one of the best streets in Canada. Being on the eastern edge of the prairies, which run for a thousand miles to the Rocky Mountains, and standing to the west of the great Laurentian formation extending from Montreal, Winnipeg is an important railway centre. The first railway to reach the city was the Pembina branch of the Canadian Pacific Railway, which connects with the railway system of the United States. This took place in December 1878. The Canadian Pacific Railway has not only its main line now running through the city, but five other branches radiating from this centre. Forty miles of the Hudson’s Bay Railway, to run from Winnipeg to York Factory, are already completed, and the Government of Manitoba is constructing (1888) an independent line to connect with the American railway system, to be known as the Red River Valley Railway. The total valuation of property for the city for 1887 was $19,392,410, while the exports of the port of Winnipeg for the year were of the value of $816,260, with $1,929,120 of imports. There are seven chartered banks, and many branches of Canadian and English life assurance and loan associations are in operation. In education Winnipeg is the centre of the Canadian NorthWest. The Winnipeg public and secondary schools compare favourably with those of other Canadian cities, and employ 50 teachers, male and female. At Winnipeg is situated the provincial university, to which are affiliated four colleges,—St Boniface (Roman Catholic), St John’s (Church of England), Manitoba (Presbyterian), and Manitoba medical college. The university has been voted 150,000 acres of wild land by the Dominion Government, and has received $85,000 of a legacy from a native of Rupert’s Land. There are 24 church buildings in the city and neighbourhood. The census of 1886 gives the religion of the population as follows :—Church of England, 5962; Presbyterians, 5271; Methodists, 3217; Roman Catholics, 2244. The societies are the historical and scientific society, and St Andrew’s, St George’s, St Patrick’s, St Jean Baptiste, Scandinavian, and Hebrew national societies. Masonic, oddfellows’, and temperance organizations are strong. There are two hospitals, besides a children’s home and maternity hospital. The finer buildings and erections are the city hall, post-office, parliament buildings, governor’s residence, court-house, college buildings, Hudson’s Bay Company warehouse, Westminster block, Cauchon block, and the volunteer monument of 1886 on the City Square.
