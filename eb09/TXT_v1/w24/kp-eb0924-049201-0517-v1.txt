WELLINGBOROUGH, a market-town of Northamptonshire, England, is situated on the declivity of a hill near the junction of the Ise with the Nen, and on the London and North-Western and Midland railway lines, 63½ miles north-north-west of London, and 10½ east-north-east of Northampton. The church of St Luke contains some Norman and Early English portions, with later work of various periods, and a Decorated western tower and spire. The grammar-schools, founded in 1594 and endowed with the revenues of a suppressed guild, include a school of the second and a school of the third grade, the former a building of red brick in the Renaissance style erected in 1880 at a cost of £6000, and the latter an old Elizabethan structure. Another educational endowment is Freeman’s school, founded by John Freeman in 1711. There are also several charities. The market-place, situated in the centre of the town, was founded in 1874. The principal public buildings include the corn exchange (erected in 1861 at a cost of £4000), and the “Priory,” an old residence now used for Sunday school and other parochial purposes. Formerly the town was famed for the chalybeate springs to which it owes its name. It is now of some importance as a centre of agricultural trade; but the staple industry is leather. A great impulse to the prosperity of the town was given by the introduction of the boot and shoe trade, especially the manufacture of uppers. Smelting, brewing, and iron-founding are also carried on, as well as the manufacture of portable steam-engines. A coal depôt of the [9:24:493] Midland Railway is also situated in the town. The population of the township and urban sanitary district (area 3992 acres) in 1871 was 9385 and in 1881 it was 13,794.

In 948 Edred gave the church at Wellingborough to Croyland abbey, and the grant was confirmed by King Edgar in 966. In the reign of Edward II. the abbot was lord in full. It received the grant of a market in the 2d year of King John. In 1621 it was visited by Charles I. and his queen, who resided in tents during a whole season that they might drink the waters. It was after its almost total destruction by fire in 1738 that the town was built on its present site on the hill.
