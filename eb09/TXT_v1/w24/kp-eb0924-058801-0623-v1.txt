WILLIS, Thomas (1621-1675), English physician, was born at Great Bed win, Wiltshire, on 27 th January 1621. He studied at Christ Church, Oxford; and when that city was garrisoned for the king he bore arms for the Royalists. He took the degree of bachelor of medicine in 1646, and after the surrender of the garrison applied himself to the practice of his profession. In 1660, shortly after the Restoration, he became Sedleian professor of natural philosophy in place of Dr Joshua Cross, who was ejected, and the same year he took the degree of doctor of physic. In 1664 he discovered the medicinal spring at Astrop, near Brackley in Northamptonshire. He was one of the first members of the Royal Society, and was elected an honorary fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1664. In 1666, after the fire of London, he removed to Westminster, on the invitation of Dr Sheldon, archbishop of Canterbury. There he rapidly acquired an extensive practice, his reputation and skill marking him out as one of the first physicians of his time. He died at St Martin’s on 11th November 1675 and was buried in Westminster Abbey.

Willis was admired for his piety and charity, for his deep insight into natural and experimental philosophy, anatomy, and chemistry, and for the elegance and purity of his Latin style. He wrote in English A Plain and Easy Method for Preserving those that are Well from the Infection of the Plague, and for Curing such as are Infected. His Latin works were printed in two vols. 4to at Geneva in 1676, and at Amsterdam in 1682. His grandson, Browne Willis, was the author of several antiquarian works.
