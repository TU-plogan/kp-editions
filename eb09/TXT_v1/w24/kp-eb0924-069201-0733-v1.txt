WRIGHT, Silas (1795-1847), was born at Amherst, Massachusetts, May 24, 1795. He graduated at Middlebury College, Vermont, in 1815, was admitted to the bar in 1819, and began practice at Canton, in northern New York. From the first he showed those characteristics which finally made him a representative American Democratic leader. He had settled in what was almost a wilderness. His farm was a small one, and no hired labourer upon it worked harder than he. His manner of life was of the simplest. In his professional work he was a type of the lawyer of the old school,—shrewd, skilful, rigidly just, and controlled by the belief that his profession was a public trust, and that judicial qualities must mingle with those of the advocate. He seems never to have sought an office, and never to have felt at liberty to refuse one, even that of village postmaster, if he could possibly serve. He was appointed surrogate in 1820, and was elected successively to the State senate in 1823, to the house of representatives in 1827-29, comptroller of the State 1829-33, United States senator 1833-44, and governor of New York 1844-46. During his public life he had become a leader of the Democratic party of New York, Van Buren being his closest associate. When the national Democratic party in 1844 nominated and elected Polk to the presidency, instead of Van Buren, Wright and the State organization took an attitude of armed neutrality towards the new administration. Renominated for governor in 1846, Wright was defeated, and the result was ascribed to the hostility of the Polk administration. The death of the defeated candidate, at Canton, August 27, 1847, gave intense bitterness to New York politics for several years; and his faction, in 1848, succeeded in defeating their national party’s candidates in the presidential election.

Wright was one of a class of politicians which has influenced American development largely, finding its most characteristic types in the State of New York. It may be traced clearly from about 1820, beginning with what was then known as “the Albany Regency,” including Dix, Marcy, Wright, Seymour, Tilden, to Cleveland (president from 1885), and many of the new men who have come into the national administration with him. Absolutely and punctiliously honest, devoted to the public good, and believing intensely that the public good depended on the political principles of their party, they have been prone to consider politics as a warfare, and merciless exclusion of opponents from office as a legitimate war-weapon. One of their earliest leaders, Marcy, declared the rule of party struggle, that “the spoils (of office) belong to the victor”; the latest, President Cleveland, has been the first to recognize the merit system of appointment in practice, Tilden having already accepted it in theory. The sternness of Wright’s integrity in office was illustrated in 1845, when the “antirent troubles” broke out again, and it seemed probable that the votes of the disaffected would decide the coming election. The governor asked and obtained from the legislature the power to suppress the disturbance by armed force, ordered the militia into the disturbed district, arrested the offenders, had them tried, convicted, and punished, and put an end to what was really an insurrection. His defeat in 1846 was a transition from the old to the new phase of American politics; but his name is still the representative of all that was best in the old.

Wright’s Life has been written by Jenkins, who also has a sketch of him in his Governors of New York·, but the best biography of him is that of Hammond.
