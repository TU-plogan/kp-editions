WESEL, a strongly fortified industrial town in Westphalia, Prussia, is situated at the confluence of the Rhine and the Lippe, 46 miles soutli-west of Münster, and 35 miles south-east of Nimeguen in Holland. The Rhine is here crossed by a large railway bridge and by a bridge of boats. The island of Büderich in mid-stream is fortified, and the town is further protected by detached forts, one of which serves as a tête de-pont on the left bank of the Rhine. Wesel contains some quaint old houses with high-pitched roofs, and a town-house, dating from 1396, with an elaborate façade. The large church of St Willibrord, a handsome late-Gothic edifice, was consecrated in 1181, though its present form dates from 1521. Since 1883 it has been undergoing a much-needed restoration. St Matthew’s church dates from 1472-77. The two Roman Catholic churches, the commandant’s house (built in 1417), the Berlin gateway (1722), and the modern gymnasium and military hospital are among the other chief buildings. Wesel carries on a considerable trade both by railway and its two rivers; wood and fish are perhaps the main exports. It has manufactures of wire, leaden pipes, aud other metal goods, pianofortes, sugar, &c. The population, more than half Roman Catholic, was 20,677 in 1885.

Wesel, formerly known as Lippemünde, was one of the points from which Charlemagne directed his operations against the heathen Saxons. The present name is said to be derived from the numerous weasels (Germ., Wiesel) at one time found in the neighbourhood. In the Middle Ages it was a flourishing commercial town, and a member of the Hanseatic League, and as late as 1495 a free imperial city. A monument outside the town commemorates eleven of Schill’s officers who were shot here in 1809 after their unsuccessful[9:24:503] attempt at Stralsund. Wesel is occasionally spoken of as Unterwesel, to distinguish it from Oberwesel, a small town also on the Rhine (18 miles south-south-east of Coblentz), and also at one time a free imperial town.
