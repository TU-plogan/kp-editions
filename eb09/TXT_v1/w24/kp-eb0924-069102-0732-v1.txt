WRIGHT, Joseph (1734-1797), styled Wright of Derby, subject, landscape, and portrait painter, was born at Derby on September 3, 1734, the son of an attorney of the place, who was afterwards town-clerk. During his early years he manifested an aptitude for mechanical pursuits, and also for music, but he finally resolved to become a painter, and in 1751 he went to London and for two years studied under Thomas Hudson, the master of Reynolds. Returning to Derby he practised portrait-painting; but feeling the need for further instruction he again placed himself for fifteen months under his former master. He then settled in Derby, and varied his work in portraiture by the productions of the subjects seen under artificial light with which his name is chiefly associated, and by landscape painting. He married in 1773, and in the end of that year he visited Italy, where he remained till 1775. "While at Naples he witnessed an eruption of Vesuvius, which under various treatment formed the subject of many of his subsequent pictures. On his return from Italy he established himself at Bath as a portrait-painter; but meeting with little encouragement he returned to Derby, where he spent the rest of his life. He was a frequent contributor to the exhibitions of the Society of Artists, and to those of the Royal Academy, of which he was elected an associate in 1781 and a full member in 1784. He, however, declined the latter honour on account of a slight which he believed that he had received, and severed his official connexion with the Academy, though he continued to contribute to the exhibitions from 1783 til! 1794. He died at Derby on August 29, 1797.

There has been a tendency in recent criticism to over-estimate the works of Joseph Wright. His portraits are frequently defective in drawing, and without quality or variety of handling, while their flesh tints are often hard, and unpleasant in their purple-grey shadows. He is seen at his best in his subjects of artificial light, of which the Orrery (1766), the property of the corporation of Derby, and the Air-pump (1768), in the National Gallery, are excellent examples. His Old Man and Death (1774) is also a strik [9:24:692] ing and individual production. An exhibition of Wright’s works was brought together at Derby in 1883, and twelve of his pictures were shown in the winter exhibition of the Royal Academy in 1886. A careful and elaborate biography of the artist, by William Bemrose, was published in 1885.
