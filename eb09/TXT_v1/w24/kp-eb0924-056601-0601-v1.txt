WILHELMSHAVEN, or Wilhelmshafen, the chief naval station and war harbour of Germany on the North Sea, is situated on the east side of the Jahde, a large basin united with the sea by a channel 3 miles long. The ground on which it stands was purchased by Prussia from the duke of Oldenburg in 1853, and though reckoned a part of the province of Hanover is completely surrounded on the landward side by Oldenburg territory. The town is laid out on a regular and ample scale, and the streets are wide and shaded with trees. A statue has been erected to Admiral Prince Adalbert of Prussia (d. 1873). Most of the inhabitants, who numbered 13,972 in 1885, including 1326 Roman Catholics, are connected with the dockyard and fleet; and there is an additional colony of dockyard employés at Bant (3000 inhabitants), on Oldenburg soil.

The original harbour, constructed in 1855-69, consists of an inner and outer basin. To the south-east of the inner harbour, which is used by war-vessels not in active service, a large new harbour has recently been constructed for war-vessels in commission and for commercial purposes. The entrance to both the old and the new harbour is sheltered by long and massive moles. A torpedo harbour has also been formed. The inner harbour and the adjacent docks, building-slips, machine-shops, &c., form the Government dockyard, which is enclosed by a lofty wall with fourteen iron gates. The whole establishment is defended by strong fortifications.
