WIMBLEDON, a suburb of London, in the county of Surrey, is situated on the London and South Western Railway, 7∣ miles south-west of London. The old village of Wimbledon has been greatly extended of late years, the district being now a favourite residence for the London middle classes. Wimbledon Common, to the north-west of the village, was the meeting-place of the Rifle Association from its foundation in 1860 till 1888. At its southwestern extremity are the outlines of a British earthwork, called Caesar’s camp, having an extreme diameter of 950 feet and a diameter within the vallum of 750 feet. At Coombe’s Hill and elsewhere British relics have been found. The parish church of St Mary is supposed to date from Saxon times; but, after it had undergone various restorations and reconstructions, it was rebuilt in 1833 in the Perpendicular style. There are various other churches and chapels, all modern. A free library was established in 1887. The benevolent institutions include nine almshouses (1838), a cottage hospital (1867), a convalescent hospital (1867), and a hospital for infectious diseases (1877). The population of the urban sanitary district (area 3220 acres) was 9087 in 1871 and 15,950 in 1881.

Wimbledon (Wibbandune) is supposed to have been the scene of a battle in 568 between Ceawlin, king of Wessex, and Ethelbert, king of Kent, in which the latter was defeated. At Domesday it formed part of the manor of Mortlake, held by the archbishops of Canterbury. Afterwards the name was sometimes used interchangeably with Mortlake, and in 1327 it is described as a grange or farm belonging to Mortlake. On the impeachment of Arundel, archbishop of Canterbury, in 1398, it was confiscated. In the reign of Henry VIII. Cromwell, earl of Essex, held the manor of Wimbledon, with Bristow Park as an appendage. On the confiscation of Cromwell’s estates in 1540 it again fell to the crown, and by Henry VIII. it was settled on Catherine Parr for life. By Queen Mary it was granted to Cardinal Pole. In 1574 Elizabeth bestowed the manor house, while retaining the manor, on Sir Christopher Hatton, who sold it the same year to Sir Thomas Cecil. In 1588 Elizabeth transferred the manor to his son Sir Edward Cecil, in exchange for an estate in Lincolnshire. At the time of the Civil War the manor was sold to Adam Baynes, who shortly afterwards sold it to General Lambert; and at the Restoration it was granted to the queen dowager, Henrietta Maria, who sold it in 1661 to George Digby, earl of Bristol. On his death in 1676 it was sold by his widow to the lord-treasurer Danby. Some years after Danby’s death it was purchased by Sarah, duchess of Marlborough, who demised it to her grandson, John Spencer. It was sold by the fifth Earl Spencer in 1877. Wimbledon House, built by Sir Thomas Cecil in 1588, was destroyed by fire in 1785, and a new house, called Wimbledon Park House, was erected about 1801.
