WINSLOW, Edward (1595-1655), was born in Worcestershire, England, October 19, 1595. He became a member of Robinson’s church at Leyden, and in 1620 joined the “Mayflower” company of pilgrims with his wife and brother, being one of the party which discovered Plymouth Harbour. His wife died soon after their arrival, [9:24:614] and his marriage with Mrs Susanna White was the first marriage in Plymouth colony. He was clιosen a magistrate in 1624, and governor in 1633, 1636, and 1644, when Bradford, the usual governor, “by importunity got off.” He made several voyages to England as the colony’s agent. Returning to England in 1649, he remained until 1655, when Cromwell sent him on a mission to the West Indies. He died on the voyage, May 8, 1655.

Winslow’s portrait is in the gallery of the Pilgrim Society at Plymouth. Winsor (Narrative and Critical History of the United States, 277, and autograph at page 268) gives a copy of it as “the only authentic likeness of any of the ’ Mayflower ’ pilgrims.” The list of his writings is given in the same volume. See also Allen’s American Biography, and Belknap’s American Biography.
