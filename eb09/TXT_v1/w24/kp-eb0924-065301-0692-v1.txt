WOODSTOCK, an ancient corporate market-town of Oxfordshire, England, is situated on a stream formerly called the Ennis and now the Glyme, which separates Old and New Woodstock, about 8 miles north-west of Oxford. The church of St Mary Magdalene, in New Woodstock, is of Norman date, but has been greatly altered by restoration, and now has Decorated chancel with Perpendicular additions, clerestoried nave, Decorated north aisle and Early English south aisle retaining a portion of the Norman doorway, Perpendicular west porch, and Perpendicular west tower. The church contains many interesting monuments. The town-hall, erected in 1766 after the designs of Sir William Chambers, includes a market-place and the fire brigade station, with public hall and council-chamber above. Almshouses were erected in 1798 by Caroline, duchess of Marlborough, and endowed with .£3500, which has been increased by bequest at different periods. The town is dependent chiefly on agriculture, but the manufacture of leather gloves has been carried on from an early period. By the Municipal Corporations Act, 1882, the borough (area about 30 acres), formerly governed by a charter of Charles IL, was placed under a corporation. The population of the parliamentary borough (area 20,804 acres), which had been extended in 1832 and ceased to þe separately represented in 1885, was 7033 in 1881.

The old manor house of Woodstock, which is supposed to have been built upon the site of a Roman villa, was at an early period a royal residence. Here Alfred the Great is said to have resided while translating Boetius. At a witenagemot held at Woodstock by King Ethelred a code of laws was published for the government of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom. Henry I. made Woodstock a favourite residence, and formed a zoological garden there. Woodstock was the scene of Henry II.’s courtship of Rosamond Clifford, and his frequent visits to the place led to the building of the nucleus of the town of New Woodstock. A first assize was held at Woodstock in 1184. It sent representatives to parliament from 1301-2 till 1885. It was incorporated by Henry VI. in 1453, and the charter was confirmed and extended by successive monarchs, that granted by Charles II. remaining the governing charter till 1882. Queen Elizabeth was a prisoner at Woodstock from May 1554 till May 1555, and after her accession to the throne visited it in 1566 and again in 1575. In 1576 she made the town a staple of wool and yarn. Woodstock was visited by James I. and by Arabella Stuart. During the Civil War it was the scene of frequent military operations, and after a siege it surrendered to the parliament 20th April 1646. After the battle of Blenheim the manor of Woodstock was by Act 3 and 4 of Queen Anne, chap. 4, bestowed in perpetuity on John duke of Marlborough. Blenheim palace, built by the duke from the designs of Sir John Vanbrugh, was completed in 1715. In 1723 the old manor house was destroyed and the site levelled.
