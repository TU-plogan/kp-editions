WELLINGTON, a market-town of Somerset, England, is situated on a gentle elevation at the foot of the Blackdowns near the river Tone, and on the Great Western Railway, 170 miles south-south-west of London, and 7 south-west of Taunton. The church of St John, a handsome structure, with one of the characteristic Somersetshire towers, is of the Perpendicular style of architecture, except the nave, which is Early English. The church contains a monument to Sir J. Popham, lord justice of England in the time of Elizabeth and James I. Among other public buildings are the market-house or town-hall (1833), the West Somerset county school (1880), and the Popham hospital for aged men and women, founded by Sir John Popham in 1606 and rebuilt in 1833. On the highest summit of the Blackdowns, 2½ miles south of the town, is a triangular stone tower erected in honour of the duke of Wellington, who took his title from the town. The staple industry is the woollen manufacture; iron-founding and brick and tile making are also carried on. The population of the township and urban sanitary district (area 5195 acres) in 1871 was 6286, and in 1881 it was 6360.

King Alfred gave Wellington, with other two neighbouring manors, to Asser, who was afterwards raised to the see of Sherborne, and died in 883. Subsequently it was conferred on Aldhelm, the first bishop of Wells. In Domesday it occurs as Wallintone, and is valued at £25. In the 2d of Edward VI. the manor was granted by Bishop Barlow, together with the borough of Wellington, to Edward, duke of Somerset. On the duke’s attainder it came to the crown, with whom it remained till the 22d of James I.
