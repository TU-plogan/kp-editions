WHITE, Joseph Blanco (1775-1841), author, was born at Seville on 11th July 1775. He was educated for the Roman Catholic priesthood; but after his ordination doubts as to the principles of Catholicism led him to escape from Spain to England (1810), where he ultimately entered the Established Church, having studied theology at Oxford and made the friendship of Arnold, Newman, and Whately. He became tutor in the family of the last-named when he was made archbishop of Dublin (1831). While in this position he embraced Unitarian views; and he found an asylum amongst the Unitarians of Liverpool, where he died on 20th May 1841.

His principal writings are Dobladds Letters from Spain, 1822; Evidence against Catholicism, 1825; Second Travels of an Irish Gentleman in Search of a Religion, 1834; Observations on Heresy and Orthodoxy, 1835. They all show literary ability, and were extensively read in their day. It is probable that his name will be longest known in the world of letters by his sonnet addressed To Night (“Mysterious night! when our first parent knew ”), which has found its way into almost all the recent anthologies, and was spoken of by his contemporaries, Hunt and Coleridge, as one of the finest in English or indeed in any language.

See Life of the Rev. Joseph Blanco White, written by himself, with portions of his Correspondence, edited by John Hamilton Thom, London, 1845.
