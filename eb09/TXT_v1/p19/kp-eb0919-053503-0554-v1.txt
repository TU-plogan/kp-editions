PORTSMOUTH, a city of the United States, capital of Norfolk county, Virginia, lies on the west bank of Elizabeth river, opposite Norfolk. It is the eastern terminus of the Seaboard and Roanoke Railroad (part of a great passenger route between Boston and New Orleans), has one of the best harbours on the Atlantic coast, is the seat of the United States Gosport navy yard (with a dry dock built of granite at a cost of $974,536, and a large naval hospital), and exports cotton, lumber, pig-iron, and early vegetables. The population was 9496 in 1860, 11,390 in 1880, and 14,870 in 1884. Portsmouth was founded in 1752. On 20th April 1861 the navy yard—then employing 1000 men—was destroyed by fire, the loss being estimated at several million dollars.
