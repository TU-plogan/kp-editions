PIKE-PERCH (Lucioperca), freshwater fishes closely allied to the perch, but with strong canine teeth standing between the smaller teeth of the jaws and palate. As indicated by the name, these fishes show some slight resemblance to the pike in their elongate body and head, and like that fish they are most dangerous enemies to other freshwater fishes. Their acclimatization therefore in waters intended for the culture of valuable food fishes is not advisable, though they compensate in some measure for their destructiveness by the excellent flavour of their flesh. In Europe two species occur, the more celebrated being the “Zander” of North Germany or “Schiel” of the Danube (Lucioperca sandra); strange to say, it is absent in the system of the Rhine. It prefers the quiet waters of large rivers and clear deep lakes, in which it reaches a weight of twenty-five or thirty pounds; it does not thrive in small and confined waters. The second European species (Lucioperca wolgensis) is limited to rivers in southern Russia and Hungary. In North America several pike-perches have been described, but in the most recent works only two are distinguished, viz., Lucioperca americana, which grows to a weight of twenty pounds, and the much smaller Lucioperca canadensis; both are abundant in the Canadian lakes and upper Mississippi, and the latter also in the Ohio.
