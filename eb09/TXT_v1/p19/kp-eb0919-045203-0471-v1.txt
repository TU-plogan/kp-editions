POND, John (c. 1767-1836), astronomer-royal, was born about 1767 in London, where his father made a fortune in trade. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge, at the age of sixteen, but took no degree, his course being interrupted by severe pulmonary attacks which compelled a prolonged residence abroad. His travels extended from Lisbon to Constantinople and the Nile, and were turned to account for astronomical observation. In 1800 he settled at Westbury near Bristol, and began to determine star-places with a fine altitude and azimuth circle of 2∣ feet diameter by Troughton. His demonstration in 1806 {Phil. Trans., xcvi. 420) of a change of form in the Greenwich mural quadrant led to the introduction of astronomical circles at the Royal Observatory, and to his own appointment as its head. Elected a fellow of the Royal Society, February 26, 1807, he married and went to live in London in the same year, and in 1811 succeeded Maskelyne as astronomer-royal.

During an administration of nearly twenty-five years, Pond effected a reform of practical astronomy in England comparable to that effected by Bessel in Germany. In 1821 he began to employ the method of observation by reflexion; and in 1825 he devised means (see Mem. R. A. Soc., ii. 499) of combining two mural circles in the determination of the place of a single object, the one serving for direct and the other for reflected vision. (By an invention of Airy’s, the same object is now attained with one instrument.) During Pond’s term of office the instrumental equipment at Greenwich was completely changed, and the number of assistants increased from one to six. The superior accuracy of his determinations was due in part to his systematic attention to the errors of his instruments, in part to his plan of multiplying observations. During a prolonged controversy (1810-24), he consistently denied the reality of Brinkley’s imaginary star-parallaxes (see his papers in Phil. Trans., cviii. 477; cxiii. 53). Delicacy of health impeded his activity, and compelled his retirement in the autumn of 1835. He died at Blackheath, September 7, 1836, and was buried beside Halley in the churchyard of Lee. The Copley medal was conferred upon him in 1823, and the Lalande prize in 1817 by the Paris Academy, of which he was a corresponding member. He published eight folio volumes of Greenwich Observations, translated Laplace’s Système du Monde (in 2 vols. 8vo., 1809), and contributed thirty-one papers to scientific collections. His catalogue of 1112 stars (1833) was of great value.
