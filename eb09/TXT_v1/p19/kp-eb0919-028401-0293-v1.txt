POKROVSKAYA SLOBODA, or Pokrovsk, also Kasakstadt, a village of the district of Novo-uzen, in the government of Samara, Russia, on the left bank of the Volga, almost opposite Saratoff. In the 18th century it was a small cluster of clay huts occupied by a number of runaway serfs who had gathered round the storehouses erected by the crown for salt brought from Lake Elton; but, a body of free settlers having been enticed to the spot in 1747 by large grants of grazing ground, the village rapidly increased, its inhabitants, who numbered 12,776 in 1859, now exceeding 20,(Jt)0. They support themselves by cattle breeding and agriculture; and the Pokrovskaya landing place is one of the most important on the Volga, —the exports, mostly of wheat, reaching 99,850 cwts. in 1880.
