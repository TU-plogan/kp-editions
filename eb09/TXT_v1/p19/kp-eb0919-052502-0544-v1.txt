PORTA, Giambattista della (c. 1543-1615), natural philosopher, was born of a noble and ancient family at Naples about theyear 1543. In early youth he travelled extensively not only in Italy but also in France and Spain, and he had scarcely emerged from boyhood when he published Magiae naturalis, sive de miraculis rerum naturalium lib. IV. (1558), the first draft of his Magia naturalis, in twenty books, published in 1569. At an early age he founded in Naples the Academia Secretorum Naturae, otherwise known as the Accademia dei Oziosi, of which the history has been briefly sketched elsewhere (see Academy, vol. i. p. 70); and in 1610 he became a member of the Accademia dei Lincei at Rome. He died at Naples on 4th February 1615.

The following is a chronological list of the principal writings of this prolific author :— De miraculis rerum naturalium, in four books (1558); De furtivis litterarum, notis, in five books (1563, and frequently afterwards, entitling him to high rank among the early writers on cryptography); Magia naturalis (1569, and often reprinted[9:19:526], also translated into English in 1658, into French, Spanish, and other languages); Phytognomonica (1583, a bulky treatise on the physiology of plants as then understood); De humana physiognomonia, in six books (1591); Villa, in twelve books (1592; an interesting practical treatise on farming, gardening, and arboriculture, based upon his own observations at his country seat near Naples); De refractione, optices parte, in nine books (1593); Pneumatica, in three books (1601); De coelesti physiognomonia, in six books (1601); Elementa curvilinea (1601); De distillations, in nine books (1604); De munitione, in three books (1608); and De aeris transmutationibus, in four books (1609). Porta also wrote several Italian comedies (Olimpia, 1589; La Fantesca, 1592; La Trappolaria, 1597; I Due Fratelli Rivali, 1601; La Sorella, 1607; La Chiappinaria, 1609; La Carbonaria, 1628; La Cintia, 1628). Among all the above-mentioned works the chief interest attaches to the Magia naturalis, in which a strange medley of subjects is discussed, including the reproduction of animals, the transmutation of metals, pyrotechny, domestic economy, statics, hunting, the preparation of perfumes; in book xvii. he describes a number of optical experiments. They include a description of the camera obscura. If, says he, a small aperture is made in the shutter of a dark room, distinct images of all external objects will be depicted on the opposite wall in their true colours; and he further adds that, if a convex lens be fixed in the opening so that the images are received on a surface at the distance of its focal length, the pictures will be rendered so much more distinct that the features of a person standing on the outside of the window may be readily recognized in his inverted image. He applied this instrument to a sort of magic lantern, the representation of eclipses of the sun, and of hunting and other scenes, battles, and other events produced by movable pictures and drawings. He considered the eye as a camera obscura, the pupil as the hole in the window contracting and dilating with different lights, and the crystalline lens as the principal organ of vision, though he seems to have regarded it not as his convex lens but as the tablet on which the images of external objects were formed, the cornea being, no doubt, in his estimation, the part of the eye which formed the picture. After speaking of spectacles and the like, he professed to know a combination of lenses by which “we may contrive to recognize our friends at the distance of several miles, and those of weak sight may read the most minute letters from a distance. It is an invention of great utility, and grounded on optical principles, nor is it at all difficult of execution; but it must be so divulged as not to be understood by the vulgar, and yet be clear to the sharpsighted.” The obscure description which follows does not, however, make it at all probable that he had really anticipated Galilteo.

In his De refractione Porta treats of binocular vision. He repeats the propositions of Euclid on the dissimilar pictures of a sphere when seen with each eye and when seen with both; and he quotes from Galen on the dissimilarity of the three pictures thus seen. But, maintaining as he does that we can see only with one eye at a time, he denies the accuracy of Euclid’s theorem; and, while he admits that the observations of Galen are correct, he endeavours to explain them on other principles. In illustrating Galen’s views on the dissimilarity of the three pictures he gives a diagram in which can be recognized not only the principle but the construction of the stereoscope. It contains a view, represented by a circle, of the picture of a solid as seen by the right eye, of the picture of the same solid as seen by the left, and of the combination of these two pictures as seen by both eyes, placed between the first two pictures. These results, as exhibited in three circles, are then explained by copying the passage from Galen, and he requests the observer to repeat the experiments so as to see the three dissimilar pictures when looking at a solid column.
