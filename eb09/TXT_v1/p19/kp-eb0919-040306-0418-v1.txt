POLO. This game, which is a species of “hockey on horseback,” is of Eastern origin, and seems to have been a favourite pastime in Persia, Tartary, and the frontiers of India from prehistoric times. Every district has a different name for the game, and the rules under which it is played, although substantially identical, vary considerably on minor points. Thus in Little Tibet, Ladakh, and the adjacent districts the ground used is in the form of a parallelogram some hundred yards long with a goal at each end about 50 feet wide. Amongst the Manipuris, a semi-independent tribe on the north-east frontier of India, by whom the game is known as “kunjai,” the ground is about 120 yards by 50 yards and the whole of each end forms a goal. In other places the goals are about 400 yards apart, and the ground is 120 yards wide at each end, increasing in width towards the centre.

In some of the early matches in the United Kingdom the ground was about 400 yards long and 200 yards wide, the width of the goal being from 30 to 35 yards. Under the present rules of the Hurlingham Club, which is now [9:19:404] the principal authority on the game, it is provided that the goals shall be “not less than 250 yards apart and that each goal shall be 8 yards wide.” The English name of the game is perhaps derived from “pulu,” which is the Tibetan for a ball, and the pastime itself reached India from Persia through Afghanistan. It speedily gained favour with the officers of British cavalry regiments quartered in India, and was introduced into the United Kingdom in 1871 by the 10th Hussars. As far as can be ascertained the first match played on English soil took place at Aidershot in the spring of that year. This, however, is not absolutely certain, as no records seem to have been preserved of the early contests.

Under the rules of the game as now played the opposing parties may consist of from three to six players a side, the number in all matches for cups or prizes being limited to four. Each of the players is mounted on a pony which must not exceed fourteen hands and which must be free from any vice. As the description of the game as “hockey on horseback” would imply, the object of the pastime is to force a ball by means of a stick, with which each player is furnished, through the goal of the opposing side. The size of the ball is 3 inches in diameter, and the sticks are 4 feet long with a cross piece at one end for the purpose of striking the ball. At the commencement of a game each side takes up its position behind the goal posts. A player on each side is appointed as goal-keeper. On a flag being dropped to notify the commencement of the game, the other players gallop towards the centre of the ground at full speed, their object being to reach the ball first and drive it in the direction of the opposite goal. When a ball is hit out of bounds it is thrown into play again by one of the umpires, of whom there is one appointed for each side before the commencement of a match. When a ball is hit beyond the goal without passing through it the side defending goal is entitled to a “hit off,” which must be made from the goal line. It is allowable in the course of play to impede an adversary and hinder his stroke by hooking his stick, but this must not be done either under or over his pony. Whilst it is permissible for a player to interpose his pony before his antagonist so as to prevent the latter reaching the ball, it is expressly forbidden to cross another player in possession of the ball except at such a distance as to avoid all possibility of collision. Should a player break his stick or have it broken he must ride to the appointed place where the sticks are kept and take one, and on no account is one to be brought to him. If he drops his stick he must dismount and pick it up, and is not allowed to hit the ball whilst dismounted. If a player is in front of a player of his own side who hits the ball, and has not two—or in case of matches of four a side, one—of the opposing side between him and the hostile goal, and has not come through the “bully,” he is “off side.” He does not then come “on his side” until the ball has been hit or hit at by the opposing side, or until the player on his own side who made the hit passes him. As long as he is “off side” he may not in any way impede a player of the opposite side. In all matches the duration of play is 1 hour 10 minutes, with an interval of 5 minutes after each 20 minutes play.

Owing to the expense of maintaining a specially trained stud of ponies and a prepared ground for the pastime, the pursuit of the game of polo has always been confined to the wealthier classes in England. Its chief supporters are the younger members of the aristocracy and the officers of British cavalry regiments.
