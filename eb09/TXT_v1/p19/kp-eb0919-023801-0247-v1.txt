PLYMOUTH, a township and village of the United States, the shire-town of Plymouth county, Massachusetts, and a port of entry on Cape Cod Bay,—the village lying at the terminus of a branch of the Old Colony Railroad, 37 miles south-south-east of Boston. The main interest of Plymouth is historical, and centres in the fact that it was the first settlement of the Pilgrim Fathers of New England, who landed December 21 (n. s.), 1620, on the rock now covered by a handsome granite canopy in Walter Street. Leyden Street, so called in memory of the Dutch town where the exiles had stopped for a season, is the oldest street in New England. The houses and general appearance of Plymouth are, however, thoroughly modern. Pilgrim Hall (which is built of granite and measures 70 feet long by 40 feet wide) was erected in 1824-25 by the Pilgrim Society constituted in 1820; it contains a public library and many relics of the fathers—including Miles Standish’s sword and Governor Carver’s chair. The corner stone of a national monument to the Pilgrims was laid August 1, 1859, on a high hill near the railroad station; 1500 tons of granite were used for the foundation; and a pedestal 45 feet high is surrounded by statues 20 feet high of Morality, Law, Education, and Freedom, and bears a colossal statue of Faith, 36 feet high, holding a Bible in her right hand (the largest granite statue in the world). Burying Hill was the site of the embattled church erected in 1622, and contains many ancient tombstones and the foundations of the watchtower (1643) now covered with sod. Cole’s Hill is the spot where half of the “Mayflower” Pilgrims found their rest during the first winter. Five of their graves were discovered in 1855 while pipes for the town water-works were being laid, and two more (now marked with a granite slab) in 1883. The bones of the first five are deposited in a compartment of the canopy over the “Forefathers’ Rock.” A town hall (1749), the county court-house, and the house of correction are the main public buildings of Plymouth. The population of the township was 4758 in 1830, 6024 in 1850, 6238 in 1870, 7093 in 1880, and 7500 in 1884. Manufactures of sailduck, cotton-cloth, tacks, nails, plate-iron, rolled zinc and copper rivets, hammers, <fcc., are carried on; the cordage factories are among the largest and most complete works of the kind in the world.
