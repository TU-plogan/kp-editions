PROME, a district in Pegu division, British Burmah, India, between 18° 30' and 19° 15' N. lat., and 94° 40' and 96° E. long., containing an area of 2887 square miles. It occupies the whole breadth of the valley of the Irawadi, between Thayet district on the north and Henzada and Tharawadi districts on the south, and originally extended as far as the frontier of the province of Burmah, but in 1870 Thayet was formed into an independent jurisdiction. There are two mountain ranges in Prome, which form respectively the eastern and western boundaries. The Arakan Yoma extends along the whole of the western side, and that portion of the district lying on the right bank of the Irawadi is broken up by thickly wooded spurs [9:19:807]

running in a south-easterly direction, the space for cultivation being but limited and confined to the parts adjacent to the river. On the eastern side lies the Pegu Yoma, and north and north-east of the district its forest-covered spurs form numerous valleys and ravines, the torrents from which unite in one large stream called the Na-weng river. The most important of the plains lie in the south and southwest portions of Prome, and extend along the whole length of the railway that runs between the towns of Poungdé and Prome; they are mostly under cultivation, and those in the south are watered by a series of streams forming the Myit-ma-kha or upper portion of the Hlaing. There are in addition large tracts of land covered by tree-jungle which are available for cultivation. The principal river is the Irawadi, which intersects the district from north to south; next in importance are the Tha-ni and its tributaries and the Na-weng system of rivers. In the hills near the capital the soil is of Tertiary formation, and in the plains it is of alluvial deposit. The climate is much drier than other districts in British Burmah. The total rainfall in 1882 was 49 ’ 64 inches.

In 1881 the population was 322,342 (161,433 males and 160,909 females). Buddhists and Jains numbered 313,261, Mohammedans 1795, Hindus 978, Christians 336, Aborigines 5818, and Parsees 5. More than two-thirds of the population are agriculturists. The chief towns are Prome (see below), and Shwedoung and Poungdé, with 12,373 and 6727 inhabitants respectively. The chief products are rice, teak, cutch, silk, sugar cane, cotton, tobacco, and sesame oil; but the staple product is rice, which is cultivated mainly in the Poungdé and Shwe-doung townships. The total area under cultivation in 1882 was 234,222 acres. One of the most important manufactures is silk; others are ornamental boxes, coarse brown sugar, and cutch. The gross revenue of the district in 1882 amounted to about £92,000, of which over a third was derived from the land.

The early history of the once flourishing kingdom of Prome, like that of the other states which now form portions of the province of British Burmah, is veiled in obscurity. Fact and fable are so interwoven that it is impossible to disentangle the true from the false. After the conquest of Pegu in 1758 by Aloung-bhùra, the founder of the third and present dynasty of Ava kings, Prome remained a province of the Burman kingdom till the close of the second Burmese war in 1853, when the province of Pegu was annexed to British territory.
