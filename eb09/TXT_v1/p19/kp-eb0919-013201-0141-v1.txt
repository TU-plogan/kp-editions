PITCAIRN, or Pitcairn’s Island, an island of the eastern Pacific, in 25° 4' N. lat. and 130° 8'W. long., may be considered as a member or appendage of the Paumotu, Tuamotu, Low, or Dangerous Archipelago, but is nearly 100 miles south of Oeno. It is not more than 3 miles long from east to west and about 2 miles broad. Unlike the other islands of this region it has no coral reef, but rises abruptly from the depths with steep and rugged cliffs of dark basaltic lava. There is no anchorage except on a bank at the west end; and even the best of its three landing places—Bounty Bay on the north coast—is dangerous from the violence of the surf and the existence of a strong undertow. The longer axis of the island is formed by a range of steep hills, attaining in Outlook Ridge a maximum height of 1008 feet. On a plateau about 400 feet above the sea lies the village of Adamstown, with its fields and gardens. The climate is variable and rainy, and snow sometimes falls on the mountains; but, as there are no springs or streamlets, drinking water is apt to grow scarce in a dry season. Vegetation is luxuriant. Neither the bread fruit nor the cocoa nut, introduced by the settlers, are fully successful; but the sweet potato, which forms their staple food, banana, yam, taro, pineapple, &c., produce abundantly. Com cannot be grown because of rats. The Pitcairn Islanders (not more than ninety in 1878), descended mainly from the mutineers of the “Bounty” and their Tahitian wives, are a healthy, virtuous, cheerful, and hospitable people, proud of their English blood, and grateful for the services rendered them from time to time by the English Government and private liberality.

Stone axes, remains of sculptured stone pillars similar to those of Rapanui (Easter Island), and skeletons with a pearl-mussel beneath their head, have been found in the island, and show that, though it was uninhabited when discovered by Carteret in 1767, it had previously been occupied. Pitcairn was the name of the midshipman who first descried it from the mast-head. On 28th April 1789 a mutiny broke out on board the “Bounty,” then employed by the English Government in conveying young breadfruit trees from Tahiti to the West Indies. The commander, Lieutenant Bligh (q.v.), was set adrift in the launch with a number of his officers and crew, but managed to make his way to Kupang in Timor (Dutch Indies). The mutineers, twenty-five in number, at first all returned to Tahiti. Of those who chose to be landed on that island, six were condemned to death by court-martial in England, and three of these were ultimately executed (1792). Two years earlier (1790) the other party (consisting of Fletcher Christian, the leader of the mutiny, eight other Englishmen, six Polynesian men, and twelve Polynesian women) had taken possession of Pitcairn and burned the “Bounty.” The beautiful island, which might have been a paradise, was soon turned into a little hell. Treachery, drunkenness, madness, and murder fill the first years of its annals. By 1800 all the men were dead except Alexander Smith (afterwards known as John Adams), whose endeavours to train up the youthful generation thus left in his sole charge were crowned with success. An American vessel, the “Topaze,” under Mayhew Folger, discovered the strange colony in 1808, and again, by accident, it was visited by the “Briton,” Captain Sir F. Staines, and the “Tagus,” Captain Pipon, in 1817. On the death of John Adams, 29th March 1829, George Hunn Nobbs, who, after an adventurous life had settled at Pitcairn in 1828, was appointed pastor and chief magistrate of the settlement. Through fear of drought the islanders, now numbering 87 persons, removed in 1830 to Tahiti, but neither the climate nor the morals of the place were such as they approved, and in 1831 they returned to their lonely island. Hardly had they settled into their old ways when Joshua Hill, a strange adventurer, rather crazy than criminal, appeared among them; claiming to be under Government authority, he tyrannized over them till his removal by an English man-of-war in 1838. In 1856 the whole population of Pitcairn—60 married persons and 134 young men, women, and children—were landed on Norfolk Island (q.v.); and the little island was again left to the occupancy of goats and cattle. In 1858, however, two men, William and Moses Young, chose to return with their families to their old homes, and their example was afterwards followed by a few others.
