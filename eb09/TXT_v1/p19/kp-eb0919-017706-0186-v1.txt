PLATAeA, or Plataeae, a celebrated city of ancient Greece, lay at the foot of the northern slope of Mount Cithaeron in Boeotia, about 6⅛ miles by road south of Thebes, or a little over 5 geographical miles in a direct line. Its territory was separated from that of Thebes by the river Asopus. The Thebans claimed to have founded Plataea, but, however this may have been, Plataea was always at feud with its more powerful neighbour. In 519 B.c. the Plataeans, being hard pressed by Thebes, applied for help to the Spartan king Cleomenes, who advised them to place themselves under the protection of Athens. They did so, and Athens and Plataea were thenceforward fast friends. It was perhaps on this occasion that the Plataeans were granted that restricted citizenship of Athens which we know that they enjoyed at a later time. When Athens faced the Persians alone at Marathon, the Plataeans to a man marched out to their help and shared in the victory (490 b.c.). From that day the names of Athens and Plataea were always associated in solemn prayers at Athens. Though dwellers in an inland town, and therefore ignorant of seamanship, the Plataeans helped to man the Athenian ships at the sea fight with the Persians off Artemisium (480). In revenge the Persians burned Plataea. The great battle of Plataea, which finally secured the freedom of Greece against the Persians, was fought ou the uneven and broken ground to the east and north of the town (September 479). After the battle the Greeks declared the city and territory of Plataea to be independent and inviolable. The Plataeans undertook to bring annual offerings of food and raiment to the graves of those who had fallen in the battle; and a festival of liberation (Eleutheria) was celebrated every fifth year. These offerings continued to be brought, and the festival to be held, as late as the 2d century of our era. With the spoils of the Persian wars the Plataeans raised a temple of Athene the Warlike.^[1. It was built, according to Plutarch (zlrtsi. 20), after the battle of Plataea; according to Pausanias (ix. 4, 1), after the battle of Marathon.] The Peloponnesian War began with an attempt of the Thebans to seize Plataea (431 b,c.). The attempt failed, but in 427, after a siege of about two years, the city was taken by the Peloponnesians and the garrison put to the sword. The bulk of the population had previously taken refuge in Athens. A year afterwards the Thebans razed the city to the 'ground, aud built a large hospice close to the old temple of Hera, to whom they erected a new temple 100 feet long. In 421 the surviving Plataeans received from the Athenians the town of Scioue in Macedonia as a residence, but they had uo doubt to quit it at the end of the war (404). When the peace of Antalcidas was concluded between Greece and Persia (387) Plataea was restored, but a few years afterwards it was surprised and destroyed, except the temples, by the Thebans (about 373). The Plataeans were again received [9:19:178] at Athens, where they were now admitted to full citizenship, except that they were not eligible for the priesthood and the archonship. After the battle of Chaeronea (338) Philip of Macedon brought back the Plataeans as a counterpoise to the power of Thebes, but the walls were not fully restored till some years later. Alexander the Great, then monarch of Asia, contributed to rebuild them, in recognition, he declared, of the services which the Plataeans had rendered against the Persians of old. With the loss of Greek freedom Plataea sank into insignificance. The inhabitants lived on the glories of the past, and were regarded as braggarts by the rest of the Boeotians. In the 6th century the walls were once more restored by Justinian.

The fullest description of ancient Plataea is that of Pausanias, who visited it in the 2d century. The great temple of Hera, he tells us, contained a statue of Rhea by Praxiteles; the temple of Athene the Warlike was adorned with an image of the goddess by Phidias and paintings by Polygnotus. Close to the city gates were the tombs of the Greeks who had fallen in the battle of Plataea, and an altar and image of Zeus the Liberator in white marble. The ruins of the ancient town lie about 500 yards east of the modern village of Kokhla. They occupy a slightly elevated plateau forming a rude triangle about two and a half miles in circumference, of which the apex to the south almost touches the great rocky slope of Cithaeron, and the base to the north has a steep though short descent to the plain. The outer walls follow the edge of the plateau, but an inner cross-wall divides it into two unequal parts. The southern and higher part is probably as old as the Persian wars; the masonry of the northern part is more recent, and probably belongs to the age of Philip and Alexander. It is likely that these two parts were never included at the same time within the city λvalls, but that the southern was the ancient city, and that at one of the restorations (perhaps that of 387 b.c. ) the northern and more spacious part of the plateau was preferred as the site. Within this northern half, and close to the northern wall, is a terrace on which may have stood the temple of Hera. The north-western corner of the northern town is portioned off by a wall, and is conjectured to have been the acropolis of the newer city.
