POLYGLOTT. A polyglott is a book which contains side by side versions of the same text in several different languages; and the most important polyglotte are editions of the Bible, or its parts, in which the Hebrew and Greek originals are exhibited along with the great historical versions, which are of value for the history of the text and its interpretation. The first enterprise of this kind is the famous Hexapla of Origen: but here only Hebrew and

Greek were employed (though the versions of Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion were shown as well as the Septuagint), so that the work was rather diglott than polyglott in the usual sense. After the invention of printing and the revival of philological studies, polyglotte became a favourite means of advancing the knowledge of Eastern languages (for which no good helps were available) as well as the study of Scripture. The series began with the Complutensian (Alcala, 1514-17), already spoken of in the article on its promoter Cardinal Jimenes or Ximenes; next came the Antwerp Polyglott (1569-72, in 8 vols, folio) of which the principal editor was Arias Montanus aided by Guido Fabricius Boderianus, Raphelengius, Masius, Lucas of Bruges, and others. This work was under the patronage of Philip II. of Spain; it added a new language to those of the Complutensian by including the Syriac New Testament; and, while the earlier polyglott had only the Targum of Onkelos on the Pentateuch, the Antwerp Bible had also the Targum on the Prophets, and on Esther, Job, Psalms, and the Salomonie writings. Next came Le Jay’s Paris Polyglott (1645), which embraces the first prints of the Syriac Old Testament (edited by Gabriel Sionita, a Maronite, but the book of Ruth by Abraham Ecchelensis, also a Maronite) and of the Samaritan Pentateuch and version (by Morinus, q.v.'). It has also an Arabic version, or rather a series of various Arabic versions. Le Jay’s work is a splendid piece of typography, but its success was marred by the appearance of the cheaper and more comprehensive London Polyglott. Le Jay was ruined, and a great part of the impression went to the trunkmakers. The last great polyglott is Walton’s (London, 1657), which is much less beautiful than Le Jay’s, but more complete in various ways, including among other things the Syriac of Esther and several apocryphal books for which it is wanting in the Paris Bible, Persian versions of the Pentateuch and Gospels, the Psalms and New Testament in Ethiopie. Walton was aided by able scholars, and used much new manuscript material. His prolegomena, too, and collections of various readings mark an important advance in Biblical criticism. It was in connexion with this polyglott that E. Castle produced his famous Heptaglott Lexicon (London, 2 vols, folio, 1669), an astounding monument of industry and erudition even when allowance is made for the fact that for the Arabic he had the great MS. lexicon compiled and left to the university of Cambridge by the almost forgotten W. Bedwell. The later polyglotts are of little scientific importance, the best recent texts having been confined to a single language; but every Biblical student still uses Walton and, if he can get it, Le Jay. Of the numerous polyglotts on parts of the Bible it may suffice to mention the Genoa psalter of 1516, edited by Giustiniani, bishop of Nebbio. It is in Hebrew, Latin, Greek, Chaldee, and Arabic, and is interesting from the character of the Chaldee text, from being the first specimen of Western printing in the Arabic character, and from a curious note on Columbus and the discovery of America on the margin of Psalm xix.
