PRESCOT, a market-town of Lancashire, is situated on rising ground on the Liverpool and Wigan branch of the London and North-Western Railway, 8 miles east of Liverpool and 28 west of Manchester. It is of considerable antiquity, and received a grant for a market and fair in the 7th year of Edward III. A church existed in the 13th century. The present edifice, in various styles, with a lofty tower and spire and carved timber roof, underwent extensive restoration in 1875-76. Among the other public buildings are the town-hall (1765) and the market-hall (1859). The chief industry is the making of watch hands and wheels, <fcc,, first introduced in 1730 by John Miller from Yorkshire. Coarse earthenware is also manufactured. The population of the urban sanitary district (area, 268 acres) in 1871 was 5990, and in 1881 it was 6419.
