PRIM, Juan, Marquis de los Castillejos, Count de Reuss (1814-1870), Spanish soldier and statesman, was the son of Lieutenant-Colonel Pablo Prim, and was bom at Reuss in Catalonia on 12th December 1814. He entered the free corps known as the volunteers of Isabella II. in 1834 and greatly distinguished himself throughout the Carlist War, in the course of which he rose to the rank of lieutenant-colonel and had two orders of knighthood conferred upon him. After the pacification of 1839 he entered political life, and as a progressist opposed to the dictatorship of Espartero he was sent into exile. However, in 1843 he was elected deputy for Tarragona and issued a pronunciamento against Espartero at Reuss; and after defeating Espartero at Bruch he entered Madrid in triumph with Serrano. The regent Maria Christina recognized his services, promoted him to the rank of majorgeneral, and made him count of Reuss. Prim now looked forward to peace under a settled constitutional monarchy, but Narvaez, the prime minister, failed to understand what constitutional freedom meant, and Prim, on showing signs of opposition, was sentenced to six years’ imprisonment in the Philippine Islands. The sentence was not carried out, and Prim remained an exile in England and France until the amnesty of 1847. He then returned to Spain, but kept aloof from politics, and was first employed as captaingeneral of Porto Rico and afterwards as military representative of Spain with the sultan during the Crimean War. In 1854 he returned to Spain on being elected to the cortes, and gave his support to O'Donnell, who promoted him to be lieutenant-general in 1856. In the war with Morocco, at the head of his division, he did such good service at Los Castillejos or Marabout, Cabo Negro, Guad al Gelu, and Campamento in 1860 that he was made marquis de los Castillejos and a grandee of Spain. He next commanded the Spanish expeditionary army in Mexico, when he acted in exact accordance with the treaty of London and refused to consent to the ambitious schemes of Napoleon III. On his return to Spain he joined the opposition, heading pronunciamentos in Catalonia against Narvaez and O’Donnell. All his attempts failed until the death of Narvaez in April 1868, after which Queen Isabella fell more and more under the influence of the J esuits, and became increasingly tyrannical, until at last even Serrano was exiled, and more than 10,000 persons, includ- [9:19:733]

îng every journalist of position, were in prison. In September 1868 Serrano and Prim returned, and Admiral Topete, commanding the fleet, raised the standard of revolt at Cadiz. For the public events of the subsequent ten months the reader is referred to the article Spain. In July 1869 Serrano was elected regent, and Prim became president of the council and was made a marshal. On 16th November 1870 Amadeo, duke of Aosta, was elected king of Spain, but Prim was not destined to receive the new monarch, for on leaving the chamber of the cortes on 28th December he was shot by unknown assassins and died two days later. The cortes at once declared that he had deserved well of his native land, and took his children as wards of the country; three days afterwards King Amadeo I. swore in the presence of the corpse to observe the new Spanish constitution.

Two biographies of Prim down to 1860 were published in that year by Gimenez y Guited and Gonzalez Llanos; see also L. Blairet, Le Général Prim et la situation actuelle de l’Espagne, Paris, 1867, and Guillaumot, Juan Prim et l'Espagne, Paris, 1870.
