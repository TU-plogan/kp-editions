POLLACK (Gadus pollachius), a species of cod-fish, abundant on rocky coasts of northern Europe, and extending as far south as the western parts of the Mediterranean, where, however, it is much scarcer and does not attain to the same size as in its real northern home. In Scotland and some parts of Ireland it is called Lythe. It is distinguished from other species of the genus Gadus by its long pointed snout, which is twice as long as the eye, with projecting lower jaw, and without a barbel at the chin. The three dorsal fins are composed of respectively 12, 18 or 20, and from 17 to 19 rays, and the two anal fins of 31 and 19 or 20. A black spot above the base of the pectoral fin is another distinguishing mark. Although pollack are well-flavoured fish, and smaller individuals (from 12 to 16 inches) excellent eating, they do not form any considerable article of trade, and are not preserved, the majority being consumed by the captors. Specimens of twelve pounds are common, but the species is said to attain 24 pounds in weight.
