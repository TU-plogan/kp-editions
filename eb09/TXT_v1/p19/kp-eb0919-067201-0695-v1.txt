PRENZLAU, or Prenzlow, a town of Prussia, in the province of Brandenburg, lies on the lower Ucker See, 60 miles north by east of Berlin and 30 miles west by south of Stettin. It is a busy little place with various branches of industry, among the chief of which are wool cleaning and spinning, iron-founding, and sugar-refining. A good deal of tobacco is grown in the neighbourhood, and there is a cigar manufactory in the town. A brisk trade is carried on also in cattle and grain. The Gothic church of the Virgin, dating from 1340, is one of the finest churches in the district, and the remains of the old town gates and walls are also interesting. In 1880 Prenzlau contained 16,933 inhabitants, nearly all Protestants and many of French descent. The garrison consists of about 800 men.

Prenzlau is first mentioned in a document of the close of the 12th century, and received its municipal charter in 1235. As the capital of the old Ucker mark it was a frequent object of dispute between Pomerania and Brandenburg until finally incorporated with the latter about 1480. It was at Prenzlau that Prince Hohenlohe, with his corps of 12,000 men, surrendered to Murat on the retreat after the battle of Jena.
