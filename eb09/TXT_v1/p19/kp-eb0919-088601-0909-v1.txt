PROVINS, a town of France, at the head of an arrondissement of the department of Seine-et-Marne, at the junction of the Durtain with the Voulzie (an affluent of the Seine), 59 miles south-east of Paris by a branch railway which rejoins the main line from Paris to Belfort at Longueville (4 miles from Provins). While the town derives a certain reputation from its mineral waters (which contain iron, lime, and carbonic acid, and are used for bathing and drinking), and is also known from its trade in roses (incorrectly called Provence roses) for certain minor industries (such as the making of “conserves” and colouring bonbons), a far higher interest attaches to it as a place which during the Middle Ages enjoyed great prosperity and still preserves, in proof of its former import? ance, a number of historical monuments. There still remains a great part of the 13th-century line of fortifications, which makes a circuit of about 4 miles, encloses an area of about 300 acres, ⅛ strengthened at intervals by towers, generally round, and now, being bordered with fine trees, forms the principal promenade of the town. The large tower, situated within this line and variously known as the king’s, Caesar’s, or the prisoners’ tower, is one of the most curious of the 12th-century keeps now extant. The base is surrounded by a thick mound of masonry added by the English in the 15th century when they were masters of the town. The tower serves as steeple to the church of St Quiriace, which, dating its foundation from the 12th century, presents some exquisite features and preserves among its treasures the pontifical ornaments of St Edmund of Canterbury. The palace of the counts of Champagne, some fragments of which also belong to the 12th century, is occupied by the communal college. The old tithe-barn is a strange erection of the 13th century with noteworthy fireplaces, windows, and vaulting. Various portions of the church of St Ayoul date from the 11 th, 13th, 14th, and 16th centuries respectively; but it is in a state of great dilapidation, and part of it is used as a fodder-store. Ste Croix belongs partially to the 13th century. On Mont Ste Catherine opposite Provins the general hospital occupies the site of an old convent of St Clare, of which there remains a cloister of the 13th century. The population of the town in 1881 was 6949.

Provins begins to figure in history in the 9th century. Passing from the counts of Vermandois to the counts of Champagne it rapidly attained a high degree of prosperity. Its fairs, attended by traders from all parts of Europe, were of as much account as those of Beaucaire. They were held twice a year, in spring and autumn, and fixed the price of provisions for the intervening months. In the 13th century the population of the town is said to have reached 60,000; but the plague of 1348 and the famine of 1349 proved exceedingly disastrous. The War of the Hundred Years, during which Provins was captured and recaptured, completed the ruin of the unfortunate town. During the religious wars it sided with the Catholic party and the League, and Henry IV. obtained possession of it in 1592 only after thirteen days’ siege.
