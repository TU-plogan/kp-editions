PORTUGAL PART I,—GEOGRAPHY AND STATISTICS.

THE kingdom of Portugal, which is geographically a province of the Iberian Peninsula on its west coast, is bounded on the N. by the Spanish province of Galicia, on the E. by the Spanish provinces of Leon, Estremadura, and Andalusia, and on the S. and W. by the Atlantic Ocean. It lies between 36° 56' and 42° 10' N. lat. and 6° 15' and 9° 30' W. long. It is 362 miles in length by 140 in breadth, and contained by the latest (1878) computation^[1. Strelbitsky, Superficie de ΓEurope, 1882.] 34,419^ square miles. Its coast-line is nearly 500 miles in length, and only one province, Tras-os-Montes, is not washed by the sea. On the extreme north the coast is low, but farther south it becomes rocky and steep for a few miles near Povoa de Varzim. From that town to Cape Carboeiro the coast of Beira is flat, sandy, and marshy, closely resembling the French Landes; after another stretch of dunes it again becomes steep and rugged from Cape Roca to Cape Espichel, and along the northern side of the Bay of Setubal, and then remains low throughout the rest of the coast-line of Estremadura (Portuguese). In Alemtejo the coast is low and in places rocky and full of shallows; and, although at Cape St Vincent the cliffs are steep and inaccessible, the general coast-line of Algarves, the southernmost province of Portugal, is low and sandy. The chief capes, which form the only cliff’s on the otherwise flat and sandy coast, are Cape Mondego, Cape Carboeiro, Cape Roca, Cape Espichel, Cape Sines, Cape St Vincent, and Cape Santa Maria, and the chief bays are those of Figueira, Ericeira, Setubal, and Sines. The only islands off the coast are the dangerous Farilhδes and the Berlengas off Cape Carboeiro, which would be uninhabited but for an old castle, now used as a prison, on the largest island of the latter group.

The mountain-systems of Portugal can only be adequately treated under Spain (<7.v.), as they are in every instance continuations to the west or south-west of the great Spanish ranges. Thus the mountains of the Cantabrian Pyrenees in Galicia spread themselves over the two northern provinces of Portugal, Entre Minho e Douro and Tras-os-Montes, in various short ranges, of which the most important are the Serra do Gerez (4815 feet) and the Serra de Marào (4665 feet), the latter extending down the left bank of the Tameja and sheltering the wine-districts of Tras-os-Montes from the east winds. In Beira the granite Serra da Estrella (6540 feet), the loftiest range in Portugal, forms part of the system of the Guadarramas and a continuation of the Sierra de Gata, and terminates in the Serra de Lousâo (3940 feet), while the chalk mountains in the south of the province, such as the Monte Junto near Santarem (2185 feet) and the Serra de Cintra, which runs into the sea at Cape Roca, belong to a different geological period. The chalk mountains of the Serra de Arrabida (1537 feet) to the south of the Tagus correspond with the Serra de Cintra, and form Cape Espichel; but the other low ranges to the south of the river in Alemtejo, such as the Serra de San Mamede (3363 feet) and the Serra de Ossa (2130 feet), belong to the system of the mountains of Toledo. The continuation of the Sierra Morena, which separates Algarves from the rest of Portugal, forms various small ranges and isolated mountains, such as the Serra do Malhäo (1886 feet) and Monte Figo, and then closes with the Serra de Monchique (2963 feet) and runs into the sea in the steep cliffs of Cape St Vincent.

The river-system of Portugal is also merely a portion of that of Spain. Its three most important rivers, the

Douro, the Tagus, and the Guadiana, all rise in Spain and flow through that country; but they all enter the sea in Portugal, and at the mouths of the Douro and the Tagus are situated the two most important cities of the kingdom, Oporto and Lisbon. The chief Portuguese tributaries of the Douro are the Tameja, the Tua, and the Sabor on the north, and the Agueda, the Coa, and the Paiva on the south; of the Tagus, the Elja, the Ponsul, and the Zezere on the north, and the Niza, the Sorraya, and the Canha on the south; while into the Guadiana, on its right or Portuguese bank, flow the Caia, the Oeiras, and the Vascâo. The other important rivers are the Minho, which forms the boundary of Portugal and Galicia in the lower part of its course, the Limia, the Cavado, the Vouga, and the Mondego to the north of the Tagus, and the Sado, the Mira, the Odelouca, and the Silves to the south of it. Important as are the rivers of Portugal, it has no inland lakes worthy of mention, though it abounds in hot and other medicinal springs, such as the Caldas de Monchique; and beautiful little mountain-lakes are numerous on the tops of the Serra da Estrella.

The climate of Portugal is particularly equable and temperate, and its salubrious qualities were recognized by the English doctors of the 18th century, who used to send many patients to winter there, including Fielding the novelist; and, though Portugal has been superseded as a winter resort by the Riviera and Algiers, there are signs that it may again become a European health-resort of the first importance. To prove the temperate nature of the climate it is not enough to state that the average mean temperatures of Lisbon, Coimbra, and Oporto are 61° *3, 61° - 1, and 60 o, 2 Fahr, respectively; more instructive is it to mention that the mean average temperature foi' the month of January is only 50° ’ 2 at both Coimbra and Oporto, and for July only 69° - 4 and 70° - 3 for the same two cities, showing a difference between summer and winter of about 20°. This equability of temperature is partly caused by the very heavy rainfall which is precipitated on Portugal as one of the most westerly kingdoms of Europe and one most exposed to the Atlantic, and which has reached as much as 16 feet in a year; but it is noticeable that this heavy rainfall comes down in gradual showers spread over the whole year, and not in the torrents of the tropics. This great humidity has its drawbacks as well as its advantages, for, though it makes the soil rich, it produces also heavy fogs, which render the Portuguese coast exceedingly dangerous to ships. This charming climate and equability of temperature are not, however, universal in Portugal; they are to be enjoyed mainly in the highlands of Beira, Estremadura, and in the northern provinces, especially at Cintra and Coimbra. In the deep valleys, even of those favoured provinces where the mountains keep off the cool winds, it is excessively hot in summer; while on the summits of the mountains snow lies for many months, and it is often extraordinarily cold. Even in Lisbon itself the temperature, though its mean is only the same as that of Coimbra, varies from 38° 'l in January to 90° ’ 6 Fahr, in July, a difference of more than 50°. In Alemtejo the climate is very unfavourable, and, though the heat is not so great as in Algarves, the country presents a far more deserted and African appearance, while in winter, when heavy rains swell the Tagus and make it overflow its banks, damp unhealthy swamps are left, which breed malaria. Notwithstanding that Algarves is hotter than Alemtejo, and [9:19:537] the climate there very sultry owing to the sea-breezes being intercepted by the Serra de Monchique and other mountains, a profuse vegetation takes away much of the tropical effect, so that it is a far shadier and more agreeable province than Alemtejo. Although such a rainy country, Portugal is very rarely visited by thunderstorms; but, on the other hand, shocks of earthquake are frequently felt, and recall the great earthquake of Lisbon in 1755.

The geology, flora, and fauna of Portugal are essentially the same as those of Spain, and will be studied under Spain (<∕.t>.).

Population.— The population of Portugal, according to the census of 1st January 1878, was 4,160,315, and in 1881 it was calculated to be 4,306,554, or 125 persons to the square mile. The following is a table of the populations of the different provinces and districts according to the census of 1878 and the official estimate of 1881 :—
[table]

According to the census of 1878 the following towns had a population of more than 10,000 each:—Lisbon, 246,343; Oporto, 105,838; Braga, 19,755; Setubal, 14,798; Loulé, 14,448; Coimbra, 13,369; Evora, 13,046; Tavira, 11,459; Covilha, 10,809; Elvas, 10,471; Povöa de Varzim, 10,365; Ovar, 10,022.

The ethnological composition of the population is most mixed: in the two northern provinces the population is essentially Galician, but farther south the mixture becomes obvious; not only did the conquering Portuguese largely intermarry with the Arabs, but in the places where they exterminated them they replaced them by colonies of crusaders of all nations, chiefly French, English, Dutch, and Frisian, who have left their mark on the features and character of the nation, and they also largely intermarried with the Jews. No Jews were so wealthy or so cultivated as those of Portugal, who, though for many centuries keeping strictly apart from the Christians, yet after their forced conversion or expulsion by King Emmanuel largely intermarried, especially with the people of Lisbon. Farther south an African physiognomy appears, derived from the thousands of negro slaves imported to till Alemtejo and Algarves, from the days of Dorn Henry till the decline of the Portuguese power.

Emigration is thinning the population, or rather keeping it from rapidly increasing; and the following are the results of the statistics published by the Royal Geographical Society of Lisbon for 1872-81. There emigrated in the ten years between 1871 and 1881 from Entre Minho e Douro 51,531 persons, from Tras-os-Montes 7799, from Beira 31,437, from Estremadura 12,769, from Alemtejo 42, from Algarves 225, from the Azores 22,794, from Madeira 6410, making a grand total of 133,007. Of these emigrants 129,549 were bound for America, the whole number in all probability for the Brazils,

3348 for the Portuguese colonies in Africa, and 95 for Asia. It will be noticed that the majority of these emigrants come from the wealthy northern provinces and the sober population of Entre Minho e Douro, while the number from the fever-stricken Alemtejo is practically nil.

Colonies. — See Azores, Cape Verd Islands, Goa, Macao, Madeira, Mozambique, and Colony (vol. vi. p. 161).

Commerce. — The commerce of Portugal has not rapidly, though it has steadily, increased during the last thirty years; the chief countries with which it trades are, in order of value, England and her colonies, Brazil, the United States, France, and Spain; but it is hardly fair to mention commerce with Spain, because the large amount of smuggling $hich takes place makes it impossible to estimate the real amount of trade between the two countries. The following table of exports and imports in nineteen classes, compiled by Mr George Brackenbury, British consul at Lisbon, dated 24th April 1884, is published in the Consular Reports for 1884, and contains the latest information on Portuguese trade and commerce. It will be noticed that the chief imports are bread-stuffs, metals, cottons, and minerals, and the chief exports fermented liquors, live stock (which is nearly all sent to England), and timber.
[table]

Agriculture.— The state of agriculture in Portugal is still deplorable; the wealth and energy of the country have been thrown into the wine trade, and the production and cultivation of cereals have been so much neglected that, in spite of its being eminently adapted for such cultivation, nearly all its cereals are imported from the United States, to the value in 1883 of over £1,000,000. The wine production, on which Portugal has so long depended, was the work of the Methuen treaty of 1703, for it was not until after that treaty that the barren rocks of the Alto Douro were covered with vines. But now, though the returns show slight alteration, there must soon be a great change. The phylloxera has utterly destroyed thousands of vineyards in Entre Minho e Douro and in Beira. The labours of the phylloxera commission seem unable to check its ravages;^[4. See Consul Crawfurd’s Report, Oporto, 1884.] the commissioners themselves are hindered by the people,—an inspector having been even shot at in the district of Riguengo.^[5. Mr Baring’s Report.] The reason why no great alteration is to be perceived in the returns is that the great Oporto shippers have such vast stocks that it may be years before the want comes to be felt. To remedy the failure, which can be only a matter of time, tobacco-growing has been proposed (see Consul Crawfurd’s Report}, and will probably be tried in place of vine-culture. Portugal has lately become a great exporter of live stock to England, as also of large quantities of fruits and early vegetables, including oranges (especially from Condeixa), lemons, limes, peaches (from Amarante), and the celebrated Elvas plums. The difference in the character of the inhabitants of different provinces is well shown by the fact that in the north the peasant not only tends his vines but in many instances rears silkworms and even possesses olive trees, while in Alemtejo he is content to live upon chestnuts and to take care of his pigs and goats.

Manufactures.— Nothing proves more decidedly the agricultural character of the Portuguese than the repeated failures to establish manufactures among them. This has often been ascribed to the provision respecting the importation of English goods in the Methuen treaty; but not all the efforts of Pombal or of the modern protectionist cabinets have been able to establish any important manufactures. The following table, extracted from Consul Brackenbury’s Report, gives a list of the chief establishments—for manufactories[9:19:538] they can hardly be called—in Portugal, with the number of workmen and the value of the products.
[table]

Some of these establishments ought to be more successful, for the glass-works of Leiria, the lace-works of Vianna and Peniche, and the potteries of Aveiro had an immense reputation in the 18th century, which they have now lost, as the table clearly shows. Portugal possesses plenty of mineral wealth, though not so much as Spain, but from want of capital and enterprise such resources as exist are neglected. A very few of the chief mines may be noted—the lead-mines of Coimbra, one of antimony near Oporto, and above all the very important copper-mines of San Domingos near Beja, worked by an English company, which contributed thirteeu-sixteenths of the total exports of minerals in the six months between January and June 1883. Of greater importance are the fisheries,—the fishermen both of Beira and Algarves being famous for their courage; and large quantities of sardines and preserved tunny fish are exported to Italy and France, and an even larger quantity of oysters to England.

Finance. — The revenue of Portugal has for many years ceased to balance its expenditure, and the deficit has had to be met by borrowing, but it is only fair to remark that vigorous attempts have been made to reduce the expenditure of recent years. The estimated revenue for 1883-84 and 1884-85 was classified under six heads.
[table]

A few of the sub-heads which help to swell these various classes of revenue are worth detailing.
[table]

The last item deserves particular notice, as it proves the confused manner in which Portuguese financiers keep their accounts; they prefer to pay into their treasury interest on bonds held by it, instead of extinguishing that amount of the national debt.

Against this revenue must be set the expenditure (which always exceeds it), causing a deficit of £194,141 on the ordinary balance-sheet, and of £1,558,142 when the extraordinary expenditure is taken into account, in 1884-85. The chief items in the estimates for that year compared with the estimates for 1883-84 are—
[table]

Under the head of the “ministry of finance” there was an estimated sum of £600,367 in 1883-84 and of £672,202 in 1884-85 for interest of debt, which in any other system of finance would have been put down to the head of “public debt.” The extraordinary expenditure was estimated to amount to £1,364,000 in 1884-85, the chief items of which were for the ministry of public works, chiefly spent on the fortifications of Lisbon, and for the minister of the colonies, for in only two colonies—Cape Verd Islands and Macao—do the colonial revenues meet their expenditure, the mothercountry having to afford substantial help to her African colonies every year. The estimated balance-sheet for 1884-85 was—
[table]

It is very difficult to give any exact estimate of the extent of the public debt of Portugal owing to the financial confusions noted above, but on 30th June 1883 it was estimated at £96,175,692, namely—
[table]

but of this amount the treasury holds about £8,000,000.

Government.— The government of Portugal is an hereditary and constitutional monarchy, exercised under the charter of 1826, as modified in 1852 and 1878, under which the king is charged with the executive and shares the power of making laws with two chambers. His civil list amounts to £144,000 a year, and he is advised in all matters of administration and assisted in nominating peers by a council of state appointed for life, but depends for advice in legislative and executive matters on a cabinet of seven members selected from the chambers by a premier, summoned by the king. The House of Peers consists of 150 members nominated by the king for life, and contains many of the most eminent professors and authors, as well as men of wealth, and additions may be made to its number by the king on the advice of the premier, with the consent of the council of state. All the members of the House of Peers do not possess titles, nor do all titled persons belong to the House of Peers; legislation and the titular and hereditary aristocracy are kept quite apart. The House of Deputies consists of 173 members, elected directly by all male citizens of twenty-five years of age, either paying in direct taxes 4s. 6d. a year, or deriving an annual income of 22s. from real estate, while all graduates, priests, officers, and certified teachers have votes without further qualification. The president of the chamber is selected by the king out of five elected candidates, and the deputies are paid. The Azores and Madeira elect members to the House at Lisbon. For administrative purposes Portugal is divided into seventeen districts, for judicial purposes into twenty-six districts or “comarcas,” with appeal courts at Lisbon and Oporto, and a supreme court at Lisbon, and for military purposes into four divisions. The Roman Catholic is the state religion, but others are tolerated, and the power of the priests has been greatly checked by the wholesale suppression of monasteries in 1834. The church in Portugal is governed by a patriarch at Lisbon, two archbishops at Braga and Evora, and fourteen bishops, of whom the most important is the bishop of Oporto. For purposes of local government the districts are under the rule of civil governors, who have much the same powers as prefects in France, while in the 292 “concelhos,” or administrative councils, there are elected councillors, and in the 3960 “freguezias” or parishes the villagers elect a magistrate, who has the same powers as an English justice of the peace.

Army and Navy.— Under a decree dated 19th May 1884 the Portuguese army has been reorganized. The effective war strength is to be maintained at 120,000 men. The term of service is for 12 [9:19:539] years, of which 3 are to be with the colours, 5 in the first reserve, and 4 in the second reserve. The force is divided into 36 regiments of infantry, 10 regiments of cavalry, 4 regiments, 1 brigade, and 4 companies of artillery, and 1 regiment of engineers. In 1883, under the old regulations, the army contained 41 general officers; its effective strength in time of peace was 33,231 men with 1643 officers, and on a war footing 75,336 men with 2688 officers. For colonial service there is one regiment of 1143 soldiers and 50 officers divided into 3 battalions, of which one is always stationed at Goa and another at Macao. The officers are trained in the military academy at Lisbon, and there is an asylum for the sons of soldiers. The navy is no longer the power it used to be, but, though small, it is equipped in modern fashion and furnished by the naval arsenal at Lisbon. It consisted in 1884 of 30 steam-ships, of which one was an armoured corvette mounting 7 guns, and 5 others corvettes mounting 46 guns, and of 14 sailing ships, of which one was a frigate mounting 19 guns. Its personnel consisted of 283 officers and 3235 sailors.

Public Instruction.— The public instruction of Portugal is regulated by the law of 1844, which enacted that all children should be bound to attend a primary school, if there was one within a mile, from the age of seven to fifteen, under penalty to the parents of a fine and deprivation of civil rights. Under this law there were in Portugal, in 1874, 2649 primary schools with 122,004 pupils of both sexes. Secondary education is not neglected, and under the same law of 1844 17 lycées have been established in the seventeen continental districts, and from them it is possible for a pupil to enter either the university of Coimbra, which during the present century has recovered some of its ancient lustre, or the special schools. These special schools are very ably conducted, and modern Portuguese policy gives, as we have seen, a higher status to teachers and professors of all grades than they obtain in most other countries. The most important of these schools are the polytechnic school at Lisbon, the polytechnic academy at Oporto, the medical schools and industrial institutes in both these cities, the institute-general of agriculture, the royal and marine observatories, and the academy of fine arts—all four at Lisbon. The valuable public libraries of Lisbon, Evora, Villa Real, and Braga, supported by the state, and in addition the free library at Oporto, ought also to be mentioned, as well as the archives at the Torre del Tombo, with which a school of palaeography and diplomacy has lately been connected.

Public Works.— On 1st January 1884 there were 1245 miles of railway open (944) and in course of construction (301), also 50 miles of tramways were open, and 2900 miles of telegraph were in operation; and every recent loan has been raised for the purpose of extending these important public works. The chief lines of railway open are those from Lisbon to Valencia de Alcantara, and thence by Talavera to Madrid, and from Lisbon to Oporto, Tua, Nine, and Braga, while the line to Faro, which is to connect Algarves with the capital, has been already extended beyond Beja as far as Casevel. There is also an alternative line to Madrid open through El vas and Badajoz, which connects Lisbon with the Andalusian system and gives a short route to Seville, Cadiz, and Malaga. As to smaller lines opening up Beira, the line from Figueira da Foz to Villar Formosa through Celorico and Guarda is completed, and one is projected parallel to the Lisbon-Oporto line from Villar Formosa to Alcantara on the south, which is to be connected with Oporto through Tua towards the west. The telegraph system is already very complete, and the last touch has been put to it by laying down a submarine cable from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro, binding the mother-country still more closely with what was once her greatest colony, (H. Μ. S.)

PART II.—HISTORY.

It has been stated that geographically the kingdom of Portugal is an integral part of the Iberian Peninsula; the only reason why it has retained its independence, while the other mediaeval states of that peninsula have merged into the kingdom of Spain, is to be found in its history. When Philip II. of Spain annexed Portugal it was a century too late for it to coalesce with Spain. It had then produced Vasco de Gama and Affonso de Albuquerque, and its language had been developed from a Romance dialect into a literary language by Camoens and Sâ de Miranda. Conscious of its national history, it broke away again from Spain in 1640, and under the close alliance of England maintained its separate and national existence during the 18th century. A union with Spain might have been possible, however, during the first half of the present century had not a generation of historians and poets arisen, who, by recalling the great days of the Portuguese monarchy, have made it impossible for Portugal ever again to lose the consciousness of her national existence.

The history of Portugal really begins with the gift of the fief of the Terra Portucalensis or the county of Porto Cale to Count Henry of Burgundy in 1094; for any attempt to identify the kingdom of Portugal and the Portuguese people with Lusitania and the Lusitanians is utterly without foundation. With the rest of the Iberian Peninsula, Portugal was colonized by the Phoenicians and conquered by the Carthaginians; and the Roman province of Lusitania, whether according to the division of Iberia into three provinces under Augustus or into five under Hadrian, in no way coincided with the historical limits of the kingdom of Portugal. In common with the rest of the Peninsula, it was overrun by the Vandals, Alans, and Visigoths, and eventually conquered by the Arabs in the 8th century. It was not until the 15th century that an attempt was made by Garcia de Menezes to identify Lusitania with Portugal. Under the influence of the Renaissance, Bernardo de Brito insisted on the identity, and claimed Viriathus as a Portuguese hero. Other writers of the same epoch delighted in calling Portugal by the classical name of “Lusitania,” and Camoens, by the very title of his great epic, Os Lusiadas, has immortalized the appellation.

For two centuries Portugal remained subject to the Omayyad caliphs, and under their wise rule the old Roman coloniae and municipia, such as Lisbon, Lamego, Visen, and Oporto, maintained their Roman self-government and increased in wealth and importance. Towards the close of the 10th century, as the Omayyad caliphate grew weaker, the Christian princes of Visigothic descent who dwelt in the mountains of the Asturias began to grow more audacious in their attacks on the declining power, and in 997 Bermudo II., king of Galicia, won back the first portion of modern Portugal from the Mohammedans by seizing Oporto and occupying the province now known as Entre Minho e Douro. In the beginning of the 11th century the Omayyad caliphate finally broke up, and independent emirs established themselves in every large city, against whom the Christian princes waged incessant and successful war. In 1055 Ferdinand the Great, king of Leon, Castile, and Galicia, invaded Beira; in 1057 he took Lamego and Viseu, and in 1064 Coimbra; and his son Garcia, who succeeded him as king of Galicia in 1065, maintained Nuno Mendes, count of Oporto, and Sesnando, a renegade Arab wazir, count of Coimbra, as feudal vassals of his court. In 1073 Alphonso VI., the second son of Ferdinand the Great, united once more his father’s three kingdoms, and for a time rivalled his father’s successes, until a fresh outburst of Mohammedan fanaticism ended in the rise of the Almoravide dynasty, and the defeat of the Christian king at Zalaca in 1086 by Yüsuf ibn Teshufin. To resist this revival of the Mohammedan power, Alphonso VI. summoned the chivalry of Christendom to his aid, and among the knights who came to his assistance were Counts Raymond and Henry of Burgundy. In the days of his success Alphonso had compelled Motawakkil of Badajoz to cede to him both Lisbon and Santarem, but the fortune of war had changed, and Sir, the general of the Almoravide caliph Yιisuf, retook both cities. Alphonso felt the need of a valiant warrior on his Galician frontier, and in 1094 he combined the fiefs of Coimbra and Oporto into one great county and conferred it upon Henry of Burgundy with the hand of his illegitimate daughter Theresa, while to Raymond he gave Galicia and his legitimate daughter and heiress Urraca.

Count Henry of Burgundy, the first count of Portugal, [9:19:540] was the second son of Henry, third son of Robert, first duke of Burgundy, and was in every way a typical knight of his century, a brave restless warrior, and a crusader; but when once firmly established in his county he thought much more about his chances of succeeding his father-in-law as king than of trying to carve a kingdom for himself out of the dominions of the Mohammedan caliphs. When, therefore, Alphonso VI. died in 1109 and left his thrones to his daughter Urraca, and nothing to Henry, the Burgundian at once invaded Leon. For five years the Christian princes, Henry of Burgundy, Alphonso Raimundes (the son of Count Raymond), 2ilph0ns0 of Aragon, and Queen Urraca, fought together, while Sir was consolidating the Almoravide power, until Count Henry died suddenly at Astorga in 1112, leaving his wife Theresa to rule the county of Portugal during the minority of his infant son, Affonso Henriques.

Theresa, who ruled at Guimarâens during her son’s minority, was a beautiful and accomplished woman, who devoted all her energies to building up Affonso’s dominions into an independent state, and under her rule, while the Christian states of Spain were torn by civil wars, the Portuguese nobles were prevented from interfering, and began to recognize Portugal as their country, and to cease from calling themselves Galicians. Her regency was a stormy one in spite of all her efforts to maintain peace: in 1116 she was persuaded by Gelmires, bishop of Santiago, to try and extend her frontier towards the north, and seized Tuy and Orense; in 1117 she was besieged by the Mohammedans in Coimbra; and in 1121 her sister Urraca took her prisoner, but, through the interposition of Bishop Gelmires and Mauricio Burdino, archbishop of Braga, peace was quickly made between them. For the next few years a curious parallelism appears between the careers of the two sisters: Urraca showered favours on her lover, Pedro de Lara, until her young son Alphonso Raimundes, or Alphonso VII. of Leon and Castile, with the help of Bishop Gelmires, revolted against her; and with equal blindness Theresa favoured her lover, Fernando Peres de Trava, whom she made governor of the cities of Oporto and Coimbra, until she was detested by the boy Affonso Henriques, and Paio, archbishop of Braga. They did not, however, break out into open revolt until after a successful invasion by Alphonso VII. of Leon and Castile, who forced Theresa to recognize his supremacy in 1127. Her son refused to ratify her submission, and rose in rebellion with Archbishop Paio, Sueiro Mendes, Sancho Nunes, and others; and at the battle of San Mamede on 14th June 1128 Theresa was taken prisoner, and then wandered about in Galicia with her lover until her death in 1130.

Affonso Henriques, who at the age of seventeen assumed the government, was one of the heroes of the Middle Ages; he succeeded to the rule of the county of Portugal when it was still regarded as a fief of Galicia, and after nearly sixty years’ incessant fighting he bequeathed to his son a powerful little kingdom, whose independence was unquestioned, and whose fame was spread abroad throughout Christendom by the reports of the victories of its first king over the Mohammedans. The four wars of independence which Affonso Henriques waged against Alphonso VII. lasted more than twelve years, and were fought out on the Galician frontier with varying success, until the question of Portuguese independence was peaceably established and confirmed by the valour of the Portuguese knights, who overcame those of Castile in the famous tournament of Valdevez, and Affonso Henriques assumed the title of the king of Portugal. The independence of Portugal from Galicia being thus finally achieved, Affonso Henriques abandoned the idea of extending his dominions towards the north, and devoted the next twenty-five years of his life to one long crusade against the Mohammedans, and to extending his frontier towards the south. The state of the Mohammedan power in Spain was particularly favourable to his enterprise. The wave of Moslem fanaticism which had created the Almoravide dynasty had exhausted itself, and independent chiefs had established themselves again in the different provinces, while in Africa 'Abd al-Mumen, the successor of the Almohade mahdi, was destroying the power of the Almoravides by means of yet another wave of fanaticism. As early as 1135 Affonso had built the castle of Leiria to protect his capital, Coimbra, but for some years he left the task of attacking the Mohammedans to the Knights Templars and Knights Hospitallers, who made incessant incursions from their headquarters at Soure and Thomar. But the castle of Leiria had soon fallen; and in 1139, after the flower of Mohammedan Spain had crossed over to Africa under Teshufin, the last Almoravide caliph, to fight the Almohades, and when Alphonso VII. was making his second incursion into the heart of Andalusia, Affonso Henriques collected his whole army and invaded the province of the Kasr ibn Abi Dânes. Advancing to the south of Beja, he met the united forces of all the neighbouring cities under a wâli named Ismar, and completely routed him at Orik or Ourique on 25th July. This battle has been surrounded with a mass of legends: it was solemnly asserted two hundred years afterwards that five kings and 200,000 Mohammedans were utterly defeated, and that after the battle Affonso was proclaimed king by his soldiers. Such legends hardly need contradiction; the victory was a great one, but it was obtained over provincial emirs; and it was not by victories over Mohammedans but by struggles with his Christian cousin Alphonso VII. that independence was to be won. Of still later invention was the fiction of the cortes of Lamego, and the passing of the fundamental laws of the monarchy, on which Vertot and other writers have expended so much eloquence. Of great significance with regard to the legendary splendour of the victory is the fact that in the very next year Ismar or Omar, the emir who was defeated at Ourique, was able to take the field again, when he once more seized the castle of Leiria, and destroyed it. In 1143 a regular peace was concluded between Alphonso VII. and Affonso Henriques at Zamora through the mediation of the cardinal Guy de Vico, when Affonso Henriques was finally recognized as 1 king, and promised to be a vassal of the pope, and to pay him four ounces of gold annually. For many subsequent years the history of Portugal is merely a narration of wars against the Mohammedans. Abù Zakaria, wazir of Santarem and Mohammedan leader in the Belatha (a district including the banks of the Tagus and the cities of Lisbon, Santarem, and Cintra), defeated the Templars at Soure in 1144, but in 1147 Santarem itself was surprised and taken on 15th March. Of still more importance was the capture of Lisbon in the same year. A number of German crusaders from the Rhine and Flanders under Count Arnold of Aerschot and Christian Ghistell, and of English crusaders under their constables, Hervey Glanvill, Simon of Dover, Andrew of London, and Saher d’Arcellis, put in at Oporto on their way to Palestine, and were persuaded by the bishop to commence their holy work by assisting in the siege of Lisbon. With their help the ancient city, which claimed to have been founded by Ulysses, and which had three times—in 792, in 851, and in 1093—been taken by the Christians and held for a short time, was finally captured on 24th October by Affonso Henriques, who also persuaded many of the crusaders to settle and form colonies in Portugal. The series of conquests continued: Cintra, Palmella, and Almada quickly surrendered, and at last, after a failure in 1152, the great city of Alcâcer [9:19:541] do Sal was taken in 1158. In 1161 Affonso Henriques met with his first important check. The Almohade caliphs, having at last triumphed in Africa, determined to extend their power to Spain, and on the arrival of their troops the Portuguese king was defeated. Then the character of the war changed. A disputed succession weakened the Almohade caliphate, and independent bands of “salteadors,” who were little better than brigands or free-lances, began to establish themselves in the cities of Alemtejo; such was Giraldo Sempavor, who took Evora in 1166.

Affonso Henriques became ambitious to win the great city of Badajoz, although by a treaty signed at Celia Nova with Alphonse VII. he had undertaken to confine his conquests to the right bank of the Guadiana. No doubt it was owing to the death of his cousin and the separation of the kingdoms of Castile and Leon that he believed he could effect his purpose. But his son-in-law, Ferdinand of Leon, would not allow such a breach of treaty, and determined to oppose it; and Affonso Henriques made the fatal mistake of again mixing himself up in Spanish affairs by invading Galicia in 1167. At last, in 1169, he formed the siege of Badajoz; Ferdinand at once invested the besieger in his camp, and the Portuguese hero was severely wounded and taken prisoner. To gain his freedom he was compelled to surrender his conquests in Galicia, and Ferdinand nobly inflicted no harsher terms; nevertheless the old king never recovered from the effect of his wound, and the remaining exploits of his reign were the work of his son Dorn Sancho. By 1169 the internal dissensions of the Mohammedans were over, and the new Almohade caliph, Yùsuf Abù Ya'kùb, crossed over to Spain with a large army. He speedily reconquered all the Portuguese acquisitions in Alemtejo, and in 1171, after a vain attempt to take Santarem, made a truce for seven years with Affonso Henriques, who in the following year admitted his son Sancho as king with himself, and left him all the duties of war. Dorn Sancho proved himself the worthy son of his father, and for twelve years Alemtejo was one great battle-ground. The greatest struggle was in 1184, when Yusuf brought over fresh forces from Africa, and again besieged Santarem; but pestilence defended the city, and on 4th July Sancho utterly defeated the fever-stricken army of the besiegers, Yùsuf himself being mortally wounded in the battle. This triumph worthily closed the reign of the great crusader king, Affonso Henriques, who died on 6th December 1185.

The fame of Dorn Sancho I., “the Povoador ” or “ Citybuilder,” rests more on his internal administration than on his early exploits as a soldier. But before he had time to obey his inclinations he had to continue a war of life and death with the Mohammedans. In 1189 he conquered Algarves and took Silves, the capital of the province, with the help of some Enghsh, Dutch, Danish, and Frisian crusaders; but the conquest was not final, for in 1192 Yùsuf Abù Ya'kùb reconquered not only Algarves but the whole province of Alemtejo, including Alcâcer do Sal, failing only before Santarem. Finding the Mohammedans under their great Almohade caliph too dangerous to attack again, Dorn Sancho made peace with them, and for some years, until 1200, concerned himself with the affairs of Spain, waging continuous war against Alphonse IX. of Leon without any particular result. His internal administration was far more important. During his father’s reign there had been nothing but fighting, and, except in Lisbon and Oporto, where a large trade for that period had arisen, and in the northern provinces of Entre Minho e Douro and Tras-os-Montes, where agriculture survived, the scanty population lived chiefly on the spoils taken in their yearly incursions on the Mohammedans. Sancho therefore both encouraged the growth of towns and fostered agriculture. The Portuguese towns had almost without exception preserved their old Roman local self-government, which had been taken advantage of by the Mohammedans; and Sancho wisely followed their example, while he encouraged the increase of population by wise laws, and furthered immigration, especially from the crusaders of England, France, and the north of Europe. The country districts he treated on a different principle. He granted large tracts of land to noblemen and cities and the military orders, on condition that they should be cultivated and occupied. The later years of Sancho’s reign were filled with disputes with Pope Innocent III. This struggle bears a curious resemblance to the quarrels of Henry II. with the pope, which had raged a few years earlier in England. Dorn Sancho had insisted on priests accompanying their flocks to battle, and also on making them amenable to the secular courts. This seemed monstrous to Innocent, who sent legate after legate to demand Sancho’s submission and the payment of the tribute to the Holy See. But the king had in his chancellor Juliâo the first Portuguese student who studied the revival of Roman law at Bologna, and who had imbibed broad views there as to the papal power, and he in Sancho’s name asserted the king’s full right even to dispose of the estates of the church in his kingdom if he liked. This general quarrel was complicated by the behaviour of Martinho Rodrigues, bishop of Oporto, who was hated -alike by his chapter, the king, and the people of his city, and who, after being besieged in his palace for five months, escaped to Rome, and claimed the pope’s protection in 1209. Sancho was now in weak health and in no mood to continue the struggle, so in 1210 he yielded to all the demands of the pope and the bishops; then, after giving large estates to his sons and daughters, he retired to the convent of Alcobaça, where he died in 1211, leaving a reputation as a warrior and a statesman only second to that of his father.

The reign of Affonso II. “the Fat” is chiefly important in the constitutional history of Portugal, and for one memorable feat of arms, the recapture of Alcâcer do Sal. On his father’s death, Affonso, probably by the advice of the chancellor Juliâo, summoned a cortes or parliament, consisting of the bishops, “fidalgoes,” and “ricos homens” of the realm, which is the first on record, as that at Lamego in 1143 is apocryphal. The king assented to the final compact which his father had made with the church, and propounded a law of mortmain, probably drawn up by Juliâo, by which the church could receive no more legacies of land, because it could not perform military service. Affonso himself proved to be no warrior, but he was very tenacious of the wealth and power of the crown, and refused to hand over to his brothers the large legacies which Dorn Sancho had left to them; and it was not until after a long civil war, in which Alphonso IX. of Leon joined, that he gave his sisters their legacies, at the same time taking care that they all became nuns, while his brothers went into exile, and never obtained their lands at all. Though Affonso himself was no soldier, the Portuguese infantry showed how free men could fight at the battle of Navas de Tolosa in 1212; and his ministers, bishops, and captains took advantage of the weakness of the Almohades after this great defeat to reconquer Alemtejo, and in 1217 they retook Alcâcer do Sal, and defeated the wâlis of Andalusia with the help of a body of crusaders. In this expedition the king took no part; he was more bent upon filling his treasury, which soon brought him again into conflict with the church. His chancellor, Gonçalo Mendes, inherited the policy of Juliâo, and encouraged him to lay hands on the lands of the archbishop of Braga, Estevâo Soares, [9:19:542] whereupon Pope Honorius III. excommunicated the king and laid an interdict upon the kingdom until Affonso should make compensation and should expel his chancellor from court. This Affonso refused to do, and he was still under the interdict of the church when he died in 1223.

Sancho II. was only thirteen when he succeeded his father, and, as might have been expected during a minority, the turbulent nobility and intriguing bishops tried to undo the late king’s labours to consolidate the royal power. The old statesmen of Affonso II.—Gonçalo Mendes, the chancellor, Pedro Annes, the “mordomo mor” or lord steward, and Vicente, dean of Lisbon—saw that it was necessary to get the interdict removed if there was to be peace during the king’s minority, and so they prudently retired into the background. Estevâo Soares, the archbishop of Braga, then became the most powerful man in the kingdom, and, with Abril Peres, the new mordomo mor, he agreed with· Alphonso IX. of Leon that the Portuguese should attack Elvas at the same time that the Spaniards laid siege to Badajoz. The siege of Elvas was completely successful; the young king greatly distinguished himself, and in the following year, 1227, felt strong enough to reinstate his father’s old friends in office, making Vicente chancellor, Pedro Annes once more mordomo mor, and Martim Annes “alferes mor” (standard-bearer). This change of power greatly disconcerted the bishops and clergy, who began to intrigue for the overthrow of the young king, but he wisely continued to occupy himself with fighting the Mohammedans, knowing well that the pope would not dare to attack a crusading monarch. He endeavoured to imitate closely his cousin St Louis of France, and his wise policy secured him the protection of the pope, who in 1228 sent John of Abbeville as legate, with full powers to rebuke the Portuguese bishops. The legate made the chancellor, Vicente, bishop of Guarda, and highly commended the favour shown by the king to the friars, who had been introduced into Portugal by his aunts, and to the military orders. But in 1237 Dorn Sancho II. had another serious quarrel with the church, and an interdict was laid on the kingdom; but prompt submission to Pope Gregory IX. secured immediate pardon. Meantime his old and wise councillors had mostly died, and his court was thronged with gay young knights and troubadours. He again attacked the Mohammedans, and invaded Algarves; and in 1239 he took Mertola and Ayamonte, in 1240 Cacello, and in 1244 Tavira. Unfortunately in the interval between 1240 and 1244 the king fell in love with a Castilian lady, Donna Mencia Lopes de Haro, the widow of Alvares Peres de Castro, whom he probably married. This union was most distasteful to the Portuguese people, and furnished the bishops with a pretext for forming a party and overthrowing him, provided they could find a leader and obtain the assistance of the pope. In 1245 the king’s brother, Affonso, who had settled at the court of his aunt, Blanche of Castile, queen-dowager of France and mother of Louis IX., and who had there married the heiress of Boulogne, offered himself as a leader to the Portuguese malcontents. The pope at once issued a bull, deposing Sancho, and Joâo Egas, archbishop of Braga, Tiburcio, bishop of Coimbra, and Pedro Salvadores, bishop of Oporto, went to Paris and offered Affonso of Boulogne the crown of Portugal on certain conditions, which he accepted and swore to obey. In 1246 Affonso arrived at Lisbon, and solemnly declared himself the defender of the kingdom; and for two years a civil war raged, which ended in Dom Sancho’s retiring to Toledo, where he died on 8th January 1248.

With such a commencement it might have been expected that the reign of Affonso III. would have been a period of civil war and internal dissension, or at least of complete submission to the church and the feudal nobility, but, on the contrary, it was from a constitutional point of view the most important of all the early reigns, and also that in which Portugal concluded its warfare with the Mohammedans and attained to its European limits. In short, Affonso III. was essentially a politic king, if not a high-principled man. On his brother’s death he exchanged his title of “visitador” or “curador” of the kingdom for that of king, and at once prepared to complete the conquest of Algarves. Aided by his uncle Dorn Pedro and the Knights Hospitallers under Gonçalo Peres Magro, he speedily reduced the remainder of the province. This rapid extension of the Portuguese territory was by no means agreeable to Alphonso X. “the Wise,” king of Leon and Castile; but, after a short war, Affonso III. consented to marry Alphonso’s illegitimate daughter, Donna Beatrice de Gusman, and to hold Algarves in usufruct only. He then turned his attention to his own position in Portugal, and determined to bridle the power of the bishops, in spite of his oath at Paris. Perceiving that this could only be done with the help of the mass of the people, he summoned a cortes at Leiria in 1254, to which representatives of the cities were elected and sat with the nobles and higher clergy. With the help of this cortes—one of great importance in the constitutional history of Portugal—he dared the interdict laid upon the kingdom for having married again (the daughter of Alphonso the Wise) whilst his first wife (Matilda, countess of Boulogne) was alive. Finally, however, on the petition of the archbishops and bishops of Portugal, Pope Urban IV. legalized the disputed marriage in 1262 and legitimated his elder son, Dorn Diniz, while in 1263 Alphonso X. made over to him the full sovereignty of Algarves. On the other hand, the people made use of their power, and in a full cortes at Coimbra in 1261 the representatives of the cities boldly denounced Affbnso’s tampering with the coinage, and compelled recognition of the fact that taxes were not levied by the inherent right of the king but by the free consent of the people. After a prosperous and successful reign Nemesis came upon Affonso in the rebellion of his eldest son Diniz in 1277, which continued until 1279, in which year the king died.

The period of war and of territorial extension in the: Peninsula was now over, and the period of civilization was to dawn. Territorially and constitutionally Portugal was now an established kingdom; it remained for it to become civilized and thoroughly homogeneous before the great heroic period of exploration and Asiatic conquest should begin. No better man for such work than the new king, Dorn Diniz, could have been found: he was himself a poet and loved letters; he was a great administrator and loved justice; above all he saw the need of agriculture and the arts of peace to take the place of incessant wars, and nobly earned the title of the “Ré Lavrador,” or “Denis the Labourer.” From all these points of viexv his reign is of vast importance in the history of Portugal, though, like all reigns of peaceful progress, it is not signalized by many striking events. It began with a civil war between Diniz and his brother Affonso, who disputed his legitimacy, which ended in a compromise; and in 1281 Diniz married Isabel, daughter of Pedro III. of Aragon, who for her pure and unselfish life was canonized in the 16th century. His reign is only marked by one war with Sancho IV. and his successor, Ferdinand IV., of Castile and Leon, which was terminated in 1297 by a treaty of alliance, according to the terms of which Ferdinand IV. married Constance, daughter of Diniz, while Affonso, the heir to the throne of Portugal, married Beatrice of Castile, sister of Ferdinand. Still more interesting are the king’s relations with Edward I. of England, with whom he exchanged many letters, and with whom he made a commercial treaty in 1294. He corresponded also often with [9:19:543] Edward II. of England, and agreed with him in 1311 that the Knights Templars had been greatly maligned; and on their suppression by Clement V., recollecting the great services which the military orders had rendered to Portugal and their great power, Dorn Diniz founded the Order of Christ, and invested it with the lands of the Templars, thus at once obeying the pope and avoiding a serious disturbance at home. The king showed his love of agriculture by the foundation of agricultural schools and homes for farmers’ orphans, as well as by encouraging improved farming, and by establishing the pine forest of Leiria, his love of justice by wise laws, checking, though not abolishing, the feudal courts, and by the appointment of royal corregidors in every town of which the crown possessed the franchise, and his love for commerce by his commercial treaty with England, and by the foundation of a royal navy, of which a Genoese, named Emmanuel Pessanha, was the first admiral. But his real affection was for literature: he encouraged a school of Portuguese poets at his court, and established a university at Lisbon, which, after many changes, found a permanent home at Coimbra. At the end of this reign war broke out between the king and the heir-apparent, and a pitched battle was only prevented in 1323 by St Isabel riding between the armies and making a peace between her husband and her son, which lasted until the death of the great peace-monarch, the Ré Lavrador, in 1325.

Affonso IV. pursued his father’s policy of making family alliances with the kings of Aragon and Castile, and in 1328 married his daughter, Donna Maria, to Alphonso XI. of Castile, who neglected her, and for her sake Affonso IV. declared war against Castile. Peace was made through the intervention of St Isabel in 1340, when Dorn Pedro, son of Affonso, married Constance Manuel, daughter of the duke of Penafiel, and Affonso IV. himself promised to bring a strong Portuguese army to the help of Alphonso XI. against the emir of Morocco, Abu Hamem, who had crossed the straits to assist the sultan of Granada. The united Christian armies won a decisive victory at the river Salado, in which Affonso especially distinguished himself, and earned the title of “the Brave”; from that time he remained at peace with Castile, and further strengthened his position in Spain in 1347 by marrying his daughter, Donna Leonora, to Pedro IV. of Aragon. The later years of the reign of Affonso IV. were stained by the tragedy of Donna Ines de Castro. (See vol. v. p. 202.)

The first act of Dom Pedro on ascending the throne in 1357 was to punish the murderers of Ines; and further, to show his love for her, he had her dead body disinterred and crowned, and afterwards solemnly buried with the kings and queens of Portugal in the convent of Alcobaça. The spirit of stern, revengeful justice which had marked the commencement of his reign continued to show itself in all matters of administration; he punished priest and noble with equal severity, and the people gave him the title of “Pedro the Severe.” Like his grandfather, he greatly valued the friendship of England, and was on intimate terms with Edward III., who in 1352 had ordered his subjects by proclamation never to do any harm to the Portuguese. A curious sequel to the commercial treaty of 1294 was executed in 1353, when Affonso Martins Alho, on behalf of the maritime cities of Portugal, signed a treaty with the merchants of London guaranteeing mutual good faith in all matters of trade and commerce. This is the most interesting feature of Dorn Pedro’s short reign.

The accession in 1367 of Ferdinand, the only son of Pedro by Constance, marks a crisis in the history of the Portuguese monarchy. As a natural result of the long peace which had succeeded the final conquest of Algarves, the people of Portugal had grown richer, more cultivated, and more conscious of their nationality, while the court had grown more and more dissolute and more out of consonance with the feelings of the people. If the Portuguese monarchy was to continue to exist, it was obvious that it must become again a truly national monarchy, as it had been in the days of Affonso Henriques, and that the kings must remember their duties and not think only of their pleasures. The life and reign of Dorn Ferdinand are marked, like those of his father, by a romantic amour, which, if not so tragic as the story of Ines de Castro, had far greater political importance. Ferdinand was a weak and frivolous but ambitious king, who, after binding himself to marry Leonora, daughter of the king of Aragon, suddenly claimed the thrones of Castile and Leon in 1369 on the death of Pedro the Cruel, through his grandmother, Beatrice of Castile, and was favourably received at Ciudad Rodrigo and Zamora. But the majority of the Castilian nobles did not wish to see a Portuguese monarch on their throne, and welcomed the illegitimate Henry of Trastamare as Henry II. of Castile. The contest ended in 1371 through the intervention of Pope Gregory XI., Ferdinand agreeing to surrender his claims on Castile and to marry Leonora, daughter of Henry II. However, in spite of the pope, this treaty was never carried out; Ferdinand had seen and fallen passionately in love with Donna Leonora Telles de Menezes, daughter of a nobleman in Tras-os-Montes and wife of Joao Lourenço da Cunha, lord of Pombeiro. For love of this lady, whom he eventually married, he refused to fulfil his treaty with Castile; but Henry II. strongly resented this insult, and taking up arms invaded Portugal and laid siege to Lisbon. Ferdinand entered into negotiations with John of Gaunt, who also claimed Castile through his wife Constance (daughter of Pedro the Cruel), and he signed a treaty of alliance through his ambassador, Joâo Fernandes Andeiro, with Edward III. of England. Donna Leonora, however, did not approve of the English alliance, and in 1374 Ferdinand made peace with Castile through the mediation of Cardinal Guy of Boulogne. The queen was now supreme, and terrible in her tyranny. She had not even the merit of constancy, for she fell in love with Andeiro, the late ambassador to England, and induced the king to make him count of Ourem. Ferdinand himself continued to aspire to the throne of Castile; and in 1380, after the death of Henry II., he again sent Andeiro to England to procure assistance for a new war against Henry’s successor, John I. Richard II. of England received the ambassador graciously, and in 1381 the earl of Cambridge, brother of John of Gaunt, arrived with a powerful force, and his son Edward was betrothed to Donna Beatrice, Ferdinand’s only child, who had been recognized as heiress to the throne by a cortes at Leiria in 1376. But the Portuguese king, as usual, failed to keep faith, and in 1383, under the influence of the queen, he deserted the English, who then ravaged Portugal and made peace with John I. of Castile at Salvaterra. By this treaty John I. engaged to marry Donna Beatrice, and it was arranged that Queen Leonora should be regent of Portugal until Beatrice’s eldest son came of age. Six months afterwards, on 2 2d October, King Ferdinand died, and Donna Leonora assumed the regency.

But she did not hold it long. The whole Portuguese people detested her, and their feeling of nationality was outraged by the contemplated union of their crown with that of Castile. Dorn John, grandmaster of the Knights of St Bennett of Aviz, and an illegitimate son of Pedro the Severe, shared both the personal hatred for the queen and the political desire for independence, and on 6th December he headed an insurrection at Lisbon and slew the queen’s lover, Andeiro, in the precincts of the palace. Leonora fled to Santarem and summoned John I. of Castile to her [9:19:544] help, while Dom John was proclaimed defender of Portugal, Joâo das Regras being appointed chancellor and Nuno Alvares Pereira constable. Dorn John sent to England for assistance, which was promised him, and put the capital in a state of defence. In 1384 John of Castile entered Portugal and formed the siege of Lisbon. The resistance was worthy of the cause; the archbishop of Braga fought like a knight; but a pestilence in the besiegers’ camp did them more mischief than even the bravery of the besieged, and John I. had to retire defeated. Before doing so he discovered that Donna Leonora had plotted to poison him, so he seized her and imprisoned her in the convent of Tordesillas, where she died in 1386. But it availed little to have repulsed one Castilian army; the relative sizes of Portugal and Castile made it obvious that the struggle λvould be a severe one; the independence of Portugal was at stake, and the Portuguese fought as men fight for their existence as a nation. The heroic constable, who won the surname of the “Holy Constable,” defeated the Castilians at Atoleiro and Trancoso. On 6th April 1385 a cortes assembled at Coimbra, and declared the crown of Portugal to be elective, choosing, at the instance of the chancellor, Dom John to be king of Portugal. King John then called afi his chivalry together, with the freemen of his cities, and, with the help of 500 English archers, utterly defeated a superior Castilian army at Aljubarrota on 14th August, and in the following October the Holy Constable destroyed another army at Valverde. These blows greatly weakened the prestige of Castile and increased that of Portugal, and when John of Gaunt arrived the following year with 2000 lances and 3000 archers the king of Castile sued for peace. King John of Portugal perceived the advantage of the friendship and alliance of England, and on 9th May 1386 was signed the treaty of Windsor, by which the two countries were to be allies for ever in every transaction. He drew the alliance still closer in 1387 by marrying Philippa of Lancaster, a daughter of John of Gaunt by his second marriage; and a truce was made between Portugal and Castile, and renewed at intervals until a final peace was signed in 1411. The only attempt made to disturb King John I. was an incursion by the eldest son of Ines de Castro, Dorn Diniz, in 1398, assisted by Henry III. of Castile, but the legitimate claims of the prince carried no weight against the conqueror of Aljubarrota, and he retired discomfited. The long reign of John I. was, like that of King Diniz, a reign of peaceful development: Diniz had settled and united the country after the Moorish wars; John did the same after the obstinate war with Castile, and at the end of his reign saw Portugal beginning to expand beyond the sea. The keynotes of his foreign policy were friendship with England and peace with Castile. Henry IV., Henry V., and Henry VI. of England all successively ratified the treaty of Windsor; Richard II. sent troops to help King John against Dorn Diniz in 1398; Henry IV. made him a knight of the Garter in 1400; and Henry V. sent him help in the expedition to Ceuta in 1415. John’s internal government was not so happy, for, though personally a clever administrator, he had had, in order to maintain himself when he claimed the crown, to grant vast privileges and estates to the nobles, who became more and more powerful, and, by their exercise of full feudal rights, almost independent. It was at the earnest request of his three elder sons, Dorn Duarte or Edward, Dorn Pedro, and Dorn Henry, that he consented to invade Africa in 1415. The young princes desired to win their knightly spurs; there were no enemies at home; and what could be more proper than to attack the old hereditary foes of Portugal, the Moors, in Morocco itself? The queen from her deathbed sent her blessing; the princes proved themselves worthy sons of their father; and by the occupation of Ceuta the

Portuguese made their first conquest beyond the limits of their country. The expedition over, the elder princes each followed his own bent: Dorn Edward assisted his father in the labours of government; Dorn Pedro, who was made duke of Coimbra, travelled throughout Europe, and showed himself everywhere a learned and accomplished as well as brave knight; and Dorn Henry, who was master of the Order of Christ, governor of Algarves, and duke of Viseu, established himself at Sagres, and devoted his life to the encouragement of maritime exploration, for an account of which see vol. x. pp. 179, 180. Portuguese discoveries thus made illustrious the closing years of the reign of King John, who died in 1433.

Contrary to expectation, the reign of King Edward (so called after Edward III. of England) proved, in spite of his own great qualities, but short, and was marked by one signal disaster. On ascending the throne he summoned a full cortes at Evora and secured the passing of the Lei Mental, or the provision which was supposed to be in the mind of King John when he gave his extensive grants to the nobility, namely, that they could only descend in the direct male line and on failure should revert to the crown. By this means Edward hoped to check the excessive power of the nobles, many of whom fled to Castile. He supported his father’s policy, married a princess of Aragon, and, after confirming the treaty of Windsor, was made a knight of the Garter in his father’s room. He also encouraged the explorations of Dorn Henry; but the king’s life was shortened and Dorn Henry’s explorations were checked for a time by the fatal expedition to Tangiers in 1436. At the earnest request of his youngest brother Dorn Ferdinand and of Dorn Henry himself, and in spite of the remonstrances of the pope and Dom Pedro, the king sent a fleet to attack Tangiers; the army was cut off, and it was only by sacrificing Dorn Ferdinand as a hostage that the troops were allowed to retire to their ships. The imprisonment of his brother preyed on King Edward’s mind, and he died in 1438, while Dorn Ferdinand, after a long and cruel captivity at Fez, borne with such exemplary piety as to win him the title of “the Constant Prince,” died from ill-treatment in 1443.

The new king, Affonso V., was a minor, and his reign . began with a struggle for the regency between his mother, Donna Leonora, and his uncle, Dorn Pedro, duke of Coimbra. The people of Lisbon supported the latter, who was recognized as regent; and his conduct justified the choice. He pursued his brother’s policy of curbing the pretensions of the nobles, and encouraged Dom Henry’s work of discovery, which advanced every year. Dorn Pedro’s power was seemingly at its height in 1447 when Affonso V. was declared of age and at the same time married his cousin Leonora, daughter of Dorn Pedro; but the duke of Braganza poisoned the king’s mind against his uncle, and schemed his dismissal from court. Then, not satisfied with this, he marched against him with a royal army, largely recruited by the nobility, who hated the duke of Coimbra. The two forces met at Alfarrobeira on 20th May 1449, when the regent was slain, to the great regret of the Portuguese people. The young king fell more and more under the influence of the duke of Braganza and his sons, who humoured his desire for knightly fame and his dream of sitting on the throne of Castile, and who secured to themselves vast grants of royal property. This knightly idea appears in Affonso’s three expeditions to Africa, which won him the surname of “the African”: in 1458 he took Alcâcer Seguier; in 1461 he failed; and in 1471 he took Arzilla and Tangiers. Meanwhile maritime exploration went on apace; but in 1460 Dorn Henry the Navigator, the heart and soul of these maritime enterprises, died. The “Ré Cavalleiro” or knightly [9:19:545] king was now bent on the old chimerical scheme of winning Castile; for that purpose he married in 1475 his own niece, the infanta Joanna, only daughter of Henry IV. of Castile, and claimed the kingdom; but the Castilians preferred the infanta Isabella, who had married Ferdinand, king of Aragon. The rival parties took up arms; and the king of Portugal was utterly defeated at Toro in 1476, which sent him hurriedly to France to beg help from Louis XI.; but his mission was in vain, and he saw no alternative save signing the treaty of Alcantara (1478), by which his newly-won wife was sent to a convent. He remained inconsolable at his loss, and alternately abdicated and returned until his death in 1481.

His successor, John II., was a monarch of a very different type: though he had proved himself a brave and valiant soldier at the battle of Toro, he pursued the old policy of the house of Aviz, that of peace and family alliances with Castile and of commercial intimacy with England. But he was also a typical king of this period, and followed the example of Louis XI. in France and Henry VII. in England in breaking the power of the nobles, with the hearty acquiescence of the people. Besides political reasons for this policy, he remembered that he was the grandson of the great duke of Coimbra, and bound to revenge his murder at Alfarrobeira. The first act of his reign was to summon a full cortes at Evora, at which it was decreed that the royal corregidors should have full right to administer justice in all the feudal dominions of the nobility. This act brought him of course into direct conflict with the nobility, who were headed by Ferdinand, duke of Braganza, to the king’s great delight, for, as he said, the wanton liberality of his father had left him only the high roads of Portugal for his inheritance. Hence the duke of Braganza was naturally the first object of the king’s attack. He was the wealthiest nobleman not only in Portugal but in the whole Peninsula; his brothers held the high offices of constable and chancellor of the kingdom, and they too had all assisted in the overthrow of the duke of Coimbra. He believed himself to be safe because he and the king had married sisters, but he was promptly arrested for high treason, and after a very short trial executed at Evora on 22d June 1483. His own and the king’s brother-in-law, Ferdinand, duke of Viseu, a grandson of King Edward, succeeded to the leadership of the nobles; but John II., imitating Louis XI.’s policy of not sparing his own family, stabbed him with his own hand at Setubal on 23d August 1484, and afterwards executed some eighty of the leading nobles, breaking the feudal power of the class for ever. This terrible struggle over, he occupied himself with such success in administration that he won the surname of “the Perfect King.” But he did not intend to keep the Portuguese in idleness. He was surrounded by the gallant knights who had been trained by his father, and who, though now frightened out of treason, yet needed some occupation, and at his court were the famous navigators trained by Dorn Henry. In 1484 he built a fort at La Mina or Elmina to cover the increasing trade with the Gold Coast, and in 1486 Bartholomeu Dias rounded the Cape of Good Hope and reached Algoa Bay. The king was full of plans for reaching India and discovering Prester John; besides despatching a special expedition for this purpose in 1487, he sent Pedro de Evora and Gonçalo Annes to Timbuctoo, and Martim Lopes to Nova Zembla to find a north-east road to Cathay. With all his perspicacity, he made the great mistake of dismissing Columbus in 1493 as a visionary; but he was occupied to the very last day of his life in getting ready the fleet with which Vasco de Gama was to find out the passage to India by the Cape of Good Hope (see vol. x. p. 181 sq.). It was in his reign, in 1494, that the pope issued his famous bull dividing the undiscovered parts of the world between Spaniards and Portuguese. A great sorrow darkened the later years of John II. in the death of his only son Affonso, who in 1490 had married Isabella, eldest daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain; and he himself died in the flower of his age in 1495.

The reign of Emmanuel “the Fortunate,” brother of the murdered duke of Viseu, is the heroic period of Portuguese history. The great men and brave knights of the reigns of Affbnso V. and John II. were still living, and Vasco de Gama, Francisco de Almeida, and Affbnso de Albuquerque were to make their king’s reign for ever glorious. Yet Emmanuel personally contributed L ι t little to this glory; his one idea was to sit on the throne of Castile. To gain this end he proposed to marry Isabella, eldest daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella and widow of Dorn Affbnso, and to win her hand he consented to expel the Jews from Portugal, although they were the richest and most useful class of people in the kingdom, and had been faithfully protected ever since the days of Affbnso Henriques. He married Isabella in 1497, and was on a progress through Spain in the following year for the purpose of being recognized as heir to the throne, when βhe died suddenly at Toledo, and with her disappeared his great hopes. Even then he did not despair, but in 1500 married his deceased wife’s sister, Maria, though her elder sister Joanna was also married, and had a son, who was afterwards the emperor Charles V. While the king was thus occupied great things were being done in Asia by his subjects. In 1497 Vasco de Gama had crossed the Indian Ocean and reached Calicut; in 1500 Pedro Alvares Cabral discovered Brazil on his way to India; in 1502 Vasco de Gama paid his second visit to the Malabar coast; in 1503 Duarte Pacheco defended Cochin and with 900 Portuguese defeated an army of 50,000 natives; and in 1505 Francisco de Almeida was appointed first viceroy of India. This is not the place to dilate on the great deeds of Albuquerque (ç.v.) and of the Portuguese in India; it is enough here to mark the dates of a few of the most important discoveries and feats of arms which illustrate the reign of Emmanuel. In 1501 Joâo da Nova discovered the island of Ascension and Amerigo Vespucci the Rio Plata and Paraguay; in 1509 Diogo Lopes de Sequieira occupied Malacca; in 1510 Affbnso de Albuquerque occupied Goa; in 1512 Francisco Senâo discovered the Moluccas; in 1515 Lopes Soares built a fort at Colombo in the island of Ceylon; in 1517 Fernando Peres Andrada established himself at Canton, and made his way to Peking in 1521; and in 1520 Magalhâes (Magellan), a Portuguese sailor, though in the Spanish service, passed through the straits which bear his name.

The reign of John III., who succeeded Emmanuel in 1521, is one of rapid decline. The destruction of the feudal power of the nobility by John II. had not been an unmixed good: it had fatally weakened the class of leaders of the people; the nobility lost all sense of patriotism and intrigued for “moradias,” or court posts; and, in short, their position was much the same as that of the French nobility before the Revolution of 1789. The overthrow of their power had also made the king absolute; having now no feudal nobility to combat, he had no need of the support of the people, and the newly-created Indian trade brought him an income greater than that of any prince in Europe, so that he had no need of taxes. There was, however, a more serious cause of the declining power of Portugal than the absolutism of the government, and that was the rapid depopulation of the country. Alemtejo and Algarves had never been thoroughly peopled; the devastation produced by constant war could not be easily repaired; and, though the exertions of Diniz the Labourer had made [9:19:546] Beira the garden of Europe, the southern part of the kingdom was chiefly in the hands of the military orders, who did not sufficiently encourage immigration. The great discoveries of the 15th century quickened the depopulation of Portugal. Not only did the bulk of the young men gladly volunteer as soldiers and sailors to go in search of wealth and honour, but whole families emigrated to Madeira and the Brazils. Also the Portuguese who did continue to live in their native country flocked to Lisbon, which trebled in population in less than eighty years, owing to the large fortunes which could be made there in trade. The king, the nobles, and the military orders were quite unconcerned at this extensive emigration, for their large estates were cultivated much more cheaply by African slaves, who were imported from the time of the first voyages of Dom Henry in such numbers that Algarves was entirely cultivated by them, and even in Lisbon itself they outnumbered the freemen by the middle of the 16th century. In this respect the condition of Portugal resembled that of Italy at the time of the decline of the Roman empire, as the wealth of Lisbon resembled that of imperial Rome, while in another respect the utter corruption of the officials in the factories and Indian settlements too far resembled the peculation and corruption of the Roman proconsuls. While the Portuguese nation was exhibiting these signs of a rapid decline, another factor was added by the religious zeal of John III. This king inherited his father’s bigotry and fanaticism, and was anxious to introduce the Jesuits and the Inquisition into Portugal. The Church of Rome was not likely to hinder his pious desire, but for several years the “neo-Christians ”—the name given to the halfhearted converts made from the Jews as the condition of their remaining in Portugal—managed to ward off the blow. But the king’s earnest wish was gratified at last, and in 1536 the tribunal of the Holy Office was established in Portugal with the bishop of Ceuta as first grand inquisitor, who was soon succeeded by the king’s brother, the cardinal Henry. The Inquisition quickly destroyed all that was left of the old Portuguese spirit, and so effectually stamped out the Portuguese revival of literature that, while towards the close of the 16th century all Europe was becoming civilized under the influence of the Renaissance, Portugal fell back and her literature became dumb. The king had his reward for his piety: he was permitted to unite the masterships of the orders of Christ, Santiago, and Aviz with the crown, and to found new bishoprics at Leiria, Miranda, and Porto Alegre; but it was left to St Francis Xavier to show the real beauty of Christianity in his mission to the Indies.

It was in India that the decline of the Portuguese was most perceptible. Nuno da Cunha, son of the discoverer Tristan da Cunha, governed the Indian settlements worthily till 1536, and then corruption undermined all prosperity until the arrival of Dorn Joâo de Castro in 1545. He was a Portuguese hero of the noblest type; and for three years the friend of St Francis Xavier revived the glories of Albuquerque by winning the battle of Diu, and then died in the missionary’s arms. Everything went afterwards from bad to worse, till even observers like the Dutchman Cleynaerts saw that, in spite of all its wealth and seeming prosperity, the kingdom of Portugal was rotten at the core and could not last. King John III., satisfied with peace and the establishment of the Inquisition in his kingdom, did nothing to check the decline; and he endeavoured to secure his aims by the marriage of his only surviving son John to his niece Joanna, a daughter of Charles V., but he had the misfortune to outlive his son, who died in 1554. When he himself died in 1557 he left the crown to his grandson, a child of three years old, the ill-fated Dom Sebastian.

Nothing could be more disastrous for Portugal than the succession of a minor at this juncture. Under the will of John III. the regency was assumed by Queen Catherine and the cardinal Henry, his widow and his brother, but all power was exercised by the brothers Luis and Martini Gonçalves Camara, of whom the former was the young king’s tutor and confessor and the latter prime minister. In 1568 Dorn Sebastian was declared of age by the Camaras, who thus excluded the cardinal from even a semblance of power. As the king came to take more interest in affairs, the mixture of imperiousness, fanaticism, and warlike ambition which made up his character began to make its mark upon his reign. He tried to check the luxury of his people by a sumptuary edict that no one might have more than two dishes for dinner; he encouraged the Inquisition; and he dreamt of a new crusade in Africa for the conquest and conversion of the Moors. His crusading ardour was most objectionable to his people, who had highly approved of John III.’s surrender of all ports in Africa except Ceuta, Tangiers, Arzilla, and Mazagan, but the Jesuits and young courtiers about his person encouraged him in his wild ideas. In 1574 he paid a short visit to Ceuta and Tangiers, and in 1576, to his great delight, Mouley Ahmed ibn 'Abdallâh, after being disappointed in his application to Philip II. for help against Mouley 'Abd al-Melik, sultan of Morocco, applied to Sebastian. The king proceeded to raise money by harsh taxes on the converted Jews and by partial bankruptcy, and set sail for Africa on 24th June 1578 with 15,000 infantry, 2400 cavalry, and 36 guns; of this army only some 10,000 were Portuguese, the rest consisting of Spanish and German volunteers and mercenaries, and 900 Italians, under Sir Thomas Stukeley, whom, when on his way to deliver Ireland from Elizabeth, Sebastian had stopped. On reaching Africa the Portuguese king was joined by Mouley Ahmed with 800 Mohammedans. He at first amused himself with hunting, and then, just as Dorn Ferdinand had done in 1436, he foolishly left his base of operations, his fleet, and the sea, and began to march over the desert to attack Larash (El-Araish). Mouley 'Abd al-Melik, who had previously endeavoured to dissuade the young king from his purpose, collected an army of 40,000 cavalry, 15,000 infantry, and 40 guns, and, feeling that he was himself on the point of death from a mortal disease, ordered an instant attack upon the Portuguese at Al cheer Quibir, or Al-kasr al-Kebir, on 4th August 1578. Dorn Sebastian behaved like a brave knight, though he had not been a prudent commander, and when all was lost he was determined to lose his own life also. According to the most trustworthy account, Christovâo de Tavora, his equerry, had shown a flag of truce, and had offered to surrender with the fifty horsemen who still remained about the king, when Sebastian suddenly dashed on the Moorish cavalry, who, irritated by this breach of faith, instantly slew him and the brave equerry who had followed his master. The slaughter was terrible; Mouley 'Abd al-Melik died during the action; Mouley Ahmed was drowned; Sir Thomas Stukeley was killed, with many of the chief Portuguese nobles and prelates, including Don Jayme de Braganza (brother of the sixth duke of Braganza), the duke of Aveiro (who had commanded the cavalry), and the bishops of Coimbra and Oporto, while among the prisoners were the duke of Barcellos and Duarte de Menezes. The sad news was brought to Lisbon by the admiral of the fleet, Dorn Diogo de Sousa, and the cardinal Henry was proclaimed king of Portugal as King Henry I.

Hardly had the new king been crowned when intrigues began about his successor. He could not live long; but he determined not to examine the question himself, and so summoned a cortes at Lisbon at once to decide it. Of [9:19:547] the seven candidates only five need be seriously considered, for Pope Gregory XIIL,who claimed as heir-general to a cardinal, and Catherine de , Medici,who claimed through Affonso Emmanuel. 1-John HI., Isabel, b. 1502, d. 1557, b. 1503, d. 1539, Catherine of Austria, m. Charles V.Beatrice, b. 1504, d. 1538, m.

Isabel of Braganza.John, Philip II. b. 1537, d. 1554, m. Joanna of Spain.Sebastian, b. 1554, d. 1578. Philibert Emmanuel, duke of Savoy. Antonio, prior of Crato (illegitimate). Catherine, Maria, m. duke of Braganza. m. duke of Banna 1 Ranuccio, duke of Banna. III. and his first wife, the countess of Boulogne, require no further notice; the relationship of the other five to Emmanuel can be best perceived from the following table :—It clearly appears that the heiress to the throne was Catherine, duchess of Braganza, and failing her heirs the duke of Parma, and that the claims of Philip II. and of the duke of Savoy were only valid in case of the extinction of the line of Dorn Edward. Yet, though the university of Coimbra declared in favour of the duchess of Braganza, Philip II. set to work to win over the majority of the cortes. Money and lavish promises assisted the eloquence of his two chief supporters, Christovào de Moura and Antonio Pinheiro, bishop of Leiria; and when the cardinal-king died on 31st January 1580 the cortes was quite ready to recognize Philip, although the people, or rather that small portion of the inhabitants who were really Portuguese, felt their old disinclination towards the union of Spain and Portugal. Philip prevented any movement on the part of the duke of Braganza by promising him Brazil with the title of king, and a marriage between the prince of the Asturias and his daughter, which, as the duke hated war and loved ease, were readily accepted; but to Philip’s surprise a competitor whom he had taken no account of, Antonio, the prior of Crato, declared himself king at Santarem, and then entered Lisbon and struck money. Portugal, however, enervated by wealth, oppressed by the Inquisition, and reduced in free population, felt no inclination to make a powerful stand against Philip, who had all the prestige of being the son of Charles V., while the hotheaded but incapable prior of Crato could not be compared to the great John I.; and the cortes, which had in 1385, under the honeyed words of Joâo das Regras, enthusiastically fought for Portugal, in 1580 listened to the promises of Christovâo de Moura and rejected the prior of Crato. The duke of Alva entered Portugal at the head of a Spanish army and easily defeated Dorn Antonio at Alcantara, after which Philip was declared king of Portugal.

The other candidates were obliged to acquiesce in Philip’s success; the duke of Braganza, though greatly disappointed at receiving only the office of constable and the order of the Golden Fleece instead of the whole of Brazil, was, like the majority of his countrymen, too apathetic to strike a blow. Philip pledged himself to recognize the individuality of Portugal in a cortes held at Thomar in 1581, when he promised that he would maintain the rights and liberties of the people, that the cortes should be assembled frequently, that all the offices in the realm should be given to Portuguese alone, that no lands or jurisdiction in Portugal should be given to foreigners, and that there should be a Portuguese council, which should accompany the king everywhere and have entire charge of all Portuguese affairs. But the lower classes refused to believe that Dorn Sebastian was dead,—a belief encouraged by the stratagem of a λvounded noble on the evening of the battle of Al-kasr al-Kebfr to gain admission into the city of Tangiers by asserting that he was the king; and four successive impostors arose, who assumed the name of the dead monarch. The first two, who were mockingly called the “king of Pennamacor” and the “king of Ericeira,” were Portuguese of low birth, who were recognized by a few people in the vicinity of their native villages, and easily captured in 1584 and 1585; the third, Gabriel Espinosa, was given out as Dorn Sebastian by a Portuguese Jesuit, and introduced as such to Donna Anna, a natural daughter of Don John of Austria, who believed in him, but he was executed in 1594; while the fourth, a poor Calabrian named Marco Tullio, who could not speak a word of Portuguese, asserted his pretensions at Venice as late as 1603, twenty-five years after Dorn Sebastian’s death, and, after obtaining some success in Italy, was also captured, sent to the galleys, and afterwards executed. Of more importance were the renewed attempts of the prior of Crato to assert his claims with the assistance of foreign allies. In 1582 he proceeded to the Azores with a strong French fleet under Philip Strozzi, but his ill-fortune followed him: Strozzi was defeated and killed in a battle with the Spanish admiral Don Alvaro de Bacam, and Dorn Antonio fled to England. There Elizabeth received him kindly, and in 1589 she sent a strong fleet under Drake and Norris to help him win back his “kingdom”; but Drake and Norris quarrelled, Portugal showed no willingness to receive him, nothing was done, and the English retired. The unfortunate prior, finding that Elizabeth would do nothing more for him, again returned to Paris, where he died in poverty in 1594.

“The sixty years’ captivity,” as the domination of Spain over Portugal from 1580 to 1640 is called, was a time of disaster for the country: not only did the English sack Faro in 1595, but Dutch, English, and French all preyed upon its great colonial possessions; the Dutch in particular, after beating the Portuguese in India, took from them the greater part of the lucrative Indian trade. This they did with the more ease since, with the true commercial spirit, they not only imported merchandise from the East to Holland but also distributed it through Dutch merchants to every country of Europe, whereas the Portuguese in the days of their commercial monopoly were satisfied with bringing over the commodities to Lisbon, and letting foreign nations come to fetch them. The Dutch incursion into the Indies was directly caused by Philip’s closing the port of Lisbon to them in 1594; and in 1595 Cornelius Houtman, a Dutchman, who had been employed by the Portuguese as an Indian pilot and then imprisoned by the Inquisition, offered to lead a Dutch fleet to the Indies, and in 1597 they erected a factory in Java. They speedily extended their sphere of operations by occupying the Moluccas and Sumatra, and in 1619 they built Batavia as a rival commercial capital in the East to Goa. The English quickly followed their example; in the reign of Elizabeth the English captains had been content to ravage Pernambuco in 1594-95, Fort Arguin in 1595, and the Azores in 1596, and in the reign of James I. the East India Company was established in the Indies at Surat. The French also settled themselves in Brazil and opened a flourishing trade with South America and the [9:19:548] west coast of Africa; and even the Danes struck a blow against the monopoly of the Portuguese by building a factory at Tranquebar. To make up for these losses, what had Portugal received from Spain? The promises made to the cortes at Thomar were all broken; the cortes was only summoned once in 1619 to recognize Philip, the eldest son of King Philip III., as the heir to the throne on the occasion of his only visit to Lisbon; Lerma and Olivares, the all-powerful ministers of Philip III. and Philip IV., appropriated to themselves large territories within the realm of Portugal; and, whenever it was possible, Spaniards were installed in Portuguese bishoprics and civil offices.

At last a blow was struck against this supremacy of Spain in the revolution of 1640 and the elevation of the house of Braganza to the throne of Portugal. Things had been tending towards a revolution for a long time, but the final impulse came from the energy of certain noblemen, conjoined with the weakness of Spain and the hope of assistance from France.

The general discontent was shown by risings in Lisbon in 1634 and in Evora in 1637, where for a short time the mob ruled the city; and, when Spain was hampered by the Catalan revolt and the French war, the opportunity seemed favourable for the Portuguese. The difficulty was to find a leader; the eighth duke of Braganza, grandson of the infanta Catherine, daughter of Dorn Edward, was a pleasure-loving, easy-tempered man, fond of music and hunting, quite happy in his palace at Villa Viçosa; but the energy of his wife, Luiza de Guzman, Castilian though she was, secured his passive co-operation, and his confidential adviser, Joâo Pinto Ribeiro, soon formed a powerful band of conspirators among the Portuguese noblemen, when the news arrived in 1640 that the arrière-ban of Portugal was summoned to fight against the Catalans. Portugal was at that time under the nominal government of Margaret of Savoy, duchess of Mantua, who was surrounded with Spaniards and Italians; but the real government was in the hands of the tyrannical secretary of state, Miguel de Vasconcellos de Brito. Ribeiro had no difficulty in collecting together many daring and discontented noblemen, of whom the chief were Miguel de Almeida, Pedro de Mendon ça Furtado, Antonio and Luis de Almada, Estevâo and Luis da Cunha, Rodrigo and Emmanuel de Sâ, and Jorge de Mello; and the archbishop of Lisbon himself, Rodrigo da Cunha, if not actually a conspirator, certainly must have had a knowledge of what was going on through his relatives the Almadas and Da Cunhas. The plot was carefully elaborated, parts being assigned to the leading conspirators, and the day fixed was the 1st of December. The plot was completely successful; the archbishop of Lisbon was appointed lieutenant-general of the kingdom, with Almeida, Mendonça, and A. de Almada for councillors, and expresses were sent off to the duke of Braganza to inform him of all that had passed and to offer him the crown. He was at first unwilling to accept the honour thrust upon him, but the duchess, on whom a prophecy that she should be a queen had had a great effect, persuaded him to go to Lisbon, where he was crowned as King John IV. on 13th December 1640. The whole of Portugal at once rose and expelled the Spaniards, and on 19th January a full cortes met at Lisbon, which recognized King John as king of Portugal, and his son Theodosius as heir-apparent.

The Portuguese knew well that, in spite of the Catalan rebellion and the terrible wars in which Spain was engaged, they were not strong enough to maintain their independence without foreign help, and at once sent ambassadors to France, Holland, and England. Richelieu was charmed with the success of the revolution, hoping to make Portugal a thorn in the side of Spain, such as Scotland had been to England in former days, and he at once sent a fleet under De Brezé to the Tagus; the Dutch also sent a fleet under Gylfels; but Charles I. of England was too much occupied with his quarrels with his parliament to do more than merely recognize the new king.

The Portuguese were at first successful, owing to the many wars in which Spain was involved, and, after the defeat which Mathias de Albuquerque inflicted on the baron of Molingen at Montijo on 26th May 1644, felt at their ease in spite of the serious plot of the duke of Caminha and the archbishop of Braga, until it became obvious that Mazarin would desert them without compunction if it suited his purpose. The old Portuguese colonies at once declared for their fatherland, and this brought about a colonial war with Holland, in which indeed the Portuguese generals won many successes, but which deprived them of the assistance of the Dutch in Europe. Mazarin’s refusal to insist on their independence at the congress at Münster, though he protected their envoys against the Spaniards, made them despondent; and a very curious letter of Mazarin’s (4th October 1647), offering the crown of Portugal to the duke of Longueville, exhibits at once the feeble character of John IV., the despair of the Portuguese, and their dependence on France. Mazarin’s desertion did not at first do great harm, for the war between France and Spain continued, though peace was made with the empire. In the midst of this universal war John IV. died in 1656.

As the prince of Brazil, Dom Theodosio, the eldest son of the late king, had predeceased him, his second son Affonso, a boy of thirteen, succeeded to the throne as Affonso VI. under the regency of his mother. The queen-regent, who had always been more energetic than her husband, determined to pursue the war with Spain with more vigour and summoned Marshal Schomberg to organize her armies. The result of Schomberg’s presence soon appeared, and on 14th January 1659 Dorn Antonio Luis de Menezes, count of Cantanhede, won a victory over Don Luiz de Haro at Elvas. This victory in one way injured the Portuguese cause, for it so incensed Don Luiz de Haro that, during the famous conferences at the Island of Pheasants with Mazarin which led to the signature of the treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659, he not only would not hear of any intercession for the Portuguese but insisted on the insertion of a secret article in the treaty to the effect that France would promise to entirely abandon them. Neither Mazarin nor Louis XIV. intended to keep this secret article and give up the advantage of having such a useful ally in the Peninsula, and they accordingly looked about for some means to evade it. England offered the opportunity; Charles II. was seeking a wife and gladly accepted the suggestion that he should marry Catherine of Braganza, sister of the king of Portugal, both because Portugal had sheltered his cousins Prince Rupert and Prince Maurice in 1650, and because the colonial cessions which the queenregent offered as her daughter’s dowry would be very popular in England. The marriage was accordingly agreed upon in 1661, and in 1662 the earl of Sandwich came to bring the bride from Lisbon, while the English occupied Tangiere, Bombay, and Galle as her dowry, and promised to send troops to Portugal, and to make peace between the Dutch and the Portuguese. Before, however, the English soldiers arrived and the final struggle with Spain began, a family revolution had taken place in Portugal. The young king, a feeble vicious youth, was very wroth that his mother had exiled a favourite valet to the Brazils, and by the advice of two noblemen about his person suddenly declared himself of age in 1662 and transferred the government to the able hands of Luis de Sousa e [9:19:549] Vasconcellos, count of Castel Melhor. The queen retired to a convent chagrined, but Castel Melhor continued her policy, and formed the English soldiers, who had arrived under the earl of Inchiquin, some French and German volunteers and mercenaries, and the newly-organized Portuguese levies into a powerful army, of which Schomberg was the real, though not the ostensible, commander. With this army a series of victories were won, which caused Affonso VI. to be surnamed “Affonso the Victorious,” though his own successes, such as they were, were confined to the streets of Lisbon. On 8th June 1663 the count of Villa Flor with Schomberg by his side utterly defeated Don John of Austria, and afterwards retook Evora; on 7th July 1664 Pedro Jacques de Magalhàes defeated the duke of Ossuna at Ciudad Rodrigo; on 17 th June 1665 the marquis of Marial va destroyed a Spanish army under the marquis of Carracena at the battle of Montes Claros, and Christovâo de Brito Pereira followed up this victory with one at Villa Viçosa. These successes entirely broke the power of Spain, and peace was only a matter of time, when Castel Melhor decided to increase both his own power and that of Portugal by marrying the king to a French princess. Such an alliance was highly approved of by Louis XIV., and the bride selected was Marie Françoise Elisabeth, Mademoiselle d’Aumale, daughter of the duke of Savoy-Nemours and granddaughter of Henry IV. of France. The marriage was celebrated in 1666; but Castel Melhor found that, instead of increasing his power, it worked his ruin. The young queen detested her husband, and fell in love with his brother Dorn Pedro; and after fourteen months of a hated union she left the palace and applied for a divorce on the ground of non-consummation to the chapter of the cathedralchurch of Lisbon, while Doni Pedro shut up King Affonso in a portion of the palace and assumed the regency. He was recognized as regent by the cortes on 1st January 1668, and at once signed a peace with Spain on 13th February, by which the independence of Portugal was recognized in return for the cession of Ceuta. This peace, signed at Lisbon, was chiefly negotiated by the earl of Sandwich and Sir Richard Southwell, the English ambassadors at Madrid and Lisbon. On 24th March the queen’s divorce was pronounced and confirmed by the pope, and on 2d April she married the regent. His rule was gladly submitted to, for the people of Portugal recognized his sterling qualities, which compared favourably with those of the unfortunate Affonso VI. Castel Melhor fled to France, and the king—for Dorn Pedro only called himself “regent ”—was imprisoned, first in the island of Terceira and then at Cintra, till his death in 1683, the very same year in which the queen also died.

As long as Affonso VI. lived, Dorn Pedro’s power was not thoroughly established, but in 1683 he was proclaimed king as Pedro II. His reign was marked by good internal administration, the breaking out of the War of the Spanish Succession, and the Methuen treaty. His good administration kept him from being short of money, and enabled him to dispense with the cortes, which never met between 1697 and 1828; but the war of the succession almost emptied his treasury. He had in 1687, at the earnest request of the duke of Cadaval, his most intimate friend, consented to marry again in order to have an heir, and had selected Maria Sophia de Neuburg, daughter of the elector palatine, rather to the chagrin of Louis XIV., who, in the prospect of the death of Charles II. of Spain, had counted on the support of Pedro’s first wife, a French princess, and who now sought to form a strong party at the court of Lisbon. He was so far successful that on the death of Charles II. King Pedro not only recognized Louis XIV.’s grandson as Philip V. of Spain but in 1701 protected a French fleet in the Tagus under the count of Chastenau against Sir George Rooke. The great Whig ministry of England was not likely to submit to this desertion on the part of England’s ancient ally, and sent the Right Honourable John Methuen in 1703 to Lisbon with full powers to make a treaty, both political and commercial, with Portugal. On 27th December 1703 he signed the famous Methuen treaty, by which Portuguese wines were to be imported into England at a lower duty than those from France or Germany, in return for a similar concession to English textile fabrics. The immediate result was that Pedro acknowledged the archduke Charles, and the ulterior that Englishmen drank port wine instead of claret or hock throughout the last century, while the Portuguese imported nearly everything they wanted from England and remained without manufactures. On 7th March 1704 Sir George Rooke arrived at Lisbon, convoying 10,000 English troops under Lord Galway and the archduke Charles himself. The English army at once advanced with a Portuguese auxiliary force and took Salvaterra and Valença. In the following year but little was done on the Portuguese frontier, because the archduke had sailed round to Barcelona, and Dorn Pedro, who was slowly dying, handed over the regency to his sister Catherine, queen-dowager of England. Had he been conscious he might have learned of the great successes of the allied army under Joâo de Sousa, marquis das Minas, and Lord Galway, who in rapid succession took Alcantara, Coria, Truxillo, Placencia, Ciudad Rodrigo, and Avila, and even for a short time occupied Madrid, and of their equally rapid retreat; he never recovered sufficiently, however, to know of these movements; he gradually sank, and died at Alcantara on 9th December 1706.

The long reign of John V., who assumed the royal state at once from the regent Catherine, resembles the reign of John III. At its commencement he left the power in the hands of his father’s friend, the duke of Cadaval, who continued Dorn Pedro’s policy and prosecuted the war against Philip V. Cadaval bound the king more surely to the Anglo-Austrian party by marrying him to the archduchess Marianna, daughter of the deceased emperor Leopold I., who was escorted to Lisbon by an English fleet under Admiral Byng in 1708. Yet the war itself did not go favourably for the allies in Spain, for the Spaniards had become enthusiastic partisans of Philip V.; and in 1709 a Portuguese army under the marquis of Fronteira was beaten at Caia, while in 1711 Duguay Trouin took and sacked Rio de Janeiro, afterwards the capital of Brazil. The war languished all over Europe after the accession of the archduke Charles to the empire, and on 6th February 1715, nearly two years after the treaty of Utrecht, peace was signed between Portugal and Spain at Madrid by the secretary of state, Lopes Furtado de Mondonça, count of Côrte-Real. The king, as soon as he began to pay more attention to affairs, exhibited his attachment to the papacy, and in 1717 sent a fleet at the pope’s bidding on a crusade against the Turks, which won a naval victory off Cape Matapan. The king declined to join the war against Alberoni, and disclosed a tendency to imitate Louis XIV., especially in building. The only indication of policy he showed was his determination to maintain peace by a close alliance with Spain: his daughter Maria Barbara was married to the infant Don Ferdinand, eldest son of Philip V., who succeeded to the throne of Spain as Ferdinand VI., while the Spanish infanta Marianna was married to the Portuguese heir-apparent, Dorn Joseph. The enormous sums of money which John V. lent to the pope, to the real impoverishment of his country, brought him rewards which were of no real value, but which were such as he highly esteemed; namely, the archbishopric of [9:19:550] Lisbon was erected into a patriarchate, and the title of “Fidelissimus” or “Most Faithful” was conferred upon the kings of Portugal, to correspond with those of “Most Christian” and “Most Catholic” attributed to the kings of France and Spain respectively.

Joseph, who succeeded his father in 1750, had the merit of perceiving the pre-eminent powers of Sebastiâo de Carvalho, who governed Portugal throughout this reign, and who, under his title of the marquis of Pombal (see Pombal), ranks among the very greatest of 18th-century statesmen. In everything—in his great internal and administrative reforms, in his financial reforms, in the reorganization of the army, in the abolition of slavery, and in the great struggle with the Jesuits—Joseph supported his minister. Pombal made the king more absolute than ever, and exalted the royal prerogative while using it for purposes of reform; and in return the king maintained Pombal in power in spite of the violent protests of the priests and the opposition of his wife. Circumstances greatly helped the minister to establish an ascendency over the king’s mind: his conduct at the time of the great earthquake on 1st November 1755 secured him his high position over the other two secretaries of state; the Tavora plot gave him the influence which enabled him to overthrow the Jesuits in 1759; and the second attempt on the king’s life in 1769 strengthened his hands in his negotiations with Rome and ensured the suppression of the order in 1773. The only war in -which Portugal was engaged during this reign was caused by the close alliance λvith England, for, -when Choiseul made the Family Compact and Spain entered upon the Seven Years’ War, a Spanish army under the marquis of Sarria invaded Portugal and took Braganza and Almeida in 1762. Pombal immediately applied to England for help, when the count of Lippe-Bückeburg came over with a body of English troops and set to work to organize the Portuguese army; and, mainly owing to the brilliant services of BrigadierGeneral Burgoyne, the Spaniards were defeated at Valencia de Alcantara and Villa Velha, and peace -was made on 10th February 1763. The close of the reign was disturbed by disputes with Spain as to the possession of Sacramento in South America, which were still unsettled when King Joseph died on 20th February 1777, leaving four daughters, of whom the eldest, Donna Maria Francisca, had married the king’s brother, Dom Pedro.

The accession of Donna Maria -was the signal for the overthrow of the great marquis and the reversal of his policy. The new queen was a weak woman, and her husband, Dom Pedro, who was proclaimed king, was a weak man; coins were struck in the names of Pedro III. and Maria I., but both sovereigns were ruled by the queendowager, who hated Pombal, and eventually sentenced him never to come within twenty leagues of the court. The incapacity of his successor soon became manifest, while the queen, who was completely under the sway of her confessor, Dorn Ignacio de San Caetano, found her greatest happiness in raising and sending large sums of money to the Latin convent at Jerusalem. Such was the state of Portugal when the great crisis in the -world's history caused by the French Revolution was at hand; and, when in 1792 it became evident that affairs could no longer go on in this haphazard fashion, it was also evident that the queen was no longer fit even for the slight fatigue she had to undergo. Her brain had given way in 1788, after the successive deaths of her husband, of her eldest son Dorn Joseph, who had married his aunt, Donna Maria Benedicta, and of her confessor, and Dorn John found it necessary to take the management of affairs into his own hands, though he was not actually declared regent until 1799.

About the time that Dorn John became regent the wish to check the spread of the principles of the French Revolution, which were as much feared in Portugal as in all other Continental states, led to the great activity of Dorn Diogo Ignacio de Pina Manique, the intendantgeneral of police. He eagerly hunted down all Portuguese gentlemen suspected of encouraging French principles or of being freemasons, expelled all Frenchmen from the kingdom, and kept a jealous eye on the American consul, Edward Church, and a merchant named Jacome Ratton, whom he declared to be at the head of a republican conspiracy. Moreover, the Portuguese ministers not only combated the dreaded French principles at home, they also believed it a holy duty to join in the general war against France, and therefore a corps of 5000 men was sent into the eastern Pyrenees to serve under General John Forbes Skelater, and four ships under the marquis of Niza joined the English fleet in the Mediterranean. The Portuguese force under Forbes Skelater served in all the actions in the eastern Pyrenees, shared in the successes of General Ricardos, and in the defeats of the count de la Union and General Urrutia; but nevertheless the Spanish Government, then under the influence of Godoy, the Prince of the Peace, did not hesitate to desert Portugal and make a separate peace -with the French republic at Basel in July 1795. This naturally drove Portugal into a still closer alliance with England; and, when, after the treaty of San Ildefonso (1796), by which Spain declared war against England, and the secret convention between Pérignon and Godoy to divide Portugal between them, Spanish troops were massed on the Portuguese frontiers, an urgent supplication for help was sent to England. In response the House of Commons voted Portugal a subsidy of £200,000; a force of 6000 men was despatched under Major-General Sir Charles Stuart, which deterred the Spaniards from attempting an invasion; and the prince of Waldeck, like the count of Lippe in former days, was sent to reorganize the Portuguese army. Yet the English party was not strong enough to carry the day entirely; Sir Charles Stuart was soon withdrawn, and an effort made to secure peace with France through the mediation of Spain. But the concessions of the French party were of no avail; the First Consul -was as violently opposed to Portugal, as being a province of England, as the Convention and Directory had been, and in 1800 Lucien Bonaparte was sent to Madrid with instructions from his brother to insist on the abandonment of the English alliance, on the opening of Portuguese ports to France and the closing of them to England, on the extension of French Guiana to the Amazons, on the cession of a portion of Portugal to Spain, until the recovery from England of Trinidad, Port Mahon, and Malta, and on the payment of a large sum of money, and he was authorized to offer to Spain a corps of 15,000 Frenchmen if these hard terms -were rejected. The Portuguese ministers did reject them, and immediately Leclerc’s corps entered Spain. The campaign lasted but a few days. Olivenza and Campo Mayor fell into the hands of the Spaniards, who also won bloodless victories at Arronches and Flor da Rosa. Peace was made at Badajoz with Spain, by which Portugal ceded Olivenza, and at Paris with France, by which it consented to the extension of French Guiana to the Amazons, and promised a large indemnity. Napoleon Bonaparte was anything but satisfied with the treaty of Badajoz, and received Lucien on his return with but little favour, for his aim was utterly to destroy Portugal as a nation; and it was with a full intention to excite her to war that he sent one of the roughest and least educated of his generals, Lannes, as ambassador to Lisbon. Lannes acted fully up to his chief’s expectations: he ordered the dismissal of all the ministers who favoured England, and [9:19:551] was obeyed both from fear of France and from a dislike of England owing to her high-handed naval policy. Even this humble submission of the regent did not satisfy Napoleon, and in 1804 he replaced Lannes by Junot, whom he ordered to insist upon Portugal’s declaring war against England. Then for a time he desisted from executing his plans against the country owing to his great campaigns in Europe, and made a treaty of neutrality with the Portuguese Government. At length in 1807, having beaten Austria, Prussia, and Russia, Napoleon again turned his thoughts to his project for the annihilation of Portugal, which had become more than ever a thorn in his side, since it refused to co-operate in his Continental schemes for ruining England. He resolved at first to act with Spain and Godoy, as Pérignon had done in 1797, and on 29th October 1807 signed the treaty of Fontainebleau, by which it was arranged that Portugal should be conquered and divided into three parts: the northern portion should be given to the* king of Etruria in the place of his Italian kingdom, which Napoleon desired to annex, while the southern portion was to be formed into an independent kingdom for Godoy, and the central provinces were to be held by France until a general peace. The signature of the treaty was followed by immediate action: Junot moved with an army rapidly across Spain, and, together with a Spanish force under General Caraffa, entered Portugal from the centre, while General Taranco and General Solano with two other Spanish armies occupied the Minho and Alemtejo. With amazing rapidity Junot accomplished the march, and the Portuguese hardly knew that war was imminent until on 27th November Colonel Lecor rushed into Lisbon with the news that the French were in possession of Abrantes. This alarming intelligence unnerved the regent, who listened to the strongly-worded advice of Sir Sidney Smith, commander of the English ships in the Tagus, to abandon his kingdom for the Brazils, and leave the English to defend Portugal; and on 27th November Dorn John, after naming a council of regency, went on board the English fleet with his whole family, including the queen Maria I. The English ships had hardly left the Tagus when a small force of wearied French soldiers, who were all that remained from the terrible fatigues of the march, entered Lisbon on 30th November.

Nothing proves more certainly the widely-spread existence of what were called French principles—that is to say, democratic ideas—in Portugal than the hearty reception which Junot met with from the first. At Santarem a deputation of the freemasons of Portugal, who were there, as in other Continental countries, a secret society for the propagation of democratic principles, welcomed him; the marquis of Alorna with the army instantly submitted to him; and the council of regency, knowing the temper of the citizens, made no attempt to hold Lisbon against him. But Junot showed no desire to grant the Portuguese a constitution, and after seizing all the money in the royal treasury he divided the country into military governments under his generals, issuing, on 1st February a proclamation that the house of Braganza had ceased to reign. He then began to hope that he himself might succeed the Braganzas, and for this purpose sought to conciliate the Portuguese by reducing the requisition demanded by Napoleon from forty millions of francs to twenty millions, and commenced a negotiation with the radical or French party in Portugal through Luca de Scabra da Silva to induce them to send a petition or deputation to the emperor, asking for Junot to be their king. But his attempts at conciliation were of no avail; and, when the Spanish general Bellesta, who had succeeded Taranco at Oporto, seized the French governor, General Quesnel, declared for the regent, and marched into Galicia, Junot departed from Lisbon, leaving the city in the hands of a regency, headed by the bishop of Oporto. The bishop at once sent to England for help, and encouraged fresh revolts all over the kingdom, till nearly every city in Portugal rose against the French and established its own junta of government. Meanwhile the English Government had willingly listened to the request of the bishop of Oporto, and ordered the small army which had been collected at Cork, under the command of Lieutenant-General Sir Arthur Wellesley, for an expedition to South America, to proceed to Portugal. Sir Arthur landed at the mouth of the Mondego river, advanced towards Lisbon, and, after defeating Laborde’s division at Roliça on 17th August 1808, routed Junot himself at Vimieiro on 21st August. These victories were followed by the convention of Cintra, by which Junot agreed to vacate Portugal and give up all the fortresses in his possession; this convention, however disappointing from a military point of view, was eminently satisfactory to the Portuguese people, who saw themselves as speedily delivered from the French as they had been conquered by them. The regency was again established, and at once despatched Domingos Antonio de Sousa Coutinho, a brother of the count of Lin-hares, to London, to ask that an English minister with full powers should be sent to Lisbon, and that Sir Arthur Wellesley might be appointed to reorganize their army. Their requests were complied with: the Right Honourable J. C. Villiers was sent to Lisbon, and, as Sir Arthur Wellesley could not be spared, Major-General Beresford, who had learned Portuguese when governor of Madeira, which he had occupied in the preceding year, was sent to command their army. Portugal, however, was not yet safe from the French; Sir John Moore’s advance to Salamanca and his retreat to Corunna had left the country but slightly garrisoned, and, in spite of the braggadocio of the bishop, Oporto quickly fell into the hands of Marshal Soult. Fortunately Soult, like Junot, -was led away by the idea of becoming king of Portugal, and did not advance on Lisbon, thus giving time for Sir Arthur Wellesley again to arrive in the country with a powerful army. In the interval the Portuguese, in spite of some spirited fights by General Silveira, had shown how little they could do in their disorganized state, and the English Government determined to send out English officers to organize them and to take 10,000 Portuguese into English pay. Meanwhile Sir Arthur Wellesley had driven Soult from Oporto, had advanced into Spain, and won the battle of Talavera. From these successes of the English general it is pitiable to turn to the Portuguese regency. With the departure of the king all the able men of the royal party seemed to have left the country; the leaders of the radical party were either in disgrace or had fled to France; and none were left to compose the regency save a set of intriguers, whose chief idea was to get as much money from England as possible. The best part of the nation had entered the army, hence Marshal Beresford, aided by the adjutantgeneral Manuel de Brito Mousinho, soon organized a force which at Busaco proved itself worthy to fight beside the English soldiery. The regency got from bad to worse, till neither Beresford nor Wellington could work with it, and the English cabinet had to demand that Sir Charles Stuart (son of General Sir Charles Stuart), their ambassador at Lisbon, should receive a place upon it. His great ability and tact soon made him master, and a certain portion of the money sent by England to pay the Portuguese troops did then find its way to its proper destination. Yet the regency, even when thus strengthened, failed to make itself popular; and that there was a large radical party in Lisbon is sufficiently proved by the deputation of eighteen journalists to the Azores in September 1810. The troubles of Portugal were not yet over; the most formidable invasion [9:19:552] of all was to come. During the time of Masséna’s campaign in Portugal the Portuguese showed the valour of a truly heroic nation. When Lord Wellington determined to retire to the lines of Torres Vedras, he commanded all the peasants to desert their fields and leave nothing for the French to subsist upon, and they obeyed him with touching fidelity. The Portuguese troops fully proved their value as soldiers when led and trained by such English generals as Pack and Ashworth, Bradford and John Hamilton, on every battlefield in the Peninsula and the south of France, and especially at Salamanca and the Nivelle. They well deserved the praise bestowed upon them by Wellington and Beresford, and the enthusiastic reception which they met with when they returned home in 1814.

Shortly after the conclusion of the war, in 1816, the mad queen Maria I. died, and the regent succeeded to the throne as King John VI. The English Government earnestly pressed him to return to Lisbon, where dissensions in the regency and the universal discontent urgently summoned him. But the new king was perpetually hampered by his intriguing and ambitious wife, Cariota Joaquina, who, in order to raise a party in her favour, had as early as 1805 promised a constitution to the Portuguese, and in 1812 had plotted to become independent queen of Brazil. The regency had become intensely unpopular, for Sir Charles Stuart and Marshal Beresford ruled despotically; and the mass of the people, who had been willing to endure the despotism of the English during the terrible war for existence, as well as the army, which had willingly obeyed the English officers on the field of battle, grew weary of foreign rule in time of peace and raised the cry of Portugal for the Portuguese. Directly after the war, in 1817, the first rising took place in Lisbon in the form of a pronunciamento of General Gomes Freire de Andrade, who had commanded the Portuguese contingent in the Russian campaign of 1812; but it was instantly and cruelly suppressed by Beresford and the regency, and the general and eleven others were executed. Yet the radical party was by no means conquered, and when Beresford went to Rio de Janeiro in 1820 advantage was taken of his absence by the people of Oporto, headed by certain officers in the garrison, to raise the cry for reform; the regency, unable to act without Beresford, gave way before a similar rising at Lisbon; the English officers were everywhere expelled; a new regency was proclaimed; Beresford was not allowed to land when he returned from Brazil; and a constituent assembly was summoned. The new assembly, consisting largely of men of the most radical opinions, at once abolished the Inquisition and the relics of feudalism, and proceeded to draw up an impracticable constitution, which showed that they had studied the glowing speeches of the men of the French Revolution and had not profited by a knowledge of their mistakes. Prussia, Austria, and Russia withdrew their ambassadors, and England insisted on John’s returning to his kingdom. He accordingly left the Brazils to the government of his elder son Pedro, and set out for Portugal, where in 1822, at the earnest request of that son, he solemnly swore to obey the new constitution. He was at once met by the opposition of the queen and his younger son Dorn Miguel, who refused to recognize the constitution; in consequence they were expelled from Lisbon. This event, with the invasion of Spain by the French to put down the rebellion of 1823, encouraged Francisco da Silveira, count of Amarante, to raise a pronunciamento in Tras-os-Montes; but the king at Lisbon declared, amid loud applause, that the constitution of 1822 was abrogated and his own absolutism restored, and he appointed the count of Palmella, the head of the English or constitutional party, to be his minister. But the absolutist party did not aim at a new form of constitutional government; they were desirous to reinstate the old absolutism. The queen and Dorn Miguel headed a new plot; the king’s friend, the marquis of Loulé, was assassinated; Palmella was imprisoned and the king himself shut up in his palace. The united action of the foreign ministers who had remained in Lisbon freed the king; the new insurrection was suppressed; Palmella was again appointed minister; and the king, with the two chief conspirators, the queen and Dom Miguel, left Portugal once more for the Brazils. In the following year (1826) John VI. died, leaving by his will his daughter, the infanta Isabel Maria, as regent, to the great disappointment of Dorn Miguel, who had returned to Portugal with the expectation of receiving it as his inheritance, while his brother Dorn Pedro ruled in Brazil.

The next twenty-five years are the darkest in the whole history of Portugal and the most complicated to analyse, for the establishment of parliamentary government was no easy task; it is almost impossible to follow the rapid changes which succeeded each other, and quite impossible to understand the varying motives of the different statesmen and generals. The keynote to the whole series of the disturbances is to be found in the influence of the army. Beresford’s creation was a grand fighting machine; but armies, and more particularly generals, are almost certain to intrigue in times of peace. On ascending the united thrones Dom Pedro IV. proceeded to draw up a charter containing the bases of a moderate parliamentary government and sent it over to Portugal by the English minister, Sir Charles Stuart, and then abdicated the crown of Portugal in favour of his daughter, Donna Maria da Gloria, a child only seven years old, on condition that she married his brother Dom Miguel, who was to recognize the new constitution. The charter was received with joy by the parliamentary party, and Palmella became prime minister; but in 1827 the king foolishly appointed Dom Miguel to be regent in Portugal. This ambitious prince was exceedingly popular with the old nobility, the army, and the poor; and, having declared himself absolute king, he drove the whole constitutional or chartist party—Palmella, Saldanha, Villa Flor, Sampaio, and their adherents—into exile. They fled to England, where the young queen then was, but, although they found popular opinion strongly in their favour, they found also that the duke of Wellington and his Tory ministry highly approved of Dorn Miguel’s behaviour, and that they persisted in confounding the moderate and the radical parties, and in believing that Palmella was a democrat. Meanwhile the reign of Dorn Miguel had become a reign of terror, and a new movement was begun by the conjoined chartist and radical parties, who respectively advocated the charter of 1826 and the constitution of 1822, but who sank their differences to oppose Dorn Miguel. The island of Terceira (Azores) had never submitted to this prince, and there in 1829 the marquis of Palmella, the count of Villa Flor, and José Antonio Guerreiro declared themselves regents for the young queen; and on 11th August 1830 they defeated in Praia Bay the fleet sent against them by Dorn Miguel. This victory was the first ray of hope to the chartist party; all who could get away from Portugal hastened to the Azores; and in 1831 Dorn Pedro, having resigned the imperial crown of Brazil to his infant son, came to London to join his daughter and prepare for a vigorous struggle against his brother. He met with acquiescence, if not encouragement, from the Liberal Government of Earl Grey, and managed to raise a large loan; then he betook himself with all the troops he could raise to the Azores, where he appointed the count of Villa Flor general-in-chief and Captain Sartorius of the English navy commander of the fleet. In July 1832 Dorn Pedro arrived at Oporto with 7500 men, being enthusiastically welcomed [9:19:553] by the citizens; Dom Miguel instantly laid siege to the city. The siege was a terrible one; want within the walls and cholera among the besiegers decimated the armies, and the only real success gained was the victory of Sartorius over the fleet of Dorn Miguel on 11th October. In 1833 more vigorous action began; Major-General Joào Carlos Saldanha de Oliveira e Daun, count of Saldanha, an old officer of Beresford’s and a member of the Palmella Government in 1825, took the command in Oporto and beat off the French general Bourmont, who had been engaged by I)om Miguel to command his forces; the count of Villa Flor sailed from Oporto to Algarves, defeated General Telles Jordâo, and after a triumphal march northwards occupied Lisbon; and Captain Charles Napier, who had succeeded Sartorius, destroyed Dorn Miguel’s fleet off Cape St Vincent in 1833. In this year Queen Maria came to Lisbon and was received with transports of delight, while Dorn Pedro as regent again proclaimed the charter of 1826. The year 1834 was one of unbroken success for the chartists; England and France recognized the queen, and the Spanish ministry of Queen Isabella, knowing Dorn Miguel to be a Carlist, sent two corps under Generals Rodil and Serrano to the help of Dorn Pedro. Saldanha defeated the forces of the usurper at Torres Novas and Alamoster; Napier reduced Beira; Villa Flor, who had been made duke of Terceira, reduced Tras-os-Montes and won a victory at Asseiceira; Sâ de Bandeira reduced Alemtejo; the combined Spanish and Portuguese armies surrounded the rest of Dorn Miguel’s adherents at Evora Monte; and Dorn Miguel himself capitulated on 26th May. By the convention of Evora Monte the usurper, on condition of receiving a pension, promised to leave Portugal for ever; and the cortes at Lisbon not only declared him and his heirs ineligible for the throne but forbade them to return to Portugal under penalty of death. This same cortes attempted to arrange the finances, and abolished the orders of the friars, who had hitherto kept alive the party of rebellion in the villages, and finally, at Dorn Pedro’s request —for he felt his health failing—declared the queen of age on 18th September 1834. Dorn Pedro, who had throughout been the heart and soul of his daughter’s party, retired to Queluz (near Lisbon), where he died six days afterwards from the effects of his great labours and fatigues.

The death of Dorn Pedro deprived Queen Maria II., who was now only fifteen, of her greatest support, but a very strong ministry was formed, with the duke of Palmella as president and the duke of Terceira at the war office. Such a ministry might have lasted for a long time, but neither the queen, the nobility, nor the people understood the principles of real constitutional government, and the army was a constant source of danger. Members of different parties, while not conceiving that all alike loved Portugal, believed sincerely in their own opinions: the party in power proscribed and exiled its opponents, while the party in opposition invariably appealed to arms instead of seeking to obtain office by legitimate parliamentary means. In addition, the country was ravaged by bands of brigands, who called themselves “Miguelites,” and who perpetually escaped into Spain when attacked in force; and, as each Government refused to recognize or pay interest upon the loans raised by its predecessors, the financial credit of Portugal soon fell to a very low ebb in the money markets of Europe. It is unprofitable to examine here the principles of the chief statesmen of the time as new Governments quickly succeeded each other; it will be sufficient to notice only the chief pronunciamentos and appeals to arms, and to remark the gradual approach to real parliamentary government. Queen Maria da Gloria’s reign is one of violent party struggles, for they can hardly be called civil wars, so little did they involve, and that of King Luis the reign of definite and peaceable parliamentary government. In her earlier years the queen was chiefly under the influence of her stepmother, the second wife of Dorn Pedro, Amelia of Bavaria, and in 1835 she married the queen-dowager’s brother, Augustus Charles Eugène Napoleon, duke of Leuchtenberg, second son of Eugène Beauharnais by the princess Augusta of Bavaria, who died two months after his marriage, in March 1835. In the following January Maria married Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, nephew of Leopold, the first king of the Belgians; and it was his nomination to the post of commander-in-chief that brought about the first appeal to arms. In September 1836 Fernando Soares da Caldeira headed a pronunciamento in Lisbon for the re-establishment of the constitution of 1822, which was completely successful, and resulted in the drawing up of a new constitution. The constitution of 1838, which was really that of 1822 slightly modified, managed to work till 1842, when one of the radical ministers, Antonio Bermudo de Costa Cabral, suddenly declared the charter of 1826 at Oporto. The duke of Terceira headed a successful pronunciamento in favour of the charter, and came into office with Costa Cabral as home secretary and virtual prime minister. Costa Cabral, who in 1845 was created count of Thomar, made himself very acceptable to the queen, and, interpreting the charter in the most royalist sense, even attempted to check the freedom of the press. It was now the turn of the radicals or Septembrists to have recourse to arms: after an attempt to place Saldanha in office, the opposition broke out into open insurrection under the viscount of Sâ de Bandeira, the count of Bomfim, and the count das Antas. This new insurrection is known as the War of Maria da Fonte or “patuleia,” and was not suj>- pressed until the conclusion of the convention of Granada on 29th June 1847, when a general amnesty was declared, Saldanha being continued in power. Queen Maria da Gloria died on 15th November 1853, and her husband, the king-consort, Dorn Ferdinand II., assumed the regency until his eldest son Dorn Pedro V. came of age.

The era of peaceful parliamentary government which succeeded the stormy reign of Queen Maria II. has been one of prosperity for Portugal, and much of that peace and prosperity is due to the great literary and historical revival which is signalized by the names of Joâo Baptista de Almeida Garrett and Antonio Feliciano de Castilho, of Alexandre Herculano de Carvalho e Araujo and Luis Augusto Rebello da Silva. Men were not wanting in the early part of the 19th century to advocate the formation of an Iberian republic or kingdom, comprising the whole of the Peninsula; but the revival of national pride in recalling the glorious past of Portuguese history, which has been the work alike of Herculano and Almeida Garrett in diferent lines, has breathed afresh the spirit of patriotism into a people who had been almost wearied out by continual pronunciamentos. The only political event of any importance during the reign of Dorn Pedro V., who came of age I and assumed the government in 1855, and who in 1857 married the princess Stephanie of Hohenzollern, was the affair of the “Charles et Georges.” This French ship was engaged in what was undoubtedly the slave-trade, though slightly disguised, off the coast of Africa, when it was seized by the authorities of Mozambique, and, in accordance with the laws and treaties against the slave-trade, its captain, Roussel, was condemned to two years’ imprisonment. The emperor Napoleon III., glad to have a chance of posing before the French people, and counting on his close alliance with England, instantly sent a large fleet to the Tagus under Admiral Lavaud, and demanded compensation, which, as England showed no signs of assistance, Portugal was compelled to pay. The whole country, especially[9:19:554] the city of Lisbon, was ravaged by cholera and yellow fever during this reign, itself evidence of the extreme neglect of all sanitary precautions; and on 11th November 1^61 the king, who refused to quit the pestilence-stricken capital, died of cholera, and was speedily followed to the grave by two of his brothers, Dorn Ferdinand and Dorn John.

At the time of Dorn Pedro’s death his brother and heir, Dorn Luis, was travelling on the Continent; and his father, Dorn Ferdinand, again assumed the regency until his son’s return, soon after which Luis married Maria Pia of Savoy, daughter of Victor Emmanuel, king of Italy. The new king followed his brother’s policy and allowed his ministers to fight their battles in the chambers without interference from himself. During his reign the old combatants of the reign of Maria da Gloria died off one by one,—Palmella, Terceira, Thomar, Saldanha. and Sâ de Bandeira. Their successors in political leadership, the duke of Loulé, Aguiar, the marquis of Avila, and Antonio Manuel Fontes Pereira de Mello, though not inferior in administrative ability, always avoided an appeal to arms, and therefore, if they do not contribute striking pages to the history of Portugal, certainly contributed more to the prosperity of the country. The last pronunciamento, or rather attempt at a pronunciamento, of the last survivor of Queen Maria’s turbulent statesmen, the duke of Saldanha, in 1870, only proved how entirely the day of pronunciamentos had gone by. He conceived the notion that the duke of Loulé, as a freemason and an advanced progressist, was a favourite with the king, after the manner of the duke of Polignac and Charles X. of France; so, recalling a few such historical examples to the king’s mind, he insisted on the duke’s dismissal, and threatened an appeal to arms. The king, perceiving that Saldanha was in earnest, and knowing the great influence of the old man, consented to dismiss the duke of Loulé. After keeping Saldanha himself in office for four months, Luis sent him as ambassador to London notwithstanding his eighty years, where he could do no mischief, and where he died in 1876. The steady prosperity of Portugal has been largely due to the present form of government based on the charter of 1826, as modified in 1852, and is borne witness to by the reconstitution of the House of Peers in 1878 from an hereditary assembly to one of life peers. It is a notable fact that the two loans raised by the Portuguese Government in 1880 and in 1882 were quickly subscribed, and mainly within Portugal itself. Of recent years much attention has been drawn to the Portuguese settlements in Africa, since the opening up of the interior has made them of vast importance on both the east and the west coast. The king, ministers, and people of Portugal are fully aware of the new vista to their prosperity thus disclosed to them, and the Portuguese travellers Serpa Pinto, Roberto Ivens, and Brito Capello have taken an important share in the explorations which have opened up the interior of Africa and paved the way for its development. Public works, however, have not been neglected, and Fontes Pereira de Mello, the leader of the “regener-ador” party, who has been prime minister three times— from 1871 to 1877, from 1878 to 1882, and from 1883— has steadily improved and extended the railway and telegraph systems, and carried out the more difficult labours of sanitary reform. Education also has not been neglected, and a good system of secondary and primary education has been established, mainly owing to the labours of the Portuguese poet, Antonio Feliciano de Castilho. The share taken by the leaders of the great literary and historical revival—which dates from the conclusion of the civil wars of 1846 and the publication of the first volume of Herculano’s History of Portugal in 1848—in Portuguese political and social reform is a marked feature of the modern parliamentary life of the country; and not only have the poets Almeida Garrett and Mendes Leal and the historian Rebello da Silva held office, but many of the most promising of the new generation of literary men, such as Latino Coelho and Pinheiro Chagas, have distinguished themselves in politics. Few countries so well realize the advantages of a constitutional and parliamentary form of government as Portugal; socialism possesses there a reforming, not a revolutionary force; unity of pride in their country inspired by great wτiters has made the modern Portuguese ambitious to revive the glories of the past, and united men of all shades of opinion in a common patriotism. The Camoens celebration of 1880 showed that the Brazilians were still proud of their mother-country, and that the Portuguese race all over the world was ready to develop new energy and perseverance, and to prove its true descent from the men who under Affonso Henriques overthrew the Moors, who under John I. and John IV. rejected the rule of the Spaniards, under Affonso de Albuquerque and Joâo de Castro conquered the East, and who by the voyage of Vasco de Gama created a new era in the history of the world.

Bibliography.— The best continuous history of Portugal is still that of Heinrich Schaefer, in Heeren and Ukert’s Europäische Staats-Geschichte, 1840-46, partly translated into Portuguese by J. L. Domingues de Mendonça (Lisbon, 1842-47), which quite eclipsed the very ordinary works of Diogo Lemos (20 vols., 1786- 1820), Sousa Monteiro (10 vols., 1838), and J. F. Pereira (3 vols., 1846-48), and the two chief English and French histories up to that date,—J. Dunham’s (along with that of Spain) in Lardner’s Cabinet Cyclopaedia (1838-43), and Bouchot’s, in Duruy’s Histoire Universelle (1846). After the publication of Schaefer’s History, and not uninfluenced by it, Alexandre Herculano commenced his great work, the Historia de Portugal (4 vols., 1848-53), in which he overthrew old legends and treated history scientifically. Owing, however, to the persecution and libellous pamphlets of such men as Francisco Recreio, J. D. Fonseca Pereira, and A. C. Pereira, he closed his work at the year 1279; but from 1854 to 1857 he published his Da Origem e Estabeletimcnto da Inquisiçâo cm Portugal, which also caused a great outcry. Nevertheless his example was followed, and a series of extremely good histories has been issued during the last twenty years, notably L. A. Rebello da Silva’s Historia de Portugal pendente XVI. c XVII. Seculos (5 vols., 1860-71), which covers the failure of Dorn Sebastian and the revolution of 1640; J. Μ. Latino Coelho’s Historia de Portugal desde os fins do XVIII. Scculo até 1814 (1874); J. F. Fonseca Benevides’s Las Rainhas de Portugal (1878); and the extremely interesting and illustrated Historia de Portugal in 37 parts by Antonio Ennes, B. Ribeiro, Edouard Vidal, G. Lobato, L. Cordeiro, and Pinheiro Chagas (1877-83). The new historical school, headed by the viscount of Santarem, has also spent much time upon the conquests of the Portuguese in India, and Herculano edited the Roteiro de Vasco de Gama; nor must the admirable editions of the old Portuguese navigators and travellers published by the Hakluyt Society be omitted, or the well-known Life of Prince Henry of Portugal, by R. H. Major (London, 1868), which has been translated into Portuguese by J. A. Ferreira Brandâo (1876). The new school has paid attention to the publication of the early chronicles of Portugal, and since 1856 several volumes of Portugallise Monumenta Historica have been issued by the Lisbon Academy of Sciences under the direction of Herculano; but this work was not neglected by their predecessors, as appears in the Colleccâo dos Livros ineditos de Historia Portugueza, edited by J. F. Corrêa da Serra for the academy (11 vols., 1790-1804), and the Colleccâo dos principaes Auctores da Historia Portugueza, published in the same manner (1806). Foedera, too, were not neglected during the present century; there exist two good collections: one, commenced by the viscount of Santarem as Quadro elementar das Relacδcs politicas e diplomaticas de Portugal, and continued by Rebello da Silva for the academy as Corpo diplomatico Portugucz, extends from the early days of the monarchy till 1640 (36 vols., 1856-78); the other, which is practically a continuation of the first, is called a Colleccâo dos Actos publicos celebrados entre a Coroa de Portugal e as mais Potentias desde I64O até ao Presente, commenced by J. Ferreira Borges de Castro, and continued by J. Judice Biker (8 vols., 1856-66). Two works on constitutional history here deserve mention, Memorias para a Historia das Inquiracδes dos primeiros Reinados de Portugal, published (1816) by the Lisbon College of Diplomatics, and Memorias para a Historia e Theoria das Cortes, by the viscount of Santarem (Lisbon, 1828). Before noticing books treating exclusively of the history of the present century, a few special works and articles ought to be enumerated, such as the chevalier de Jant’s Relations de la France avec le Portugal [9:19:555] an temps de Mazarin, by Jules Tessier (Paris, 1877); Vertot’s Revolutions de Portugal (Paris, 1678); Miguel d’Antas, Les faux J). Sebastien (Paris, 1866); R. Carte’s History of the Revolutions of Portugal from the Foundation of that Kingdom to the year 16ΊΊ, with Letters of Sir R. Southwell during his Embassy there to the Duke of Ormond (London, 1740), which are the best books on their respective subjects, and two articles in vol. ii. of the Annacs das Sciencias Moraes e Politicas, “D. Joâo II. e la Nobreza,” by L. A. Rebello da Silva, and “Apontamentos para a Historia da Conquista de Portugal por Filippe II.,” by A. P. Lopes de Mendonça. The literature of the history of the last hundred years requires careful selection; the best work is, however, the Historia da Guerra civil e do Estabelecimento do Governo parlcmentar em Portugal, by Simiâo José da Luz Soriano (8 vols., 1866-82); for the Peninsular War see, besides Napier’s history, the Historia ger al da Invasào dos Francczes em Portugal, by Accursio das Neves (Lisbon, 1810-11), and Excerptos historicos relativos a Guerra denominada da Peninsula, e as anteriores de 1801, de Roussillon e Cataluila, by Claudio de Chaby (1863). The period of the war of Doni Miguel is best seen in the Memorias para a Historia do tempo que duron a Usurpaçâo de D. Miguel, by J. L. Freire de Carvalho (Lisbon, 1841-43); the Historia da L·iberdade em Portugal, by J. G. Barros Cunha (Lisbon, 1869); The Civil War in Portugal, and the Siege of Oporto by a British Officer of Hussars [Colonel Badcock] (1835); and The Wars of Succession of Spain and Portugal, by William Bollaert (vol. i., 1870). For the ensuing period consult the Despachos e Correspondencia do Duque de Palmella (3 vols., 1851-54); the Cor respondentia official de Conde de Carneira com o Duque de Palmella (1874); and the Memoirs of the Duke of Saldanha, by the count of Carnota (2 vols., 1880).

PART III.—LITERATURE.

Portugal has a distinct literature as well as a distinct history, and one which is intimately bound up with the growth of the nation. The biographies, histories, and travels of the 16th century are unrivalled of their age in brilliancy and vigour, while the poetry of a land where all men are singers is not only admirable in itself but illustrates a continuous and undecided struggle between native and foreign schools. The period of the growth of national independence and of the victories over the Moors was that of the brilliant poetry of the Portuguese troubadours, which became at last truly characteristic; but the brilliancy speedily died aλvay with peace and national unity, to be revived in the heroic period of Vasco de Gama and Albuquerque. For in the 16th century, after the classical school of Sa de Miranda had given a polish to the language, the national epics of Camoens and his followers were produced, which might have yielded more lasting results had not the Spanish dominion paralysed all national life. In more modern times the reaction against mere imitations of foreign literature has resulted in the formation of a new native school by which much good work both in poetry and in historical research has already been accomplished.

12th to 14th Century.— The Portuguese, Gallegan, and Bable dialects are subdivisions of that form of the Lingua Romana Rustica which was spoken in Galicia and the western provinces of the Iberian Peninsula, and which until the 15th'century was the literary language of Castile itself. The remains of the early poets are necessarily scanty, but they are sufficient to show that the courtly troubadours of Portugal and Castile were certainly not inferior to the more noted singers of Provence. In some respects they were even superior, since, not being tied to the forms of a merely literary language such as the Provençal, they were able to borrow both form and matter from a vigorous national poetry which can be traced through the different races which successively occupied Portugal. The “alalâla,” which afterwards developed into the “aravia,” the earliest form of the epic, is probably a legacy from the original Turanian inhabitants; the “guayado,” a short lyric with the refrain “ay” or “guai,” was derived from their Celtic successors; the “cantos de ledino ’ are evidences of the Roman conquest, which in turn gave place to the “chacones” or dance-songs of the Visigoths; while during the Arab dominion the sensuous “serranilhas” and “cantos de amigo” found a place in the family “cancioneiros,” which were then compiled in imitation of the divans or tribal songs of the ruling race. This national poetry, however, was for long affected in its literary form by foreign influences. From the beginning of the reign of Affonso Henriques (1112) to the - death of Dorn Sancho II. (1248) the court was under direct Provençal influence; anditisnot improbable that in!146 the celebrated troubadour Marcabrun was himself attached to the suite of Donna Matilda on her marriage with Affonso Henriques, since he was certainly a visitor at the court in 1147. The poets Egas Moniz Coelho and Gonçalo Herminguez are commonly, though erroneously, referred to the time of Affonso Henriques, who was himself a poet; but the name (and poem) of only one undoubtedly Portuguese troubadour of this period has survived, Joao Soares de Panha (1145-1204). The history of Galician literature properly belongs to that of Spain, but it is important to remember that Portugal is perhaps even more than Castile the heir of its early efforts. Amongst the Galician poets who frequented the court of Sancho I. (1185-1211) and formed a strong opposition to the Italo-Provençal school were Affonso Gomez, Fernam Goncalves de Senabria, and Joao Soares de Paiva. The most famous of their Provençal rivals, who doubtless were the more readily welcomed owing to the king’s marriage with a daughter of Raymond Berenger 1V., count of Provence and king of Aragon, were Peire Vidal, Peire Valeira, and Gavaudan 0 Velho, who in a “sirvente” written about 1210 incited the Christians to a crusade against the Moors. Affonso III. (1248-1279) returned from his residence at the court of St Louis of France imbued with northern rather than with southern sentiments, and consequently during his reign French influences prevailed. The nobles who had accompanied him were “trouvères” rather than “troubadours” and to one of them, Affonso Lopes de Bayam, belongs the honour of writing the first Portuguese gesta, a Gesta de Maldizer. Other celebrated poets of this Franco-Provençal school were the “privados,” or court poets, Joâo de Aboim, the author of several sirventes and tensons, but, like De Bayam, the writer also of cantos de amigo and cantos de ledino, Fernâo Garcia Esgaravunha, and Joâo Garcia o Pinto, his brother. The privados were in their turn satirized by Martim Moxa and Lourenço and Diogo Pezelho, who belonged to the less privileged class of “segreis,” a term applied to those singers who wandered from court to court. The king’s songs have been lost, or at least cannot be identified, but he is reputed to have been no mean poet, and a sirvente against Alphonso X. of Castile, which appears from internal evidence to have been written by him, is still extant. To this period also belonged the privados Fernâo Fernandes Cogominho, the writer of cantos de amigo and serranilhas, and Estevam Coelho, of whose works two lovely serranilhas remain of the purest Galician form and feeling. The works of these poets show that, notwithstanding foreign influence, the national forms had already obtained some degree of favour at court. Similarity in the literary language led to considerable intercourse between Portugal and Castile, and the Galicians Pero da Ponte and Affonso Eanes de Coton were entertained by Affonso III., while the Portuguese poets Pero Gomes Barroso, Payo Gomes Charrinho, and Gonçalo Eanes do Vinhal enjoyed the patronage of Alphonso the Wise. On the accession of Diniz (1279-1325) the court literature showed the decided southern and Provençal tendencies of this king, who from the number, variety, and beauty of his songs was himself the greatest poet of his time. Educated by Aymeric d’Ebrard of Cahors, afterwards bishop of Coimbra, he at first affected the mannerisms of the decaying school of Provence. With the courts of Love which he introduced came the Limousin decasyllabic in place of the national octosyllabic metre, and the ancient forms were lost in the intricacies of the ritournelle. This king’s songs are marked by an exaggerated subjectivism, but among them quaint and graceful ‘ ‘ pastorellas” are found, full of poetic life and truth, which show that the king was not blind to the beauty of his people’s lyrics. Admiration led to imitation, and the close of his reign is marked by a distinct literary revival of the national poetry, which at his hands received a polish it had somewhat lacked before. The effects of Diniz’s influence pervade the whole of Portuguese poetry, for not only was he in his pastorellas the forerunner of the great pastoral school, but by sanctifying to literary use the national storehouse of song he perpetuated among his people, even to the present day, lyric forms of great beauty. Dorn Diniz completely overshadows the poets who were his courtiers and contemporaries, but amongst them the most notable were Estevam da Guarda, Ayras Peres Veyturon, Ruy Gonçalves, Joâo Eanes, and Joâo de Guilharda, though the last-named was rather a musician than a poet. Dorn Affonso Sanches, a natural son of Dorn Diniz, wrote partly in the Limousin and partly in the Galician style, and another son, Dorn Pedro, Conde de Barcellos, who compiled a “livro das cantigas” and a “nobiliario” or peerage, was the author of several poems, but in an affected strain, which marked the approaching decay of lyric poetry. With the reign of Affonso IV. (1325-1357) began the reaction of the Castilian language against the Portuguese, but the quarrels of Ferdinand (1367-1383) with Henry II. of Castile were the fortunate cause of the formation of a second national school. For amongst its founders were the Galician poets who took refuge at the court of Portugal, and who were followers of Macias and Padron, including Vasco Pires de Camoes, ancestor of the great Luis, while to this period must be properly assigned the poems of Egas Moniz Coelho and Gonçalo Herminguez.

Epic poetry was in Portugal as in Provence a later literary development than lyric. The popular aravias must have been numerous, to judge from the remains which are still found in the Azores and in the provinces of Beira and Algarves; and to the 13th century may be referred the Loenda de Santa Pria and the Cancäo do Figueiral. In its literary form the Breton “lai” was [9:19:556] known to Dom Pedro, brother of AfΓonso II. (1211-1223), and a few poems in this style with music attached were written by him. The Roman de Brut is also quoted by Diniz, but it was through the marriage of John I. with Philippa of Lancaster (1387) that a knowledge of the Arthurian cycle spread through the Peninsula and led to the popularity of the Prophecies of Merlin and kindred works down to the 16th century. The patriotic pride of the people, which had before found vent in the aravias or tales of contests with the Arabs, sought a new literary expression for the rising national greatness, and the parent of Camoes’s great epic is the poem in which Alfonso Giraldes celebrates the victory won by the united armies of Portugal and Castile over the Moors at the battle of the Salado (1340). Only a small portion is extant, but it shows considerable vigour and foreshadows the development which national pride was afterwards to take in the Lusiads.

The revolt against the subjectivism of lyric poetry which appeared in the narrative spirit of the epic showed itself now in another form, and to Alfonso IV. belongs the credit of fully appreciating the new tendencies. Acting under his instructions, Vasco de Lobeira (d. 1403) became the author of the first Portuguese novel by turning into prose the romance of Arnadis of Gaul, which led the way for a host of imitations bearing a similar title. The historical records of this period are comprised chiefly in the Chronica da Conquista do Algarve, the Livra velho das Linhagens, and the Nobiliario do Collegio dos Nobres. The theological tendencies of the people are aptly illustrated by works which, although in Latin, deserve mention. They are the Concordantiae Morales and Interpretatio.Mystica by St Anthony of Lisbon (1195-1231), and the writings of Cardinal Alvaro Paes (d. 1353). The most learned scholar, however, of this period was Pedro Hispano, who became Pope John XXL (d. 1277), and whose universal learning recalled the days of the great schoolmen.

15th Century. — During this century lyric poetry was under the increasing influence of the Spanish school and of its leader Juan de Mena, whose praises were sung in some couplets by the infante Dorn Pedro, son of J ohn I. The chief imitators of this style were Luis de Azevedo, Ayres Telles (d. 1515), and Diogo Brandâo (d. 1530). The Arthurian romances of Dom Eurives and Branca-Flor maybe referred to this century; and the poems on the death of the infante Dom Pedro by Luis de Azevedo, and on the death of John II. by Diogo Brandâo exhibit the literary form of the epic. The constable, son of Dom Pedro, felt the influence of the Italian Renaissance, and consequently became the founder of the Dantesque or allegorical school. His Satyra da felice e infelice Vida is an allegorical piece of some merit, but a better specimen of this style is the Visào by Duarte de Brito, a compound of the Roman de la Rose and the Divina Commedia. The Fingimento de Amore by Fernâo Brandâo also possesses many beauties.

The principal prose works of the time are the Book of the Chase written for John I. (1383-1433), the vivid and interesting Chronicles of Fernâo Lopes (1380-1459), the Froissart of Portugal, and the Chronicles of Gomes Eanes de Azurara (d. 1473), Buy de Pina (1440-1520), and Duarte Galvâo (1445-1517). King Edward himself (1433-1438) was the author of The Faithful Councillor and Instructions in Horsemanship, while a Treatise on Tactics with several other works showed the powers of Affbnso V. (1438-1481) as a general mathematician and natural philosopher, the cultivation of which may have been in part due to the lessons learned from the Cyropaedia translated for him by Vasco de Lucena.

16th and 17th Centuries.— The golden age of Portuguese literature had now arrived, and to Bernardim Ribeiro (c. 1500) is due the honour of founding its characteristic school of romantic pastoral poetry. The χ∙ivers and mountains of his native land are the natural framework of a poet’s fancy, and the revival of classical learning showed him in the Eclogues of Virgil a model which he was not slow to imitate. His Eclogues, written in “redondilhas” (octosyllabic nine or ten-lined stanzas), are accordingly the earliest in modern Europe, and, while replete with the charms and conceits of versification of the troubadours, show a truly poetic love of nature. He was also the writer of the first “sextinas” in redondilhas, and of many beautiful cantigas and elegies. To the same school, which was now the representative of all national feeling, belong Christovâo Falcâo, whose smaller poems are quite equal to those of Ribeiro, Garcia de Resende (1470-1554), compiler of the Cancionciro Geral, a magnificent collection of poems by almost three hundred writers, beginning with Alfonso Henriques, Gil Vicente (1470-1536), Jorge Ferreira de Vasconcellos (d. 1585), and Fernâo Rodrigues Lobo Soroρita (c. 1600). The last-named is chiefly known from three comic satires on the classical school and his Introduction to the poems of Camoens, which formed the basis of Faria e Sousa’s Commentary. Except for the fact that a master-mind belongs to no school, Camoens himself might be claimed by these writers as a fellow-work er, for he was systematically either ignored or abused by the opposing school of classicists. IIis works are treated of at length elsewhere (see Camoens), but it is not out of place to remark here that his beauties are those of the national school and his defects the result of an imitation of the classicisms affected by his opponents. These were the followers of the school founded by Francisco de Sa de Miranda (1495-1558) on his return from Italy, where he acquired a love not only for the Renaissance, whose influence had been already felt by Ribeiro, but for the forms in which the new culture found expression. Much praise is due to him for the polish he gave to his country’s literature, but by his classical affectations and the favour he showed to the Spanish language, in which his best works were written, he sowed the seeds of that decay which afterwards overtook Portuguese poetry. The eclogues, epistles, odes, elegies, and sonnets of this school are often perfect in form and contain much real poetry, but the classicisms which at first are graceful in their novelty weary in the end by their unreality, and in the hands of inferior artists degenerate into mere stage properties, used to conceal the want of genius. The shepherds and shepherdesses are no longer the idealized peasants of the troubadours but courtiers in masquerade, and the sense of this lowering of the ideal is sufficient to destroy the pleasure which would otherwise be derived from the polished language and poetic imagination. The imitators of Miranda were very numerous; the chief among them were Antonio de Ferreira (1528-1569), who was Hora tian rather than Virgilian in feeling, and consequently produced but inferior eclogues, while his didactic epistles λvere the earliest Portuguese examples of that style, Diogo Bernardes (d. 1599), whose sacred songs are particularly good, Pedro de Andrade de Caminha(d∙ 1589), Fernâo Alvares do Oriente (b. 1540), Don Manuel de Portugal (d. 1606), and Estevâo Rodrigues de Castro (1559-1637). Among the lyric poets of the 17 th century the chief of those who by their satirical and comic verses showed an inclination to the national rather than the classical school were Thomas de Noronha (d. 1651) and Jacinto Freire de Andrade (1597-1657), author of the Fabulas de Narciso and of various songs and sonnets published in the Fenix Renascida (1716-1728). Antonio Barbosa Bacellar (1610-1663) was the first writer of “saudades,” and was followed in the same style by Simâo Torrezâo Coelho (d. 1642). Sonnets were of course written by every man of culture, but they rarely rose above the standard of mediocrity. Those of Manuel de Faria e Sousa (1590-1649), Duarte Ribeiro de Macedo (1618-1680), and André Nunes da Sylva (1630-1705) may, however, be reckoned among the best. The sacred poems of the last-named are also very good, but are surpassed by the Jardim do Ceo by Eloi de Sa Sotomaior, and by the poems of Sister Violante do Céo (1601-1693). The didactic epistles of Antonio Alvares da Cunha (1626-1690) are fair specimens of this class of poem.

The truly heroic life of Portugal during this period naturally demanded to be sung in a fitting strain, and the 16th and 17th centuries were consequently the era of epic poems. The earliest of these was the Creaçâo do Homcm by Andre Falcâo de Resende (d. 1598), which from its similarity in style has been often attributed to Camoens (1524-1579), whose Lusiads appeared in 1572. Though the sole masterpiece of the country and the age, this last not unworthily eclipses other epics in which the brilliant passages are more or less numerous. Such are the Primeiro Cerco de Diu by Francisco de Andrade (1540-1614), the Naufragio de Sepulveda and the Segundo Cerco de Diu by Jeronymo Côrte-Real (1540-1593), both rather above the average, the Elegiada (1588) by Luis Pereira Brandâo, the Affonso Africano (1611) by Vasco Mousinho de Quebedo, who shares with Côrte-Real the honour of ranking next after Camoens, the Ulysséa by Gabriel Pereira de Castro (1571-1632), the Viriato Tragico by Braz Garcia Mascarenhas (1596-1656), the Malaca Conquisiada by Francisco de Sa de Menezes (d. 1664), the Ulyssipo by Antonio de Souza de Macedo (1606-1682), and the Destruiçâo de Hespanha (1671) by André da Silva Mascarenhas.

The drama in Portugal was stifled in its birth. The miracle-plays of the people attained a high degree of excellence in the “autos” or sacred Christmas plays of Gil Vicente (1470-1536), but this writer was born half a century too soon for his work. His comedies, of which the best is Inez Pereira, are full of the rough wit which is found in the early Latin writers, but show a want of polish and dramatic conception which is fatal to their claims to high rank as works of art. The comedies of his contemporaries, Antonio Prestes, Jorge Pinto, and Jeronymo Ribeiro Soares, all show considerable talent, and the Eufrosina of Jorge Ferreira de Vasconcellos (d. 1585) most nearly approaches to a modern standard of excellence. Francisco Manuel de Mello (1611-1666) was the author in Portuguese of the Auto do Fidalgo Aprendiz as well as of several poems, but most of his works are in the Spanish language. Among the classicists Miranda was the author of the comedies Os Estrangeiros and Os Vilhalpandos, but his plays are inferior to those of Ferreira, whose dramatic works are in some respects superior to his poems. The chief of them, which was produced only a few years later than the Sophonisba of Trissino, is the tragedy Inez de Castro, but, though his subject was so fine, his treatment of it was not altogether satisfactory. There are also several plays by Camoens; but the influence of the Spanish language was by this time irresistible, and the result was that all serious dramas were written in Castilian, while Portuguese was reserved only for the lighter and more popular pieces, the best of which were collected [9:19:557] by Coelho Rebello in A Musa entretenida de varios Entrcmcses (Coimbra, 1658).

In prose the imitations of Amadis of Gaul were followed by the school of the Palmeirims, which originated in the romance of chivalry Palmeirim d’Inglaterra. The first and second parts of this work were probably by the Spaniard Hurtado, and were only translated by Francisco de Moraes (d. 1572); the third and fourth parts were written by Diogo Fernandes (c. 1580), and the fifth and sixth by Balthasar Gonçalves Lobato (c. 1600). But Moràes, though thus missing the honour of being an originator, was probably the author of the scarcely less celebrated Palmeirim de Oliva. The Livro de Cavallaria by Fernâo Lopes da Castanheda (d. 1559), the Chronica do Emperador Clarimundo by Joâo de Barros (1496-1570), several works by Francisco Rodrigues Lobo (c. 1600), and the Chronica do famoso Principe D. Clarisol de Bretanha (1602) by B. G. Lobato are of a similar character. The pastoral novel originated in the Menina e Moça by Bernardini Ribeiro, a composition in prose and verse which gave rise through its imitation in Spanish by Jorge de Monte Mor (d. 1561) to the school of the Dianas. This style was in its turn imitated in Portuguese by Fernâo Alvares do Oriente (b. 1540) in the Lusitania Transformada, and among other examples maybe noted the Ribeiros do Mondcgo (1623) by Eloi de Sa Sotomaior, and the Primavera, O Pastor Peregrino, and 0 Desenganado (1601) by F. R. Lobo. The last-named was also the author of the more meritorious Côrte na Aldéa, a sort of Friends in Council, which was afterwards imitated in the Serào politico by Felix da Costanheira Turacem, the nom-de-plume of Lucas de St Catherina (1660-1740). To the pastoral novel succeeded the allegories, of which Grand Cyprus, Clelia, and Astrea are the best examples. The Inquisition, however, laid its ban upon them when they showed mystical tendencies, as in the Pé de Rosa Fragrante, Cerva Branca, &c.; but an adaptation of the Pilgrim’s Progress was published by the inquisitor Alexandre de Gusmâo (1629-1724), with a view to proving the efficacy of infant baptism, which was certainly not the intention of Bunyan. The Decameronic tales took the form in this period of the Contos e Historias de Proveito e Exemplo (1589) by Gonçalo Fernandes Trancoso, the Infortunios tragicos da constante Florinda (1625) by Gaspar Pires de Rebello, and the Allivio de Tristes (1672), Retiro de Cuidados (1681), and Roda da Fortuna (1692) by Mattheus Ribeiro. The pride in the national greatness which found poetical expression in the epic also caused the rise of a great school of historians. The older royal chroniclers were followed by Garcia de Resende (1470-1554), Christovâo Rodrigues Acenheiro (b. 1474), and Damiâo de Goes (1501-1573). Their chronicles are graphic and interesting, though inferior in style to the works of their successor, who was the most brilliant early historian Portugal can boast. This was Joâo de Barros (1496-1570), author of the Conquest of the Indies, which was afterwards continued in the Asia Portugueza by Manuel de Faria e Sousa (1590-1649), a learned and facile writer, from whose pen are also the Europa, Africa, and America Portugueza, a Commentary on Camoens, and numerous other works. The style of Barros is both elegant and energetic, and the criticism and accuracy which he displays make him still an authority of the first rank. The next greatest historian after Barros was the monk Bernardo de Brito (1569-1617), author of Monarchia Lusitana, of which there is a continuation by Antonio Brandäo (1584-1637), and of the Chronicles of the Cistercians and of D. Sebastiâo. The elegant Latinist and best antiquary of the 16th century, André de Resende (1498-1573), whose talents were recognized by Erasmus, produced the De antiquitatibus Lusitaniae and the Life of the Infante D. Duarte; and the History of the Discovery and Conquest of India by Fernâo Lopes de Castanheda (d. 1559), the Chronicles of D. Sebastiâo by Bernardo da Cruz (1530-1586) and by Manuel de Menezes (d. 1628), the Life of D. Joao de Castro by Jacinto Freire de Andrade (1597- 1657), which is still the type of perfect biography, the Chronicles of Scanderbeg and. D. John III. by Francisco de Andrade (1540-1614), the Commentaries of Affonso d'Albuquerque (1500-1580), compiled by his son, and the works of Diogo do Couto (1542-1616) and Duarte Nunes do Leâo (d. 1608) supply a mass of interesting historical material. To Antonio Barbosa Bacellar (1610-1663) is due an account of the Siege and Capture of Recife ; and the True Account of Prester John (1540) by Francisco Alvares, the Travels in China, Tartary, &c., of Fernâo Mendes Pinto (1509-1580), and in Persia (1610) of Pedro Teixeira, the account of the Mission of Aleixo de Menezes to the Christians of S. Thomas by Antonio de Gouvea (d. 1628), and the History of Tangier by Fernando de Menezes (1614-1699) are all classical works and full of interest. Among ι religious works may be mentioned those of Diogo de Paiva de Andrade (1528-1575) and of Diogo de Gouvea (d. 1576), the Commentaries oi the Hebrew scholar Jeronymo de Azambuja (1520-1565), the Life of S. Francis Xavier by Joâo de Lucena (1550-1600), the Commentaries on the Minor Prophets by Bernardo de Brito (1569- 1617), the Lives of S. Dominic and other saints by Luis de Sousa (1555-1632), the Agiologio Lusitano by Jorge Cardoso (1616-1669), the Sermons of the great preachers Gaspar Pires de Rebello (c. 1625) and Antonio Vieira (1608-1697), the Clavis Prophetarum of the last-named, and the works of Bartholomen do Quental (1626-1698), founder of the Portuguese branch of the Oratorians. The scientific writers of the period are not numerous, being represented chiefly by the cosmograρher Pedro Nunes (1492-1577), one of the greatest mathematicians of his time, Estevâo Rodrigues de Castro (1559-1637), author of a Commentary on Hippocrates and various other medical works, and the astronomer Manuel Boccarro Francez (1588-1662).

18th Century.—- During the preceding century there had been founded in imitation of the Italians numerous “arcadias” or literary clubs under fantastic titles, such as “Ambientes,” “Solitarios,” &c. Their influence was insignificant, and their existence would call for no remark were they not the forerunners of the academies, which duιing the 18th century saved Portuguese literature from total extinction. In the year 1714 was founded the Lisbon Royal Academy of Sciences, which was succeeded by the Portuguese Academy, whose first president was the learned historian Francisco Xavier de Menezes, count of Ericeira (1673-1743), author of the epic Henriqueida. His numerous translations of the works of Boileau and other French writers had considerable influence on Portuguese literature, and the founding in 1757 of the “Arcadia de Lisbôa,” in which the great minister the marquis of Pombal was supreme, led to a wider spread of the teachings of the Encyclopaedists. The arcadia ceased to exist in 1774, but was followed in 1779 by the Royal Academy of Sciences, founded by the duke of Lafδes, and by the “Nova Arcadia,” which flourished between 1790 and 1806. As regards poetry these academies were little more than manufactories of verse, the only lyric poets of the early part of the century being Thomas Pinto Brandäo (1664-1743) and Antonio de Lima Barros Pereira (b. 1687); but their members, though wanting in poetical originality, showed considerable industry in historical research. The Bibliotheca Lusitana by Diogo Barbosa Machado (1682-1772) is a complete biographical dictionary of the Peninsula, and the Life of the Infante D. Henrique by Francisco José Freire (1719-1773) and the General History of Portugal by Damiâo Antonio de Lemos (1715-1789) are standard works, while the Memorias de Litteratura of the Royal Academy of Sciences contains much information about the literature of the 16th and 17th centuries. But the real founder of scientific history in Portugal, as opposed to mere collections of legends and traditions, was Joao Pedro Ribeiro (1759- 1839), whose Researches in Portuguese Chronology show an historical scepticism far in advance of his age. To the same group of workers for the academy in the historical department belong Francisco de St Luis, cardinal-archbishop of Lisbon (1766-1845), Francisco Manuel Trigoso (1777-1838), and José Francisco Correa da Serra (1750-1823), who edited the Early Portuguese Chronicles. In the latter half of this century a revival in poetry also took place, and the works of Antonio Diniz da Cruz e Silva (1731-1800), author of Hyssope, acquired for him the title of the Portuguese Boileau. With him were associated Pedro Antonio Corrêa Garçâo (1724-1772), authoι of the comedy Assemblea and the Cantata de Dido, Domingos dos Reis Quita (1728-1770), the best pastoral poet of the period, and the Brazilian Claudio Manuel da Costa (1729-1789). But to Francisco Manuel do Nascimento (1734-1819), who wrote under the nom-dc-plume of Filinto Elysio, must be assigned the honour of being the reviver of letters in Portugal, not only by his elegant lyric poems but more especially by his miscellaneous writings and by his opposition to foreign imitations. His school of “Filintists” found rivals in the “Elmanists” led by Manuel Maria de Barbosa du Bocage (1766-1806), who, though less original than Nascimento, had perhaps greater influence. His poetical works are numerous, and he was, besides, the author of three tragedies, Viriatus, Affonso Henriques, and Vasco de Gama, which had some success. The poems of Antonio Ribeiro dos Sanctos (1745-1818), the satires of Nicolau Tolentino de Almeida (1741-1811), and the sonnets of Paulino Antonio Cabral de Vasconcellos (b. 1720) are all reckoned among the good work of the 18th century. But the best as well as the last work of this school is the epic Oriente (1814) by José Agostinho de Macedo (1761-1831), whose contemporary, José Anastasio da Cunha, was condemned by the Inquisition for the heresy contained in his Ora<ffo Universal. The tragedies 0smia, by Catharina de Sousa, countess of Vimieiro (1749-1824), and Nova Castro, by Joâo Baptista Gomes (d. 1803), call for especial notice, as do the vaudevilles Don Quixote and Esopaida by Antonio José da Silva (1705- 1739), while the national taste further showed itself in the favourable reception given to the comedies of his successor, Alexandre Antonio de Lima (b. 1699).

19th Century.— The political troubles of 1820 led to the expatriation of Joâo Baptista de Almeida Garrett (Jonio Duriense) (1799- 1854) and Alexandre Herculano (1810-1879), and the retreat to a monastery of Antonio Feliciano de Castilho (Memnide Egynense) (1800-1875). The first two were followers of Nascimento, the last of Bocage; but, while the enforced studies of Castilho only increased his classicist proclivities, the exile of Garrett and Herculano brought them into contact with romanticism. The effects are seen in Garrett’s D. Branca, Joâo Minimo, and Flores sem Fructo, and later on in his most famous work, the Folhas Callidas. R. A. de Bulhâo Pato, F. Gomes de Amorim, and E. Vidal have also written in the same style, but their poems have a less truthful ring than [9:19:558] those of Garrett, who is also the author of both the earliest and the best examples of the modern Portuguese drama, Gil Vicente, Alfageme, and Luis de Sousa. The principal works of Castilho are A Primavera, Amor e Melancolia, and Ejccavaçôes Poeticas ; and the writers who may chiefly be claimed as his followers are Sarmento, J. Μ. de Costa e Silva the dramatist, Cabral de Mello, and Fernandes Leitâo. The publication in 1848 of 0 Trovador, a collection of modern lyrics, marks the foundation of the school of Coimbra. Its leader, Joâo de Lemos, the lyric poet, found fellow-workers in José Freire de Serpa, the impressionable author of Soldos, and José da Silva Mendes Leal, author of the dramas A Alva Estrella, A Madre Silva, and Os Homens de Marmore, and various lyric poems. The most popular modern poet Luis Augusto Palmeirim, the dramatist A. Pereira da Cunha, Antonio de Serpa, and Joào de Andrade Corvo, author of the novel Um Anno da Cδrte, all belong to this school, the prevailing characteristic of which at its foundation was a profound admiration for Chateaubriand and his royalist and religious opinions. The second phase of this school dates from the Novo Trovador, in which the influence of Aimé Martin and Krause on its originator Soares de Passos is plainly visible. The poems of Passos are tinged with a melancholy which presaged his early death, and he philosophizes in the Firmamento, the Escravo, and the Morte de Socrates somewhat in the same strain as the English Lake poets. The third phase of the school of Coimbra is represented by the Flores do Campo and Folhas Soltas of Joâo de Deus, the poet of love and revolution. Of the same school the Visdo dos Tempos by Theophilo Braga is an attempt at a new revelation, and the Odes Modernas by Anthero do Quental are socialistic, but both writers show more than ordinary power. Other modern poets are Alberto Telles, Sousa Viterbo, Candido de Figueiredo, Gomes Leal, Thomas Ribeiro, A. J. Viale, and Guilherme de Azevedo. The plays of C. C. Branco and Ernesto Biester are above the average, and King Luis has worthily followed the traditions of his race in his translations of the plays of Shakespeare. The historical novels of Herculano are much admired by his countrymen, as well as those of L. A. Rebello da Silva; and the works of J. G. Gomes Coelho (Julio Diniz), A. de Oliveira Marreca, Mendes Leal, Bernardim Ribeiro, Arnal do Gama, Teixeira de Vasconcellos, and Camillo Castello Branco, with his accuracy of description, have some reputation; but the best modern novel, judged by an English standard, is 0 Crime do Padre Amaro by E< i ∙a de Queiroz. As the growth of Portuguese independence was coeval with the work of the troubadours, and the discoveries and conquests of the heroic age gave birth to the epic of Camoens, so, in like manner, the political revival of the 19th century has given rise to a school of great historians, the chief of whom was Alexandre Herculano. The exile of Herculano had brought him into contact with both English and French romanticism, as appears in his early poems and his historical novels, in which the influence of Lamartine and Scott is plainly visible, but in later life he was attracted to the new German school of historians founded by Ranke, and perceived that his true vocation was scientific history. His chief work has been the disentanglement of the early history of Portugal from the mass of legends which had clustered round it, and his History of Portugal and The Origin of the Inquisition in Portugal are lasting monuments of industry and criticism. But Herculano perceived that, before a true knowledge could be gained of Portuguese history, a critical study must be made of early documents, so, using his official position, he commenced the publication for the academy of a magnificent edition of the Origines of Portuguese history. The viscount of Saιιtal∙em began a similar work in his collections of Foedcra, though his fame will rest rather on his researches into the history of the great maritime discoveries of the 15th and 16th centuries/ L. A Rebello da Silva continued the work of Santarem in the publication of the Corpo Diplomatico, and his History of Portugal in the 17th and 18th Centuries is only inferior to the great work of Herculano. These historians inspired many others, among whom may be mentioned Fonseca Benevides, F. F. de la Figaniere, Claudio de Chaby, and Simào José da Luz Soriano. The strength of this school is no doubt partly due to the extreme vigour of the reactionaries who were first called into existence by Herculano’s attacks on superstitious legends. Their work is brilliant if not convincing, and it would not therefore be right to pass over without mention such names as F. Recreio, Γinheiro Chagas, and Aflbnso Ennes. In general literature the name of Francisco Alexandre Lobo (17t'3- 1844) stands out prominently as the foremost man of the century, and the Portuguese equal of De Maistre, whilst Thomas de Carvalho, Rodrigo da Fonseca, Cesar Machado, Lopes de Mendonça, F. Adolplιo Coelho, Theophilo Braga, Innocencio Francisco da Silva, and F. D. Vieira have all won a position as critics and essayists. Political liberty has gone hand in hand with the freedom of the press, and here again Herculano appears as the founder of the Panorama, in which he had the assistance of most of the writers above-mentioned. Besides these the most influential journalists are Teixeira de Vasconcellos, Rodrigues de Sampaio, and J. Μ. Latino Coelho. While the press remains free and can boast of such writers Portuguese literature will certainly increase in strength and vigour, and maintain the feeling of national pride and independence which appears so strongly in the works of Garrett and Herculano, and will always prevent a union with Spain.
