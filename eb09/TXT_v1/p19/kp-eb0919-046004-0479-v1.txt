POOLE, a market town, municipal borough, county in itself, and seaport of Dorsetshire, on the south coast of England, is picturesquely situated on a peninsula between Holes Bay and Poole Harbour, 30 miles east from Dorchester and 120 south-west of London. The churches are modern, and possess no features of special interest. Among the principal public buildings are the town-house, 1721; the guild-hall, formerly the market-house, 1761; the old town-hall, built in 1572; the custom-house; and the mechanics’ institute. On Brownsea Island in the middle of Poole Harbour is a small castle erected as a fortress by Elizabeth and strengthened by Charles I. At low water Poole Harbour is entirely emptied except a narrow channel, but at full tide the water covers an area about 7 miles long by about 4⅜ broad. The quays lined with warehouses are about one mile in length, and can be approached by vessels of very large tonnage. There is a large general trade with the British colonies and the United States, and an important coasting trade, especially in corn to London, and Purbeck clay to the Staffordshire potteries. In 1883 the number of vessels that entered the harbour was 933 of 81,003 tons, the number that cleared 874 of 77,948 tons. Some shipbuilding is carried on, and there are manufactures of cordage, netting, and sailcloth. The town also possesses large potteries, decorative tile works, iron-foundries, engineering works, agricultural implement works, and flour-mills. The area of the borough is 5111 acres, with a population in 1871 of 10,129, and in 1881 of 12,310 (5820 males and 6490 females).

Poole derives its name from being nearly surrounded by a sheet of water. There was a Roman road between it and Wimbourne. It is not mentioned in Domesday, being included in Canford, but it enjoyed certain immunities before 1248, when it received a charter from William Longsword. In the reign of Edward III. it supplied four ships and 94 men for the siege of Calais. Mιιch of its succeeding prosperity was due to the presence of Spanish merchants, and after the outbreak of war with Spain in the reign of Elizabeth its trade for a time declined. Its charter was extended by Elizabeth, who reincorporated it, and erected it into a county in itself. It has a sheriff elected annually, and a separate court of quarter sessions. It is divided into two wards, and is governed by a mayor, six aidermen, and eighteen councillors. It returned two members to parliament as early as the reign of Edward III., but one only from 1868 to 1885.
