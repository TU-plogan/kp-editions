PRIDE, Thomas (d. 1658), Parliamentary officer, was of humble origin, and is stated to have been brought up by the parish of St Bride’s, London. Subsequently he was a drayman and a brewer. At the beginning of the Civil War he served as ensign under the earl of Essex, and gradually obtained promotion to the rank of colonel. He distinguished himself at the battle of Preston, 17th August 1648, and in Cromwell’s Scottish campaign he held command of a brigade. He was noted for his resolute character and extreme anti-Royalist sentiments. After the Commons had voted that the king’s concessions at Newport were a basis for a settlement, he was chosen by the army chiefs to effect their purpose of “purging” the Commons. Taking his stand at the entrance of the House of Commons with a written list in his hand, he caused the arrest of the Royalist members who were pointed out to him, and placed them in custody. After about a hundred members had been dealt with by this ordinance, subsequently known as “Pride’s Purge,” the mutilated House of Commons proceeded to bring the king to trial. Pride was one of the judges of the king and signed his death-warrant. Under Cromwell he received the honour of knighthood, and was also chosen a member of the new House of Lords. He died at Nonsuch on 23d October 1658, and after the Restoration his body was dug up and suspended on the gallows at Tyburn along with that of Cromwell.
