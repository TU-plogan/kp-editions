PROTOZOA.

Characters.— Organisms consisting of a single cell or of a group of cells not differentiated into two or more tissues; incapable of assimilating nitrogen in its diffusible compounds (ammonia or nitrates) or carbon in the form of carbonates, except in special instances which there is reason to regard as directly derived from allied forms not possessing this capacity. The food of the Protozoa is in consequence as a rule taken in the form of particles into the protoplasm either by a specialized mouth or by any part of the naked cell-substance, there to be digested and rendered diffusible.

Grade A. GYMNOMYXA, Lankester, 1878 (64).

Characters.— Protozoa in which the cell-protoplasm is entirely or partially exposed to the surrounding medium, during the active vegetative phase of the life-history, as a naked undifferentiated slime or viscous fluid, which throws itself into processes or “pseudopodia” of various form either rapidly changing or relatively constant. Food can be taken into the protoplasm in the form of solid particles at any point of its surface or at any point of a large exposed area. The distinction into so-called “exoplasm” and “endoplasm” recognized by some authors, is not founded on a permanent differentiation of substance corresponding to the cortical and medullary substance of Corticata, but is merely due to the centripetal aggregation of granules lying in a uniform undifferentiated protoplasm. The cell-in dividual exhibits itself under four phases of growth and development—(1) as a swarm-spore (monadiform young or flagellula); (2) as an amoeba form; (3) as constituent of a plasmodium or cell-fusion or conjugation; (4) as a cyst, which may be a flagellula(Schwarme)-producing cyst, an amoebula·producing cyst, a co vered-spore(chlamydospore)-producing cyst (sporocyst sens, strie. , Zopf), or a simple resting cyst which does not exhibit any fission of its contents (hypnocyst). Any one of these phases may be greatly predominant and specialized whilst the others are relatively unimportant and rapidly passed through.

Class I. PROTEOMYXA, Lankester.

Characters. — Gymnomyxa which exhibit in the amoeba phase various forms of pseudopodia often changing in the same individual, and do not produce elaborate spore cysts; hence they are not referable to any one of the subsequent six classes. Mostly minute forms, with small inconspicuous nucleus (absent in some ?).

A division into orders and families is not desirable, the group being confessedly an assemblage of negatively characterized or insufficiently known forms.

Genera. — Vampyrella, Cienkowski (15); Vampyrellidium, Zopf (13); Spirophora, Zopf { = Amoeba radiosa, Perty); Haplococcus, Zopf; Leρtophrys, Hertwig and Lesser (16); Endyomena, Zoρf; Bursulla, Sorokin (17); Myxastrτιm, Haeckel (1); Enteromyxa, Cienkowski (18); Colpodella, Cienkowski (19); Pseudospora, Cienkowski (20); Protomonas, Cienkowski (15); Diplophy salis, Zopf (13); Gymnococcus, Zopf; Aphelidium, Zopf; Pseudosporidium, Zopf; Protomyxa, Haeckel (1); Plasmodiophora, Woronin (21); Tetramyxa, Göbel (22); Gloidium, Sorokin (23); Gymnophrys, Cienkowski (24); Myxodictyum, Haeckel (1); Boderia, Wright (25); Biomyxa, Leidy (92); Protogenes, Haeckel (1); Protamoeba, Haeckel (1); Nuclearia, Cienkowski (26); Monobia, Aim. Schneider (27); Archerina, Lankester (14).

The forms here brought together include several genera (the first nineteen) referred by Zopf to the Mycetozoa, some again (Vampyrella, Myxastrum, Nuclearia, Monobia) which are by Biitschli associated with the Heliozoa, others (Protamoeba, Gloidium) referred by the same authority to the Lobosa (Amoebaea) and others (Colpodella, Protomonas) which might be grouped with the lower Flagellata. By grouping them in the manner here adopted we are enabled to characterize those higher groups more satisfactorily and to give a just expression to our present want of that knowledge of the life-history both of these forms and of the higher Gymnomyxa which when it is obtained may enable us to disperse this heterogeneous class of Proteomyxa. The group has the same function in relation to the other classes of Gymnomyxa which the group. Vermes has been made to discharge in relation to the better defined phyla of the Metazoa; it is a lumber-room in which obscure, lowly-developed, and insufficiently known fonns may be kept until they can be otherwise dealt with.

It is true that, thanks to the researches of Continental botanists (especially Cienkowski and Zopf), we know the life-history of several of these organisms; but we are none the less unable to connect them by tangible characteristics with other Gymnomyxa.

Nearly all of the above-named genera are parasitic rather than “voracious,” that is to say, they feed on the organized products of larger organisms both plants and animals (Haplococcus is parasitic in the muscles of the pig), into whose tissues they penetrate, and do not, except in a few cases (Protomyxa, Vampyrella), engulph whole organisms, such as Diatoms, &c., in their protoplasm. Many live upon and among the putrefying debris of other organisms (e.g., rotting vegetable stems and leaves, excrements of animals), and like the Mycetozoa exert a digestive action upon the substances with which they come in contact comparable to the putrefying and fermentative activity of the Schizomycetes (Bacteria).

Fig. II. illustrates four chief genera of Proteomyxa.

Protomyxa aurantiaca was described by Haeckel (1), who found it on shells of Spirula on the coast of the Canary Islands, in the form of orange yellow flakes consisting of branching an<l reticular protoplasm nourishing itself by the ingestion of Diatoms and Peridinia. This condition is not a simple amoeba phase but a “plasmodium” formed by the union of several young amoebae. The plasmodium under certain conditions draws itself together into a spherical form and secretes a clear membranous cyst around itself, and then breaks up into some hundreds of flagellulae or swarmspores (Fig. II. 2). The diameter of the cystis *12 to *2 millimetre. The flagellulae subsequently escape (Fig. II. 3) and swim by the vibratile movement of one end which is drawn out in the form of a coarse flagellum. The swarm-spore now passes into the amoeba phase (Fig. II. 4). Several of the small amoebae creeping on the surface of the spirula-shell then unite with one another and form a plasmodium which continues to nourish itself by “voracious” inception of Diatoms and other small organisms. The plasmodia may attain a diameter of one millimetre and be visible by the naked eye.

A nucleus was not observed by Haeckel in the spores nor in the amoeba phase, nor scattered nuclei in the plasmodium, but it is not improbable that they exist and escaped detection in the living condition, in consequence of their not being searched for by methods of staining, &c., which have since come into use. A contractile vacuole does not exist.

Vampyrella spirogyrae, Cienkowski (Fig. II. 5, 6, 7), is one of several species assigned to the genus Vampyrella, all of which feed upon the living cells of plants. The nucleus previously stated to be absent has been detected by Zopf (13). There is no contractile vacuole. The amoeba phase has an actinophryd character (i.e., exhibits fine radiating pseudopodia resembling those of the sun-animalcule, Actinophrys, one of the Heliozoa). This species feeds exclusively upon the contents of the cells of Spirogyra, eflect-ing an entrance through the cell-wall (Fig. II. 5), sucking out the contents, and then creeping on to the next cell. In some species of Vampyrella as many as four amoeba-individuals have been observed to fuse to form a small plasmodium. Cysts are formed which enclose in this species a single amoeba-individual. The cyst often acquires a second or third inner cyst membrane by the shrinking of the protoplasmic body after the first encystment and the subsequent formation of a new membrane. The encysted protoplasm sometimes merely divides into four parts each of which creeps out of the cyst as an Actinophrys-like amoeba (Fig. II. 7); in other instances it forms a dense spore, the product of which is not known.

Protogenes primordialis is the name given by Haeckel to a very simple form with radiating filamentous pseudopodia which he observed in sea-water. It appears to be the same organism as that described and figured by Max Schultze as Amoeba porrecta. Schultze’s figure is copied in Fig. II. 12. No nucleus and no contractile vacuole is observed in this form. It feeds voraciously on smaller organisms. Its life-history has not been followed over even a few steps. Hence we must for the present doubt altogether as to its true affinities. Possibly it is only a detached portion of the protoplasm of a larger nucleate Gymnomyxon, The same kind of [9:19:840] doubt is justified in regard to Haeckel’s Protamceba primitiva, which was observed by him in pond water and differs from Protogenes in having lobose pseudopodia, whilst agreeing with it in absence of nuclei, contractile vacuoles, and other differentiation of structure. The structureless protoplasmic network described by Haeckel from spirit-preserved specimens of Atlantic ooze and identified by him with Huxley’s (28) Bathybius, as also the similar network described by Bessels (29) as Protobathybius, must be regarded for the present as insufficiently known.

It is possible that these appearances observed in the ooze dredged from great depths in the Atlantic are really due to simple Protozoa. On the other hand it has been asserted by Sir Wyville Thomson, who at one time believed in the independent organic nature of Bathybius, that the substance taken for protoplasm by both Huxley and Haeckel is in reality a gelatinous precipitate of calcium sulphate thrown down by the action of alcohol upon sea-water. Other naturalists have pointed to the possibility of the protoplasmic network which Bessels studied in the living condition on board ship being detached portions of the protoplasm of Reticularia and Radiolaria. The matter is one which requires further investigation.

Archerina Boltoni is the name given by Lankester (14) to a very simple Gymnomyxon inhabiting freshwater ponds in company with Desmids and other simple green Algae (Fig. II. 8 to 11). Archerina exhibits an amoeba phase in which the protoplasm is thrown into long stiff filaments (Fig. II. 11), surrounding a spherical central mass about τ π ∏ πr th inch in diameter (actinophryα form). A large vacuole (non-eontractile) is present, or two or three small ones. No nucleus can be detected by careful use of reagents in this or other phases. The protoplasm has been seen to ingest solid food particles (Bacteria) and to assume a lobose form. The most striking characteristic of Archerina is the possession of chlorophyll corpuscles. In the actinophryd form two oval green-coloured bodies (b, b) are seen. As the protoplasm increases by nutrition the chlorophyll corpuscles multiply by quaternary division (Fig. 11. 10) and form groups of four or of four sets of four· symmetrically arranged. The division of the chlorophyll corpuscles is not necessarily followed by that of the protoplasm, and accordingly specimens are found with many chlorophyll corpuscles embedded in a large growth of protoplasm (Fig. II. 8); the growth may increase to a considerable size, numbering some hundreds of chlorophyll corpuscles, and a proportionate development of protoplasm. Such a growth is not a plasmodium, that is to say, is not formed by fusion of independent amoeba forms, but is due to continuous growth. When nutrition fails the individual chlorophyll corpuscles separate, each carrying with it an investment of protoplasm, and then each such amoeba form forms a cyst around itself which is covered with short spines (Fig. II. 9). The cysts are not known to give rise to spores, but appear to be merely hypnocysts.

The domination of the protoplasm by the chlorophyll corpuscles is very remarkable and unlike anything known in any other organism. Possibly the chlorophyll corpuscles are to be regarded as nuclei, since it is known that there are distinct points of affinity between the dense protoplasm of ordinary nuclei and the similarly dense protoplasm of normal chlorophyll corpuscles.

Class II. MYCETOZOA, De Bary.

Characters.— Gymnomyxa which, as an exception to all other Protozoa, are not inhabitants of water but occur on damp surfaces exposed to the air. They are never parasitic, as are some of the Proteomyxa most nearly allied to them (Plasmodiophora, &c.), but feed on organic debris. They are structurally characterized by the fact that the amoeba forms, which develop either directly or through flagellulae from their spores, always form large, sometimes very large, i.e., of several square inches area, fusion plasmodia (or rarely aggregation plasmodia), and that the spores are always chlamydospores (i.e., provided with a coat) and are formed either in naked groups of definite shape (sori) or on the surface of peculiar columns (conidiophore) or in large fruit-like cysts which enclose the whole or a part of the plasmodium and develop besides the spores definite sustentacular structures (capillitium) holding the spores in a mesh-work.

Three orders of Mycetozoa arc distinguishable according to the arrangement of the spores in more or less complex spore-fruits.

Order 1. SOROPHORA, Zopf.

Chdracters.— Mycetozoa which never exhibit a vibratile (monadiform) swarmspore or flagellula phase, but hatch from the spore as amoebae. A true fusion plasmodium is not formed, but an aggrega-gation plasmodium by the contact without fusion of numerous amoeba forms. The spore finit is a naked aggregation of definitely arranged encysted amoebae called a sorus, not enclosed in a common capsule; each encysted amoeba has the value of a single spore and sets free on germination a single amoebula. They inhabit the dung of various animals.

Genera.— Copromyxa, Zopf; Cynthulina, Cienk.; Dictyostelium, Brefeld; Acrasis, Van Tieghem; Polyspondylium, Brefeld.

Order 2. ENDOSPOREA, Zopf.

Characters.— Mycetozoa always passing through the flagellula phase and always forming true plasmodia by fusion of amoeba forms. The spore-fruit is in the form of a large cyst which encloses a quantity of the plasmodium; the latter then breaks up into (a) [9:19:841]

spores (one corresponding to each nucleus of the enclosed plasmodium) each of which has a cellulose coat, and (δ) a capillitium of threads which hold the spores together. Each spore (chlamydospore) liberates on germination a single nucleated flagellula, which develops into an amoebula, which in turn fuses with other amoebulae to form the plasmodium. The Endosporea are essentially dwellers on rotten wood and such vegetable refuse.
[table]

Order 3. EXOSPOREA, Zopf.

Characters.— The chlamydospore liberates an amoebula in the irst instance, which develops into a flagellula. This subsequently eturns to the amoeba form, and by fusion with other amoebulae it 'orms a true fusion plasmodium. The spores are not produced vithin a cyst but upon the surface of column-like up-growths of the plasmodium, each spore (conidum) forming as a little spherical outgrowth attached to the column (conidiophor) by a distinct pedicle.

Sole Genus.— C cratium. [This name must be changed, since it vas already applied to a genus of .Dinoflagellata, when Famintzin ιnd Woronin gave it to this Mycetozoon.]

Further Remarks on Mycetozoa. — About two hundred species of Mycetozoa have been described. Botanists, and especially those who occupy themselves with Fungi, have accumulated the very large mass of facts now known in reference to these organisms; nevertheless the most eminent botanist who has done more than any other to advance our knowledge of Mycetozoa, namely, De Bary, has expressed the view that they are to be regarded rather as animals than as plants. The fact is that, once the question is raised, it becomes as reasonable to relegate all the Gymnomyxa without exception to the vegetable kingdom as to do so with the Mycetozoa. Whatever course we take with the latter, we must take also with the Heliozoa, the Radiolaria, and the Reticularia.

The formation of plasmodia, for which the Mycetozoa are conspicuous, appears to be a particular instance of the general phenomenon of cell-conjugation. Small plasmodia are formed by some of the Proteomyxa; but among the other Gymnomyxa, excepting Mycetozoa, and among Corticate Protozoa, the fusion of two individuals (conjugation sensu stricto) is more usual than the fusion of several. Zopf (13) has attempted to distinguish arbitrarily between conjugation and plasmodium formation by asserting that in the former the nuclei of the cells which fuse are also fused, whereas in the latter process the nuclei retain their independence. Both statements are questionable. What happens to the nucleus in such conjugations as those of the Gregarinae has not yet been made out, whilst it is only quite recently that Strasburger (30) has shown that the plasmodia of Mycetozoa contain numerous scattered nuclei, and it is not known that fusion does not occur between some of these. There is no doubt that the nuclei of plasmodia multiply by fission, though we have no detailed account of the process.

The Sorophora are exceptional in that the amoebae which unite to form a cell-colony in their case do not actually fuse but only remain in close contact; with this goes the fact that there are no large spore-cysts, but an identification of spore and spore-cyst. The amoebae arrange themselves in stalked clusters (sori), and each becomes encysted: one may, in this case, consider the cyst equally as a spore or as a spore-cyst which produces but a single spore. The amoebae described by various writers as inhabiting the alimentary canal and the dung of higher animals (including man) belong to this group. The form described by Cunningham in the Quart. Jour. Mier. Sei., 1881, as Protomyxomyces coprinarius is apparently related to the Copromyxa (Guttulina) protea of Fayod (31).

The spore-fruits of the Endosporeae occur in various degrees of elaboration. Usually they are (1) spherical or pear-shaped cysts with or without an obvious stalk (Fig. III. 19, 20, 21), and often have a brilliant colour, and are of a size readily observed by the naked eye, the plasmodia which give rise to them being by no means microscopic. But they may present themselves (2) as irregular ridges growing up from the plasmodium, when they are termed serpula forms. Lastly, the cysts may be united side by side in larger or smaller groups instead of forming at various separate points of the plasmodium. These composite bodies are termed “fruit-cakes’’ or “aethalia,” in view of the fact that the spore-cysts of Fuligo, also called Aethalium—the well-known “flowers of tan” —form a cake of this description.

The capillitium or network of threads which lies between the spores in the spore-cysts of Endosporeae is a remarkable structure which exhibits special elaborations in detail in different genera, here not to be noticed for want of space. Although definite in form and structure, these threads are not built up by cells but are formed by a residual protoplasm (c/’. Sporozoa) which is left in the cyst after the spores have been segregated and enclosed each in its special coat. They are often impregnated by calcium carbonate, and exhibit crystalline masses of it, as does also the cyst-wall.

The spores of the Mycetozoa are as a rule about the τ ⅛ δ th inch in diameter. They are produced by millions in the large fruitcakes of such forms as Fuligo. Often the spore-coat is coloured; it always consists of a substance which gives the cellulose reaction with iodine and sulphuric acid. This has been sometimes considered an indication of the vegetable nature of the Mycetozoa, but cannot be so regarded since many animals (especially the Tunicata and various Protozoa) produce substances giving this same reaction.

Dryness, low temperature, and want of nutriment lead to a dormant condition of the protoplasm of the plasmodium of many Mycetozoa and to its enclosure in cyst-like growths known as “sclerotia,” which do not give rise to spores, but from which the protoplasm creeps forth unaltered when temperature, nutrition, and moisture are again favourable. The sclerotia are similar in nature to the hypnocysts of other Protozoa.

The physiological properties—chemical composition, digestive action, reaction to moisture, heat, light, and other physical influences—of the plasmodia of Mycetozoa have been made the subject of important investigations; they furnish the largest masses of undifferentiated protoplasm available for such study. The reader is referred to Zopf’s admirable treatise (13) as to these matters, and also for a detailed account of the genera and species.

Class III. L0B0SA, Carpenter.

Characters.— Gymnomyxa in which (as in the succeeding four classes) the amoeba-phase predominates over the others in permanence, size attained, and physiological importance. The pseudopodia[9:19:842] are lobose, ranging in form from mere wave-like bulgings of the surface to blunt finger-like processes, but never having the character of filaments either simple, arborescent, or reticulate. Fusions of two individuals (conjugation) have been observed in a few cases, but not fusions of many individuals so as to form plasmodia; nevertheless the size attained by the naked protoplasm? pure growth is in some cases considerable, forming masses readily Visible by the naked eye (Pelomyxa). The presence of more than one nucleus is a frequent character. A contractile vacuole may or may not be present. The formation of sporocysts and of chlamydospores (coated spores) has not been observed in any species, but naked spores (fiagelhilae or amoebulae) have been with more or less certainty observed as the product of the breaking up of some species (Amoeba? Pelomyxa). The cyst phase is not unusual, but the cyst appears usually to be a hypnocyst and not a sporocyst. In the best observed case of spore-production (Pelomyxa) the spores were apparently produced without the formation of a cyst. Reproduction is undoubtedly most freely effected by simple fission (Amoeba) and by a modified kind of bud-fission (Arcella). Freshwater and marine. Two orders of the Lobosa are distinguished in accordance with the presence or absence of a shell.

Order 1. NUDA.

Characters.— Lobosa devoid of a shell.

Genera.— Amoeba, Auct. (Fig. IV. 4); Ouramoeba, Leidy (with a villous tuft at one end, Wallich’s A. villosa) ; Corycia, Duj. (low, ridge-like pseudopodia); Lithamoeba, Lankester (Fig. V.); Dina- moeba, Leidy (92) (covered with short stiff processes); Hyalodiscus, H. and L.; Plakopus, F. E. Schultze; Dactylosphaera, H. and L. (Fig. IV. 1, 2, 3); Pelomyxa, Greeff (Fig. IV. 5, 6); Amphizonclla, Greeff (forms a gelatinous case which is broken through by the pseudopodia).

Order 2. TESTACEA.

Characters.— Lobosa which secrete a shell provided with an aperture from which the naked protoplasm can be protruded. The shell is either soft and membranous, or strengthened by the inclusion of sand-particles, or is hard and firm.

Genera.— Cochliopodium (Fig. IV. 8), H. and L.; Pyxidicula, Ehr.; Arcella, Ehr. (Fig. IV. 7); Hyalosphenia, Stein; Quadrula, F. E. Schultze (shell membraneous, areolated); Difflugia, Leclerc (shell with adventitious particles).

Further remarks on the Lobosa.— The Lobosa do not form a very numerous nor a very natural assemblage. Undoubtedly some of the forms which have been described as species of Amoeba are amoeba forms of Mycetozoa; this appears to be most probably the case in parasitic and stercoricolous forms. But when these are removed, as also those Proteomyxa which have pseudopodia of varying character, at one time lobose and at another filamentous, we have left a certain small number of independent lobose Gymnomyxa which it is most convenient to associate in a separate group. We know very little of the production of spores (whether it actually obtains or not) or of developmental phases among these Lobosa. The common Amoebae are referable to the species A. princeps, A. lobosa, Dactylosphaera polypodia, Ouramoeba villosa. Of none of these do we know certainly any reproductive phenomena excepting that of fission (see Fig. IV. 1, 2, 3). Various statements have been made pointing to a peculiar change in the nucleus and a production of spores having the form of minute Amoebae, arising from that body; but they cannot be considered as established. Whilst the observed cases of supposed reproductive phenomena are very few, it must be remembered that we have always to guard (as the history of the Ciliata has shown, see below) against the liability to mistake parasitic amoebulae and flagellulae for the young forms of organisms in which they are merely parasitic. The remarkable Pelomyxa palustris of Greeff (32) was seen by him to set free (without forming a cyst) a number of amoebulae which he considers as probably its young. Mr Weldon of St John’s College, Cambridge, has observed the same phenomenon in specimens of Pelomyxa which made their appearance in abundance in an aquarium in the Morphological Laboratory, Cambridge. It seems probable that the amoebulae in this case are not parasites but spore-like young, and this is the best observed case of such reproduction as yet recorded in the group.

Arcella is remarkable for the production of bud-spores, which may be considered as a process intermediate between simple fission and the complete breaking up of the parent body into spores. As many as nine globular processes are simultaneously pinched off from the protoplasm extruded from the shell of the Arcella; the nuclei (present in the parent Arcella to the number of two or three) have not been traced in connexion with this process. The buds then become nipped off, and acquire a shell and a contractile vacuole (83).

The presence of more than one nucleus is not unusual in Lobosa, and is not due to a fusion of two or more uninuclear individuals, but to a multiplication of the original nucleus. This has been observed in some Amoebae (A. princeps ?) as well as Arcella. Pelomyxa (Fig. IV. 6) has a great number of nuclei like the Heliozoon, Actinosphaerium (Fig. VIII.).

Pelomyxa is the most highly differentiated of the Lobosa. The highly vacuolated character of its protoplasm is exhibited in a less degree by Lithamoeba and resembles that of Heliozoa and Radiolaria. Besides the numerous nuclei there are scattered in the protoplasm strongly refringent bodies (Fig. IV. 6, f), the significance of which has not been ascertained. The superficial protoplasm is free from vacuoles, hyaline, and extremely mobile. Occasionally it is drawn [9:19:843] It has been observed to take in solid nourishment, though Labyrinthula has not.The Labyrinthulidea present strong resemblances to the Mycetozoa. The genus Dactylostelium (Sorophora) would come very close to Labyrinthula were the amoebae of its aggregation plasmodium set upon a network of threads. Such a network, whether in the condition of soft protoplasm or hardened and horny, is represented in the higher Mycetozoa by the capillitium of the sporocysts.The most important difference between Archer’s Chlamydomyxa and Cienkowski’s Labyrinthula is that in the former the threads


out into very short fine filaments. Scattered in the protoplasm are a number of minute cylindrical crystals, of unascertained compositi >n. Pelomyxa is of very large size for a Protozoon, attaining a diameter of ⅛th of an inch. It takes into its substance a quantity of foreign particles, both nutrient organic matter such as Rotifera and Diatoms and san<l particles. It occurs not uncommonly in old muddy ponds (such as duck-ponds), creeping upon the bottom, and has a white appearance to the naked eye. Lithamoeba (Fig. V.) is distinguished by its large size, disk-like form, the disk-like shape of its pseudopodia, the presence of specific concretions, the vacuolation of its protoplasm, and the block-like form and peculiar tessellated appearance of its large nucleus, which has a very definite capsule. In Lithamoeba it is easy to recognize a distinct pellicle or temporary cuticle which is formed upon the surface of the protoplasm, anil bursts when a pseudopodium is formed. In fact it is the rupture of this pellicle which appears to be the proximate cause of the outflow of protoplasm as a pseudopodium. Probably a still more delicate pellicle always forms on the surface of naked protoplasm, and in the way just indicated determines by its rupture the form and the direction of the “flow” of protoplasm which is described as the “protrusion” of a pseudopodium.

The shells of Lobosa Testacea are not very complex. That of Arcella is remarkable for its hexagonal areolation, dark colour, and firm consistence; it consists of a substance resembling chitin. That of Difflugia has a delicate membranous basis, but includes foreign particles, so as to resemble the built-up case of a Caddis worm.

Arcella is remarkable among all Protozoa for its power of secreting gas-vacuoles (observed also in an Amoeba by Biitschli), which serve a hydrostatic function, causing the Arcella to float. The gas can be rapidly absorbed by the protoplasm, when the vacuole necessarily disappears and the Arcella sinks.

Class IV. LABYRINTHULIDEA.

Characters.— Gymnomyxa forming irregular heaps of ovoid nucleated cells, the protoplasm of which extends itself as a branching network or labyrinth of fine threads. The oval (spindle-shaped) corpuscles, consisting of dense protoplasm, and possessing each a well-marked nucleus (not observed in Chlamydomyxa), travel regularly and continuously along the network of filaments. The oval corpuscles multiply by fission; they also occasionally become encysted and divide into four spherical spores. The young forms developed from these spores presumably develop into colonies, but have not been observed.

Genera.— Two genera only of Labyrinthulidea are known :— Labyrinthula, Cienkowski; Chlamydomyxa, Archer.

Cienkowski (35) discovered Labyrinthula on green Algae growing on wooden piles in the harbour of Odessa (marine). It has an orange colour and forms patches visible to the naked eye. Chlamydomyxa was discovered by Archer of Dublin (36) in the cells of Sphagnum and crawling on its surface; hence it is a freshwater form. Unlike Labyrinthula, the latter forms a laminated shell of cellulose (Fig. VI. 2, c), in which it is frequently completely enclosed, and indeed has rarely been seen in the expanded labyrinthine condition. The laminated cellulose shells are very freely secreted, the organism frequently deserting one and forming another within or adherent to that previously occupied. The network of Chlamydomyxa appears to consist of hyaline threads of streaming protoplasm, whilst that of Labyrinthula has a more homy consistence, and is not regarded by Cienkowski as protoplasm.

The spindle-shaped cells are much alike in form and size in the two genera; but no nucleus was detected by Archer in those of Chlamydomyxa. The encysting of the spindle-cells and their fission into spores has been seen only in Labyrinthula. Chlamydomyxa is often of a brilliant green colour owing to the presence of chlorophyll corpuscles, and may exhibit a red or mottled red and green appearance owing to the chemical change of the chlorophyll.
[9:19:844]

of the network appear to consist of contractile protoplasm, whilst in the latter they are described as firm horny threads exuded by the spindle-cells. Neither form has been re-examined since its discovery; and it is possible that this apparent difference will be removed bv further study. Class V. HELIOZOA, Haeckel, 1866. Characters.— Gyιnnomyxa in which the dominating amoeba phase has the form of a spherical body from the surface of which radiate numerous isolated filamentous pseudopodia which exhibit very little movement or change of form, except when engaged in the inception of food-particles. The protoplasm of the spherical body is richly vacuolated; it may exhibit one or more contractile vacuoles and either a single central nucleus or many nuclei (Nuclearia, Actinosphaerium). Skeletal products may or may not be present. Flagellulae have been observed as the young forms of some species (Acanthocystis, Clathrulina), but very little has been as yet ascertained as to spore-formation or conjugation in this group, though isolated facts of importance have been observed. Mostly freshwater forms.
[9:19:845]

Sub-class A. Imperforata. Characters.— Shell-substance not perforated by numerous apertures through which the protoplasm can issue, but provided’with only one or two large apertures, or in branched forms with a few such apertures. Order 1. GROMIIDEA, Brady. Characters.— Shell or test membranous, in the form of a simple sac with a pseudopodial aperture either at one extremity or at both. Pseudopodia thread-like, long, branching, reticulated. Marine and freshwater.Fam. 1. Monostomina, with a single aperture to the shell.

(Fig. VII. 1; body spherical; pseudopodia with an axial skeletal filament; central nucleus; one large contractile vacuole; often forming colonies; A. sol, the Sun-animalcule); Actinosphaerium, Stein (Fig. VIII.; spherical body; pseudopodia with axial filament; nuclei very numerous; contractile vacuoles 2 to 14); Actinolophus, F. E. Schulze (stalked).

Order 2. CHLAMYDOPHORA, Archer (57).

Characters.— Heliozoa with a soft jelly-like or felted fibrous envelope.

Genera.— Hcterophrys, Archer (Fig. VII. 3); Sphaevastrum, Greeff; Astrodisculus, Greeff (Fig. VII. 8).

Order 3. CHALAROTHORACA, Hertw. and Lesser (58).

Order 4. DESMOTHORACA, Hertw. and Less.

Characters.— Heliozoa with a skeletal envelope in the form of a spherical or nearly spherical shell of silica ρreforated by numerous large holes.

Genera.— Orl·ulinella, Entz (without a stalk); Clathrulina, Cienk. (with a stalk, Fig. VII. 2).

Further remarks on the Heliozoa.— The Sun-animalcules, Actinophrys and Actinosphaerium, were the only known members of this group when Carter discovered in 1863 Acanthocystis. Our further knowledge of them is chiefly due to Archer of Dublin, who discovered the most important forms, and figured them in the Quart. Jour. Mier. Sei. in 1867.

Some of the Proteomyxa {e.g., Vampyrella) exhibit “heliozoon-like” or “actinophryd” forms, but are separated from the true Heliozoa by the fact that their radiant pseudopodia are not maintained for long in the stiff isolated condition characteristic of this group. It is questionable whether Nuclearia should not be relegated to the Proteomyxa on account of the mobility of its body, which in all other Heliozoa has a constant spherical form.

Actinophrys sol is often seen to form groups or colonies (by fission), and so also is Raphidiophrys. It is probable from the little that is known that reproduction takes place not only by simple fission but by multiple fission, producing flagellate spores which may or may not be preceded by encystment. Only Clathrulina, Acanthocystis, Actinosphaerium, and Actinophrys have been observed in the encysted state, and only the first two have been credited with the production of flagellated young. The two latter genera form covered spores within their cysts, those of Actinosphaerium being remarkable for their siliceous coats (Fig. VIII. 14), but their further development has not been seen.

Class VI. RETICULARIA, Carpenter, 1862. {Foraminifera, Auct., Thalam<yphora, Hertwig).

Characters.— Gymnomyxa in which the dominating amoeba-phase, often of great size (an inch in diameter), has an irregular form, and a tendency to throw out great trunks of branching and often anastomosing filamentous pseudopodia, and an equally strong tendency to form a shell of secreted membrane or secreted lime or of agglutinated sand particles (only in one genus of secreted silex) into which the protoplasm (not in all ?) can be drawn and out of and over which it usually streams in widely spreading lobes and branches. One nucleus is present, or there are many. A contractile vacuole is sometimes, but not as a rule, present (or at any rate not described). Reproduction is by fission and (as in some other Protozoa) by the formation of peculiar bud-spores which remain for a time after their formation embedded in the parental protoplasm. No multiple breaking up into spores after or independent of the formation of a cyst is known. Marine and freshwater.

The Reticularia are divisible into several orders. The marked peculiarity of the shell structure in certain of these orders is only fitly emphasized by grouping them together as a sub-class Perforata, in contrast to which the remaining orders stand as a sub-class Imperforata. The distinction, however, is not an absolute one, for a few of the Lituolidea are perforate, that is, are sandy isomorphs of perforate genera such as Globigerina and Rotalia.
[9:19:846]

Genera.— Lieberkuhnia, Clap, and Lach.; Gromia, Dnj. (Fig. IX. 2); Mikrogromia, Hertw.; Euglypha, Duj. (shell built up of hexagonal siliceous plates); Diaphorophodon, Archer (38) (many foreign particles cemented to form shell; small pseudopodia issue between these, hence resembling Perforata, and large long ones from the proper mouth of the shell, Fig. IX. 12).

Fam. 2. AMPHl8T0MlNA,with an aperture at each end of the shell.

Genera. —Diplophrys, Barker (Fig. IX. 1); Ditrema, Archer; Amphitrema, Archer (Fig. IX. 11); Shepheardella, Siddall (39) (membranous shell very long and cylindrical so as to be actually tubular, narrowed to a spout at each end, Fig. IX. 3; protoplasm extended from either aperture, Fig. IX. 5, and rapidly circulating within the tubular test during life, carrying with it the nucleus which itself exhibits peculiar movements of rotation, Fig. IX. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).

Order 2. ASTRORHIZIDEA, Brady.

Characters.— Test invariably consisting of foreign particles; it is usually of large size and single-chambered, often branched or radiate with a pseudopodial aperture to each branch, the test often continued on to the finer branches of the pseudopodia (Fig. X. 12); never symmetrical. All marine.

Fam. 1. Astrorhizina, Brady. Walls thick, composed of loose sand or mud very slightly cemented.

Genera.— Astrorhiza, Sandahl (Fig. X. 12, very little enlarged); Pelosina, Brady; Storthosphaera, Brady; Dendrophrya, St. Wright; Syringammina, Brady.

Fam. 2. Pilulinina, Test single-chambered; walls thick, composed chiefly of felted sponge-spicules and fine sand, without calcareous or other cement.

Genera.— Pilulina, Carpenter; Techniteιla, Norman; Bathy∙ siphon, Sars.

Fam. 3. Saccamminina. Chambers nearly spherical; walls thin, composed of firmly cemented sand grains.

Genera.— Psammosphaera, Schultze; Sorosphaera, Brady; Saccam∙ mina, Μ. Sars.

Fam. 4. Rhabdamminina. Test composed of firmly cemented sand - grains, often with sponge - spicules intermixed; tubular; straight, radiate, branched or irregular; free or adherent; withone, two, or more apertures; rarely segmented.

Genera.— Jaculella, Brady; Marsipella, Norman (Fig. X. 13); Rhabdammina, Μ. Sars; Aschemovella, Brady; Rhizammina, Brady; Sagenella, Brady; Botellina, Carp.; Haliphysema, Bowerbank (test wine-glass-shaped, rarely branched, attached by a disklike base; generally beset with sponge-spicules, Fig. X. 11; pseudopodial aperture at the free extremity). This and Astrorhiza are the only members of this order in which the living protoplasm has been observed; in the latter it has the appearance of a yellowish cream, and its microscopic structure is imperfectly unknown (61). In Haliphysema the network of expanded pseudopodia has been observed by Saville Kent as drawn in Fig. X. 11. Lankester (59) discovered numerous vesicular nuclei scattered in the protoplasm (Fig. X. 10, ri), and also near the mouth of the shell reproductive bodies (probably bud-spores) embedded in the protoplasm (Fig. X. 8). Haliphysema was described by Bowerbank as a Sponge, and mistaken by Haeckel (60) for a very simple two-cell-layered animal (Enterozoon), to which he assigned the class name of Physemaria.

Order 3. MILIOLIDEA, Brady.

Characters.— Test imperforate; normally calcareous and porcellanous, sometimes encrusted with sand; under starved conditions {e.g., in brackish water) becoming chitinous or clιitino-arenaceous; at abyssal depths occasionally consisting of a thin homogeneous, imperforate, siliceous film. The test has usually a chambered structure, being divided by septa (each with a hole in it) into a series of loculi which may follow one another in a straight line (Fig. X. 4) or the series may be variously coiled (Fig. X. 1 and 3). The chambering of the test does not express a corresponding cellsegmentation of the protoplasm; the latter, although growing in volume as the new shell-chambers are formed, remains one continuous cell-unit with many irregularly scattered nuclei (Fig. X. 2). The chambered and septate structure results in this group and in the other orders from the fact that the protoplasm, expanded beyond the last-formed chamber, forms a new test upon itself whilst it lies and rests upon the surface of the old test. The variations in such a formation are shown in Fig. XII. 1, 2, 3, 4.

Fam. 1. Nubecula Rina. Test free or adherent, taking various irregular asymmetrical forms, with variable aperture or apertures.

Genera.— Comuspira, Schultze; Peneroplis, Montfort (Fig. X. 3); [9:19:847]

Orbiculina, Lamarck; Orbitolites, Lamarck (by a division of the chambers regularly into chamberlets, and a cyclical mode of growth which results in shells of the size of a shilling, a very elaborate-looking structure is produced which has been admirably analysed by Carpenter (40), to whose memoir the reader is specially referred).

Order 9. ROTALIDEA, Brady.

Characters.— Test calcareous, perforate; free or adherent. Typically spiral and “rotaliform” (Fig. XII. 2), that is to say, coiled in such a manner that the whole of the segments are visible on the superior surface, those of the last convolution only on the inferior or apertural side, sometimes one face being more convex sometimes the other. Aberrant forms evolute, outspread, acervuline, or irregular. Some of the higher modifications with double chamberwalls, supplemental skeleton, and a system of canals.

Outside and between the successive chambers with finely perforated walls a 2 , a 3 , a i a secondary shell-substance is deposited by the protoplasm which has a different structure. Whilst the successive chambers with their finely perforate walls (resembling dentine in structure) are formed by the mass of protoplasm issuing from the mouth of the last-formed chamber, the secondary or supplemental-shell substance is formed by the protoplasm which issues through the fine perforations of the primary shell substance; it is not finely canaliculated, but is of denser substance than the primary shell and traversed by coarse canals (occupied by the protoplasm) which make their way to the surface of the test (c', c). In Calcarina a large bulk of this secondary shell-substance is deposited around each chamber and also forms the heavy club-like spines.]

Fam. 5. Eozoonina. Test forming irregular, adherent, acervuline masses.

Further remarks on the B,eticularia.— The name Thalamophora, pointing to the peculiar tendency which the larger members of the group have to form chamber after chamber and so to build up a complex shell, has been proposed by Hertwig (56) and adopted by many writers. The old name Foraminifera (which did not refer to the fine perforations of the Perforata but to the large pseudopodial aperture leading from chamber to chamber) has also been extended by some so as to include the simpler Gromia-like forms. On the whole Carpenter’s term Reticularia (62) seems most suitable for the group, since they all present the character indicated. It has been objected that the Radiolaria are also reticular in their pseudopodia, but if we except the pelagic forms of Reticularia (Globigerina, Orbulina, &c.), we find that the Radiolaria are really distinguishable by their stiffer, straighter, radiating pseudopodia. No doubt the Labyrinthulid Chlamydomyxa and the plasmodia of some Mycetozoa are as reticular in their pseudopodia as the Reticularia, but they possess other distinctive features which serve, at any rate in an artificial system, to separate them.

The protoplasm of the majority of the Reticularia is unknown, or only very superficially observed; hence we have made a point of introducing among our figures as many as possible which show this essential part of the organism. It is only recently (1876) that nuclei have been detected in the calcareous-shelled members of the group, and they have only been seen in a few cases.

The protoplasm of the larger shell-making forms is known to be often strongly coloured, opaque, and creamy, but its minute structure remains for future investigation. Referring the reader to the figures and their explanation, we would draw especial attention to the structure of the protoplasmic body of Hastigerina (one of the Globigerinidea) as detected by the “Challenger” naturalists. It will be seen from Fig. XII. 5 that the protoplasm extends as a relatively enormous “bubbly” mass around the shell which is sunk within it; from the surface of this “bubbly” (vacuolated or alveol-ated) mass the pseudopodia radiate.

The reader is requested to compare this with Fig. XIΠ., representing the “bubbly” protoplasmic body of Thalassicolla. It then becomes obvious that the perforated central capsule CK of the latter holds the same relation to the mass of the protoplasm as does the central perforated shell of Globigerina (Hastigerina). The extreme vacuolation of the protoplasm in both cases (the vacuoles being [9:19:849]

filled with sea-water accumulated by endosmosis) and the stiff radiating pseudopodia are directly correlated with the floating pelagic life of the two organisms. All the Radiolaria are pelagic, and many exhibit this vacuolation; only a few of the Reticularia are so, and their structural correlation to that habit has only lately been ascertained.

The Reticularia are almost exclusively known by their shells, which offer a most interesting field for study on account of the very great complexity of form attained by some of them, notwithstanding the fact that the animal which produces them is a simple unicellular Protozoon. Space does not permit the exposition here of the results obtained by Carpenter in the study of the complex shells of Orbitolites, Operculina, Nummulites, &c.; it is essential that his work Introduction to the Study of the Foraminifera (Ray Society, 1862) should be consulted, and in reference to the sandy-shelled forms the monograph by Brady, in the Challenger Reports, vol. ix., 1883; and it must be sufficient here to point out the general principles of the shell-architecture of the Reticularia. Let us suppose that we have an ever-growing protoplasmic body which tends to produce a calcareous shell on its surface, leaving an aperture for the exit of its pseudopodia. It will grow too large for its shell and accumulate outside the shell. The accumulated external mass may then secrete a second chamber, resting on the first as chamber 1 rests on chamber 0 in Fig. XII. 4. By further growth a new chamber is necessitated, and so is produced a series following one another in a straight line, each chamber communicating with the newer· one in front of it by the narrow pseudopodial aperture (a, a 1 , a 2 , a 3 ). Now itis possible for these chambers to be very variously arranged instead of simply as in Fig. XII. 4. For instance, each new chamber may completely enclose the last, as in Fig. XII. 3, supposing the protoplasm to spread all over the outside of the old chamber before making a new deposit. Again the chambers need not succeed one another in a straight line, but may be disposed in a spiral (Fig. XII. 1). And this spiral may be a flat coil, or it may be a helicine spiral with a rising axis; further it may be close or open. All these forms in various degrees of elaboration are exhibited by Miliolidea and various Perforata.

But the Perforata in virtue of their perforate shell-walls introduce a new complication. The protoplasm issues not only from the mouth of the last-formed chamber, but from the numerous pores in the wall itself. This latter protoplasm exerts its lime-secreting functions; it gathers itself into coarse branching threads which remain uncalcified, whilst all around a dense deposit of secondary or supplemental shell-substance is thrown down, thus producing a coarsely canalicular structure. The thickness and amount of this secondary shell and the position it may occupy between and around the chambers of primitive shell-substance vary necessarily in different genera according to the mode in which the primitive chambers are arranged and connected with one another. Calcarina is a fairly typical instance of an abundant secondary shell-deposit (Fig. XII. 10), and it is the existence of structure resembling the chambers of Calcarina with their surrounding primary and secondary shellsubstances which has rendered it necessary to regard Eozoon (41) as the metamorphosed encrusting shell of a pre-Cambrian Reticularian.

The division of the Reticularia into Imperforata and Perforata which is here maintained has no longer the significance which was once attributed to it. It appears, according to the researches of Brady, that it is not possible to draw a sharp line between these sub-classes, since there are sandy forms which it is difficult to separate from imperforate Lituolidea and are nevertheless perforate, in fact are “sandy isomorphs of Lagena, Nodosaria, Globigerina, and Rotalia.” It does not appear to the present writer that there can be any insurmountable difficulty in separating the Lituolidea into two groups—those which are sandy isomorphs of the porcellanous Miliolidea, and those which are sandy isomorphs of the hyaline Perforata. The two groups of Lituolidea thus formed might be placed in their natural association respectively with the Imperforata and the Perforata.

The attempt to do this has not been made here, but the classification of Brady has been adopted. In Biitschli’s large work on the Protozoa (9) the breaking up of the Lituolidea is carried out to a logical conclusion, and its members dispersed among the Miliolidea on the one hand and the various orders of Perforata on the other hand.

The calcareous shell-substance of the Miliolidea being opaque and white has led to their being called “Porcellana,” whilst the transparent calcareous shells of the smaller Perforata has gained for that group the synonym of “Hyalina.”

The shells of the calcareous Reticularia and of some of the larger arenaceous forms are found in stratified rocks, from the Palaeozoic strata onwards. The Chalk is in places largely composed of their shells, and the Eocene Nummulitic limestone is mainly a cemented mass of the shells of Nummulites often as large each as a shilling. The Atlantic ooze is a chalky deposit consisting largely of the shells of Globigerina, &c.

Class VII. RADIOLARIA, Haeckel, 1862 (63) {Polycystina, Ehr.).

Characters.— Gymnomyxa in which the protoplasmic body of the dominant amoeba phase has the form of a sphere or cone from the surface of which radiate filamentous pseudopodia, occasionally anastomosing, and encloses a spherical (homaxonic) or cone-shaped (monaxonic) perforated shell of membranous consistence known as the central capsule, and probably homologous with the perforated shell of a Globigerina. The protoplasm within the capsule (intracapsular protoplasm) is continuous through the pores or apertures of the capsule with the outer protoplasm. Embedded in the former lies the large and specialized nucleus (one or more). Gelatinous substance is frequently formed peripherally by the extracapsular protoplasm, constituting a kind of soft mantle which is penetrated by the pseudopodia. A contractile vacuole is never present.

Usually an abundant skeleton, consisting of spicules of silica or of a peculiar substance called acanthin arranged radially or tangentially, loose or united into a basket-work, is present. Oil globules, pigment, and crystals are found in greater or less abundance in the protoplasm.

In most but not all Radiolaria peculiar nucleated yellow corpuscles are abundantly present, usually regarded as parasitic Algae. Reproduction by fission has been observed, and also in some few species a peculiar formation of swarm-spores (flagellulae) within the central capsule, in which the nucleus takes an important part. All the Radiolaria are marine. The Radiolaria are divided into two sub-classes according to the chemical nature of their spicular skeleton, and into orders according to the nature and the disposition of the apertures in the wall of the central capsule.

Sub-class I. Silιco-Skeleta, Lankester.

Characters. — A more or less elaborate basket-work of tangential and radial elements consisting of secreted silica is present; in rare exceptions no skeleton is developed.

Characters.— Silico-skeletal Radiolaria in which the central capsule is uniformly perforated all over by fine pore-canals; its form is that of a sphere (homaxonic), and to this form the siliceous skeleton primarily conforms, though it may become discoid, rhabdoid, or irregular. The nucleus is usually single, but numerous nuclei are present in each central capsule of the Polycyttaria.

Fam. 1. Sphaerida, Haeck. Spherical Peripylaea with a spherical basket-work skeleton, sometimes surrounded by a spongy outer skeleton, sometimes simple, sometimes composed of many concentric spheres (never discoid, flattened, or irregular).

Further remarks on the Radiolaria.— It has not been possible in the systematic summary above given to enumerate the immense number of genera which have been distinguished by Haeckel (42) as the result of the study of the skeletons of this group. The important differences in the structure of the central capsule of different Radiolaria were first shown by Hertwig, who also discovered that the spines of the Acanthometridea consist not of silica but of an organic compound. In view of this latter fact and of the peculiar numerical and architectural features of the Acanthometrid skeleton, it seems proper to separate them altogether from the other Radiolaria. The Peripylaea may be regarded as the starting point of the Radiolarian pedigree, and have given rise on the one hand to the Acanthometridea, which retain the archaic structure of the central capsule whilst developing a peculiar skeleton, and on the other hand to the Monopylaea and Phaeodaria which have modified the capsule but retained the siliceous skeleton.
[table]

The occasional total absence of any siliceous or acanthinous skeleton does not appear to be a matter of classificatory importance, since skeletal elements occur in close allies of those very few forms [9:19:852] which are totally devoid of skeleton. Similarly it does not appear to be a matter of great significance that some forms (Polycyttaria) form colonies, instead of the central capsules separating from one another after fission has occurred.

It is important to note that the skeleton of silex or acanthin does not corres]κ>nd to the shell of other Gymnomyxa, which appears rather to be represented by the membranous central capsule. The skeleton does, however, appear to correspond to the spicules of Heliozoa, and there is an undeniable affinity between such a form as Clathrulina (Fig. VII. 2) and the Sphaerid Peripylaea (such as Heliosphaera, Fig. XIV. 14). The Radiolaria are, however, a very strongly marked group, definitely separated from all other Gymnomyxa by the membranous central capsule sunkin their protoplasm. Their differences inter se do not affect their essential structure. The variations in the chemical composition of the skeleton and in the perforation of the capsule do not appear superficially. The most obvious features in which they differ from one another relate to the form and complexity of the skeleton, a part of the organism so little characteristic of the group that it may be wanting altogether. It is not known how far the form-species and form-genera which have been distinguished in such profusion by Haeckel as the result of a study of the skeletons are permanent (i.e., relatively permanent) physiological species. There is no doubt that very many are local and conditional varieties of a single Protean species. The same remark applies to the species discriminated among the shell-bearing Reticularia. It must not be supposed, however, that less importance is to be attached to the distinguishing and recording of such forms because we are not able to assert that they are permanent species.

The yellow cells (of spherical form, Ό05 to 0 - 15 of a millimetre in diameter) which occur very generally scattered in the extracapsular protoplasm of Radiolaria were at one time regarded as essential components of the Radiolarian body. Their parasitic nature is now rendered probable by the observations of Cienkowski (43), Brandt (44), and Geddes (45), who have established that each cell has a cellulose wall and a nucleus (Fig. XIV. 6 to 13), that the protoplasm is impregnated by chlorophyll which, as in Diatoms, is obscured by tire yellow pigment, and that a starch-like substance is present (giving the violet reaction with iodine). Further, Cienkθλvski showed, not only that the yellow cells multiply by fission during the life of the Radiolarian, but that when isolated they continue to live; the cellulose envelope becomes softened; the protoplasm exhibits amoeboid movements and escapes from the envelope altogether (Fig. XIV. 13) and multiplies by fission. Brandt has given the name Zooxanthella nutricola to the parasitic unicellular Alga thus indicated. He and Geddes have shown that a similar organism infests the endoderm cells of Anthozoa and of some Siphonophora in enormous quantities, and the former has been led, it seems erroneously, to regard the chlorophyll corpuscles of Hydra viridis, Spongi Ila, and Ciliata as also parasitic Algae, for which he has coined the name Zoochlorella. The same arguments which Brandt has used to justify this view as to animal chlorophyll would warrant the creation of a genus “Phytochlorella” for the hypothetical Alga which has hitherto been described as the “chlorophyll corpuscles” of the cells of ordinary green plants.

Zooxanthella nutricola does not, for some unknown reason, infest the Acanthometridea, and it is by no means so universally present in the bodies of the Silico-skeleta as was supposed before its parasitic nature was recognized.

The streaming of the granules of the protoplasm has been observed in the pseudopodia of Radiolaria as in those of Heliozoa and Reticularia; it has also been seen in the deeper protoplasm; and granules have been definitely seen to pass through the pores of the central capsule from the intracapsular to the extracaρsular protoplasm. A feeble vibrating movement of the pseudopodia has been occasionally noticed.

The production of swarm-spores has been observed only in Acanthornetra and in the Polycyttaria and Thalassicollidae, and only in the two latter groups have any detailed observations been made. Two distinct processes of swarm-spore production have been observed by Cienkowski (43), confirmed by Hertwig (46)—distinguished by the character of the resulting spores which are called “crystalligerous” (Fig. XIV. 15) in the one case, and “dimorphous f, in the other (Fig. XIV. 16). In both processes the nucleated protoplasm within the central capsule breaks up by a more or less regular cell-division into small pieces, the details of the process differing a little in the two cases. In those individuals which produce crystalligerous swarm-spores, each spore encloses a small crystal (Fig. XIV. 15). On the other hand, in those individuals which produce dimorphous swarm-spores, the contents of the capsule (which in both instances arc set free by its natural rupture) are seen to consist of individuals of two sizes “macrospores” and “microspores,” neither of which contain crystals (Fig. XIV. 16). The further development of the spores has not been observed in either case. Both processes have been observed in the same species, and it is suggested that there is an alternation of sexual and asexual generations, the crystalligerous spores developing directly into adults, which in their turn produce in their central capsules dimorphous swarm-spores (macrospores and microspores), which in a manner analagous to that observed in the Volvocinean Flagellata copulate (permanently i'us>e) with me another (the larger with the smaller) before proceeding to develop. The adults resulting from this process would, it is suggested, produce in their turn crystalligerous swarm-spores. Unfortunately we have no observations to support this hypothetical scheme of a life-history.

Fusion or conjugation of adult Radiolaria, whether preliminary to swarm-spore-production or independently of it, has not been observed—this affording a distinction between them and Heliozoa, and an agreement, though of a negative character, with the Reticularia.

Simple fission of the central capsule of adult individuals and subsequently of the whole protoplasmic mass has been observed in several instances, and is probably a general method of reproduction in the group.

The siliceous shells of the Radiolaria are found abundantly in certain rocks. They furnish, together with Diatoms and Spongespicules, the silica which has been segregated as flint in the Chalk formation. They are present in quantity (as much as 10 per cent.) in the Atlantic ooze, and in the celebrated “Barbados earth” (a Tertiary deposit) are the chief components.

Grade B. CORTICATA, Lankester, 1878 (64).

Characters. — Protozoa in which the protoplasm of the cell-body, in its adult condition, is permanently differentiated into two layers, an outer denser cortical substance and an inner more fluid medullary substance (not to be confused with the merely temporary distinction of exoplasm and endoplasm sometimes noted in Gymnomyxa, which is not structural but due to the gravitation and self-attraction of the coarser granules often embedded in the uniformly fluid protoplasm).

Since the Corticata have developed from simple Gymnomyxa exhibiting both amoeboid and flagellate phases of form and activity, it results (1) that the forms of the body of many Corticata are traceable to modifications of these primitive forms; (2) that the young stages of the Corticata are in the lower classes of that group typical flagellulae or amoebulae; and (3) that there are certain archaic forms included in those lower classes whose position there is doubtful, and which might be with almost equal propriety assigned to the Gymnomyxa, since they are transitional from that lower grade to the higher grade of Corticata.

Class I. SP0R0Z0A, Leuckart (47); Syn. Gregarinida, Auct.

Characters. — Corticata parasitic in almost all classes and orders of animals, imbibing nutriment from the diffusible albuminoids of tbeir hosts and therefore mouthless. In typical cases there is hatched from a chlamydospore one or more modified nucleate or non-nucleate flagellulae (falciform young, drepanidium phase). The flagellula increases in size and differentiates cortical and medullary substance. Fission is common in the younger stages of growth. The movements now become neither vibratile nor amoeboid but definitely restrained, and are best described as “euglenoid” (cf. Flagellata, Fig. XX. 27, 28). The nucleus is single, large, and spherical. No contractile vacuole and rarely any vacuole is present. A size of τ ⅛th inch may be attained in this phase, which may be definitely spoken of as the euglena phase corresponding to the amoeba phase of Gymnomyxa. It is usually of oblong form, with sac-like contractile wall of cortical substance, but may be spherical (Coccidiidea) or even amoeboid (Myxosporidia).

Conjugation, followed directly or after an interval by sporulation, may now ensue. The conjugated individuals (two), or sometimes a single individual, become encysted. The contents of the cysts now rapidly divide (by a process the details of λvhich are unknown) into minute ovoid nucleated (?) bodies; sometimes a portion of the protoplasm is not converted into spores but may form sporoducts (cf. capillitium of Mycetozoa). Each piece acquires a special chitin-like colourless coat, and is then a chlamydospore. Rarely one spore oιdy is formed from the whole contents of a cyst. The spore-coat is usually thick, and remarkable for processes and other accessory developments. The included protoplasm of the chlamydospore frequently divides into several pieces before hatching. These usually, when set free from the spore-coat, have the form of modified nucleated flagellulae, i.e., flagellulae in which the protoplasm is not drawn out into a thread-like flagellum but exhibits an elongate form, uniformly endowed with vibratile activity. With few (if any) exceptions, the falciform young thus characterized penetrates a cell of some tissue of its host and there undergoes the first stages of its growth (hence called Cytozoa). In some forms the pre-cystic phase never escapes from its cell host. In other cases it remains connected with the hospitable cell long after it has by growth exceeded by many hundred times the bulk of its quondam entertainer; often it loses all connexion with its cell host and is carried away to some other part of the infested animal before completing its growth and encysting.
[9:19:853]

The Sporozoa are divided into four sub-classes, differing from one another according to the form and development attained by the euglena phase. We shall place the most highly developed first, not only because our knowledge about it is most complete, but because it is possible that one at least of the other sub-classes is derived by degeneration from it. Sub-class I. Gregarinidea, Biitschli (9). Characters.— Sporozoa in which the euglena phase is dominant, being relatively of large size, elongate in form, definitely shaped, having contractile but not viscid cortex, and exhibiting often active nutritional and locomotor phenomena. Though usually if not invariably cell-parasites in early youth, they become free before attaining adult growth, and inhabit either the body-cavity or the intestine of their hosts. Many spores are produced in the encysted phase. The spores have an oblong, sometimes caudate coat, and produce each one or several falciform young. At present only known as parasites of Invertebrata.

Order 1. HAPLOCYTA, Lankester.

Characters.— Gregarinidea in which there is never at any time a partition of the medullary substance into two or more chambers. The euglenoid is always a single contractile sac with one mass of medullary substance in which floats the large vesicular transparent nucleus. Spores larger than in the next group, each producing several falciform young.

Genus unicum.— Monocystis, Stein, 1848. The various generic subdivisions proposed by Aim. Schneider (48), and accepted by Biitschli, appear to the present writer to have insufficient characters, and serve to complicate rather than to organize our knowledge of the subject. We do not yet know enough of the sporulation and subsequent development of the various monocystic Gregarinidea to justify the erection of distinct genera.

Monocystis agilis, Stein, Fig. XVII. 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and Fig. XVIÏI. is the type. The other species of Monocystis occur chiefly (and very commonly) in marine Annelids, Platyhelminthes, Gephyraea, and Tunicata; not in Arthrqpoda, Mollusca, nor Vertebrata. The only definite differences which they present of possibly more than specific worth, as compared with Μ. agilis, are in the form of the chlamydospores, which are sometimes tailed, as in Μ. saemtridis (Fig. XVII. 5), and in Μ. nemertis (Fig. XVII. 13) and Μ. sipunculi, and further also certain differences in the general form, as for instance the anchor-like Μ. sagittata (Fig. XVII. 23), and the proboscidiferous Μ. aphroditae (Fig. XVII. 17). The fine parallel striation of the cuticule in some species (4f. serpulae, &c.) might also be made the basis of a generic or subgeneric group.

On the whole it seems best to leave all the species for the present in the one genus Monocystis, pending further knowledge. It seems probable that more than one species (at least two, Μ. agilis and Μ. magna) infest the common Earthworm.

Order 2. SEPTATA, Lankester.

Characters. —Gregarinidea in which in the adult the medullary substance is separated into two chambers—a smaller anterior (the [9:19:854] protomerite) and a larger posterior (the deutomerite), in which lies the nucleus. There is frequently if not always present, either in early growth or more persistently, an anterior proboscis-like appendage (the epimerite) growing from the protomerite. The epimerite serves to attach the parasite to its host, and may for that purpose carry booklets. It is always shed sooner or later. The phase in which it is present is called a “cephalont,” the phase after it has broken off a “sporont” (see Fig. XIX. 22, 23). The spores are smaller than in the preceding gr<>up, often very minute, and sometimes the cyst is complicated by the formation of sporoducts, and by a kind of “capillitium” of residual protoplasm (Fig. XIX. 2). Spores producing each only a single (?) falciform young.

Genera. — Gregarina, Dufour; Hoplorhynchus, Von Carus.

[The numerous genera which have been proposed at different times by Hammerschmidt and others, and more recently by Aimé Schneider, appear to the present writer to be unserviceable, owing to the fact that our knowledge is as yet very incomplete. A good basis for generic or family distinctions might probably be found in the greater or less elaboration of the cyst and the formation or not of sporoducts. But of the majority of Septata we do not know the cysts or the history of sporulation; we merely know that some have simple cysts with complete sporulation leaving no residue of protoplasm, and that others form cysts with double walls and elaborate tubular ducts, whilst a part of the protoplasm is not sporulated but forms a capillitium (Fig. XIX. 2).

Another possible basis for generic division of the Septata may be found in the characters of the epimerite. This may be present or absent altogether. It may exist only in the young condition or persist until growth is completed. It may be simple, short, elongate, or provided with booklets. The presence of booklets on the epimerite is the only character which at present seems to serve conveniently for generic distinction. With regard to the other points mentioned we are not sufficiently informed, since we know the complete history of development from the young form set free from the spore in only one or two cases.]

The Septata are found exclusively in the alimentary canals of Arthropoda (Insects, Myriapods, Crustacea, not Arachnida). See Fig. XIX. for various examples of the group.

Sub-class II. Coccidiidea, Biitschli (9).

Sporozoa in which the euglena phase remains of relatively minute size, of spherical shape and simple egg-cell-like structure. It is not locomotive, but continues, until the cyst is formed, to inhabit a single cell of the host. Many, few, or one single chlamydospore are formed in the cyst. One or more falciform young escape from each spore, and exhibit active movements (flagêllula-hke) leading to a penetration of a tissue-cell by the young form as in Gregarinidea. Many are parasites of Vertebrata.

Order 2. OLIGOSPOREA, Aim. Schn.

Characters.— The cyst-content develops itself into a definite and constant but small number of spores.

Genus unicum.— Coccidium, Leuck. (in intestinal epithelium and liver of Mammals, and some Invertebrates, Figs. XVII. 24 to 31).

Order 3. POLYSPOREA.

Characters.— The cyst-content develops itself into a great number of spores (sixty or more).

Genus unicum. — Klossia, Aim. Schn. Three species of Klossia are found in Mollusca—viz., in Helix, in Cephalopods, and in Chiton. Schneider’s genus, Adelea, from Lithobius, appears to belong here. Kloss (49) discovered the parasite of the renal cells of Helix hortensis represented in Fig. XVII. 18, 19, 20, 21, and 22; Schneider that of Cephalopods, Fig. XVII. 32, 33. In Chiton Dr Tovey has discovered a third species with very remarkable spores, which are here figured for the first time (Fig. XVII. 12).

The Drepanidium Ranarum (Fig. XVII. 45, 46, 47), discovered by Lankester (50) in the Frog’s blood, is probably the falciform young of a Coccidium parasitic in the Frog’s kidney, and discovered there by Lieberkühn (51). A spore of this Coccidium is shown in Fig. XVII. 48; whilst in 46 two Drepanidia which have penetrated a red-blood corpuscle of the Frog are represented.

The Polysporous Coccidiidea come very close to the Gregarinide genus Monocystis, from which they may be considered as being derived by an arrest of development. The spores and falciform young of the Coccidiidea are closely similar to those of Monocystis, and the young in both cases penetrate the tissue-cells of their host; but in Monocystis this is only a temporary condition, and growth leads to the cessation of such “cell-parasitism.” On the other hand, growth is arrested in the Coccidiidea, and the organism is permanently a cell-para site.

Since the parasitism is more developed in the case of a cell-parasite than in the case of a parasite which wanders in the body cavity, it seems probable that the Coccidiidea have been derived from the Gregarinidea rather than that the reverse process has taken place.

Sub-class III. Myxosporidia, Bütschli.

Characters.— Sporozoa in which the euglena-phase is a large multinucleate amoeba-like organism (Fig. XVII. 34). The cysts are imperfectly known, but appear to be simple; some attain a diameter of two lines. The spores are highly characteristic, having each a thick coat which is usually provided with a bifurcate process or may have thread capsules (like nematocysts) in its substance (Fig. XVII. 40, 41, 42, 43, 44).

The spores contain a single nucleus, and are not known to produce falciform young, but in one case have been seen to liberate an amoebula. The further development is unknown. The Myxosporidia are parasitic beneath the epidermis of the gills and fins, and in the gall-bladder and urinary bladder of Fishes, both freshwater and marine.

Genera.— Myxidium, Biitschli (Pike, Fig. XVII. 34); Myxobolus, Bütschli (Cyprinoids); Lithocystis, Giard (the Lamellibranch Echino-cardium).

The Myxosporidia are very imperfectly known. They present very close affinities to the Mycetozoa, and are to be regarded as a connecting link between the lower Gymnomyxa and the typical Sporozoa. Possibly their large multinucleate amoeba phase is a plasmodium formed by fusion of amoebulae set free from spores, though it is possible that the many nuclei are the result of a division of an original single nucleus, preparatory to sporulation.

Their spores are more elaborate in structure than those of any other Protozoa, and are more nearly paralleled by those of some species of Monocystis than by those of Mycetozoa. The threadcapsules of the spores are identical in structure with those of Hydrozoa, and probably serve as organs of attachment, as do the furcate processes of the spore-case. It is not certain that a definite cyst is always or ever formed, but as occurs rarely in some Gregarinidea, the spores may be formed in a non encysted amoeba form.

Although pseudopodia, sometimes short and thread-like, have been observed in the amoeba phase, yet it is also stated that a distinction of cortical and medullary substance obtains.

The “psorosperms” of J. Müller are the spores of Myxosporidia.

Sub-class IV. Sarcocystidia, Bütschli.

(This division is formed by Bütschli for the reception of Sarcocystis, parasitic in the muscular fibres of Mammals, and of Amcebi-dium, parasitic in Crustacea. Both are very insufficiently known, but have the form of tubular protoplasmic bodies in which numerous ovoid spores are formed from which falciform young escape. )

Genera.— Sarcocystis, Lankester; Amoebidium, Cienkowski (52). Sarcocystis(Fig. XVII. 50,51, S. Miescheri, Lank.), was first observed by Miescher in the striated muscle-fibres of the Mouse; then by Rainey in a similar position in the Pig, and taken by him for the youngest stage in the development of the cysts of Taenia solium; subsequently studied by Beale and others in connexion with the cattle-plague epidemic, and erroneously supposed to have a causal connexion with that disease. It is common in healthy butcher’s meat. See Leuckart (47).

Further remarks on the Sporozoa.— The Sporozoa contrast strongly with the large classes of Gymnomyxa, the Heliozoa, Reticularia, and Radiolaria, as also with the Ciliate and Tentaculiferous Corticata, by their abundant and rapidly recurrent formation of spores, and agree in this respect with some Proteomyxa, with Mycetozoa, and some Flagellata. Their spores are remarkable for the firm, chitin-like spore-coat and its varied shapes, contrasting with the cellulose spherical spore-coat of Mycetozoa and with the naked spores of Radiolaria and Flagellata.

The protoplasm of the more highly developed forms (Gregarinidea) in the euglenoid phase exhibits considerable differentiation. Externally a distinct cuticle may be present, marked by parallel rugae {Monocystis serpulse) or by fine tubercles (Monocystis sipunculi). A circlet of hooks may be formed by the cuticle at one end of the body. Below the cuticleôs sometimes developed a layer of fibrils running transversely to the long axis of the body (Fig. XIX. 9 and 19), which have been regarded as contractile, but are probably cuticular. The cortical layer of protoplasm below these cuticular structures is dense and refringent and sometimes fibrillated (Monocystis pellucida, Fig. XVII. 15). It is the contractile substance of the organism, and encloses the finely granular more liquid medullary substance. The granules of the latter have been shown by Bütschli (9) to give a starch-like reaction with iodine, &c. Probably the protoplasm in which they lie is finely reticulate or vacuolar, and when the granules are few it is actually seen to be so. No contractile vacuole is ever present. In Myxosporidia the, medullary protoplasm is coloured yellow by haematoidin derived from the blood of its host or by absorbed bile-pigment, and also contains small crystals.

The nucleus of the Gregarinidea is a large clear capsule, with a few or no nucleolar granules. It has never been seen in a state of division, and it is not known what becomes of it during sporulation, though sporulating Gregarinidea have been observed with many minute nuclei scattered in their protoplasm, presumably formed by a breaking up of the single nucleus.

The habit of attaching themselves in pairs which is common in Gregarinidea is perhaps a reminiscence of a more extensive formation of aggregation plasmodia (compare Mycetozoa). The term “syzygium” is applied to such a conjunction of two Gregarinidea; it is not accompanied by fusion of substance. The formation of cysts is not connected with this pairing, since the latter occurs in young individuals long before encystment. Also cysts are formed by single Gregarinidea, as is always the case in the non-motile Coccidiidea.

The encystment always leads to the formation of spores, but in rare cases sporulation has been observed in unencysted Gregarinidea, and it occurs perhaps normally without true cyst-formation in the Myxosporidia.

The cell-parasitism of the young Sporozoa, and their flagellula-like (falciform) young and active vibratile movement, are points indicating affinity with the lower Gymnomyxa, and especially with those Proteomyxa, such as Vampyrella and Plasmodiophora, which are cell-parasit es. Indeed it is probable that we have in this fact of cell-parasitism, and especially of parasitism in animal cells, a basis for the theoretical association of several unicellular organisms. The Haplococcus of Zopf (regarded by him as a Mycetozoon) is parasitic in the muscular cells of the Pig, and is probably related to Sarcocystis. Recently Von Lendenfeld (53) has described in Australia an amoeba-like organism as parasitic in the skin of Sheep, which will probably be found to be either a Sporozoon or referable to those parasitic spore-producing Proteomyxa which are separated from Sporozoa only by their negative characters (see previous remarks on the negative characters of Proteomyxa).

The application of the name “Gregarines” has sometimes been [9:19:856] made e.roneously to external parasitic organisms, which have nothing in common with the Sporozoa. This was the case in regard to a fungoid growth in human hair—the so-called “chignon Gregarine.” The Silk-worm disease known as “pebrine” has also been attributed to a Gregarine. It seems probable that the parasitic organism which causes that disease is (as is also the distinct parasite causing the disease known as “tlaccidezza” in the same animals) one of the Schizomycetes (Bacteria). No disease is known at present as due to Sporozoa, although (e.g., the Klossia Chilonis') they may lead to atrophy of the organs of the animals which they infest, in consequence of their enormous numbers. Cocciαιa and Sarcocystis are stated to occur in Man. t Class II. FLAGELLATA,^[1. B“*? ’ Lj' β w ,θ rk <θ> , llas bccn Pretty closely followed in the diagnosis of the gιouρs of Flagellata and the enumeration of genera here given. b] Ehrenberg.

Characters. — Corticata in which the dominant phase in the lifehistory is a corticate flagellula, that is, a nucleated cell-body provided with one or a few large processes of vibratile protoplasm. Very commonly solid food particles are ingested through a distinct cell-mouth or aperture in the cortical protoplasm, though in some an imbibition of nutritive matter by the whole surface and a nutritional process chemically resembling that of plants (holophytic), chlorophyll being present, seems to occur.

Conjugation followed by a breaking up into very numerous minute naked spores is frequent in some; as also a division into small individuals (microgonidia), which is followed by their conjugation with one another or with big individuals (macrogonidia) and subsequent normal growth and binary fission.

Many have a well-developed cuticle, which may form collar-like outgrowths or stalk-like processes. Many produce either gelatinous or chitin-like shells (cups or coenoecia), which are connected so as to form spherical or arborescent colonies; in these colonies the protoplasmic organisms themselves produce new individuals by fission, which separate entirely from one another but are held together by the continuity, with those already existing, of the new shells or jelly-houses or stalk-like supports produced by the new individuals. A single well-marked spherical nucleus, and one or more contractile vacuoles, are always present in the full-grown form.

Often, besides ingested food-particles, the protoplasm contains starch granules (amylon nucleus), paramylum corpuscles, Chromatophors and chlorophyll corpuscles, some of which may be so abundant as to obscure the nucleus. One or two pigment spots (stigmata or so-called eye-spots) are often present at the anterior end of the body.

Sub-class I. Lissoflagellata, Lankester.

Never provided with a collar-like outgrowth around the oral pole.

Order 1. MONADIDEA, Biitschli.

Characters.— Lissoflagellata of small or very small size and simple structure; øften naked and more or less amoeboid, sometimes forming tests. Usually colourless, seldom with Chromatophors. With a single anterior large flagellum or sometimes with two additional paraflagella. A special mouth-area is often wanting, sometimes is present, but is never produced into a well-developed pharynx.

Fam. 1. Rhizomasγigtna, Biitschli. Simple mouthless forms with 1 to 2 flagella; either permanently exhibiting a Gymnomyxa-like development of pseudopodia or capable of passing suddenly from a firm-walled into a Gymnomyxa-like condition, when the flagella may remain or be drawn in. Ingestion of food by aid of the pseudopodia.

Genera.— Mastigamoeba, F. E. Schultze; Ciliophrys, Cienkowski (65; Dimorpha, Gruber; Actinomonas, Kent; Trypanosoma, Gruby (parasitic in the blood of Frogs and other Amphibia and Reptiles, Fig. XX. 21, 22). The Rhizomastigina might all be assigned to the Proteomyxa, with which they closely connect the group of Flagellata. The choice of the position to be assigned to such a form as Ciliophrys must be arbitrary.

Fam. 2. Cercomonadina, Kent. Minute oblong cell-body which posteriorly may exhibit amoeboid changes. One large anterior flagellum. Mouth at the base of this organ. Reproduction by longitudinal fission and by multiple fission producing spores in the encysted resting state.

Genera.— Cercomonas, Duj. (Fig. XX. 32, 33); Herpetomonas, S. Kent; Oikomonas, Kent (≈ Monas, James Clark; Pseudospora Cienkowski, Fig. XX. 29, 30, 31); Ancyromonas, S. K.

Fam. 3. Codon<ecina, Kent. Small colourless monads similar to Oikomonas in structure, which secrete a fixed gelatinous or membranous envelope or cup.

Genera.— Codonceca, James Clark; Platythoeca, Stein.

Fam. 4. Bikoecina, Stein. Distinguished from the last family by the fact that the monad is fixed in its cup by a contractile thread-like stalk; cup usually raised on a delicate stalk.

Genera. — Bicosoeca, J. Cl.; Poteriodendron, Stein.
