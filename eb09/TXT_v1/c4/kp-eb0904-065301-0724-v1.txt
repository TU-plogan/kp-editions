CALASIO, Mario de (1550-1620), a Franciscan, and professor of the Hebrew language at Rome, was born in 1550 at a small town in Abruzzo, from which he took his name. His Concordance of the Bible (which occupied him forty years) was published at Rome in 1621, the year after his death. This work has been highly approved and commended both by Protestants and Roman Catholics, and is indeed an admirable work; for, besides the Hebrew words of the Bible, which compose the body of the book, with the Latin version over against them, there are in the margin the differences between the Septuagint version and the Vulgate; so that at one view may be seen wherein the three Bibles agree, and wherein they differ. At the beginning of every article there is a kind of dictionary, which gives the signification of each Hebrew word, affords an opportunity of comparing it with other Oriental languages (Syriac, Arabic, and Chaldee), and is extremely useful for determining more exactly the true meaning of the Hebrew words. It has been several times reprinted; but the originaì edition is the best.
