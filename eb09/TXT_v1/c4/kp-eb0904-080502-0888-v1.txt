CANE, a name applied to many plants which are possessed of long, slender, reed-like stalks or stems, as, for example, the sugar-cane, the bamboo-cane, or the reed-cane. From the use as walking-sticks to which many of these plants have been applied, the name cane is improperly given to sticks irrespective of the source from which they are derived. Properly it should be restricted to a peculiar class of palms, known as ratans, included under the two closely allied genera Calamus and Doemonorops, of which there are a large number of species. The plants are found widely extended throughout the islands of the Indian Archipelago, the Malay Peninsula, China, India, and Ceylon; and examples have also been found in Australia and Africa. They were described by the learned Rumphius, under the name of Palmijunci, as inhabitants of dense forests into which the rays of the sun scarce can penetrate, where they form spiny bushes, obstructing the passage through the jungle. They rise to the top of the highest trees and fall again so as to resemble a great length of cable, adorned, however, with the most beautiful leaves, pinnated or terminating in graceful tendrils. The plants creep or trail along to an enormous length, sometimes, it is said, reaching 500 feet. In the Paris exhibition of 1855 two examples of Calamus verus, measuring respectively 270 and 230 feet, were exhibited. The stem in few casts exceeds 1 inch in diameter, and it is mostly of much smaller dimensions. When growing it is sheathed in a base of numerous leaves, which the natives, in preparing the canes for the market, strip off by pulling the cut plant through a notch made in a tree. The canes always present distinct rings at the junction of the sheathing leaves with the stem. They assume a yellow colour as they dry; and those imported from Calcutta have a glossy surface, while the produce of the Eastern Archipelago presents a dull exterior.

Canes, on account of their lightness, length, strength, and flexibility, are used for a great variety of purposes by the inhabitants of the countries in which they grow. Split into thin strips they are twisted to form ropes and ships’ cables, an application mentioned by Captain Dampier in his Voyages. A more important application, however, is for basket-work, and for making chairs, couches, pillows, <fcc., as the great strength and durability of thin anti easily-prepared strips admit of such articles being made at once airy, strong, and flexible. Much of the beautiful and elaborate basket-work of the Chinese and Japanese is made from thin strips of cane, which are besides used by the Chinese for larger works, such as door-mats, houses, and sheds. The use of cane as a material for constructing bridges in Ceylon is mentioned by Sir James E. Tennent, and Dr J. D. Hooker instances a similar application of the material in his Himalayan Journal.

A very large trade with Western countries and the United States is carried on in canes and ratans, the principal centres of the trade being Batavia, Sarawak, Singapore, Penang, and Calcutta. In addition to the varieties used for walking-sticks, whip and umbrella handles, &c., the common ratans are in extensive demand for basketmaking, the seats and backs of chairs, the ribs of cheap umbrellas, saddles, and other harness-work; and generally for purposes where their strength and flexibility make [9:4:806] them efficient substitutes for whalebone. The walking-stick “canes” of commerce include a great many varieties, some of which, however, are not the produce of trailing palms. The well-known Malacca canes are obtained from Calamus Scipionum, the stems of which are much stouter than is the case with the average species of Calamus.
