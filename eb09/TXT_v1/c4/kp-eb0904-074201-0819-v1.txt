CAMERON, Richard ( ĭ -1680), the founder of the Cameronians, was born at Falkland, in the county of Fife. The date of his birth is not known. His father, who was a shopkeeper in that town, gave him such an education as the village school afforded; and his success was so great that, while still a youth he was appointed schoolmaster. In this situation he had opportunities of becoming acquainted with some of the more enthusiastic fieldpreachers, who at this time wandered through the country disseminating their doctrines. Persuaded by them he resigned his situation, and shortly after entered the family of Sir Walter Scott of Harden as chaplain and tutor. He did not remain there long, however, for, refusing to acknowledge the Indulgence, he joined the ranks of the nonconforming ministers, and incited the inhabitants of the southern counties of Scotland to protest openly against the new edict. So formidable was the agitation that the Government thought fit to interfere, and pronounced illegal all armed assemblages for religious purposes. Cameron was obliged to take refuge in Holland, - where he resided for some time; but in the spring of 1680 he returned to Scotland, and once more made himself formidable and obnoxious to the Government. Shortly after the defeat of the Covenanters at Bothwell Bridge in that year, Cameron was slain in a skirmish at the Aird’s Moss, fighting bravely at the head of the few troops which he had been able to collect, and which formed the nucleus of the renowned regiment in the British army afterwards known by his name.
