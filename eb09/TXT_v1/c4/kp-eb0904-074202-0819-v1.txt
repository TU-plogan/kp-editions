CAMEROONS, or perhaps preferably Camaroons, is the greatest mountain-mass on the western coast of Africa. It is situated at the angle of the Bight of Biafra, directly opposite the island of Fernando Po, with which it has evidently an intimate geological connection. Its European name is said to be derived from the Portuguese Camarãos (shrimps or prawns), and to have been bestowed by the early discoverers on the neighbouring coast from the abundance of its Crustacea. The native designation of the highest peak is Mongo-má-Lobá, or the Mountain of the Sky, and the whole upper region is usually called Mongo-mo-Ndemi, or the Mountain of Greatness. The area of the Cameroons proper is calculated at about 380 square miles; but offshoots and underfalls seem to stretch both north and south for considerable distances. The pile is of distinctly volcanic formation, and the higher district contains numerous craters and lava-beds of comparatively recent date. On the principal summit, whose twin peaks of Mount Albert and Victoria rise to a height of about 13,120 feet above the sea-level, there are one small and two large craters, from which, if native report can be trusted, eruptions have taken place within the memory of man (1838). The lower portions of the mass are occupied by a luxuriant vegetation of palms, acacias, fig-trees, kokos, plantains, and a rich variety of tree and shrub; while at the height of about 7000 feet these give place to ferns, grasses, and heaths. The climate of the middle zone would render it an excellent site for a sanatorium for Europeans debilitated by the malaria of the neighbouring coasts; and the fertility of the soil would soon raise the district to great commercial importance, if it were brought under cultivation. The native tribes which inhabit the mountain sides are comparatively few, and have a very small proportion of the surface in actual possession. To the south of the Cameroons lies the Bay of Ambas (Ambozes, or Amboize), with the two islands of Ndami and Mondori. It forms a well-sheltered harbour, and is capable of receiving the largest vessels. In 1837 the king of Bimbia on the mainland made over a large part of the country round the bay to Colonel Nicolls, and in 1848 he agreed to abolish human sacrifices at the funerals of his great men. In 1858 a settlement was made on the coast at the mouth of a small river, flowing into Morton Cove, now known as the Victoria River. The settlers were Mr Saker, a Baptist missionary, and his converts, who removed from Fernando Po, when the Spanish authorities published an edict forbidding public worship to be celebrated by any but the Roman Catholic clergy. To the south-east of the mountains flows the Cameroons River, where the Baptist mission has had a station since 1850. The most important tribe is the Duallas, whose language has been reduced to writing within recent years. The ascent of the Cameroons Mountains was first attempted by Mr Merrick in 1847; but it was not till 1861 that the summit was actually gained by Captain Richard Burton and Mr Mann, a botanist. See Burton’s Abeokuta and the Camerooηs Mountains, 1863; papers by Mr Mann in the Proceedings of the Linnoean Society ; also Zeitschrift d. Gesellschaft fur Erdk. zu Berlin, 1874, and Petermann’s Mittheil., 186*3.
