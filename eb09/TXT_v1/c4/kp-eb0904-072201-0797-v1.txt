CAMBACÉRÈS, Jean Jacques Regis de (1753-1824), an eminent French statesman under the first republic and the first empire, was born at Montpellier the 18th October 1753, of an old and distinguished family. Being destined for the profession of law, he began his studies in that department at an early age, and was soon recognized as one of the ablest jurists in France. And as his legal learning was one of the main sources of his fame, so it was his chief means of rendering service to his country. Cambacérès was a decided though moderate disciple of the new principles now everywhere diffused in France, and on the assembling of the States-general in 1789 was chosen as a second representative for the nobility of the district of Montpellier. The right of Montpellier to send a second noble deputy was disputed, and Cambacérès did not sit. But he was a member of the National Convention in 1792. Foreseeing the violent courses into which the Convention should be impelled, Cambacérès, from principle as well as necessity, held aloof, and sought to avoid the perils and excesses of the time by confining himself to the neutral province of jurist and legislator. The trial of the king, however, compelled him to declare himself. In the first place, he maintained that the Convention was not competent to try the king; and when the trial had been decided on, he insisted that aÚ latitude of defence ought to be accorded to the royal counsel. As to the sentence, he found the king guilty, and worthy of the punishment due to one who had conspired against his country; but moved for delay in the execution of it, till peace should be restored, or the French soil invaded. This moderation made Cambacérès “suspect” in the eyes of the Mountain, and he confined himself more circumspectly than ever to his proper work of revising and codifying the new laws. On the downfall of Robespierre in 1794, he was a leading man in the restoration of a milder régime. He was sometime president of the Convention, and, subsequently, president of the Committee of Public Safety, in which capacity he helped to the conclusion of peace with Prussia and Spain. Under the Directory he again fell under the suspicion of the extreme party, and was obliged to retire -from the presidency of the Five Hundred, to which he had been called. He took no part in the revolution of the 18th Brumaire (9th November 1799), which overturned the Directory and set up the consulate; but Napoleon had such confidence in him that he made him second consul. This confidence Cambacérès continued to enjoy all through the consulate and the empire. On the establishment of the empire he became arch-chancellor, being life-president of the Senate, and the right-hand man of'Napoleon in the civil administration generally. While loyal to his master, his influence was on the whole beneficial to France. He took an important part in the redaction of the Code Napoléon, tried to dissuade Napoleon from the murder of the Due d’Enghien and from the disastrous campaigns of 1812 and 1813, and only gave in his adhesion to the act of abdication of 1814 when resistance was manifestly hopeless, while he resumed office with reluctance during the Hundred Days.

After the final restoration of Louis XVIII. in 1815, Cambacérès again became an object of persecution, this time as a regicide, and was obliged to retire into Belgium. A royal decree of 1818 restored him to all his civil and political rights, but he did not again emerge from private life. He died in 1824. Cambacérès was a great contrast to most of the leading men in the stormy days of the Revolution. He was moderate in his opinions and in his advocacy of them; he had a clear, penetrating and luminous understanding; and was a great master of sena torial eloquence. He had been created duke of Parma in 1808, and by this name is sometimes known in history.
