CHISWICK, a village of England, on the north bank of the Thames, in Middlesex, 4½ miles from Hyde Park Comer, on a branch of the South-Western Railway. It contains numerous fine villas, the principal of which is Chiswick House, the residence of the duke of Devonshire, where Fox died in 1806, and Canning in 1827. The parish church is ancient, and in the churchyard is the tomb of Hogarth. In the neighbourhood were formerly the gardens of the Horticultural Society, and there are still extensive market-gardens for the supply of the metropolis. The Chiswick Press was founded here in 1811 by Charles Whittingham. The population of the parish and the improvement commissioners district, which are co-extensive, was 6303 in 1851, and in 1871, 8508.
