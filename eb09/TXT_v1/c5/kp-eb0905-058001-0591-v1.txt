CHEMNITZ, a town of the kingdom of Saxony, in the circle of Zwickau, 50 miles W.S.W. of Dresden by rail, in a beautiful plain at the foot of the Erzgebirge, watered by the River Chemnitz, an affluent of the Mulde. It is the first manufacturing town in the country, and in population ranks next to Dresden and Leipsic. Though in general well built and possessing a large number of handsome edifices, it has comparatively few of special interest; among the most important are St James’s church, the ancient townhouse, the post-office, the theatre, the new realschule, and the exchange. It contains a Roman Catholic and five Protestant churches, and has three civic schools, a gymnasium, a royal industrial school, of great repute throughout Saxony, a school of practical designing, and an extensive Sunday school under the direction of the workmen’s union. It is the seat of several large administrative offices, and a chamber of commerce and industry; and among its societies are two scholastic associations, a merchants’ union, a scientific association, and an architectural and artistic society. The cotton goods, and especially the stockings, for which it is mainly celebrated, rival those of England in quality and cheapness; and it is also famous for the manufacture of spinning-machinery. There are nineteen distinct establishments for the weaving of woollen and half-woollen cloth; and 3400 hand-looms are engaged in the same trade. The stocking weaving is prosecuted by sixty-three firms, partly in regular factories and partly by the domestic system. The dye-works number thirty-three, the print-works eight, the bleach-works six, and the chemical works six. There are about eighty establishments for engineering operations, one of which, founded about 1844 by Richard Hartmann, employs 4000 workmen, and manufactures steam-engines of all descriptions, mining and boring apparatus, boilers, and a great variety of implements. The export trade is, of course, very extensive; and in 1871 the value of the goods despatched to America alone amounted to $4,500,000. There is abundant railway communication in all directions. The population in 1849 was 30,753; in 1864, 54,875; and in 1871, 70,380. In the last of these years it was found that, with the exception of about 1800 Roman Catholics, 380 German Catholics, 48 Jews, and a few dissenters, the people were all Protestants.

Chemnitz was originally a settlement of the Sorbian Wends, which received its first Christian Church from Otto I. in 938. In the 12th century it obtained municipal rights from Lothaire IL, and from the 13th to the 17th century it ranked as an imperial city. From its very commencement its prosperity was due mainly to its manufacturing industry, the nucleus of which seems to have been the linen-weaving of the Wends. To this were added extensive bleaching and woollen cloth establishments, which raised the town to great importance in the 15 th century. In 1539 the Reformation was introduced, and 1546 saw the dissolution of the great Benedictine monastery which had been founded in 1125 by Lothaire at Schloss Chemnitz, about 2 miles north of the city. In the Thirty Years’ War the city was plundered by both Swedes and Imperialists, and its trade was almost completely ruined. By the close of the century, however, it began to recover, chiefly through the introduction of cotton-weaving, which as early as 1739 employed 2000 looms. In 1775 the English quilt manufacture was commenced, and in 1799 the Arkwright system of cotton-weaving. After the peace of Paris there was another period of decay; but a revival set in about 1834 when Saxony joined the customs union. The cotton manufacture suffered considerably during the American Civil War, but by no means so severely as in the English towns.
