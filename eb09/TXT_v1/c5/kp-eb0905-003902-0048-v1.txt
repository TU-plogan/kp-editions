CANTON, John (1718-1772). an able natural philosopher, was born at Stroud, Gloucestershire, in 1718. At the age of nineteen, he was articled for five years as clerk to the master of an academy in Spital Square, London, with whom at the end of that time he entered into partnership. In 1746 the science of electricity, which seems early to have engaged Canton’s attention, gained a very important addition by the discovery of the principle of the Leyden jar. This event turned the thoughts of most of the philosophers of Europe to that branch of natural philosophy; and Canton, who was one of the first to repeat and pursue the experiment by which the discovery had been made, found his labour rewarded by manj valuable discoveries. In 1750 he read a paper before the Royal Society on a method of making artificial magnets, which procured him election as a member of the Society, and the award of its gold medal. The same year he was complimented with the degree of Μ. A. by the university of Aberdeen; and in 1751 he was chosen one of the council of the Royal Society. Canton was the first in England to verify Franklin’s hypothesis of the identity of lightning and electricity, having in 1752 succeeded in attracting the electric fire from the clouds during a thunderstorm. In consequence he prepared a paper, which was read the next year before the Royal Society, on Electrical Experiments, with an Attempt to Account for their several Phenomena, in which, among other things, he mentions that he had discovered that some clouds are in a positive and some in a negative state of electricity. About the same time Franklin made a similar discovery in America; and these circumstances gave rise to a lasting friendship between the two philosophers. In 1762 and 1764 he published experiments in refutation of the decision of the Florentine academy, at that time generally accepted, that water is incompressible. These and many other investigations were carried on without any intermission of his work as a schoolmaster, and his too sedentary life brought on dropsy, of which he died on March 22, 1772.
