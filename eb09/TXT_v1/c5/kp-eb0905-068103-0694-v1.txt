CHOISEUL, Claude Antoine Gabriel, Due de (1760-1838), was born in August 1760. He was brought up at Chanteloup, under the care of his relative, the Duke Étienne François, who was childless. The outbreak of the Revolution found him a colonel of dragoons, and throughout those troublous times he was distinguished for his devotion to the royal house. He made a memorable attempt to rescue Louis XVI. from the hands of the Revolutionists; but the affair was ill-managed; the royal party was recaptured; a price was put upon ChoiseuΓs head, and he had to seek refuge in flight. His hopes, however, of assisting the royal cause were not relinquished, and he succeeded in raising a regiment of hussars with which he joined the royalist army. He was eventually taken prisoner, and confined at Dunkirk. Having escaped, and set sail for India, he was wrecked on the French coast, and condemned to death by the decree of the Directory. Nevertheless, he was fortunate enough to escape with his life. Napoleon allowed him to return to France; and at the Restoration he was called to the House of Peers by Louis XVIII. At the revolution of 1830 he was nominated a member of the Provisional Government; and he afterwards received from Louis Philippe the post of aide-de-camp to the king and governor of the Louvre. He died in Paris in 1838.
