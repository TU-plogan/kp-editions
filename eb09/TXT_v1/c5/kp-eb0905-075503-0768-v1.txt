CHRYSIPPUS (c. 280-206 b.c.), one of the greatest of the Stoics, was born probably in 280 B.C., at Soli, in Cilicia. Being robbed of his property, he visited Athens, and attended the lectures, possibly of Zeno, and certainly of Cleanthes. The latter he succeeded as recognized chief of the school. He is also said to have been instructed in the doctrines of the Middle Academy by Arcesilaus and Lacydes. Chrysippus was the author of a prodigious number of works, which, though extremely prolix and disfigured by great obscurity and carelessness of style and language, were distinguished by extensive learning and considerable acuteness. But nothing has come down to us except small fragments, and from these it is difficult to discover what doctrines are originally due to Chrysippus. We know, however, that he made considerable emendations on the theory of Zeno and Cleanthes. With regard to the relation of moral to physical science, he reversed their conclusion, adopting the view, which from that time became characteristic of Stoicism, that, as the sole aim of philosophy is to discover man’s duty, ethics is the only science that is of real importance in itself, while physics is to be regarded merely as an aid to its study. He improved on the crude theory of perception which had been held by his predecessors, who compared the action of the object on the mind to that of the seal on the wax, arguing that this would do away with the possibility of the simultaneous perception of more than one object, and denying that the mental modification resembles the object. He also finally determined the Stoical theory of the criterion of truth, which, according to him, is irresistible conviction. Much attention was paid by Chrysippus to formal logic. He held that the hypothetical syllogism is the original type of syllogistic inference, and he devoted the most elaborate study to its various forms. He drew up a scheme of the categories,—making the highest Substance (to vττoκelμevov)', the next, Form, or essential attribute; the third, Variety, or that non-essential attribute which is at the same time independent of all but the object itself; the fourth, Variety of Relation, or that non-essential attribute which depends on the relation of the object to some other object. Chrysippus also gave some attention to linguistic, and especially to grammatical investigations.

The explanation of the universe adopted by Chrysippus is that of the rest of his school. The real is the corporeal; man and the world are all that exists. In each there is that which is inert, and also the informing soul or vivifying fire. The soul of the universe is God, or Destiny. Each human soul is part of the universal soul, in which, according to the view originated by Chrysippus, the souls of all, except the wise, are again swallowed up at death. The universe is perfect. So-called physical evil is none. Moral evil is the necessary complement of good, and is turned by Providence into good. AH is the result of perfect law. Yet Chrysippus employed all his subtilty to establish the freedom of the will. A nother inconsistency was his reliance on divination, which he strove to explain on a theory of natural causation. The stories of the gods Chrysippus regarded as symbolical myths; and of many of them he attempted ingenious explanations.

In morals Chrysippus somewhat modified the extreme theory of the earlier Stoics. He admitted between the good and the bad a third class of things—the indifferent, and even avowed that it is foolish not to desire health, and riches, and honour. In practice a man of unsullied purity, he felt bound to conclude, from the theory that the lower animals live according to nature, that incest and many other crimes, and acts so repulsive as the devouring of the bodies of the dead, are natural, and therefore not to be blamed.
