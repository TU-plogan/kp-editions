CINQUE PORTS. The Cinque Ports, or Five Ports, is the name of an ancient jurisdiction in the south of England, which is still maintained with considerable modifications and diminished authority. As the name implies, the original members of the body were only five in number —Hastings, Romney, Hythe, Dover, and Sandwich; but to these were afterwards added the “Ancient Towns” of Winchelsea and Rye with the same privileges, and a good many other places, both corporate and non-corporate, which, with the title of Limb or Member,held a subordinate position. To Hastings were attached the corporate members of Pevensey and Seaford, and the non-corporate members of Bulverheeth, Petit Iham, Hidney, Beaksbourne, and Grange; to Romney, Lydd, and Old Romney, Dengemarsh, and Oswardstone; to Dover, Folkstone and Feversham, and. Margate, St John’s, Goresend, Burchington Wood, St Peter’s, Kingsdowne, and Ringwold; to Sandwich, Fordwich, and Deale, Walmer, Ramsgate, Stoner, Sarr, and Brightlingsea. The jurisdiction thus extends along the coast from Seaford in Sussex to Burghington near Margate in Kent; and it also includes a number of inland districts, at a considerable distance from the ports with which they are connected. The non-incorporated members are within the municipal jurisdiction of the ports to which they are attached; but the corporate members are as free within their own liberties as the individual ports themselves. The incorporation of the Cinque Ports had its origin in the necessity for some means of defence along the southern seaboard of England, and in the lack of any regular navy. Up to the reign of Henry VII. they had to furnish the Crown with nearly all the ships and men that were needful for the state; and for a long time after they were required to give large assistance to the permanent fleet. The oldest charter now on record is one belonging to the 6th year of Edward I.; and it refers to previous documents of the time of Edward the Confessor and William the Conqueror. In return for their services the ports enjoyed extensive privileges. From the Conquest or even earlier they had, besides various lesser rights,—(1) Exemption from tax and tallage; (2) Soc and sac, or full cognizance of all criminal and civil cases within their liberties; (3) Toll and theam, [9:5:787] or the right of receiving toll and of holding serfs; (4) Bloodwith and fledwith, or the right to punish shedders of blood and those who were seized in an attempt to escape from justice; (5) Pillory and tumbreìl; (6) Ingfangtheof and outfangtheof, or power to imprison and execute felons; (7) Mundbriech, or authority to erect banks or dykes on any man’s land as a defence against the sea; (8) Waives and strays, or the right to appropriate lost property or cattle not claimed within a year and a day; (9) The right to seize all flotsom, jetsom, or witsom, or in other words, whatever of value was cast ashore by the sea; (10) The privilege of being a guild with power to impose taxes for the common weal; and (11) The right of assembling in portmote or parliament at Shepway or Shepway Cross, a few miles west of Hythe—the parliament being empowered to make bye-laws for the Cinque Ports, to regulate the Yarmouth fishery, to hear appeals from the local courts, and to give decision in all cases of treason, sedition, illegal coining, or concealment of treasure trove. The ordinary business of the ports is conducted in two courts known respectively as the Court of Brotherhood and the Court of Brotherhood and Guestli'ng,—the former being composed of the mayors of the seven principal towns and a number of jurats and freemen from each, and the latter including in addition the mayors, bailiffs, and other representatives of the corporate members. The Court of Brotherhood was formerly called the Brotheryeeld, Brodall, or Brodhull; and the name Guestling seems to owe its origin to the fact that the officials of the “members” were at first in the position of invited guests. The highest office in connection with the Cinque Ports is that of the Lord Warden, who also acts as governor of Dover Castle, and has a maritime jurisdiction as admiral of the ports. His power was formerly of great extent, and he held a court of chancery at Dover in the old parish church of St James. He still presides in the court of Shepway, and appoints the justices of peace for the liberties of the Cinque Ports.
