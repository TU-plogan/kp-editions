CAPITULATION (the Pactum deditionis of Grotius) is an agreement in time of war for the surrender to a hostile armed force of a particular body of troops, a town, or a territory. It is an ordinary incident of war, and therefore no previous instructions from the captor’s Government are required before finally settling the conditions of capitulation. The most usual of such conditions are freedom of religion, and security of private property on the one hand, and a promise not to bear arms within a certain period on the other. Such agreements may be rashly concluded with an inferior officer, on whose authority the enemy are not in the actual position of the war entitled to place reliance. The Roman consuls sometimes introduced the condition— “Ita ratum sit, si populus Romanus censuisset. ” Saturninus surrendered the Capitol on the promise of Marius; but Cicero asks (pro C. Rab., c. x.), “Fides qui potuit sine senatusconsulto dari 1” Caesar evidently thought that responsibility in such matters should rest in the commander-in-chief: “Alter agere ad praescriptum,alter libere ad summam rerum consulere debet” (de B. C., iii. 51). In modem times the question has been raised whether a capitulation can ever amount to a conveyance of the sovereignty, or a perpetual cession of political allegiance. Such matters are fixed by the terms of peace; but before then questions may rise as to rights in the property passed by capitulation. Although private ransoms are theoretically allowed by English admiralty law in cases of necessity, the Prize Act (27 and 28 Vict. c. 25, § 45) confers a right only to ships and goods afloat. Hence part of the consideration of a capitulation may be condemned to the Crown. Again, as in the case of Thorshaven and its dependencies (Island of Stromoe), which capitulated to Captain Baugh in 1808, public property passed by the capitulation, if not taken possession of by the private enemy, may afterwards be seized by privateers and forfeited to the Crown. In two great capitulations of modern history, Great Britain has made a not very creditable appearance. That of Closter Seven, between the duke of Cumberland and Marshal Richelieu for a suspension of arms in N. Germany, King George, as elector of Hanover, refused to ratify, and ordered the Hanoverian troops, which ought to have been disbanded, to resume service as British troops. In the capitulation of El Arish (1800), which related to the evacuation of Egypt by the French, the British Government, so long as it seemed more advantageous to fight, pleaded a defect in the authority of Sir Sidney Smith; but when Kleber’s brilliant movement to Heliopolis had changed matters, they clamoured for the faithful execution of the agreement. The most important case on the subject of capitulation is, however, that of the merchants of Genoa, particulars of which may be got in Hansard, vol. xxx., and 4 Robinson, 388.

Capitulation is also the name given to an arrangement by which a body of foreigners enjoy certain privileges within the state making the capitulation ; e.g., the Swiss Guards at the Tuileries, or the consular jurisdictions in the Levant. It is also applied by French writers to the oath which on his election the emperor of the Romans used to make to the college of electors; this related chiefly to such matters as regalian rights, appeals from local jurisdictions, the rights of the Pope, &c.
