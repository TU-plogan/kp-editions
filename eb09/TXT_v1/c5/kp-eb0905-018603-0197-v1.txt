CASTANOS, Don Francisco Xavier de (c. 1756- 1852), duke of Baylen, a Spanish general, who served in the Peninsular War, was born at Madrid. The exact year of his birth is not known, but it was probably about 1756. He was the son of a military officer; at the age of twelve he had received a commission as captain; and, while still very young, he was sent to study the art of war at the court of Frederick the Great. His first success was at Baylen, where, on the 22d of July 1808, 18,000 French under Dupont surrendered to him. It is, however, said that the chief credit in this engagement is due to the Swiss, Aloys Reding. In November of the same year, Castanos was defeated at Tudela; and during the rest of the war he occupied subordinate positions. He, however, distinguished himself at Vitoria, and was placed at the head of the army which was sent to assist the Allies in 1815; and till his death, which took place on the 24th September 1852, he held a high political position, being senator and guardian to Queen Isabella.
