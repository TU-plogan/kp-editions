CLARK, Sir James (1788-1870), an English physician, was born at Cullen, in Banffshire. He was educated at the grammar-school of Fordyce, and at the universities of Aberdeen and Edinburgh, at the former of which he took the degree of Μ. A., at the latter that of M.D. He served for six years as a surgeon in the navy; he then spent some time in travelling on the Continent, in order to investigate the effects of the mineral waters and the climate of various places commonly recommended to invalids; and for eight years he was settled at Rome. In 1824 he was chosen physician to Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg, and two years after he commenced to practise in London as physician to the St George’s Parochial Infirmary. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1832; in 1835 he was appointed physician to the Duchess of Kent and the Princess Victoria, and on the accession of the latter to the throne he became physician in ordinary to the Queen. On the foundation of the university of London, he was made a member of its senate; and he belonged to many medical societies both at home and abroad. In 1838 he was created baronet. Sir James Clark made a special study of sanatory science, and he was also regarded as an authority on diseases of the lungs. He published— Medical Notes ; The Sanative Influence of Climate, containing valuable meteorological tables; A Treatise on Pulmonary Consumption and Scrofulous Disease ; and Clinical Instruction.
