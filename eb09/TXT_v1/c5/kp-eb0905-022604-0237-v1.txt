CATHCART, Sir George (1794-1854), British general, was born in London, May 12, 1794. He was the third son of the first Earl Cathcart, a distinguished general and diplomatist, commander-in-chief of the expedition to Copenhagen in 1807, and afterwards ambassador to Stockholm and St Petersburg. He received his early education at Eton College, and passed thence to the university of Edinburgh. In 1810 he entered the army, and two years later accompanied his father as aide-de-camp to Russia. With him he joined the Russian headquarters in March 1813; and he was present at all the great battles of the campaigns of that year in Germany, and of the following year in France, and also at the taking of Paris. The fruits of his careful observation and critical study of these operations appeared in the Commentaries which he published in 1850, a volume of plain soldier-like history, prepared from notes made during the campaigns. After the peace of 1814 he accompanied his father to the Congress of Vienna; and while in that city he was appointed (March 1815) extra aide-de-camp to the duke of Wellington. He was present at Quatre-Bras and at Waterloo, was named full aide-de-camp to the duke, and remained in his staff till the army of occupation quitted France. Reappointed almost immediately, he accompanied the duke to the Congresses of Aix-la-Chapelle and Verona, and in 1826 to Prussia. Promoted lieutenant-colonel in 1828, he served in Nova Scotia, Bermuda, and Jamaica,—retiring on halfpay in 1834. After three years he was recalled to active service, and was sent as commander of the King’s Dragoon Guards to Canada, where he played an important part in suppressing the rebellion and pacifying the country. In 1844 he returned to England and again retired. Two years later he was appointed deputy-lieutenant of the Tower, and this post he held till 1852. In that year he was offered the governorship and command at the Cape. This he accepted, and had the merit of bringing to a close the Kaffre War. In December 1853 he was appointed adjutant-general of the army. In 1854 he was sent to take part as lieutenant-general in the Crimean War, and the highest hopes were fixed on him as a scientific and practically experienced soldier. But these hopes were not to be fulfilled; for he fell at the battle of Inkermann, November 5, 1854. His remains, with those of other officers, were buried on Cathcart’s Hill, Lord Raglan, the commander-in-chief, attending the ceremony. Sir George Cathcart married in 1824 Lady Georgiana Greville, who survived him, and by whom he had a family of one son and seven daughters. At the time of his death he was a Knight Commander of the Bath.
