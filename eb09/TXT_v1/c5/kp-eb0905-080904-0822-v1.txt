CLARK, Thomas (1801-1867), a distinguished chemist, was born at Ayr, on the 31st March 1801. His father was captain of a merchant vessel, and his mother began the Ayrshire needlework. He was educated at the Ayr Academy, a school of great efficiency and repute. In 1816 he entered the counting-house of Charles Macintosh <fc Co., the inventors of the waterproof cloth, but soon obtained the more congenial situation of chemist in Tennant’s chemical works at St Rollox. In 1826 he was appointed lecturer on chemistry to the Glasgow mechanics’ institution, where he propounded advanced views on the atomic theory and the theory of salts. The same year he published his first papers, containing his discovery of the pyrophospate of soda, which was a turning-point in chemical history. Becoming a medical student in the university of Glasgow, he took the degree of M.D. in 1831. He was for several years apothecary to the Glasgow infirmary, and published several important papers on pharmacy. In 1832 he published in the Westminster Review an elaborate inquiry into the existing system of weights and measures. In 1833 he obtained by competition the chair of chemistry in Marischal College, Aberdeen. About the same time he matured two important practical researches relating to the construction of hydrometers and the means of detecting arsenic. In 1835 he published a paper on the “Application of the Hot-Blast,” explaining the principle of its efficacy. In 1836 appeared his letter to Mitscherlich on the Oxygen Salts. Clark’s name became most generally known in connection with his water tests and his process for softening hard (chalk) waters. These came out in 1841. The tests have been in use ever since; and the softening process intended for the London waters, but not as yet adopted by any of the London companies, has been very successfully carried out in several places. In 1844 his health gave way under mental strain, and he ceased to be able to lecture to his class. Being removed also from his laboratory, he did little more chemical work, except directing his assistant in perfecting his water tests. His active mind, however, could not rest, and he took up several inquiries, the last of all, which occupied what strength he had for nearly twenty years before his death, beingthe historical origin of the Gospels. Proceeding from one stage to another, he finally concentrated his energies on an attempt to settle the true readings of the Greek text of the three first Gospels. His mode of proceeding displayed the peculiar sagacity and tact shown in his scientific inventions, and his results had reached a form admitting of publication at the time of his death. The work would have been very valuable in connection with the revision of the Bible, and it is to be regretted that his surviving relatives didnot seefit topublishit. Clark took a leading part in all the discussions relating to the improvement of the university of Aberdeen. He was an admirable lecturer, but unfortunately his teaching career was short. He died at Glasgow on the 27th November 1867.
