+=====================================================================+


CARY, Sir Lucius, second Viscount Falkland, was born at Burford, co. Oxon, in 1610 or 1611, and educated at Trinity College, Dublin, his father being at that time lorddeputy of Ireland. On leaving the university he served for a short time in the Low Countries, but failing to attain promotion returned to England, and found a refuge from domestic troubles in the study of ancient literature and the society of the most eminent men of learning. Among his intimate associates were Jonson, Suckling, and Cowley; and at his country seat, Great Tew in Oxfordshire, he subsequently gathered around him a small group of theologians whose liberal opinions were not without influence in the religious rivalries of the day. In 1633 he succeeded to his father’s title, and was appointed gentleman of the privy chamber to Charles I. In 1640 he entered the House of Commons as member for Newport, Isle of Wight, and quickly assumed there a prominent part upon the side of the king, while at the same time he supported Pym in his schemes of moderate reform in church and state, and himself introduced the Bill for the exclusion of bishops from the House of Peers. But having been chosen by Charles to be one of his secretaries of state, [9:5:171] Falkland found himself irretrievably committed to a cause which he could not wholly approve, and to the service of a king whom in his heart he distrusted, though his chivalry forbad him to abandon his cause. On the eve of the Civil War he joined his royal master at York, and having raised a troop of horse, did good service at Edgehill, Oxford, and the siege of Gloucester. In the indecisive battle of Newbury (20th September 1643) he fell fighting in the front rank of Lord Byron’s regiment, with the words “Peace, Peace” upon his lips. Had his life been spared it is possible that he might at least have succeeded in mitigating the rancour of the contending parties. His poems and political writings, published after his death, do not increase a reputation which is based rather upon single-mindedness and patriotic self-devotion than upon his contributions to literature.
