CATHERINE of Braganza (1638—1705), queen of Charles II. of England, was born at Villa Viçosa in Portugal, 25th November 1638. Her father, John, duke of Braganza, who was rightful heir to the crown of Portugal, then under Spanish sway, headed the revolt of 1640, which after many years’ fighting succeeded, and became king of Portugal. Her mother was a woman of great ability, and governed Portugal after the death of her husband. She was penetrating enough to foresee the Restoration in England, and, some years before, proposed the marriage of Charles with her daughter Catherine, in order to secure an ally in the prolonged struggle against Spain. After the Restoration the marriage was agreed upon, not without much diplomatic manoeuvring, especially on the side of Spain, which was naturally averse to it. The marriage treaty was very advantageous to England, as the Portuguese promised a dowry in money of £500,000, the towns of Tangier and Bombay (the first English possession in the East), and many privileges of trade with their colonial dependencies. On his marriage at Plymouth, 13th May 1663, Charles expressed himself highly pleased with his Portuguese bride. But the union did not prove a happy one. Catherine had been brought up in a convent, and therefore had not the tact and the manners suited to one of the most fashionable and profligate courts of Europe. But the principal fault lay in the heartless and inconstant nature of Charles. He insisted on bringing to court his abandoned mistress, Lady Castlemaine, and, when the queen expressed her indignation at the insult, made Clarendon himself lecture her on the duty of submission. Gradually Charles’s neglect of her grew into a feeling of settled alienation, and after repeated humiliations her spirit was broken. Being a Roman Catholic, too, she was an object of suspicion and calumny during the Popery panics. Perhaps the only satisfaction she enjoyed from her connection with England was the decisive aid rendered by the country to her native land in its struggle against Spain. After a life of great retirement during the reign of James IL and the early part of that of William, she returned to Portugal in 1692. Some little time before her death (at the close of 1705), she acted with great ability in the capacity of regent to her brother, Don Pedro. She had no children.
