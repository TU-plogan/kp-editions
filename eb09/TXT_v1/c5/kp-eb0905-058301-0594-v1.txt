CHEPSTOW, a market-town and river-port of England, in the county of Monmouth, on the Wye, 2 miles from its junction with the Severn, and 135 miles from London. It occupies the slope of a hill on the western bank of the river, and is environed by scenery of much beauty and grandeur. The town is generally well built, and the streets are broad and clean. The church, originally the conventual chapel of a Benedictine priory of Norman erection, was restored to its former dimensions by the rebuilding of the chancel and transepts in the beginning of the present century. The western entrance and some other parts are richly decorated, and the interior contains many interesting monuments. The castle, founded in the 11th century by W. Fitz-Osborn, earl of Hereford, and almost wholly rebuilt in the 13th, is still a magnificent pile. It stands on the summit of a cliff which is washed by the Wye, and occupies about 3 acres of ground. The river is crossed by a fine iron bridge of five arches, erected in 1816, which has a total length of 532 feet and a span in the middle of 112 feet. There is free passage for large vessels as far as the bridge; but barges of from 18 to 30 tons can ascend as far as Hereford. From the narrowness and depth of the channel the tide rises suddenly, and to a great height, frequently above 50, and it is said even-to 70 feet, forming a dangerous bore. There are no manufactures, but the trade is considerable. The exports are timber, bark, iron, coal, cider, and millstones. Population in 1851, 4295, and in 1871, 3347.
