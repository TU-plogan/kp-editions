CHRYSOLORAS, Manuel (c. 1355-1415), a learned Greek who was instrumental in spreading Greek literature in the West, was bornât Constantinople, about 1355, of a distinguished family, which had removed with Constantine to Byzantium. While still very young, he was sent by the emperor John Palaeologus to implore the aid of the Christian princes against the Turks. After several years he returned to Constantinople; but at the invitation of the magistrates of Florence, about the year 1395, he became professor of the Greek language in that city, where he taught three years. Having visited Milan and Pavia, and resided for several years at Venice, he went to Rome upon the invitation of Aretmo, who had been his disciple, and was then secretary to Gregory XII. In 1408 he was sent to Paris on an important mission from Manuel Palaeologus, the Greek emperor. In 1413 he was appointed by Pope Martin V. on an embassy to the Emperor Sigismund, of which the object was to fix a place for the assembling of a general council. It was decided that the meeting should take place at Constance; and Chrysoloras was on his way thither, having been chosen to represent the Greek church, when he died suddenly on the. lõth of .April 1415. Only two of his works have been printed, viz., his Erotemaia, which was for some time the only grammar in use in the West, and Epistolae III. de comparatione veteris et novoe Romoe ; but many others exist in MS.
