CHAMBÁ, a feudatory state of Northern India, subordinate to the Punjab Government, situated between 32° 10' and 33 n 9' N. lat., and between 75° 54' and 76° 30' E. long. Chámbá is bounded on the N. by a range of mountains, separating it from the province of Zaskár in Kashmir; on the E. by the outlying British parganás of Bangáhal and Lahaul, belonging to Kángra district; on the S. by mountain ranges which separate it from the Kángra valley; and on the W. by the provinces of Jammu and Kistwar in Kashmir. In shape the state is an oblong, its eastern and western sides being about 65 miles in length, and its mean width about 50 miles. It is traversed from east to west by a lofty range which divides it into two distinct valleys. The northern of these valleys is drained by the Chináb, which, rising in Lahaul, passes through Chámbá into Kashmir territory, having a general direction from south-east to north-west. The southern valley is drained by the Ráví, of which one head is in Chámbá territory, and the other in BangáhaL The two branches unite a short distance below Barmur in Chámbá. The river then flows eastwards till close to Dalhousie it turns southwards, and after forming the boundary of the state for some distance, enters the plains of the Punjab. The estimated population of the state is 140,000 souls, and the estimated gross revenue, £18,937. The annual tribute payable to the British Government is £500. Owing to the abdication of the late rájá and the succession of his son, a lad of seven years of age, the administration of the state passed under the direct control of the British Government in 1872-73, an arrangement which will continue during the minority of the young chief. The only towns in the state are Chámbá and Barmur situated on the Ráví, and Kilár on the Chináb. The British sanitarium of Dalhousie is within the limits of the state, situated upon ground purchased from the chiefs. The principal agricultural products are wheat and millet; among the other products are timber, wax, nuts, honey, lime, and slate from quarries near Dalhousie. The extensive forests are leased by the British Government, and are under the management of the Punjab Forest Department.
