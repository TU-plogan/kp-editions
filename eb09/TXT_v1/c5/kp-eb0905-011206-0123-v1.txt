CARLSRUHE, or Karlsruhe (Charles’s Rest), a city of Western Germany, capital of the grand duchy of Baden.

It stands on an elevated plain of the Hardwald (which nearly surrounds it), 380 feet above the level of the sea, 5 miles from the Rhine, and 39 miles W.N.W. of Stuttgart. The Frankfort and Basel Railway passes the city. Carlsruhe takes its name from Charles William, margrave of Baden, who, owing to disputes which he had with the citizens of Durlach, erected in 1715 a hunting-seat, around which the town has since been built. From the palace the principal streets, seventeen in number, radiate in the form of an expanded fan, in a S.E., S., and S.W. direction. The palace, erected in 1751 on the site of the previous erection of 1715, is a plain building in the old French style, composed òf a centre and two wings, presenting nothing remarkable except the octagon tower {Bleithurm), [9:5:113] from the summit of which a splendid view of the city and surrounding country is obtained, and the marble saloon, in which the meridian of Cassini was fixed or drawn. In front of the palace is the Great Circle, a semi-circular hue of buildings, containing the Government offices and the palace of the margraves of Baden. Carlsruhe has several fine public squares, the principal of which are the Castleplace—with Schwanthaler , s statue of the late grand duke Charles Frederick in the centre—and the market-place. In the centre of the latter is a pyramid in honour of Charles William, the founder of the city, whose remains are interred there. Among the public buildings are the council house, the palace of the margrave of Baden, hall of representatives, mint, post-office, barracks, arsenal, theatre, hall of fine arts, museum, the famed polytechnic school (with 800 students), cannon foundry, a synagogue, and several Protestant and Catholic churches. There are also several hospitals, a deaf-mute asylum, botanic gardens, and lyceum; military, medical, and veterinary schools, academies of architecture, painting, and music, and numerous literary and scientific associations. The town is adorned with several public fountains, and is supplied with water by an aqueduct from Durlach. Carlsruhe carries on a considerable trade, and has engineering, carriage, chemical, silk, cotton, carpet, woollen, jewellery, tobacco, and snuff manufactories. The town is surrounded by beautiful parks and gardens. Population (1875), 43,000. Lat. 49° Γ N., long. 8° 25' E.
