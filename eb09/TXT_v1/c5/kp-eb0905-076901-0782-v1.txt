CHUTTERPUR, a city of British India, in the province of Bundelcund, 180 miles S.E. of Agra, and 140 S.W. of Allahabad. It was established by the Rajah Chutter Sal, the founder of the short-lived independence of Bundelcund, and the resolute opponent of the Mogul empire in the 17th century. Situated but a short distance from the diamond mines of Pannah, and forming an important entrepôt in the trade between the Deccan and Benares, it soon grew into a very flourishing city. It is still a thriving place, but it maintains its prosperity less by its transit trade than by its manufactures, of which the most important are paper and coarse cutlery. It is irregularly built, and contains but few buildings of individual interest. The palace ⅛ a modern structure of hybrid character, combining the features of an Italian villa with those of a Rajput castle. There was formerly a political agent of the British Government in the city, but he has been transferred to Nowgong. The territory of which the town is the capital contains an area of 1240 square miles, with a population of from 200,000 to 300,000. The revenue is stated at not more than twenty lacs of rupees per annum. As the Rajah Per-taub Singh had no male issue, the territory on his decease would have lapsed to the paramount power; but in acknowledgment of his fidelity and the beneficial results of his administration, the British Government recognized a successor in the person of his grand-nephew Juggut Singh.
