CHEMNITZ, Martin (1522-1586), probably the ablest Lutheran theologian of the period immediately succeeding that of Luther himself, was born at Treuenbritzen in the mark of Brandenburg, on the 9th November 1522. His father, though of noble rank, was in somewhat straitened circumstances, and Martin’s education was frequently interrupted owing to pecuniary difficulties. In his fourteenth year he was sent to school at Wittenberg, where he had frequent opportunities of hearing Luther preach. He studied at the universities of Magdeburg (1539-42), Frankfort-on-the-Oder (1543), and Wittenberg (1545), devoting himself specially at the last of these, under the advice of Melanchthon, to mathematics and astrology. In 1547 he removed to Königsberg, where hé was appointed in the following year rector of the cathedral school, and two years later (1550) librarian to Duke Albert of Prussia, whose patronage he had gained through his acquaintance with astrology. It was during his residence in Königsberg that Chemnitz first turned his attention seriously to theology, and that he first had an opportunity, in the celebrated controversy with Osiander on the doctrine of justification by faith, of displaying the polemical ability in which he was scarcely surpassed by the greatest of the Reformers. Osiander, who assailed the forensic and objective element in the Lutheran doctrine, was favoured by Duke Albert, and, as the controversy increased in intensity, Chemnitz judged it expedient to resign his post of librarian and leave Königsberg. In 1553 he returned to Wittenberg, and immediately commenced to deliver lectures at the university on the Loci Communes of Melanchthon. These formed the basis of his Loci Theologici (Frankfort, 1591), a work which furnishes one of the best existing expositions of the Lutheran theology, as formulated and modified by Melanchthon. His audience was from the first exceptionally large, and a career of great influence seemed open to him at the university, when he was induced to make another change by accepting the office of pastor to the church in Brunswick, to which he removed in J 554. In this position he spent the remainder of his life, though he received numerous offers of important offices from various Protestant princes of Germany. He was unusually active in the duties of his charge, and he also took a leading part in the theological controversies of the time, always representing and defending strictly Lutheran views. In fact, it is in no small degree to his personal influence, exerted as it was at the critical period of its history, that the Lutheran Church owed the purity of its doctrine and the compactness of its organization. Against the Crypto-Calvinists he maintained the Lutheran doctrine of the Lord’s Supper in a treatise Repetitio sanoe doctrinae de υera Praesentia Corporis et Sanguinis Domini in C<xna Sacra (1560, translated into German 1561). Against the Jesuits, on the other hand, he wrote some works of great power, which probably did a good deal to. check the reaction from Lutheranism that seemed to be setting in. Chief of these were the Theologies Jesuitarum praecipua Capita (1562), a very incisive attack on the principles of the order, and his Examen Concilii Tridentini, in four parts, published at intervals (1565, 1566, 1572, and 1573). The latter is undoubtedly Chemnitz’s greatest work. Roman Catholics themselves have not been slow to acknowledge its ability, and it may be questioned whether to this day anti-Tridentine literature can show anything more thorough or more acute. In conjunction with Mörlin, Chemnitz compiled the Corpus Doctrinoe Prutenicum (1567), a doctrinal work, which at once acquired great authority. Perhaps his chief service to the organization of the church was rendered when, in conjunction with Andrea and Selnecker, he induced the Lutherans of Saxony and Swabia to adopt the Formula Concordiae, and so become one body. In the protracted negotiations which led to this result his learning and tact were of the greatest value.

Chemnitz resigned office owing to infirm health in 1584, and died at Brunswick on the 8th April 1586. A very full account of his life by Schenkel is given in Herzog’s Real-Encylclopoedie.
