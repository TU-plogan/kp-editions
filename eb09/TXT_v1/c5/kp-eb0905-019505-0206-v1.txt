CASTIGLIONE, Carlo Ottavio, Count (1784-1849), an Italian philologist of considerable reputation, was born at Milan of an ancient family. His principal work was done in connection with the Arabic and other Oriental languages; but he also performed good service in several other departments. In 1819 he published Monete Cufichx del Museo di Milano, and assisted Cardinal Mai in his Ulphiloe partium ineditarum in Ambrosianis palimpsestis repertarum editio. A learned Mémoire géographique et numismatique sur la partie orientale de la Barbarie appelée Afrikia par les Arabes appeared in 1826, and established his reputation. In 1829 he published by himself the Gothic version of the second epistle of Paul to the Corinthians; and this was followed by the Gothic version of the epistle to the Romans, the~first epistle to the Corinthians, and the epistle to the Ephesians in 1834; by Galatians, Philippians, and 1 Thessalonians in 1835, and by 2 Thessalonians in 1839. His life was written by Biondelli, and appeared at Milan in 1856.
