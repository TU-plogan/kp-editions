CARMONA, a town of Spain in the province of Seville, situated about 15 miles east of the city of that name, on a gentle elevation that overlooks an extensive plain. Its castle, now in ruins, was formerly the principal fortress of Peter the Cruel, and contained a spacious palace within its defences. The principal entrance to the town is an old Moorish gateway; and the gate on the road to Cordova is partly of Roman construction. Part of the ancient college of San Teodomir is of Moorish architecture, and the tower of the church of San Pedro is an imitation of the Giralda at Seville. The principal trade is in oil, corn, and cattle. Carmona, the Roman Carmo, was the strongest city in Further Spain in the time of Julius Caesar; and its strength was greatly increased by the Moors, who surrounded it with a wall and ornamented it with fountains and palaces. In 1247 Ferdinand III. of Castile took the city, and bestowed on it the motto— Sicut Ludfer lucet in Aurora, sic in Wandalia Carmona. The Carmona fair, which is held in April, affords an almost unequalled opportunity of observing the genuine costumes and customs of southern Spain. Population, 20,704.
