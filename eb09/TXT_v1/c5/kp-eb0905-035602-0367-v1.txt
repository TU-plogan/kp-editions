CESARI, Giuseppe, called II Cavaliere d’Arpino (being born in or about 1568 at Arpino, and created a “Cavaliere di Cristo” by Pope Clement VIII. ), also named Il Giuseppino, an Italian painter, much encouraged at Rome and munificently rewarded. Cesari is stigmatized by Lanzi as not less the corrupter of taste in painting than Marino was in poetry; indeed, another of the nicknames of Cesari is “Il Marino de’ Pittori” (the pictorial Marino). There was spirit in Cesari’s heads of men and horses, and his frescoes in the Capitol (story of Romulus and Remus, &c.), which occupied him at intervals during forty years, are well coloured.; but he drew the human form ill. His perspective is faulty, his extremities monotonous, and his chiaroscuro defective. He diedin 1640,at the age of seventy-two, or perhaps of eighty, at Rome. Cesari ranks as the head of the “Idealists” of his period, as opposed to the “Naturalists,” of whom Michaelangelo’da Caravagio was the leading champion,—the so-called “idealism” consisting more in reckless facility, and disregard of the common facts and common-sense of nature, than in anything to which so lofty a name could be properly accorded. He was a man of touchy and irascible character, and rose from penury to the height of opulence.
