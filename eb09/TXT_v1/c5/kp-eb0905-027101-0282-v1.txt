CAVE, Edward (1691—1754), an English printer, was born at Newton in Warwickshire, in 1691. He was placed by his father, who was a shoemaker at Rugby, at the famous school of that town, but being accused of robbing the hen-roost, he was forced to leave. He became clerk to a collector of the excise; but the drudgery and insolence to which he was subjected by his master’s wife caused him to try his fortunes in London, and after having been engaged for some time by a timber-merchant, he was finally bound apprentice in the printing-office of Mr Collins. In two years he attained so much skill in his art, that he was sent to conduct a printing-house at Norwich, and publish a weekly paper. In this undertaking he met with some opposition, which produced a public controversy, and procured young Cave the reputation of a writer. The only work of any size, however, which he left was An Account of the Criminals. He held for a short time the office of clerk of the franks, but his rigour in checking abuses soon caused his dismissal. He now embarked the capital which he had acquired in the publication of the Gentleman’s Magazine, a periodical which procured a fortune for the projector, and survived almost all its competitors. It is as the founder of this magazine, and as the first to give literary employment to Samuel Johnson, that Cave’s name has been remembered. He died on the 10th January 1754. Dr Samuel Johnson wrote a short biography of Cave.
