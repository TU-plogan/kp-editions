CAPITANATA, or Foggia, a province of Southern Italy, formerly belonging to the kingdom of Naples. It has an area of 2955 square miles, and is bounded on the N. and E. by the Adriatic Sea, on the S.E. by the province of Bari, on the S. by Basilicata and Principato Ulteriore, on the W. by Benevento and Molise. The south-west of the province is occupied by the slopes and underfalls of the Apennines, and on the north-east the mountain mass of Gargano covers an extent of more than 800 square miles. The central district, however, is very level, and is known as the Tavogliere di Puglie, or Chess-board of Apulia; while the mountainous parts also enclose many fertile valleys. Except at the promontory of Gargano the coast is low, and is in many parts covered with lagoons, of which the principal are the Lago di Lesina, the Lago di Verana, and the Lago di Salpi. The harbours are few and unimportant. The Fortore, the Candelaro, and the Cervajo are the chief rivers, to which must be added the Ofanto, which forms the boundary towards the south. The products are wheat, maize, pulse, fruits, hemp, flax, oil, and wine; the breeding of horses and cattle is pursued to a considerable extent, and vast herds of sheep are pastured throughout the province. The manufactures are few and of no great importance; and the commerce consists mainly in the coasting trade. The province is divided into the three districts of Foggia, San Severo, and Manfredonia; its capital is Foggia, and the other principal towns, besides those which give name to the districts, are Lucera, Bovino, Cerignola, Ascoli di Satriano, and Vieste. Population in 1871, 322,758.
