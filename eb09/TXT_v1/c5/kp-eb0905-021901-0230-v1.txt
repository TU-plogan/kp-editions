CATAWBAS, an American Indian tribe in North and South Carolina, which has now become almost extinct, but was still able at the time of the War of Independence to furnish a valuable contingent to the South Carolina troops They then occupied a number of small towns on the river which still preserves their name; but they afterwards leased their land and removed to the territory of the Cherokees, with whom they had been formerly at war There, however, they did not long remain, but returned to a reservation in their original district. Their affinities have not been very clearly made out, but by Gallatin they are grouped with the Cherokees, Choctaws, Muskogees, and Natchez. Their language is closely allied to that of the Waccoes and the Caroline tribe, and affords no support to the opinion that they came originally from Canada. A vocabulary of sixty of their words was published by Hale in volume ii. of the Transactions of the American Ethnological Society in 1848; and a much fuller list—about 300—collected by Oscar Μ. Lieber, the geologist, in 1856, made its appearance in volume ii. of Collections of the South Carolina Historical Society, 1858. Peter Harris, the revolutionary soldier, was said to be the last survival of the full-blooded Catawbas, and the present representatives of the tribe are all half-castes. The pleasant sound of the Indian name is far more familiar in its application to the white American wine, whose praises have been sung so heartily by Longfellow. The grape from which the wine is obtained was first discovered about 1801, near the banks of the Catawba River, but it is now cultivated extensively in Illinois, Ohio, and New York, and especially on the shores of Lake Erie.
