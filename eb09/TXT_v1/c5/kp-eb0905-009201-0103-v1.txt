CARDENAS, a maritime town of the island of Cuba, capital of a district in the western department, is situated 105 miles E. of Havana, on a bay of the northern coast, and has railway communication with Matanzas and Montalvo. There is good anchorage in the harbour, and a number of long wharves stretch out from the shore. The most important article of export is the sugar from the neighbouring district,—of which, in 1873, 13,096 tons were sent to Europe, and 69,364 to America. Though only founded in 1828, Cardenas had in 1861 12,910 inhabitants; and at present, in spite of the troubled condition of the island, the number is calculated at about 11,000, of whom 7700 are whites, 2800 slaves, and the rest free negroes. In 1850 the town was plundered by general Lopez.
