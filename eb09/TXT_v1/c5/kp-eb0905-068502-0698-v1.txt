CHOLULA, an ancient town of Mexico, situated on the plateau of La Puebla between Vera Cruz and the city of Mexico. Although formerly a populous place, it now contains little over 6000 inhabitants, mostly Indians, who are engaged in agricultural pursuits. At the time of the Spanish conquest Cholula—then known as Chololan—was a town of great importance, consecrated to the worship of the god Quetzalcoatl, who had here one of the noblest temples in the country, built on the summit of a truncated pyramid. This pyramid, which is 160 feet high, is now the most conspicuous feature in the place, and is surrounded by a chapel dedicated to Our Lady de los Remedios. The town was visited by Cortez in 1519 in his march to Tenochtitlan, the city of Montezuma, and on that occasion was given over to massacre and pillage, owing to a suspicion against the good faith of the inhabitants.
