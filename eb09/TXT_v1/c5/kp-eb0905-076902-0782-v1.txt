CIBBER, or Cibert, Caius Gabriel (1630-1700), sculptor, was born at Flensburg in Denmark. He was the son of the king’s cabinetmaker, and was sent to Rome at the royal charge while yet a youth. Nothing further is known of his earlier life, save that he came to England during the Protectorate, or during the first years of the Restoration. By his second wife, Miss Colley of Glaiston, a son was bom to him afterwards to be known as Colley Cibber. Besides the famous statues of Melancholy and Raving Madness (“great Cibber’s brazen brainless brothers”), once in old Bethleham Hospital and now at South Kensington, Cibber produced the bas-reliefs round the Monument on Fish Street Hill. The several Kings of England and the Sir Thomas Gresham executed by him for the Royal Exchange were destroyed with the building itself in 1838. Cibber was long employed by William fourth earl of Devonshire, and many fine specimens of bis work are to be seen at Chatsworth. Under that nobleman he took up arms in 1688 for William of Orange, and was appointed in return carver to the king’s closet. He died rich, and, according to Horace Walpole, built the Danish church in London, where he lies buried beside his second wife, to whom he erected a monment.
