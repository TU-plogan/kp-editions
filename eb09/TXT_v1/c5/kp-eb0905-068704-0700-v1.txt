CHRISTCHURCH, a parliamentary borough of South Hampshire, England, is situated at the confluence of the rivers Avon and Stour, 1½ miles from the sea, 22 miles S.W. of Southampton, and 111 miles from London by rail. Its history commences in Saxon times, when it was known as Τweonaeteam, a name which continued till recently in the form of Christchurch Twineham. The town, which is nominally governed by a mayor, recorder, and councillors, consists of two long irregular streets. It manufactures chains for clocks and watches, and hosiery, while the salmon fishery employs some hands. It is, however, to its priory church that it owes its distinction. This building, which is a conspicuous object at sea, belongs partly to the Norman and partly to the Perpendicular styles of architecture, and is one of the best specimens of its kind, measuring 311 feet long by 104 broad. It was first established as an Augustinian priory by Baldwin, earl of Devon, in the 12th century, and thereafter received successive grants from the Crown. Within recent years the work of restoration has been carried on to a considerable extent. The church contains a very fine rood screen of the 14th century, a chapel of the 16th century, built by Margaret, countess of Salisbury, an altar tomb of the same century with effigies, and many other objects of architectural interest. A monument has been erected in the Western tower to Shelley the poet. Little remains of the old castle but an adjoining ruin called the Norman House, which is supposed to date from the time of Henry II. The population of the town in 1871 was little over 2000, but the parliamentary borough, which extends to 22,350 acres and includes the greater part of Bournemouth and the parish of Holden-hurst, contained 15,415 persons; it returns one member to parliament.
