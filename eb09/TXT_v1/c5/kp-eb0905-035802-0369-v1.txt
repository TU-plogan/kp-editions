CETTINJE, Cetinje, Zetinje, Cettigno, or Cettin, the capital of the principality of Montenegro, is situated on the left of a small river in a narrow plain deeply sunk in the heart of the mountains, at a height of 2470 feet above the sea. It consists of two streets of whitewashed stone houses, and, according to Mr Tozer, has very much the appearance of a Dartmoor village. The principal buildings are the monastery and the palace. The former was founded in 1478, but has been frequently burned and restored. It is surrounded with walls, and now contains a prison, a school, a library, a printing establishment, and the residences of the archimandrite and the bishop. The chapel is held in great veneration as the burial-place of the sainted Peter I. and Danilo. The palace is a comparatively simple building of two stories, composing two sides of a court, which is completed by high walls. The town owes its origin to Ivan the Black, who was obliged, in the end of the 15th century, to withdraw from Jabliak, the former capital, situated to the north of Lake Scodra. The town has frequently been taken and ravaged by the Turks, but has seldom continued for any length of time in their possession. Population about 700.
