CAREW, George (died about 1613), second son of Sir Wymond Carew of Antony, was educated at Oxford, entered the Inns of Court, and passed some years in Continental travel. At the recommendation of Queen Elizabeth, who conferred on him the honour of knighthood, he was appointed secretary to Sir Christopher Hatton, and afterwards, having been promoted to a mastership in chancery, was sent as ambassador to the king of Poland. In the reign of James he was employed in negotiating the treaty of union with Scotland, and for several years was ambassador to the Court of France. On his return he wrote a Relation of the State of France, with sketches of the leading persons at the court of Henry IV. It is written in the classical style of the Elizabethan age, and was appended by Dr Birch to his Historical View of the Negotiations between ths Courts of England, France, and Brussels, from 1592 to 1617. Much of the information regarding Poland contained in De Thou’s History of His Own Times was furnished by Carew.
