CLARKE, Adam (c. 1760-1832), a Wesleyan divine,distinguished for his varied learning, was born at Moybeg, in [9:5:810] the north of Ireland in 1760 or 1762. After receiving a very limited education he was apprenticed to a linen manufacturer, but, finding the employment uncongenial, he soon abandoned it, and devoted himself to study. His parents belonged to a Methodist congregation under the pastoral charge of Breedon, one of Wesley’s earliest associates in the Methodist movement, by whose advice young Clarke was sent to the school founded by Wesley at Kingswood, near Bristol. In 1782 he entered on the duties of the ministry, being appointed by Wesley to the Bradford (Wiltshire) circuit. His popularity as a preacher was very great, and his influence in the denomination is indicated by the fact that he was three times chosen to be president of the Conference. He served twice on the London circuit, the second period being extended considerably longer than the rule allowed, at the special request of the British and Foreign Bible Society, who had employed him in the preparation of their Arabic Bible. He had found time during his i tinerancy for diligent study of Hebrew and other Oriental languages, undertaken chiefly with the view of qualifying himself for the great work of his life, his Commentary on the Holy Scriptures, the first volume of which appeared in 1810, and the eighth and last in 1826. It is a work of much learning and ability, and it still possesses some value, though it is in great part superseded by the results of later scholarship. Dr Clarke’s other literary works were very numerous. In 1802 he published a Bibliographical Dictionary in six volumes, to which he afterwards added a supplement. He was selected by the Records Commission to edit Rymer’s Foedera, a task for which he was not well qualified, and which he did not complete. He also wrote Memoirs of the Wesley Family (1823), and edited a large number of religious works. He died of cholera in London on the 16th August 1832. His Miscellaneous Works have been published in a collected form in 13 vols., and a Life by J. B. B. Clarke appeared in 1833.
