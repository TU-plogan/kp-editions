+=====================================================================+


NEY, Michel (1769-1815), one of the bravest of Napoleon’s marshals, was born at Saarlouis on January 10, 1769. His father, who had been a soldier, gave him a fairly good education, and obtained for him an appointment in some neighbouring mines. But his heart was set on the army, and in 1787 he went to Metz and enlisted in a regiment of hussars. But for the Revolution he could never have become more than a sergeant, but in the new state of things he was elected lieutenant, and afterwards (1792) captain of his regiment. He was aide-decamp to General Lamarque in March 1793, and soon after became lieutenant-colonel, when Kléber perceived his eminent military ability, and made him adjutantgeneral in August 1794. He was promoted colonel in September, and his merits were so great that Jourdan and Kléber actually quarrelled which should have the advantage of his services. In February 1795 he might have become general of brigade, but modestly refused the rank, alleging his own unworthiness. He commanded the advanced guard of Kléber at the battle of Altenkirchen, and was made general of brigade on the field of Forchheim. He then commanded the right wing of Hoche’s army, and in 1798 took Mannheim. Sent next to Switzerland, he there reorganized Masséna’s cavalry, and immensely distinguished himself in Masséna’s great campaign, in which he was three times wounded, and after which he was made general of division. In 1799 he commanded on the Rhine, and by his skilful operations obtained the armistice during which the coup d’état of Brumaire took place. In 1801 he was present at Hohenlinden, and in May 1802 he married Mademoiselle Auguié, whom Josephine had chosen for him at Bonaparte’s request. He became inspectorgeneral of cavalry, and, after a short residence as minister in Switzerland, commandant of the camp of Montreuil. It was while there that in the name of the army he begged Napoleon to declare himself emperor, and on the establishment[9:17:472] of the empire he was made marshal of France and grand cross of the Legion of Honour. In 1805 he commanded the 6th corps of the grand army, and by his victory at Elchingen, for which he was made duke of Elchingen, secured the surrender of General Mack at Ulm. He was then ordered to the upper Adige, and missed the battle of Austerlitz, but was present at Jena and Eylau, and was so instrumental in winning the battle of Friedland that Napoleon called him the brave des braves, and gave him the grand eagle of the Legion of Honour. In 1808 he was ordered to Spain with the 6th corps, and received the command of Galicia, which he managed to keep in subjection to the French in spite of the mountainous nature of the country. In 1810, in command of a corps d’armée under Masséna, he advanced into Portugal, but he was so disgusted at being under Masséna’s command that perpetual quarrels resulted, and not only were the French defeated at Busaco, but Ney, when conducting the last column on the retreat from Torres Vedras, received more than one repulse from Lord Wellington at Pombal, Redinha, and Foz d’Aronce. For his opposition to Masséna Ney was recalled from Spain, but received the command of the 3d corps in the grand army of 1812. At the battle of the Moskva he so distinguished himself that he was made Prince de la Moskowa on the field, and in the disastrous retreat from Moscow it was Ney who commanded the rear-guard, and kept the relics of the grand army together. He served at Lützen and Leipsic, and in the last defensive campaign of 1814, and with Macdonald remained faithful to Napoleon to the last. At the Restoration he was made a peer, and in 1815 was given the command of the army sent to check Napoleon on escaping from Elba. But the sight of the old colours and of his old master was too much for him, and he led his troops over to Napoleon’s side. In the Flemish campaign he fought the battle of Quatre Bras against the English on the same day that Napoleon defeated the Prussians at Ligny, and at Waterloo he commanded in person the last charge of the Old Guard. He made no attempt to leave France, and was arrested as a traitor; on December 5 he was found guilty of high treason by the House of Peers by 169 votes to 17, and two days later he was shot in the gardens of the Luxembourg. His execution caused a cry of horror; while no one would have regretted the death of Fouché or many another of the innumerable traitors, it is to be lamented that Ney was chosen to suffer, whose honesty was well known, and had only once failed him.

The character of Ney was that of a simple soldier; intensely brave, though without the rash impetuosity of a Murat, he was yet as modest as he was brave; as a general his conduct of the two retreats from Portugal and Russia are his chief titles to fame; and, if he was not faithful to the Bourbons, he paid with his life for his defection.
