NASH, Richard (1674-1761), better known as “Beau Nash,” was born at Swansea, 18th October 1674. He was descended from an old family of good position, but his father from straitened means had become partner in a glass business. Young Nash was educated at Caermarthen grammar school and at Jesus College, Oxford. He obtained a commission in the army, which, however, he soon exchanged for the study of law at the Middle Temple. “Here,” it is said, “he went to the very summit of second-class luxury,” and among “wits and men of pleasure” he came to be accepted as an authority in regard to dress, manners, and style. When the members of the Inns of Court entertained William III. after his accession, Nash was chosen to conduct the pageant. This duty he performed so much to the satisfaction of the king that he was offered knighthood, but he declined the honour, unless accompanied by a pension. As the king did not take the hint, Nash found it necessary to turn gamester. The pursuit of his calling led him in 1704 to Bath, where he had the good fortune almost immediately to succeed Captain Webster as master of the ceremonies. His qualifications for such a position were unique, and under his conventional authority reforms were introduced which rapidly secured to Bath a leading position as a fashionable watering-place. He drew up a new code of rules for the regulation of balls and assemblies, abolished the habit of wearing swords in places of public amusement, induced gentlemen to adopt shoes and stockings in parades and assemblies instead of boots, reduced refractory chairmen to submission and civility, and introduced a tariff for lodgings. Through his exertions a handsome assemblyroom was also erected, and the streets and public buildings were greatly improved. Nash adopted an outward state corresponding to his nominal dignity. He wore an immense white hat as a sign of office, and a dress adorned [9:17:236] with rich embroidery, and drove in a chariot with six greys, laced lackeys, and French horns. Notwithstanding his vanity and impertinence, the tact, energy, and superficial cleverness of Nash won him the patronage and notice of the great, while the success of his ceremonial rule, as shown in the increasing prosperity of the town, secured him the gratitude of the corporation and the people generally. When the Act of Parliament against gambling deprived him of an easy though uncertain means of subsistence, the corporation granted him a pension of six score guineas a year, which, with the sale of his snuff boxes and other trinkets, enabled him to support a certain faded splendour till his death on February 3, 1761. He was honoured with a public funeral at the expense of the town.

A Life of Richard Nash, by Goldsmith, was published anonymously at London in 1762, has been frequently reprinted, and is now included in the editions of Goldsmith’s collected works. See also London Magazine, vol. xxxi., and a paper on ‘ ‘ The Monarch of Bath” in Blackwood’s Magazine, vol. xlviii.
