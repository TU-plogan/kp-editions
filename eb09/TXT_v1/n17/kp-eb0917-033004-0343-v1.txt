NENAGH, a market and assize town of county Tipperary, province of Munster, Ireland, is finely situated in a rich though hilly country near the river Nenagh, 29 miles north of Tipperary and 95 south-west of Dublin. The principal buildings are the court-house, the barracks, and the market-house. Of the old castle, “Nenagh Round,” dating from the time of King John, there still exists the circular donjon or keep. There are no remains of the hospital founded in 1200 for Austin canons, nor of the Franciscan friary, founded in the reign of Henry III. and one of the richest religious houses in Ireland. The town depends chiefly on agriculture, and there is an important butter and corn market. The population in 1871 was 5696, and in 1881 it was 5422.

Nenagh was one of the ancient manors of the Butlers, who received for it the grant of a fair from Henry VIII. In 1550 th< i town and friary were burned by O’Carroll. In 1641 the town was taken by Owen Roe O’Nial, but shortly afterwards it was recaptured by Lord Inchiquin. It surrendered to Ireton in 1651. and was burned by Sarsneld in 1688.
