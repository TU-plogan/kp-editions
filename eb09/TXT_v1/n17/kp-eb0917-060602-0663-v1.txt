NOVELLO, Vincent (1781-1861), an artist whose efforts to diffuse an increased taste for classical music in England fifty years ago have been crowned with permanent success, was born in London 6th September 1781. He was organist at different times of the Sardinian, Spanish, and Portuguese chapels, and of St Mary’s chapel, Moorfields. He was an original member of the Philharmonic Society, of the Classical Harmonists, and of the Choral Harmonists. He composed an immense quantity of sacred music, much of which is still deservedly popular; but his great work lay in the introduction to England of unknown compositions by the great masters. The Masses of Haydn and Mozart were absolutely unknown in England until he edited them, as were also the works of Palestrina, the treasures of the Fitzwilliam Museum, and innumerable great compositions now well known to every one. To his zeal is due the store of sacred music published, first by his son, and then by Novello, Ewer, and Co.; and it is not too much to say that benefit is still derived from the impulse given to English taste by these publications. Novello died at Nice on 9th August 1861.
