NOLA, a city of Italy in the province of Caserta (Terra di Lavoro), is pleasantly situated on the plain between Mount Vesuvius and the Apennines, 14 miles east-northeast of Naples on the road to Avellino, and 20⅜∙ miles south-west of Cancello on the railway to the same town. The more conspicuous buildings are the ancient Gothic cathedral (restored in 1866), with its lofty tower rebuilt since the fire of 1860, the cavalry barracks, the ex-convent of the Capuchins at a little distance from the city, and the seminary in which is preserved the famous Oscan inscription known as the Cippus Abellanus (from Abella). Two fairs are held in Nola, on 14th June and 12th November; and the 26th of July is devoted to a great festival in honour of St Paulinus, one of the early bishops of the city. The population of the city was 10,771 in 1871, and 8489 in 1881; that of the commune 11,395 in 1871, and 11,931 in 1881.

Nola (Νώλα) was one of the oldest cities of Campania. At the time when it sent assistance to Neapolis against the Roman invasion (328 B.c.) it was probably occupied by Oscans in alliance with the Samnites; but it had evidently passed through an Etruscan period, and had possibly received a Greek colony from Chalcis. The Romans made themselves masters of Nola in 313 B.c. In the Second Punic War it thrice bade defiance to Hannibal; but in the Social War it was betrayed into the hands of the Samnites, who kept possession till Marius, with whom they had sided, was defeated by Sulla. Whatever punishment Sulla may have inflicted, Nola “remained a municipium, with its own institutions and the use of the Oscan language.” At a later date it became a Roman colony. Marcus Agrippa and Augustus died at Nola. Sacked by Genseric in 455, and by the Saracens in 806 and 904, captured by Manfred in the 13th century, and damaged by earthquakes in the 15th and 16th, Nola lost much of its importance. The remains of two great amphitheatres described by Ambrosio Leone in the first part of the 16th century were used by Carlo Caraffa and Orso Orsini in 1664 to build their palaces in Naples and Nola. Giordano Bruno and the sculptor Giovanni Marliano were natives of the city; and some of the latter’s works are preserved in the cathedral.
