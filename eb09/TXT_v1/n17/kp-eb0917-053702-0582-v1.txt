NORFOLK ISLAND, with the much smaller Nepean Island and Phillip Island, lies about 29° 3' S. lat. and 167° 58' E. long, 400 miles north-north-west of New Zealand, on a submarine tableland extending 18 miles to the north, and 25 miles to the south, with an average breadth of 18 miles. Measuring about 6 miles in length from north-west to south-east, Norfolk Island has an area of 8607 acres, or 13∣ square miles. The breakers of the Pacific beating on its high cliff-bound coast render it difficult or even impossible to land except at two places, and even there not without danger. With a general elevation of 400 feet above the sea the surface of the island rises in the northwest into Mount Pitt, whose double summit is 1050 feet in height. The soil, of decomposed basalt, is well watered and wonderfully fertile. A rich undulating pasture-land clothed with clumps of trees and copses gives a park-like appearance to the general aspect of the country. The Norfolk Island pine {Eutassa excelsa), a magnificent tree, with a height at times of 200 feet and a girth of 30, forms a fine avenue between Sydney and St Barnabas, though of the forest that clothed the slopes of Mount Pitt only a few of the larger trees are left. A small species of palm is known as the Norfolk Island cabbage. The underwood is largely composed of lemon trees; and guavas, bananas, peaches, and pine-apples are to be had in abundance. Sweet potatoes are the staple crop, but common potatoes, maize, yams, and even barley and oats are cultivated. The climate is genial and healthy, the thermometer rarely sinking below 65°. In 1862 the population was 268; in 1871, 481; and in 1880, 663. The descendants of the Pitcairn Islanders, who form two-thirds of the inhabitants, have their chief settlement on the south side, on Sydney Bay, where the buildings of the old penal establishment were placed at their disposal. A thousand acres on the west side of the island are held by the mission station of St [9:17:538] Barnabas, founded by Bishop Patteson, where 150 Melanesian boys and girls receive education.

King of the “Stirling” and twenty-four convicts from New South Wales. 1805. Settlement abandoned by order issued in 1803. 1826. Island made penal settlement for New
