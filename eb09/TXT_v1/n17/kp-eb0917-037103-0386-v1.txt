NEW BEDFORD, a city and port of entry of the United States, one of the capitals of Bristol county, Massachusetts, stretches for several miles along the west side of the estuary of the Acushnet river, which opens into Buzzard Bay, and forms an excellent harbour. It is 56 miles almost due south of Boston by the Old Colony Railroad. Of the fact that it has been for a long time one of the wealthiest cities in the State New Bedford affords abundant indications in the character both of its private residences and of its public enterprises and numerous charitable institutions. Among the more conspicuous buildings are the city-hall, constructed of granite in 1839, the custom-house (1836) also of granite, the almshouse (1846), and the public library. This last was erected in 1857 at a cost of $45,000, the city having taken over the “Social Library,” founded in 1803; in 1863 the development of, the institution and the cause of liberal education generally were stimulated by a bequest of $100,000 from Miss Sylvia A∕ Howland. The same lady left a similar sum for the construction of water-works; and in 1867—69 a total of about $1,000,000 was spent in connecting the city with a reservoir for 300,000,000 gallons supplied by the upper [9:17:372] part of the Acushnet river. French Avenue, the favourite promenade, was laid out by the municipality in 1853; it runs 4 miles round the shore of Clark’s Point at the mouth of the river, where the United States erected a granite fort in 1860-64. Since the decline of Nantucket New Bedford has been the great seat of the United States whale fishery; in 1854, when this enterprise was at its best, the New Bedford district possessed 410 whalers with a burden of 132,966 tons, but owing to the civil war and other influences (especially the immense production of petroleum) the number was by 1883 reduced to 95. The manufactories of the city, which on the other hand have been increasing in importance, produce cotton goods (460,000 spindles), woollen goods, silver-plated and iron wares, drills for metalworkers, copper sheathings, Prussian blue, paraffin and other candles, glass, cordage, shoes, &c., the total value in 1880 being $8,880,384. The population was 21,320 in 1870, and 26,845 in 1880.

New Bedford (Acushnet of the Indians) was settled by Quakers in 1664, but it did not receive its present name till about 1765. Previous to 1787 it formed part of the “town” of Dartmouth. The city charter dates from 1847. In 1778, in revenge for the use of its harbour as a rendezvous of privateers who had been driven from other ports, the shipping and wharves of New Bedford were burned by the British. Not many of the privateers, however, belonged to the town, most of the inhabitants at that time being Quakers.
