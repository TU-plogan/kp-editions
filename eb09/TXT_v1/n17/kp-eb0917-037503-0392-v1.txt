NEWBURY, a municipal borough and market-town of Berkshire, England, near the Hampshire border, is situated on the river Kennet, the Kennet and Avon Canal, and the Great Western Railway, 53 miles west of London and 16 south-west of Reading. The church of St Nicholas, in the Late Perpendicular style, is said to have been mainly built at the expense of John Winchcombe (Jack of Newbury), who sent one hundred of his own weavers fully equipped to Flodden Field. The church was restored in 1867 at a cost of £15,000. It contains a brass of John Winchcombe and Alice his wife (1519). Among other public buildings are the corn exchange (1862), the literary and scientific institution, and the free grammar school. There are over one hundred almshouses, of which twenty-four are supported by the hospital of St Bartholomew, chartered by King John. Malting is carried on, and there is a considerable trade in com and agricultural produce. Silk, ribbons, and paper are also manufactured. A large wool fair is held in February. The population of the municipal borough, 6602 in 1871, was 10,144 in 1881. In 1878 the area of the borough was extended from 1722 to 1813 acres.

Newbury owes its origin to the Roman station Spinae, now represented by the modem village of Speen. In contradistinction to this village it was named Newbury, that is the new borough or town. By William the Conqueror it was bestowed on Ernulf de Hesdin, and it belonged to the Marshalls of Hampstead-Marshall before it came into the possession of the Cravens. The town was incorporated by Elizabeth in 1596, and the charter was renewed by James I. and Charles II. In the reign of Edward I. it sent two members to a parliament at Westminster; and,· being a place of considerable trade, it also sent representatives to a great council in the time of Edward III. It then possessed large woollen manufactures, but the industry is now wholly discontinued. During the civil war two battles were fought near it in 1643 and 1644. In 1645 it was taken by the Parliamentarians, who held possession of it till the close of the war. A handsome memorial to Lords Falkland, Sutherland, and Carnarvon and other Royalists who fell at Newbury in 1643 has been erected on the battlefield (1878).
