NARVAEZ, Ramon Maria (1800-1868), Spanish soldier and statesman, was born at Loja, Granada, on August 4, 1800, entered the army at an early age, and saw active service under Mina in Catalonia in 1822. In 1823 the French invasion caused him to retire into private life, whence he re-emerged in 1832, speedily attaining the rank of colonel. He achieved great popularity by his victory over Gomez, the Carlist general, near Arcos, in November 1836, and after clearing La Mancha of brigands by a vigorous policy of suppression in 1838 he was appointed captain-general of Old Castile, and commanderin-chief of the army of reserve. In 1840, for the part he had taken at Seville in the insurrection against Espartero, he was compelled to take refuge in France, where, in conjunction with Maria Christina, he planned the expedition of 1843 which led to the overthrow of his adversary. In 1844 he became prime minister, and was created fieldmarshal and duke of Valencia, but his policy was too reactionary to be tolerated long, and he was compelled to quit office in February 1846. He now held the post of ambassador at Paris, until again called to preside over the council of ministers in 1847; but misunderstandings with Maria Christina led to his resignation in the following year. His ministry succeeded that of O’Donnell for a short time in 1856-57, and he again returned to power for a few months in 1864-65. He once more replaced O’Donnell in July 1866, and was still in office when he died at Madrid on April 23, 1868.
