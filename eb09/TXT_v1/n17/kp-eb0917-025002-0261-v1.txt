NAVARRETE, Martin Fernandez de (1765-1844), Spanish historian, was born at Abalos, Logrono, in 1765, received his early education at the seminary in Vergara, Guipuzcoa, and entered the navy as a midshipman in 1780. His ship was engaged in the unsuccessful operations against Gibraltar in 1782, and afterwards in the suppression of Algerine pirates. Ill-health compelled him for a time to withdraw from active service, but he was able to devote the leisure thus forced upon him to historical research, and in 1789 he was appointed by the crown to examine the national archives with a view to the publication of a series of documents relating to the maritime history of Spain. Rejoining the navy in 1793, he was present at the siege of Toulon, and afterwards received command of a frigate. From 1797 to 1808 he held in succession various important posts in the office of the minister of marine. In 1808 the French invasion led to his withdrawal to Andalusia, and the rest of his life was entirely devoted to literature. In 1819 appeared, as an appendix to the Academy’s edition of Don Quijote, his Vida de Cervantes, the best biography of the great poet and humorist that has as yet been written, and in 1825 the first two volumes of the Coleccion de los Viajes y Descubrimientos que hicieron por Mar los Espanoles desde fines del Siglo XV.,— characterized by Humboldt as “one of the most important historical monuments of modern times,”—were published. The third followed in 1829, and the fourth and fifth in 1837. After the publication of his Life of Cervantes, Navarrete’s literary merits received ample recognition: various public posts were conferred on him, including that of director of the hydrographical institute, and in 1837 he was made a senator and director of the academy of history. At the time of his death, which occurred on October 8, 1844, he was assisting in the preparation of the Coleccion de Documentes Ineditos para la Historia de Espana. The last two volumes of the Coleccion de Viajes were published posthumously, as also were a Disertacion sobre la Historia de la Nautica (1846) and the Biblioteca Maritima Espanola (1851).
