NITZSCH, Karl Immanuel (1787-1868), theologian, was born at the small Saxon town of Borna on September 21, 1787. His father, Karl Ludwig Nitzsch, who at that time was pastor and superintendent in Borna, and afterwards became professor at Wittenberg, has also left a name of some distinction in the theological world by a number of writings, among which may be mentioned a work entitled De discrimine revelationis imperatoriae et didacticae prolusiones academicae (2 vols., 1830). Karl Immanuel, after receiving his elementary education at home, was sent to Schulpforta in 1803, whence he proceeded to the university of Wittenberg in 1806. In 1809 he graduated, when the subject of his thesis was De euangeliorum apocryphorum in explicandis canonicis usu et abusu, and in the following year he “habilitated” with a dissertation De testamentis patriarcharum, libro veteris testamenti pseudepigrap>ho. Having been ordained deacon in 1811, he showed remarkable energy and zeal during the bombardment and siege of the city in 1813; and in 1817 he was appointed one of the preceptors in the preachers’ seminary which had been established after the suppression of the university. From 1820 to 1822 he was superintendent in Kemberg, and in the latter year he was appointed professor ordinarius of systematic and practical theology at Bonn. Here he remained until called to succeed Marheineke at Berlin in 1847; subsequently/ he became university preacher, provost of St Nicolai (in 1855), and member of the supreme council of the church, in which last capacity he was one of the ablest and most active promoters of the Evangelical Union. He died on August 21, 1868.

His principal works are System der Christlichen Lehre (1829, 6th; ed. 1851), Praktische Theologie (1847-60, 2d. ed. 1863-68), Akade-* mische Vorträge über Christliche Glaubenslehre (1858), and severaF series of Predigten. His Protestantische Beantwortung, a reply to the Symbolik of Möhler, which originally appeared in the Studien u. Kritiken, may also be mentioned. Nitzsch, whose work in dogmatic theology has been already characterized (see vol. vii. p. 342), still stands out as one of the ablest and most genial and accomplished representatives of the “Vermittelungstheologie” (mediation theology), or what may be called the broad evangelical school of modern Germany.—Gregor Wilhelm Nitzsch (1790-1861), brother of Karl Immanuel, chose philology as his province, and held professorships of ancient literature successively at Kiel (from 1827) and at Leipsic (1852). He published various works, chiefly connected with the elucidation of the Homeric poems.
