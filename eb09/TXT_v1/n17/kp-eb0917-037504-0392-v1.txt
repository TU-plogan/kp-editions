NEWBURYPORT, a city and port of entry of the United States, and one of the shire-towns of Essex county, Massachusetts, lies on the right-hand side of the estuary of the Merrimack, and 35 miles by rail north-north-east of Boston. At this point the river is crossed by several [9:17:376] bridges, one of which, constructed in 1792, was the first suspension bridge in America. The ground on which the city is built rises gradually to a height of about 100 feet; along the top of the ridge, parallel with the river, runs for a distance of 3 miles High Street, the leading thoroughfare, lined with old-fashioned mansions (Caleb Cushing’s, Lord Timothy Dexter’s, Ac.); and at the junction of High Street and State Street is a pond of 3∣ acres enclosed by a terraced promenade. The streets in general are umbrageous even for an American city, a special endowment having been left for the maintenance of shade trees. Old South (Presbyterian) Church in Federal Street contains a whispering gallery of a very striking kind, and under its pulpit lie the remains of George Whitefield. The free library, founded by Josiah Little in 1854, and endowed by George Peabody, occupies the old Tracy mansion, and contains upwards of 21,000 volumes. Putnam Free School, dating from 1847, with an endowment of $50,000, and the high school for girls, are both institutions of wide reputation (the latter the first of its kind in the States), now consolidated with the high school for boys. The cotton manufacture, introduced in 1836, is the staple of the city, which also, however, contains shoe factories (one of them said to be the largest manufactory of women’s shoes in the world), an iron foundry, a distillery, carriage works, hat factories, &c., and has long been the seat of extensive shipbuilding operations (tonnage 4000 in 1882). The harbour (formed by the northern end of Plum Island, which is united to the city by a causeway) is of somewhat difficult access owing to the shifting character of the bar, which becomes altogether impassable during storms from the east. The population of the city was 13,401 in 1860, 12,595 in 1870, and 13,538 in 1880.

Newbury was settled by Thomas Parker’s company in 1635, but it was not till 1764 that Newburyport attained independent existence. It had reached a state of great prosperity when in 1811 about 11 acres of its most closely-built portion were destroyed by fire. In 1851 a city charter was obtained.
