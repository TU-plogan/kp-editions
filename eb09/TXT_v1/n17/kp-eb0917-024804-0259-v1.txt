NAUDÉ, Gabriel (1600-1653), French librarian and scholar, was born at Paris in February 1600. An intense love for books caused him to accept, when only twenty years of age, the appointment of librarian to the president De Mesmes, whom he left in 1626 to finish his medical studies at Padua. On returning to Paris in 1628 he was chosen to deliver a panegyrical discourse on the medical school. The credit thus acquired brought him under the notice of Cardinal Bagni, who took -him to Rome and gave him charge of his collection. On Bagni’s death in 1641 he became librarian to Cardinal Barberiai, under whose patronage he commenced a wearisome controversy with the Benedictines concerning the authorship of De Imitatione Christi. Richelieu, wishing to secure the services of Naudé, recalled him to Paris in 1642, but, the great minister dying a few months later, Naudé accepted a similar offer on the part of Mazarin, and for the next ten years his unwearied energy was directed to the task of bringing together that noble assemblage of books since known as the Bibliothèque Mazarine (see Libraries, vol. xiv. p. 525), making for the purpose expeditions to all parts of Europe. The troubles of the Fronde caused him to assent to the wish of Queen Christina that he should become her librarian at Stockholm. He was not happy in Sweden, however, and on Mazarin’s appeal that he should reform his scattered library Naudé returned at once. But his health was altogether broken, and he died on the journey at Abbeville in July 1653. The friend of Gui Patin, Gassendi, and all the liberal thinkers of his time, Naudé was no mere bookworm; each of his books shows traces of the critical spirit which made him a worthy member of the company of humorists and scholars who prepared the way for the better known writers of the “siècle de Louis XIV.”

Including works edited by him, a list of ninety-two pieces is given in the Naudaeana. The chief are Le Marfore, ou discours contre les libelles, Paris, 1620, very rare, reprinted 1868; Instruction à la France sur la vérité de l'histoire des Frères de la Rozc-Croix, 1623, 1624, displaying their impostures; Apologie pour tous les grands personnages faussement soupçonnez de magie, 1625, 1652, 1669, 1712,—Pythagoras, Socrates, Thomas Aquinas, and Solotnou are among those defended; Advispour dresser une bibliothèque, 1627, 1644, 1676, translated by J. Evelyn, 1661, full of sound and liberal views on librarianship; Addition a l'histoire de Louys XI., 1630 (this includes an account of the origin of printing); Bibliographia politica, Venice, 1633, <⅛c., in French 1642, a mere essay of no bibliographical value; De studio liberali syntagma, 1632, 1645, a practical treatise found in most collections of directions for studies; De studio militari syntagma, 1637, esteemed in its day; Considérations politiques sur les coups d'état, Rome [Paris], 1639, first edition rare, augmented by Dumay, 1752 (this contains an apology for the massacre of St Bartholomew); Biblioth. Cordesianae Catalogus, 1643, classified; Jugement de tout ce que a été imprimé contre le Card. Mazarin [1649], Naudé’s best work, and one of the ablest defences of Mazarin; it is written in the form of a dialogue between Saint-Ange and Mascurat, and is usually known under the name of the latter.
