NICHOLAS V. (Tommaso Parentucelli), the pope whose name is most intimately associated with the revival of learning, was the son of a physician, and was born at Sarzana, near Spezzia, in 1389. He received a good education at Bologna, became tutor in the Albizzi and Strozzi families at Florence, and ultimately entered into the service of Albergata, bishop of Bologna. He accompanied his patron on several embassies, and gained so high a reputation, for diplomatic ability and for learning that shortly after Albergata’s death he himself obtained the see of Bologna, was sent by Eugenius IV. on an embassy into Germany, and in December 1446 was made a cardinal. In less than three months he was pope in succession to Eugenius,—a. small majority of the electors, indisposed to the strongest candidate, Cardinal Prospero Colonna, having united upon Parentucelli as a man who had made no enemies. His policy as pope seemed clearly marked out for him. The church was reaching the end of a period of strife and schism. The. firmness of Eugenius IV. had at length almost beaten down the emperor, the antipope, and the council of Basel; the wisdom and moderation of Nicholas V. completed the work. Within two years the emperor made peace, the antipope abdicated, and the council dissolved itself. Nicholas hoped for a period of tranquillity, and determined, to exhibit the papacy to the world as the protector of art and learning. “To the demand of Germany for reformation,” says Mr Creighton, “he answered by offering culture.” He aimed especially at making Rome architecturally a worthy capital of the Christian world: he repaired its fortifications, began the rebuilding of its cathedral, enlarged and adorned its thoroughfares, and. traced much of the plan of restoration executed by his successors. But his great glory was his active co-operation in the revival of learning. He collected manuscripts from all quarters, caused them to be multiplied by transcription, commissioned the most competent scholars to translate Greek books into Latin, and gathered around him the most distinguished humanists of his day, Poggio Bracciolini, Valla, Filelfo. Under him the papacy regained much of its former lustre, and till late in his reign his administration was disturbed by no unfortunate events. In January 1453∙ the conspiracy of Stefano Porcaro was detected on the eve of breaking out. The pope and cardinals were to have been seized, their effects pillaged, and Rome declared a. republic. Nicholas was terrified, and showed himself angry and cruel. On May 29 of the same year Constantinople was taken by the Turks. The fault was not the pope’s, who had ineffectually sent his galleys to the rescue; yet he could not but feel that a stain had fallen upon his pontificate. He proclaimed a crusade, but this was an undertaking for which he was constitutionally unfit; he failed to kindle the zeal of others, and many doubted his own. Exhausted by repeated attacks of gout, he died on March 24, 1455. Before his death he summoned the cardinals, and enumerated the good works he had been enabled to perform, “by God’s blessing of peace and tranquillity in my days.” These last words sufficiently express the general scope of his policy. He was rather a scholar than an ecclesiastic or a statesman, yet enough of both to perform his part on the world’s stage with sufficient credit; it is, however, his principal distinction to have been a learned and art-loving pope, and to have formed that alliance between the papacy and intellectual culture which subsisted for the next hundred years. He was succeeded by Calixtus HI.
