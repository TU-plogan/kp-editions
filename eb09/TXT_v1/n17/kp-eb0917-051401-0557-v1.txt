NIORT, a city of France, chief town of the department of Deux Sèvres, distant 255 miles south-west of Paris by the railway to Poitiers and La Rochelle (here crossed by the line from Angers to Angoulême), is situated at the head of navigation of the Sèvre Niortaise, partly in the valley and partly on the slopes of the enclosing hills. The tower of the church of Notre Dame (16th century) has a spire 246 feet high, with bell-turrets adorned with statues of the evangelists, and at the base a richly-decorated dais in the Renaissance style; and the north doorway shows a balustrade, whose balusters form the inscription, 0 Mater Dei, memento mei. There is a fine window in the apse of St André, and St Hilaire contains some beautiful frescos. Of the old castle, whose site is partly occupied by the prefecture, there still remains the donjon—two large square towers, flanked by several of smaller dimensions. Built, it is said, by Henry II. of England or Richard Coeur de Lion, the south tower contains four vaulted chambers one above the other, and the platform on the top affords a fine view of the public garden (one of the most picturesque in France) and the valley of the Sèvre. The old town-house (now used as “justice de paix”) is known as the Aliénor or Éléonore palace, after Eléonore of Guienne; near it is a Renaissance belfry. The convent of the Oratorians is occupied by a public library (30,000 volumes), a picture gallery, and museums of geology and antiquities—the last containing plaster copies of all objects of interest in the ancient monuments of the surrounding country. Niort further possesses extensive barracks, several hospitals, and a lycée named after Fontanes, grandmaster of the imperial university, who was born in the town. The house is still shown in which Madame de Maintenon was born while her father was imprisoned in the donjon. Tanning, currying, shammy-dressing, glove-making, and hair-working are the staple industries of Noirt,—gloves alone giving employment to about one thousand workmen, and brushmaking, hair-working, and allied industries to nearly as many. A large cotton-mill, oil-works, foundries, distilleries, and a glass-work also exist in the town. Owing to the mildness of its climate, Niort has admirable nurseries, and its market-gardens export onions and artichokes. The population of the city in 1881 was 18,823, and that of the commune 22,254.

Up to the 7th century the Niort plain formed part of the Gulf of Poitou; and the mouth of the Sèvre lay at the foot of the hills now occupied by the town which grew up round the castle erected by Henry Plantagenet in 1155. The place was captured by Louis VIII. in 1224. By the peace of Brétigny it was ceded to the English; but its inhabitants revolted against the Black Prince, and most of them were massacred when his troops recovered the town by assault. In 1369 Duguesclin obtained possession by a stratagem. Protestantism made numerous proselytes at Niort, and Coligni made himself master of the town, which successfully resisted the Catholic forces after the battle of Jarnac, but surrendered without striking a blow after that of Moncontour. Henry IV. rescued it from the League. It suffered severely by the revocation of the edict of Nantes.
