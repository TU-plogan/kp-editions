NORTHAMPTON, a city of the United States, the county seat of Hampshire county, Massachusetts, is situated on the west side of the Connecticut river, 17 miles by rail north of Springfield, and is connected with Hadley by a bridge 1230 feet long. The village of Northampton lies in rich alluvial meadow-land, about a mile from the bank of the river, and with its semi-rural streets and venerable trees has the reputation of being one of the prettiest villages in New England. Of note among its buildings are Smith College (1871; endowment, $500,000) for the higher education of women, the free public library (18,000 volumes) and memorial hall, the Clarke institution for deaf-mutes (1867; endowment, $300,000) on rising ground to the west, and the State lunatic asylum (1858; 460 patients). A tramway runs 3 miles to Florence, a manufacturing village producing sewing-machines, silk goods, paper, &c. The population of the township was 5278 in 1850, 6788 in 1860, 10,160 in 1870, and 12,172 in 1880.

Nonotuck, bought from the Indians in 1653, became the village of Northampton in 1654, and was incorporated as a city in 1883. Jonathan Edwards was pastor from 1727 to 1750, and David Brainerd died under his roof in 1747. Timothy Dwight, Arthur, Benjamin, and Lewis Tappan, and W. D. Whitney were born at Northampton.
