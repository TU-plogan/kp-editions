NICEPHORUS II. (Phocas), emperor of Constantinople from 963 to 969, was member of a brave Cappadocian family which had previously furnished more than one distinguished general to the empire. He was born about 912, joined the army at an early age, and under Constantine VII., Porphyrogenitus, attained the high rank of magnus domesticus, or general of the East (954). In the almost continual struggle with the Saracens which this post implied he sustained severe defeat in 956, but retrieved his fame in 958 and again in 959 in Syria; and in July 960 he led the expedition against Crete which compelled Candia to surrender after a siege of ten months, and again brought the whole island under Byzantine rule. The long extinct honours of a triumph were revived to reward him on his return to Constantinople. In 962 he again set out with a large army against Syria; after forcing his way through the narrow passes of Mount Amanus, and compelling the principal cities to open their gates, he was pushing on towards the Euphrates when intelligence reached him in 963 that the emperor Romanus II. had died, leaving the empress Theophano regent for her infant sons. Justly fearing the intrigues of the able minister Joseph Bringas, he returned to Constantinople, after having previously obtained from Theophano and the patriarch Polyeuctes a guarantee for his personal safety; he then, with the help of the patriarch, procured for himself the supreme command of the army during the minority of the princes, and, after gaining over the officers and soldiers to his interest, consented to allow himself to be proclaimed emperor. He was crowned on August 16, and soon afterwards married Theophano, though the union was discountenanced by the patriarch on the alleged ground of a spiritual affinity. In 964 he resumed the war against the Saracens, and, though compelled to raise the siege of Tarsus, was successful in capturing Adana and Mopsuestia; in the following year Tarsus also was forced to surrender to himself, while Cyprus was reconquered for him by the patrician Nicetas. In 966 and 967 the internal affairs of the empire and threatening troubles in Hungary and Bulgaria detained him in Constantinople; but the spring of 968 saw him once more in the field against the caliph, and Laodicea, Hierapolis, Aleppo, Area, and Emesa were added to his conquests. In the following year Antioch also fell, in the emperor’s absence, into the hands of the patricians Burtzes and Peter, but Nicetas was less successful against Sicily. Meanwhile Nicephorus had not made himself so popular on the throne as in the camp. The heavy imposts he found necessary for the support of his expeditions more than counterbalanced, in public estimation, the glory he gained by them. His retrenchment of court largesses and pensions naturally made him many enemies, and he incurred just odium by employing debased coinage to meet the public debts while oontinuing to exact money of the old standard in payment of the taxes. An accidental tumult in the hippodrome, which had resulted in the loss of many lives, further increased his unpopularity, and, last of all, his fickle wife joined the number of his enemies and began to plot his death. He was assassinated in his sleeping apartment on the night of December 10, 969. At the head of the conspirators was his nephew John Zimisces, who immediately succeeded him.
