NEUCHÂTEL, The Lake of, along with the connected lakes of Morat and Bienne, is the modern representative of the large body of water which at one time occupied the whole lower valley of the Aar. It is 25 miles in length, at its broadest part it measures 6 miles, its maximum depth is 500 feet, and the area is 92 square miles. The Thiele (Germ., Zihl), which flows into it at the south-west angle, rises in the heights above La Sarraz close to the edge of the Geneva basin; the Broye, which joins it on the north-east, comes from the Lake of Morat (Lacus Aventicensis). It is also fed by the Reuse, which drains the Vai de Travers, and by the Seyon from the Vai de Ruz (Rudolfsthal). It drains by the Thiele into the Lake of Bienne and thence into the Aar. Its elevation above sealevel, lowered 7 feet by a recent enlargement of the outlet, is 1424 feet. The north-west shore is cultivated and populous, but the opposite bank is rocky, overgrown with wood, and comparatively thinly peopled. The scenery, though pleasing, cannot compare with that of the more famous Swiss lakes. Besides Neuchâtel, the principal towns upon its banks are Estavayer and Yverdon—the ancient Eburodunum or Ebredunum, from which came its Roman name (Lacus Eburodunensis). It abounds in fish; [9:17:362] and a considerable traffic, by steam and otherwise, is borne by its waters. It is subject to violent westerly storms. Interesting remains of ancient lake dwellings have been discovered at Estavayer and Cortaillod.
