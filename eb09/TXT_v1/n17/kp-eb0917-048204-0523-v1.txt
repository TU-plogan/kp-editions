NICEPHORUS, surnamed Callisti, the last of the Greek ecclesiastical historians, lived at Constantinople, perhaps as a monk in connexion with the church of St Sophia. He was born about the close of the 13th century, and died not later than 1356. His Historia Ecclesiastica, in eighteen books, brings the narrative down to the death of Phocas in 610; for the first four centuries the author is largely dependent on his predecessors, Eusebius, Socrates, Sozomen, Theodoret, and Evagrius, his additions showing very little critical faculty; in the later period his labours, based on documents now no longer extant, to which he had free access, though he used them also with small discrimination, are much more valuable. A table of contents of other five books, continuing the history to the death of Leo the Philosopher in 911, also exists, but whether the books were ever actually written is doubtful. A Latin translation of the Historia of Nicephorus, by Lange, appeared at Basel in 1553; the Greek text was edited for the first time by Fronton le Duc (2 vols, fol., Paris, 1630).
