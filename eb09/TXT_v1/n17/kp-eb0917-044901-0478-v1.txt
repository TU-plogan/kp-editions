NEWTON, John (1725-1807), a prominent Evangelical clergyman of the Church of England, and an intimate friend of the poet Cowper, was born in London 24th July 1725. His father, who for a long time was master of a ship in the Mediterranean trade, became in 1748 governor of York Fort, Hudson’s Bay, where he died in 1750; his mother, a pious Dissenter, died when he was hardly seven years old. The only time spent by him at school was from his eighth to his tenth year, at Stratford, Essex. When only eleven years of age he joined his father’s ship, where he continued to serve under him till 1742; shortly afterwards he was impressed on board a man-of-war, the

Harwich,” where he was made a midshipman. For an attempt to escape while his ship lay off Plymouth he was degraded, and treated with so much severity that when two men from a Guinea ship came aboard the man-of-war off Madeira he was glad to take advantage of the opportunity to exchange into an African trader. At Sierra Leone he left this ship and entered into the service of a slave trader, with whom he remained two years. The hardships he suffered were, however, so severe that he brought them under the notice of his father, by whose directions an English ship called for him in 1747 and brought him to England. Shortly afterwards he became mate on board a Liverpool slave ship, with which he made another voyage to Guinea, returning by the West Indies and Charleston. After his marriage in 1750 he made several similar voyages as master, devoting his leisure time to the improvement of his education, especially in mathematics, French, and Latin. The state of his health and a growing aversion to the slave trade led him to quit the sea in 1755, when he was appointed tide-surveyor at Liverpool. He now directed his attention to the study of Greek and Hebrew, and in 1758, in consequence of a gradual deepening of his religious convictions which had been going on for years, applied to the archbishop of York for holy orders. This was refused him, but, having had the curacy of Olney offered to him in April 1764, he was ordained deacon by the bishop of Lincoln, and in June of the following year was ordained priest. About three and a half years afterwards Cowper the poet settled in the parish. An intimate friendship sprung up between them, and they published together the Olney Hymns (1779). They made it a rule to spend four days of the week in one another’s company, and were rarely “seven successive working hours apart.” In 1779 Newton left Olney to become rector of St Mary Woolnoth, London, where he laboured with unremitting diligence in visiting and preaching till his death, December 31, 1807.

Like Cowper, Newton held strongly Calvinistic views, although his evangelical fervour allied him closely with the sentiments of Wesley and the Methodists. His enduring fame rests on certain of the Olney Hymns, remarkable for vigour, simplicity, and directness of devotional utterance, which have passed into almost universal currency throughout the Reformed churches of English speech. His prose works include an Authentic Narrative of some Interesting and Remarkable Particulars in his own Life, a volume of Sermons (1760), Omicron (a series of letters on religion, 1762), Review of Ecclesiastical History (1769), and Cardiphonia (1781); but, though once extensively read, they now, with perhaps the exception of the first-named (a well-told narrative of moral and religious conversion), receive but little attention, and indeed have but little title to a permanent place in religious literature. A Life of Newton by Richard Cecil, first published in 1808, was prefixed to a collected edition of his works which appeared in 6 vols., 1816. Many subsequent editions of his works have been published.
