RUDOLPH II. (1552-1612), Holy Roman emperor, was the son of the emperor Maximilian II., and was born on the 18th July 1552. In 1572 he obtained the crown of Hungary, in 1575 that of Bohemia, with the title “King of the Romans ”; and in 1576, after his father’s death, he became emperor. He was of an indolent and melancholy disposition, and preferred the study of astrology and alchemy to the responsibilities of government. He surrendered himself absolutely to the control of the Jesuits, under whose influence he had been brought up at the gloomy court of Spain; and in his hereditary lands they laboured assiduously to destroy Protestantism. The Protestants were deprived of the right of public worship in Vienna and other towns; their schools were closed, and many of their preachers banished. Almost all public offices, too, were placed in the hands of Roman Catholics. In the lands which Rudolph ruled, not by hereditary right, but as emperor, his advisers could exercise less authority; but there also they did what they could to foster the Catholic reaction. In 1607 Maximilian, duke of Bavaria, was allowed to seize the imperial city Donauwörth, the Protestant inhabitants of which had quarrelled with the abbot. This and other high-handed proceedings alarmed the Protestants of Germany, and in 1608, under the leadership of Frederick IV., elector of the Palatinate, they formed a confederation called the Union for the protection of their interests. The Catholic princes, guided by Duke Maximilian of Bavaria, responded by forming the League. Civil war seemed inevitable, but it was postponed by the murder of Henry IV. of France, who had promised to support the Union, and by the death of the elector Frederick IV. Meanwhile, the greatest confusion prevailed in Hungary, due in part to religious oppression, in part to a war with the Turks. In 1601 the Hungarians rebelled, and peace was not restored until 1606, when Matthias, the emperor’s brother, with the sanction of his younger brothers, who acknowledged him as head of the family, came to terms both with the Hungarians and with the sultan. Matthias allied himself with the Protestants, and compelled Rudolph to give up to him Hungary, Moravia, and the greater part of Austria. The emperor then tried to strengthen his position by granting to the nobles, knights, and towns of Bohemia perfect religious freedom, with the right to build Protestant churches and schools on their own and on the royal lands. Even after they had obtained the letter of majesty in which these *concessions were embodied, the Bohemians did not trust Rudolph; and, when at his request the archduke Leopold appeared in their country with an army, they invited Matthias to come to their aid. Matthias went, and the emperor had no alternative but to resign tö him in 1611 the remainder of his hereditary territories. Rudolph died on the 20th January 1612.
