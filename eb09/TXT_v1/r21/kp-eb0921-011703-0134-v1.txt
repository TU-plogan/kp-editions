RYE a municipal town and seaport at the eastern extremity of the county of Sussex, 63 miles south-southeast of London, is built upon a rocky eminence which two or three centuries ago was washed on all sides by the influx of the tide, but now, in consequence of the gradual recession of the sea, lies two miles inland. It is surrounded by rich marsh land through which flows the river Rother, uniting at the south-east foot of the rock with two rivulets to form a small serpentine estuary, Rye harbour, the mouth of which is connected with the town by means of a branch line of railway. In bygone years, when the adjacent marshes were flooded with tidal water, the efflux was so powerful as to effectually maintain safe and free entrance into Rye harbour; and in the reign of Charles II. a frigate of 50 guns could enter and ride at anchor. Now the harbour suffers seriously from the shifting sand and shingle, and considerable sums of money have been expended by the harbour commissioners with the view of overcoming these impediments, with but partial success. The trade is chiefly in coal, timber,

and bark, and shipbuilding is carried on as well as fishing. There is a large market every alternate Wednesday, and considerable business in cattle, sheep, corn, wool, and hops is transacted. Rye is a quaint, compactly-built town perched upon the rock to which for centuries it was restricted, but in the course of the last half-century it has gradually extended itself over the northern slopes beyond the town wall. It is excellently drained, abundantly supplied with clear spring water, and very healthy. The church, said to be the largest parish church in England, is of very mixed architecture, chiefly Transitional, Norman, and Early English; the nave and high chancel were judiciously restored in 1882, according to designs by the late Mr G. E. Street. Of the old fortifications there still remain portions of the town wall, much hidden by newer buildings, a strong quadrangular tower built by William of Ypres, earl of Kent, and lord warden in the time of Stephen, and now forming part of the police station, and a handsome gate with a round tower on each side, known as the Sandgate, at the entrance into Rye from the London road. Rye ceased in 1885 to be a parliamentary borough, but gives its name to the eastern division of the county. The population in 1881 was 4224.

Of the early history of Rye little is known. In the mediaeval French chronicles it is always mentioned as “La Rie.” Having been conferred upon the abbey of Fecamp by Edward the Confessor, it was taken back by King Henry III. into his own hands, “for the better defence of his realm,” and received from that sovereign the full rights and privileges of a Cinque Port under the title of “Ancient Town.” In consequence of the frequent incursions of the French, by whom it was sacked and burnt three times in the 14th century, it was fortified by order of Edward III. on the landward side, the steep precipitous sides of the rock affording ample protection towards the sea. In addition to the naval services rendered by Rye as a Cinque Port under the Plantagenet and Tudor sovereigns, it was a principal port of communication with France in times of peace,—for which reason successive bands of Huguenots fled thither between 1562 and 1685, many of whom settled at Rye and have left representatives now living.
