RUM is a spirituous liquor, prepared from molasses, skimmings of the boiling house, and other saccharine byeproducts, and the refuse juice of the cane-sugar manufacture. Its distillation, which is a simple process, may be conducted in connexion with any cane-sugar establishment, but the rum which comes to the American and European markets is chiefly the produce of the West India Islands and Guiana. The ordinary method of working in the West Indies is the following. A wash is prepared consisting of sugar skimmings 4 parts, lees of still or d under 5 parts, and molasses 1 part, the quantity prepared being equal to the capacity of the still in use. Dunder consists of the residue of the still from previous distillations, and it takes the place of a ferment, besides which the acetic acid it contains, derived from the fermenting wash of previous operations, has a favourable influence on the progress of attenuation. The wash prepared as above is placed in the fermenting vat, where, according to weather and other conditions, the fermentation proceeds more or less briskly; but usually a week or ten days is the period required for attenuation, during which time the scum formed is removed from the surface of the vat twice daily. λVhen sufficiently attenuated, the wash is run into the still, which is generally of a simple construction, and distilled off, the first product being “low wines,” which on redistillation come over as “high wines” or strong rum. When a Pontefex still is used, which contains two intermediate “retorts” between the still and the worm, a strong spirit is obtained at the first distillation. The charge of wash yields from 10 to 12 per cent, of rum, of an average strength of 25’ over proof. Pure distilled rum is an entirely colourless liquid, but as imported and sold it generally has a deep brown colour imparted by caramel or by storage in sherry casks. It has a peculiar aroma, derived principally from the presence of a minute proportion of butyric ether. Rum varies very considerably in quality, the finest being known as Jamaica rum, whether it is the product of that island or not. An inferior quality of rum is known among the French as tafia ; and the lowest quality, into the wash for which debris of sugar cane enters, is called negro rum, and is mostly consumed by the coloured workers in the sugar houses and distilleries. The planters sometimes put rinds and slices of pine-apple into the barrels in which rum is matured, to improve and add to its flavour, and occasionally anise and other flavouring ingredients are also used. The spirit prepared from molasses of beet-sugar factories cannot be classed with rum. The product has a highly disagreeable odour and taste, and it can only be rendered fit for consumption by repeated distillation and concentration to a high degree of strength, whereby the spirit is rendered “silent,” or has only a faint rum flavour. In this condition it is used for mixing with strongly flavoured rum, and for the Jireparation of a fictitious rum, the flavour of which is due to “rum essence,”—a mixture of artificial ether, birch bark oil, and other substances. Cane-sugar molasses enters largely into the materials from which

Arrack (ç.r), the spirit of Java and the Indian Archipelago, is prepared, but its flavour depends more on palm-tree toddy, which also is a constituent of the wash. The imports of rum into the United Kingdom and the home consumption have been decreasing for a number of years. ^[1. Rmn Shrub]
