RUSHWORTH John (c. 1607—1690), the compiler of the Historical Collections Commonlydescribed by his name, was born in Northumberland about the year 1607. After a period of study at Oxford, but not, it appears, as a member of the university, he came to London, was entered at Lincoln’s Inn, and was in due course called to the bar. As early as 1630 he seems to have commenced attendance at the courts, especially the Star Chamber and the Exchequer Chamber, not for the purpose of practising his profession, but in order that he might observe and record the more remarkable of their proceedings. On the meeting of the Long Parliament in 1640 Lewasappointedassistant clerk to the House of Commons, and was in the habit of I making short-hand notes of the speeches he heard delivered in debate. He himself states that it was from his report that the words used by Charles I. during his memorable attempt to seize the “five members” were printed for public distribution under the king’s orders. Being an expert horseman, it seems that Rushworth was frequently employed by the House as their messenger as well as in the capacity of clerk. When the king left London, and while the earl of Essex was general, he was often the bearer of communications from the parliament to one or the other of them. In 1645 Sir Thomas Fairfax, to whom he was distantly related, and who was then in command of the Parliamentary forces, made him his secretary, and he remained with the army almost continuously until 1650. In 1649 he was at Oxford, and the degree of master of arts was conferred on him by the university. In 1652 he was nominated one of the commissioners for the reform of the common law, and in 1658 he was elected member for Berwick in the parliament of the commonwealth. Almost immediately before the Restoration he published the first volume of his Historical Collections, which had been submitted in manuscript to Oliver Cromwell, with a very laudatory dedication to Richard Cromwell, then Lord Protector. But the turn of events induced him to withdraw this dedication, and he subsequently endeavoured without success to conciliate Charles II. by presenting him with some of the registers of the privy council which had come into his possession. In the convention of 1660, which recalled the king, he sat again as member for Berwick. In 1677 he was made secretary to Sir Orlando Bridgeman, then lord keeper, and he was returned for Berwick a third and a fourth time to the parliaments of 1679 and 1681. Soon after this he appears to have fallen into straitened circumstances. In 1684 he was arrested for debt, and cast into the King’s Bench prison, where he died, after lingering for some time in a condition of mental infirmity, the result of excessive drinking, in 1690.

Rushworth’s Historical Collections of Private Passages of Stats, IVeighty Matters in Law, and Remarkable Proceedings in Parliament was reprinted in eight folio volumes in 1721. The eighth volume of this edition is an account of the trial of the earl of Strafford, the other seven volumes being concerned with the miscellaneous transactions of the period from 1618 to 1648. Only the first three volumes and the trial of Strafford were originally published in Rushworth’s lifetime; but the manuscript of the other volumes was left by him ready for the press. The extreme value of the work is well known to all inquirers into the history of the Civil War, and much of the information it contains is to be found nowhere else. Its impartiality, however, can hardly be seriously maintained, and hence it is necessary to consult it with some caution.
