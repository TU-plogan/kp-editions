OLEO-MARGARINE. Thé process by which the French chemist Mège-Mouriès sought to convert ordinary animal fat into butter has already been described under Butter (vol. iv. p. 592). The following account of the mode of manufacture as carried on by the “Commercial Manufacturing Company” in New York is abridged from a report by Mr Victor Drummond, secretary to the British Embassy in Washington, in 1880.

Fresh fat from recently killed cattle is soaked in tepid water for one hour, then thoroughly washed with cold water, and, after having been soaked in cold water, assorted, the pieces less rich in “oil” being rejected and put aside for the manufacture of tallow. The fat thus selected is hashed up (almost minced) by machinery and melted down in water-jacketed caldrons, the water being heated by means of steam, so that the fat never becomes hotter than 124° Fahr. Through the action of this heat the fat divides into three parts, namely, shreds of membrane below, a scum of an emulsion of fat and water above, and clear oil between the two. The oil is drawn off and kept for thirty to thirty-six hours at a temperature of 85° Fahr., when a portion of the stearin and palmitin crystallizes out, while the more easily fusible components remain as a mother liquor, which is then squeezed out by hydraulic pressure. This oil, which on cooling freezes into a semi-solid fat, constitutes oleo-margarine, and is recommended as an excellent substitute for melted butter. Of the oil considerable quantities are worked up into imitation butter. For this purpose it is violently churned up with milk for about twenty minutes, a little arnotto being added to produce a yellow colour. The emulsion is run direct on a mass of pounded ice to cause it to solidify without crystallization. After having been again churned up with fresh milk, it is kneaded to remove the excess of water, salted (in short, manipulated as genuine churned butter is), and sent out into the market.

The report includes a comparative analysis of real and of the Commercial Company’s imitation butter, of which the following is a somewhat condensed codv :—

Oleo-margarine,—that is, ordinary fat minus part of the palmitin and stearin—is necessarily somewhat richer in those components (2) which are characteristically predominant in butter, but still falls far short of what real butter naturally contains. The physiological action of these butter-glycerides, as we may call them, has never been made out; possibly they may account to some extent for butter being more easily digestible than ordinary fat.

Hehner and Angell have the merit of being the first to work out an easy and straightforward method for detecting (considerable) admixtures of ordinary animal fat, and consequently also of such things as oleo-margarine, with real butter. It consists in determining the percentage of insoluble and non-volatile acids contained in the previously dehydrated and filtered article. By their modus operandi all ordinary animal fats yield close upon 95 per cent., while genuine butter yields only 86 5 to 87'5, at most 89 per cent., of fixed fatty acids. Easier and more decisive is the method of Reichert, who saponifies 2 , 5 grammes of the dry filtered article with 1 gramme of caustic potash dissolved in alcohol, expels the alcohol, decomposes the soap, after addition of 50 cubic centimetres of water, with 20 c.c. of dilute sulphuric acid (1 vol. of vitriol, 10 vol. of water), and distils off (exactly) 50 c.c., to determine therein the volatile acids by ascertaining the volume of a dilute standard solution of caustic alkali which is required to neutralize them. Real butter (per 2'5 grammes) yields 12 to 13 milligrammes, ordinary fats only 1'8 to 2'7, of volatile acids, calculated as butyric, C 4 H 8 O 2 .
