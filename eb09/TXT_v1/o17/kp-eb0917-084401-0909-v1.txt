ORIOLE, from the Old French Oτiol and that from the Latin aureolus, the name once applied to the bird, from its golden colouring, which is now generally admitted to be the Vireo or Icterus (vol. xii. p. 696) of classical authors— the Oriolus galbula of Linnaeus—but now commonly used in a much wider sense. The Golden Oriole, which is the type of the Family Oriolidae of modern ornithologists, is a far from uncommon spring-visitor to the British Islands; but the conspicuous plumage of the male—bright yellow contrasted with black, chiefly on the wings and tail—always attracts attention, and generally brings about its death. Y et a few instances are known in which it is supposed to have bred in England. The nest is a beautifully interwoven fabric, suspended under the horizontal fork of a bough, to both branches of which it is firmly attached, and the eggs are of a shining white sometimes tinged with pink, and sparsely spotted with dark purple. On the Continent it is a well-known if not an abundant bird, and its range in summer extends so far to the east as Irkutsk, while in winter it is found in Natal and Damaraland. In India it is replaced by a closely allied form, 0. kundoo, chiefly distinguishable by the male possessing a black streak behind as well as in front of the eye; and both in Asia and Africa are several other species more or less resembling 0. galbula, but some depart considerably from that type, assuming a black head, or even a glowing crimson instead of the ordinary yellow colouring, while others again remain constant to the dingy type of plumage which characterizes the female of the more normal form. Among these last are the aberrant species of the group Mimetes or Mimeta, belonging to the Australian Region, respecting which Mr Wallace pointed out, first in the Zoological Society’s Proceedings (1863, pp. 26-28), and afterwards in his Malay Archipelago (ii. pp. 150-153), the very curious facts—as yet only explicable on the theory of “mimicry ”—of which mention has already been made (Honey-eater, vol. xii. p. 139). It is a singular circumstance that this group Mimeta first received its name from Captain King {Survey &c. of Australia, ii. p. 417) under the belief that the birds composing it belonged to the Family Meliphagidae, which had assumed the appearance of Orioles, whereas Mr Wallace’s investigations tend to show that the imitation (unconscious, of course) is - on the part of the latter. The external similarity of the Mimeta and the Tropidorhynchus of the island of Bouru, one of the Moluccas, is perfectly wonderful, and has again and again deceived some of the best ornithologists, though the birds are structurally far apart. Another genus which has been referred to the Oriolidae, and may here be mentioned, is Sphecotheres, peculiar to the Australian Region, and distinguishable from the more normal Orioles by a bare space round the eye.
