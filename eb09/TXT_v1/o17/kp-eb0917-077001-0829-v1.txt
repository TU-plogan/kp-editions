OLYMPIAS, the ambitious and energetic wife of Philip II., king of Macedonia, and the mother of Alexander III., commonly called The Great, was daughter of Neoptolemus I., king of Epirus, who claimed to be descended from Pyrrhus, son of Achilles. Plutarch tells us that it was while being initiated in the Samothracian mysteries, in which she was an enthusiastic participant, that Philip, still very young, fell in love with her. The marriage took place in 359 B.c., shortly after his accession, and Alexander was born in 356. There was also a daughter, named Cleopatra. The fickleness of Philip and the vehement and jealous temper of Olympias led to a growing estrangement, which became complete when Philip married a second wife, Cleopatra, in 337. Alexander, who strongly sided with his mother, withdrew, along with her, into Epirus, whence they both returned in the following year, after the assassination of Philip, which Olympias is said to have countenanced. During the absence of Alexander, with whom she had regular correspondence on public as well as domestic affairs, she had great influence in Macedonia, and by her arrogance and ambition gave great trouble to Antipater,—so great, indeed, that on the death of her son (323) she found it prudent to withdraw into Epirus.

Here she remained until 317, when, allying herself with Polysperchon, by whom her old enemy had been succeeded in 319, she took the field with an Epirote army; the opposing troops at once declared in her favour, and for a short period Olympias was mistress of Macedonia. Cassander, Antipater’s son, speedily, however, returned from the Peloponnesus, and, after an obstinate siege, compelled the surrender of Pydna, where she had taken refuge. One of the terms of the capitulation had been that her life should be spared; but this did not protect her against trial for numerous and cruel executions (including that of Nicanor, Cassander’s brother) of which she had been guilty during her short lease of power. Condemned without a hearing, she was put to death tumultuously by the friends of those whom she had slain, and Cassander is said to have denied her remains the rites of burial (316).
