OLDHAM, a municipal and parliamentary borough and important manufacturing town of south-east Lancashire, is situated on an eminence near the source of the Medlock, at the junction of several railway lines, 6 miles north-east of Manchester. By the Oldham canal it has water-communication with Manchester, Ashton, Stockport, and Rochdale. Although consisting chiefly of monotonous rows of workmen’s houses, interspersed with numerous immense factories and workshops, Oldham has some good [9:17:759] streets and a number of imposing public buildings. Among these the principal are the town-hall, a fine structure in the Grecian style, with a tetrastyle portico copied from the Ionic temple of Ceres near Athens, enlarged by a new wing erected in 1880 at a cost of £24,000, the nucleus of much more extensive municipal buildings; the lyceum, in the Italian style, erected in 1854 and enlarged in 1880; the public baths, erected in 1854—partly by money raised for a memorial to Sir Robert Peel—and enlarged in 1880; the workmen’s hall, erected in 1844 and enlarged in 1854; the Werneth mechanics’ institute, 1867; the infirmary, erected in 1870 and enlarged in 1877; and the new post-office, 1877. There is a grammar school, founded in 1611; but a more important educational endowment is the blue-coat school, for which a sum of £40,000 was left in 1808. On account of a legal dispute the money was allowed to accumulate for over twenty years, so that the school started with an endowment of £100,000. The town possesses a commodious general market, opened in 1856, and also a fish market, opened in 1873. Both the gasworks and waterworks have since 1853 been in the hands of the corporation. Additional reservoirs have been added to meet the increasing needs of the town, their total capacity being now 1,233,500,000 gallons. During the cotton famine occupation was given to many of the distressed operatives in laying out 72 acres as a public park, which, under the name of the Alexandra Park, was opened in 1865, at a cost of about £37,000. The town, which is one of the most important seats of the cotton manufacture in the world, owes its prosperity in great part to its situation on the edge of the Lancashire coal-field, where the mineral is very easily wrought. There are many valuable seams of coal in the immediate neighbourhood of the town, those in highest repute being the Black Mine and Bent Mine coals. From entries in the church registers it would appear that linens were manufactured in Oldham as early as 1630. Watermills were introduced in 1770, and with the adoption of Arkwright’s inventions the cotton industry spread with great rapidity. After the introduction of steam power the town, owing to its proximity to the coal-beds, soon assumed a leading place in the manufacture of cotton. The total number of persons engaged in the industry is over 30,000, the annual consumption of cotton being over 700,000 bales, or about one-fourth of the whole quantity of cotton imported into the United Kingdom. The principal manufactures are fustians, velvets, cords, hats, shirtings, sheetings, and nankeens. There are also large foundries and mill and cotton machinery works, the most extensive establishment being that of Platt and Co. The gas-meters made at Oldham have a high reputation, and there are also several large manufactories of sewing-machines. The town is divided into eight wards, and is governed by a mayor, eight aidermen, and twenty-four councillors. The area of the township is coextensive with that of the municipal borough, and comprehends 4730 acres, of which 13 are water. The parliamentary borough has an area of 12,310 acres, and, in addition to Oldham, includes the townships of Crompton, Royton, and Chadderton, and part of the parish of Ashton-under-Lyne. Within the present century the growth of Oldham has been very rapid. In 1714 the population numbered only 1750, which in 1801 had increased to 12,024, in 1841 to 42,595, in 1861 to 72,333, in 1871 to 82,633, and in 1881 to 111,343. The population of the parliamentary borough in 1871 was 113,100, and in 1881 it was 152,513.

The name Oldham is of Saxon origin. A Roman road, of which some traces are still left, passes through the township, but it does not appear to have been a Roman station. It is not mentioned in Domesday; but in the reign of Henry III. Alwardus de Aidholme is referred to as holding “two bovats of land in Vernet (Werneth).” A daughter and co-heiress of this Alwardus conveyed Werneth Hall and its manor to the Cudworths, a branch of the Yorkshire family, with whom it remained till the early part of last century. From the Oldhams was descended Hugh Oldham, who died bishop of Exeter in 1519. In 1826 the town was placed under the care of a board of commissioners, and in 1849 it received municipal government. Since 1832 it has returned two members to parliament.
