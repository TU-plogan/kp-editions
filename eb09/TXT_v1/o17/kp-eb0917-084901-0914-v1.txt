ORLEANS, a city of France, chief town of the department of Loiret, lies on the right bank of the Loire, 75 miles south-south-west of Paris. At Les Aubrais, a mile to the north, is one of the chief railway junctions in the country. Besides the Paris and Orleans Railway, which there divides into two main lines—a western to Nantes and Bordeaux via Tours, and a southern to Bourges and Toulouse via Vierzon—branches leave Les Aubrais eastwards for Pithiviers, Châlons-sur-Marne, and Gien, northwest for Châteaudun and Rouen. The whole town of Orleans is clustered together on the right bank of the river and surrounded by fine boulevards, beyond which it sends out suburbs along the various roads. With the suburb of St Marceau on the left bank it is connected by a handsome stone bridge (1092 feet long and 51 feet wide) of nine arches, erected in the 18th century. Farther up is the railway bridge. The river is canalized on the right, and serves as a continuation of the Orleans Canal, which unites the Loire with the Seine by the canal of the Loing. Owing to its position on the northmost point of the Loire Orleans has long been the centre of communication between the Loire basin and Paris. Wines, grain, wool, and trees for planting are the main products of the surrounding districts and the commercial staples of the city, which, while devoted rather to trade than to manufactures, has establishments for the making of vinegar, blankets, hosiery, worsted, the so-called Rheims biscuits, confectionery, preserved foods, pins, pottery, boilers, paper, cardboard, soap, and dressed skins. The chief interest of the place, however, lies in its public buildings and the historical events of which it has been the scene. Proceeding from the railway station to the bridge over the Loire, the visitor crosses Orleans from north to south and passes through the Place du Martroi, the heart of the city. In the middle of the square stands an equestrian statue of Joan of Arc, 30 feet high, in bronze, resting on a granite pedestal surrounded by bas-reliefs representing the leading episodes in the life of the heroine. In 1855 it took the place of an older statue executed in the beginning of the century, which was then transferred to the left bank of the Loire at the end of the bridge, a few paces from the spot where a simple cross marks the site of the Fort des Toumelles captured by Joan of Arc on 7th May 1429. From the Place du Martroi, the Rue Jeanne d’Arc leads to the cathedral of Ste Croix. This church, commenced in 1287, was burned by the Huguenots in 1567 before its completion. Henry IV., in 1601, laid the first stone of the new structure, the building of which has continued until now. It is a Gothic cathedral on a large scale, consisting of a vestibule, a nave with double aisles, a corresponding choir, a transept, and an apse. Its length is 482 feet, its greatest width 206, and the height of the central vaults 108 feet. The west front has two flat-topped towers each of three stories, of which the first is square, the second octagonal, and the third cylindrical. The whole front is Gothic, but was designed and constructed in the 18th century and exhibits all the defects of the period. A central spire 328 feet high, on the other hand, raised about twenty-five years ago, recalls the pure ogival style of the 13th century. In the interior the choir chapels and the apse, dating from the original erection of the building, are worthy of note. In the episcopal palace and the great seminary are several remarkable pictures and pieces of wood-carving; and the latter building has a crypt which some antiquaries hold to belong to the 6th century, The church of St Aignan, said to have been founded by the son of Constantine, and often rebuilt, contains in a gilded and carved wooden shrine the remains .of its patron saint, who occupied the [9:17:850] see of Orleans at the time of Attila’s invasion. The crypt dates from the reign of Robert the Pious (the beginning of the 11th century). The once beautiful sculpture of the exterior has been altogether ruined; the interior has been restored, but not in keeping with the original style. A third church, St Euverte, consecrated to one of the oldest bishops of Orleans (oδ. 391), is an early Gothic building dating from the 12th century. To the west of Rue Royale stand the church of St Paul, whose façade and isolated tower both bear fine features of Renaissance work, and Notre Dame de Recouvrance, rebuilt between 1517 and 1519 in the Renaissance style and dedicated to the memory of the deliverance of the city. The Hôtel de Ville, built in 1530, was formerly the residence of the governors of Orleans, and was occupied by the kings and queens of France from Francis II. to Henry IV. The front of the building, with its different coloured bricks, its balconies supported by caryatides attributed to Jean Goujon, its gable-ends, and its windows, recalls the Flemish style. There are several niches with statues. Beneath, between the double flight of steps leading up to the entrance, stands a bronze reproduction of the statue of Joan of Arc, a masterpiece of the princess Mary of Orleans, which is preserved in the Versailles museum. The richly-decorated apartments of the first story contain paintings, interesting chimneys, and a bronze statuette (also by the princess Mary) representing Joan of Arc mounted on a caparisoned horse and clothed in the garb of the knights of the 15th century. The great hall in which it is placed also possesses a copy of Ingres’s picture, “Joan of Arc at the Consecration of Charles VIL,” and a plaster model of the Bigot tower at Rouen,where the heroine was imprisoned; the chimney is decorated with three bas-reliefs of Domremy, Orleans, and Rheims, all associated with her life. The historical museum at Orleans is one of the most interesting of provincial collections; a special section consists of all the objects—tapestries, banners, pictures, statuettes—relating to Joan, as well as of arms or bullets found on the battle-field of Patay; and the numismatic, mediaeval, and Renaissance departments, and the collection of ancient vases, are all of great value. The city also possesses a separate picture gallery, a sculpture gallery, a natural history museum, and four learned societies. The public library (50,000 volumes) comprises among its manuscripts a number dating from the 7 th century, and obtained in most cases from St Benoît on the Loire. At Orleans the general hospital has incorporated the almshouse for the aged, the orphan asylum, the lunatic asylum, the Hôtel Dieu, the maternity hospital, and the preparatory school of medicine and pharmacy. It is one of the finest institutions in France. In the corn-exchange is embodied a vast cloister formed by 16th-century arcades, once belonging to the old cemetery. Among the private houses those of Agnes Sorel and Francis I., and that occupied by Joan of Arc during the siege of 1429, are of historical interest. The “White Tower” is the last representative of the towers rendered famous by that siege. Near the Quai du Châtelet a stretch of wall, dating at least from the 9th century, was discovered some years ago; it is supposed to be a portion of the châtelet or tète du pont of the Roman period. A statue has been erected in front of the town-house to the jurisconsult Pothier, one of the most illustrious of the natives of Orleans. The anniversary of Joan of Arc is celebrated every year with great pomp. After the English had raised the siege the popular enthusiasm improvised a procession, which marched with singing of hymns to the cathedral of St Paul; and the ceremony is still repeated on the first days of May by the clergy and the civil and military functionaries. The population of Orleans is 57,264.

Whether Genabum is to be identified with Orleans or with Gien is matter of dispute; but Aurelianum appears as a flourishing town in the 5th century. St Aignan (as already mentioned) was bishop when, in 451, it was vainly besieged by Attila. Clovis got possession of the city in 498, and in 511 held there the first council assembled in

France. Though the dignity which it then obtained, of being the capital of a separate kingdom, was lost by its union with that of Paris in 613, Orleans remained during all the mediaeval period one of the first cities of the French monarchy; several of the kings dwelt within its walls, or were consecrated in its cathedral; it had a royal mint, was the seat of councils, and obtained for its schools the name of university (1305), and for its soldiery an equal standing with those of Paris. It became the apanage of one of the first princes of the blood under Philip of Valois, who made it a duchy for his second son, and under Charles VI., who bestowed the duchy on his brother Louis. After the assassination of this last prince by Jean sans Peur, duke of Burgundy (1407), the people of Orleans sided resolutely with the Armagnacs, and in this way brought upon themselves the attacks of the Burgundians and the English. Joan of Arc, having entered the beleaguered city on 29th April 1429, effected the raising of the siege by 7th May by means of an attack on the Fort des Tournelles, in the course of which she was wounded. After the Amboise conspiracy (1560) the States-General were convoked at Orleans, where Francis II. died. In 1562 it became the headquarters of Condé, the Protestant commander[9:17:851]-in-chief, and the duke of Guise was assassinated on his way to besiege it. Huguenot and Leaguer were alternately in possession till Henry IV. came in person to take it in 1594. The duchy of Orleans, united to the crown by Louis XII., was again detached in favour of Gaston, brother of Louis XIII., and afterwards for Philip, brother of Louis XIV. and founder of the present house of Orleans. Since 1789 the title “duke of Orleans” has been purely honorary. During the Revolution the city suffered from the sanguinary excesses of Barere and Collot d’Herbois. It was occupied by the Prussians in 1815 and in 1870. As the centre of the preparations made by the Government of the National Defence for raising the siege of Paris, it bore the brunt of numerous battles fought in its vicinity, and of the hostile occupation to which they led.
