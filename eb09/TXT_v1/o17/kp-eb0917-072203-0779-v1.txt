OCTOBER, the eighth month of the old Roman year, which began in spring. By the Julian arrangement, while retaining its old name, it became the tenth month, and had thirty-one days assigned to it. The meditrinalia, when a libation of new wine was made in honour of Meditrina, were celebrated on the 11 th, the faunalia on the 13th, and the equiria, when the “equus October” was sacrificed to Mars in the Campus Martius, on the 15th. The principal ecclesiastical feasts in October are those of St Luke on the 18th and of St Simon and St Jude on the 28th. By the Slavs this is called “yellow month,” from the fading of the leaf; to the Anglo-Saxons it was known as Winter-fylleth, because at this full moon (fylleth) winter was supposed to begin. It corresponds partly to the Vendémiaire and partly to the Brumaire of the first French republic.
