ODDFELLOWS, a name adopted by the members of certain social institutions having mystic signs of recogni tion, initiatory rites and ceremonies, and various grades of dignity and honour. The objects the associations have in view are purely social and benevolent; the sphere of their operations is confined wholly to their own members, and secrecy is enjoined in regard to all benevolent acts. As in the case of most other institutions of a similar kind, a claim of venerable antiquity has been set up for the order of Oddfellows,—the most common account of its origin ascribing it to the Jewish legion under Titus, who, it is asserted, received from that emperor its first charter written on a golden tablet. Statements even more improbable and fantastic have been made regarding its foundation, but Oddfellows themselves now generally admit that the institution cannot be traced to an earlier period than the first half of the 18th century, and explain the name as adopted at a time when the severance into sects and classes was so wide that persons aiming at social union and mutual help were a marked exception to the general rule. Mention is made by Defoe of the society of Oddfellows, but the oldest lodge of which the name has been handed down is the Loyal Aristarcus, No. 9, which met in 1745 “at the Oakley Arms, Borough of Southwark; Globe Tavern, Hatton Garden; or the Boar’s Head in Smithfield, as the noble master may direct.” The earliest lodges were supported by each member and visitor paying a penny to the secretary on entering the lodge, and special sums were voted to any brother in need. If out of work he was supplied with a card and funds to reach the next lodge, and he went from lodge to lodge until he found employment. Now there is a regular system of periodical dues and collections, with occasional fees proportioned to the dignities or degrees conferred in the lodges. At first each lodge was practically independent of the others, and had its own special rules and government, but a close bond of unity gradually grew up between the large majority of the lodges until they adopted a definite common ritual and became confederated under the name of the Patriotic Order. Towards the end of the century many of the lodges were broken up by State prosecutions on the suspicion that their purposes were “seditious,” but the society, changing its name and location, continued to exist in a sort of moribund condition, as the Union Order of Oddfellows, until in 1809 several of the members endeavoured to resuscitate its dormant energies. Finding, however, that it was impossible to excite an interest in anything higher than convivial meetings, they in 1813, at a convention in Manchester, formally seceded from the Union Order and formed the Independent Order of Oddfellows, Manchester Unity, which increased with enormous rapidity, and now overshadows all the minor societies in England. According to the Oddfellows' Magazine for October 1883, the membership of the order in 1834 was 32,832, which in 1837 had increased to 80,570 and in 1845 to 239,374, while in January 1883 the numbers had risen to 565,368, the lodges amounting to 4251. In 1881 the receipts were £761,695, the payments £531,335, and the capital £5,291,891. In 1850 the society was legalized and recognized by the state in a corporate capacity. The Oddfellows' Magazine, issued by the society, and up to October 1883 published quarterly, now appears monthly. In England there are a large number of minor orders of Oddfellows, which either existed before the Manchester Unity, have seceded from it, or have had an independent origin. Among them are the Ancient Independent Order or Kent Unity, Woolwich, 1805, revived 1861; the Nottingham Ancient Imperial Order, 1812; the London Unity, 1820; the Boston Unity, 1832; the Kingston Unity, 1840; the Norfolk and Norwich Unity, 1849; and the Derby Midland United Order, 1856.

Oddfellowship was introduced into the United States [9:17:724] from the Manchester Unity in 1819, and the grand lodge of Maryland and the United States was constituted 2 2d February 1821. At first the progress of the order was slow, but, as may be supposed from the social characteristics and proclivities of the Americans, as soon as it had gained a firm hold its principles spread with great rapidity, and it now rivals in membership and influence the Manchester Unity, from which it severed its connexion in 1842. In 1843 it issued a dispensation for opening the Prince of Wales Lodge No. 1 at Montreal, Canada. The American society, including Canada and the United States, has its headquarters at Baltimore. In 1882 the membership was said to be 500,000, the income 6,000,000 dollars, and the annual sum disbursed for the relief of members of the order 2,000,000 dollars. Organizations, connected either with the United States or England, have been founded in Germany, Switzerland, Gibraltar and Malta, Australia, New Zealand, the Fiji Islands, the Hawaiian Islands, South Africa, South America, the West Indies, and Barbados.

The rules of the different societies, various song-books, and a number of minor books on Oddfellowship have been published, but the most complete and trustworthy account of the institution is that in The Complete Manual of Oddfellowship, its History, Principles, Ceremonies, and Symbolism, privately printed, 1879.
