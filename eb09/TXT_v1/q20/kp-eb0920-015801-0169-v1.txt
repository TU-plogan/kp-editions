QUARANTINE, Cattle. The importation of foreign cattle into England was forbidden at a comparatively early period. Thus 18 Car. II. c. 2 made such importation a common nuisance. In 1869 previous legislation was consolidated by the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Act, 1869, which applied to the United Kingdom. In 1878 this Act was repealed and new provisions made by the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Act, 1878, amended by two Acts passed in 1884. By this Act the privy council is empowered to make from time to time such general or special orders as they think fit for prohibiting the landing of animals brought from a foreign country. Foreign animals can be landed only at certain ports named by the privy council, and must be slaughtered on landing, unless they are intended for exhibition or other exceptional purposes, in which case they are subject to the quarantine rules given in the fifth schedule of the Act. In the United States the importation of neat cattle is forbidden by the Act of 1883, c. 121, except as allowed by the secretary of the treasury. The appropriation Acts since 1881 have made annual grants of sums of $50,000 to enable the secretary of the treasury to cooperate with State and municipal authorities in making regulations for the establishment of cattle quarantine stations. The cattle quarantine system of Canada is said to be one of the most perfect existing. In 1876 a quarantine of eight days was established, raised to ninety days in 1879. The chief Canadian Act is 42 Vict. c. 23. The effect of the Canadian precautions has been that English orders in council have allowed Canadian cattle to be imported into the United Kingdom for breeding and exhibition purposes.
