QUOITS. This pastime resembles the ancient discusthrowing which formed one of the five games of the Greek pentathlon (see Discus, vol. vii. p. 258). The modern quoit, however, is a far lighter missile,-and consists of a circular iron ring to be thrown or pitched in play at a fixed object. This ring is flattened, having a thick inner edge and thin outer one. The latter is slightly indented at a given spot to receive the tip of the player’s forefinger without cutting it. There is no limit to the weight of a quoit, but this should be specified before commencing a match. The diameter is restricted to 8 inches over all. Two iron pins, called “hobs,” are driven into the ground at a certain distance apart, generally 19 yards. There may be one or more players a side, and each has two quoits. These he may throw successively; or else each player throws one only at a time and a second round follows in the same order, as may have been agreed on. The throwing takes place the reverse way after each round. A player grasps the quoit with his forefinger along the outer edge and the tip in the dent, holding the two surfaces between the thumb and the other fingers. In pitching, a slight rotary motion is imparted by the wrist, in order that the quoit may pass smoothly and horizontally through the air, and alight flat. Each player attempts to make his quoit pitch on the hob or pin so that the head of the latter passes through the circular opening in the centre of the missile. Such a success is termed a “ringer,” and two is scored. Quoits of opposite sides alighting equidistant from the pin do not score at all. If a player has both his quoits nearer the pin than any of his opponents he scores two; while if only one be nearer he is entitled to count one to his credit. The game is popular in many country towns and villages of England and in the mining districts of the Midlands and Lancashire. The rules were drawn up as follows in 1869 :—

1. That the distance from pin to pin be 19 yards, and that the player stand level with the pin, and deliver his quoit with the first step. 2. That no quoit be allowed which measures more than 8 inches external diameter, but the weight may be unlimited. 3. That the pins be 1 inch above the clay. 4. That all measurements be taken from any visible part of the pin to the nearest visible part of the quoit. No clay or quoit to be disturbed. 5. That no quoit count unless fairly delivered in the clay free from the outer rim, and that no quoit on its back count unless it holds clay or is knocked out by another quoit. That no quoit rolling on the clay count unless it first strikes another quoit or the pin. 6. That each player deliver his quoits in succession, his opponent then following. 7. That an umpire be appointed, and in all cases of dispute his decision be final.
