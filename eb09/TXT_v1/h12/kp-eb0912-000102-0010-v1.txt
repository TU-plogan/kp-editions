HIRSCHAU, or Hirsau, a village within the amt of Calw and the circle of Schwarzwald, Würtemberg, on the Nagold, is a station on the Pforzheim-Horb Railway, and has paper and other factories. Population 800. It owes its origin and its historical interest to the now ruinous Benedictine monastery in the neighbourhood, the Monasterium Hirsaugiense, at one period one of the most famous in Europe. It was founded in 830 or 832 by Count Erlafried of Calw, at the instigation of his son, Bishop Notting of Vercelli, who enriched it with, among other treasures, the body of St Aurelius. Its first occupants (838) were a colony of fifteen monks from Fulda, disciples of Hrabanus Maurus and Walafridus Strabus, headed by the abbot Liudebert. During about a century and a half, under the fostering care of the counts of Calw, it enjoyed great prosperity, and became an important seat of learning; but towards the end of the 10th century the ravages of the pestilence combined with the rapacity of its patrons, and the selfishness and immorality of its inmates, to bring it to the lowest ebb. After it had been desolate and in ruins for upwards of sixty years it was rebuilt in 1059, and under Abbot William “der Selige” (1069-1091) more than regained its former splendour. By his Constitutiones Hirsaugienses, a sort of new religious order, Ordo Hirsau-giensis, was formed, of which the rule was afterwards adopted by many monastic establishments throughout Germany, such as those of Blaubeuren, Erfurt, and Schaffhausen. The friend and correspondent of Pope Gregory VII., and of Anselm of Canterbury, he took active part in the politico-ecclesiastical controversies of his time; while a treatise from his pen, De Musica et Tonis, as well as the Philosophicarum et astronomicarum institutionum libri III., bears witness to his interest in science and philosophy. About the end of the 12th century the material and moral welfare of Hirschau was again very perceptibly on the decline; and it never afterwards again rose into importance. In consequence of the Reformation it was secularized in 1558; in 1692 it was laid in ruins by the French. The Chronicoη Hirsaugiense, or, as in the later edition it is called, Annales Hirsaugienses of Trithemius (Basel, 1559; St Gall, 1690), is, although containing much that is merely legendary, an important source of information, not only on the affairs of this monastery, but also on the early history of Germany. The Codex Hirsau-giensis was printed at Stuttgart in 1844. See Christmann, Geschichte des Klosters Hirschau (1782); Steck, Das Kloster Hirschau (1844); Wolff, “Job. Trithemius u. die älteste Geschichte des Klosters Hirschau,” in the Württembergisches Jahrbuch for 1863; and Helmsdörfer, Forschungen zur Geschichte des Abts Wilhelm von Hirschau (Göttingen, 1874).
