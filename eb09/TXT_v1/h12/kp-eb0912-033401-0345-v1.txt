HUELVA, one of the eight provinces into which Andalucia has since 1833 been divided, is bounded on the N. by Badajoz, on the E. by Seville, on the S. and S.W. by the Atlantic, and on the W. by Portugal, and has an area of 4122 square miles. With the exception of its south-east angle, where the province merges into the flat waste lands known as Las Marismas of the Guadalquivir, Huelva presents throughout its entire extent an agreeably varied surface, being traversed in a south-westerly direction by the western spurs of the Sierra Morena. The principal streams are the Odiel and the Tinto, which both fall into the Atlantic by navigable rias or estuaries; the Malagon, the Chanza, the Murtiga, which belong to the Guadiana system, and the Huelva, belonging to that of the Guadalquivir, also take their rise in this province. Iron pyrites and manganese occur in the Sierra in considerable quantities; among many important mines, which are at present inactive, may be mentioned Lagunazo, Carpio, Lapilla, San Miguel, Mυnterubio, Sotiel, Coronada, San Telmo, Cueva de la Mora, and Toya. Those of Rio Tinto, situated to the north-east of Valverde del Camino, and near the source of the river Tinto, are ascertained to have been known to the Phoenicians and Romans. They are at present wrought by an Anglo-German company; in 1876 the output amounted to 329,305 tons; the number of men employed approached 5000. The mines of Tharsis and Calanas, and of Buitron and Poderosa, are of corresponding importance. Saline and other mineral springs are also of frequent occurrence in the province. The soil possesses great fertility, and produces excellent pasturage; among the exports are included, besides corkwood and esparto, oranges, grapes, figs, oil, and wine. The only railways at present in the province are those constructed for mineral traffic between Rio Tinto mines and Huelva (52 miles), between Tharsis and Huelva (30 miles), and between Buitron and Poderosa and San Juan del Puerto at the head of the Tinto estuary (44 miles); but a line from Huelva to Seville is at present in course of construction. The towns of chief interest and importance in the province are, besides Huelva the capital, Ayamonte, Aracena, Valverde, La Palma, Niebla, and Moguer, with Palos its harbour. The population in 1877 was 210,641.

Huelva, the capital of the above province, is situated on the western shore of the triangular peninsula formed by the estuaries of the Odiel and Tinto, 53 miles west by south of Seville. Its streets are wide and well built, and among the public edifices may be mentioned two parish churches, an Academia Onubense, two hospitals, and a theatre. The town has a considerable coasting trade in the produce of the province, and there is a limited manufacture of esparto floor mattings; others of the inhabitants find employment in the sardine, tunny, and bonito fisheries of the neighbourhood. The chief source of the growing prosperity of Huelva, however, is in connexion with the extensive exportation of ore from the Tharsis and Rio Tinto mines. The total quantity of pyrites shipped amounted in 1872 to 261,373 tons, and in 1876 had risen to 442,201 tons (value £552,506). The exportation of manganese, however, which in 1868 amounted to 41,000 tons, did not in 1876 exceed 6972 tons (value £41,813); 7178 tons of precipitate of copper were valued at £279,956. For the accommodation of the Rio Tinto mineral traffic there is a fine pier 2682 feet long, 65∣ feet wide, and 43∣ feet above the level of the river at high-water, at which vessels of 2000 tons can be moored and loaded with ease. In 1876 the total number of vessels entering the port was 1409, with a tonnage of 278,594; of these 512 were British, with a tonnage of 237,610. The total imports amounted to £315,856; from Great Britain, £149,939. Total exports £918,506; to Great Britain, £833.968. Population 13,174 (1877).

Huelva is usually identified with the Onuba Aestuaria of Ptolemy, the Önoba or Onuba of Strabo, Mela, and the numismatists, described in the Antonine Itinerary as situated on the estuary of the river Luxia, on the road from the mouth of the Anas to Augusta Emerita. There still exist vestiges of a Roman aqueduct, which, however, are fast disappearing. The town is alleged to have been founded by the Phoenicians; the name Welba or Wuelba is due to the Moors.
