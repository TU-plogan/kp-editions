HOLY ISLAND, or Lindisfarne, an irregularly shaped island in the North Sea, 10 miles S.S.E. of Berwick, and 2 miles from the coast of Northumberland, in which county it is included. It is joined to the mainland at low water by flat sands, over which a track, marked by wooden posts and practicable for vehicles, leads to the island. The parish of Holy Island includes Fenham and Goswick townships on the mainland, and had in 1871 a population of 876. The area of the island is about 1000 acres, of which about 400 are under cultivation, producing abundant crops of barley, oats, turnips, carrots, and potatoes. The northern part consists chiefly of barren sand-hills on which rabbits and eider-ducks breed. There are several fresh springs on the island, and in the north-east is a lake of 6 acres. Lime, quarried and burned on the island, is exported chiefly to Dundee. Four vessels are engaged in the trade. Rabbits, fish, cattle, corn, and potatoes are also exported. At the south-west angle is the little fishing village, formerly much larger, which is now a favourite summer watering-place. Salmon, cod, haddocks, crabs, lobsters, and herrings are the principal fish taken. There are two churches and a national school on the island. The population of the island proper in 1871 was 553.

Holy Island, derives its name from a monastery founded on it in 635 by Oswald, king of Northumbria, which, after being plundered and destroyed by the Danes in the three preceding centuries, was restored by the Normans in 1082 as a cell of the Benedictine monastery at Durham. Its ruins, still extensive and now carefully preserved, justify Scott’s description of it as a “solemn, huge, and dark-red pile.” Holy Island was also an episcopal see (finally transferred to Durham), of which St Cuthbert was consecrated bishop in 685. The castle, situated to the east of the village, on a basaltic rock about 90 feet high, dates from a very early period. In 1646 it was garrisoned by parliament, and in 1715 an abortive attempt was made by two Jacobites to hold it for the Pretender.
