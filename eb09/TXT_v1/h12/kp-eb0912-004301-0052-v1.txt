HODY, Humphrey (1659-1706), an English divine, was born at Odcombe in Somersetshire in 1659. In 1676 he entered Wadham College, Oxford, of which, having proceeded M.A. in 1682, he became fellow in 1684. Previously he had published in 1680 Dissertatio contra Historiam Aristeae de LXX. Interpretibus, in which he showed that the so-called letter of Aristeas, containing an account of the production of the Septuagint, was the late forgery of a Hellenist Jew originally circulated to lend authority to that version. The dissertation was generally regarded as conclusive, although Vossius published an angry and scurrilous reply to it in the appendix to his edition of Pomponius Mela. In 1689 Hody wrote the “Prolegomena” to the chronicle of John Malala, published at Oxford in 1691. The following year he became chaplain to Stillingfleet, bishop of Worcester, and, on account of his supporting the ruling party in a controversy with Dodwell regarding the nonconforming bishops, he was appointed chaplain to Archbishop Tillotson, an office which he continued to hold under Tenison. In 1698 he was appointed regius, professor of Greek in the university of Oxford, and in 1704 he was promoted to the archdeaconry of Oxford. In 1701 he published History of Englhh Councils and Convocations, and in 1704 in four volumes De Bibliorum textis originalibus, in which he included his original work on the Septuagint, and published a reply to the attack of Vossius. He died 20th January 1706. A work, De Groecis Illustribus, which he left in manuscript, was published in 1742 by Dr Jebb, who prefixed to it a Latin dissertation.
