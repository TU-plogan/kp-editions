HOUWAERT, Jean Baptista (1533-1599), Flemish poet, was the most prominent of the rhetoricians of his day. He held the title of “Counsellor and Master in Ordinary of the Exchequer to the Dukedom of Brabant.” As a patriot and a friend of the prince of Orange he played a prominent part in the revolution of the Low Countriesagainst Spain, and when the prince entered Brussels victoriously, September 23, 1577, Houwaert met him in pomp at the head of the two chambers of rhetoric, the “Book” and the “Garland of Mary.” He died at Brussels, March 11,1599.

His existiug works are of an allegorical and highly fantastic order, and prove him to have been a disciple of Matthys de Castelyn. He wrote the Commerce of Anιorosity (Den Handel der Amourens-heyt), consisting of four plays or moralities in verse, namely, Aeneas and Dido, Narcissus awl Echo, Mars and Venus, and Le ιnder and Hero. His other principal poem is a didactic epic on the vanity of human love, Pegasides Pleyn, of den Lusthof der Macchden. These and other laborious and exemplary pieces gained him the title of the “Homer of Brabant” from his contemporaries. Houwaert prided himself on the introduction of classical and mythological names into his poems, but he had little or nothing of the antique spirit.
