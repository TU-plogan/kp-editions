HUMMEL, Johann Nepomuk (1778-1837), a celebrated composer and pianist, was born November 14, 1778, at Pressburg, in Hungary, and received his first artistic train ing from his father, himself a musician in a humble way. In 1785 the latter received an appointment as conductor of the orchestra at the theatre of Schikaneder, the friend of Mozart and the librettist of the Magic Flute. It was in this way that young Hummel became acquainted with the great composer, who took a great fancy to him, and even invited him to his house for a considerable period. During two years Hummel received the invaluable instructions of Mozart, after which he set out with his father on an artistic tour through Germany, England, and other countries, his clever playing winning for the boy the admiration of amateurs. After his return to Vienna he completed his studies under Albrechtsberger, the celebrated contrapuntist, and Haydn, and for a number of years devoted himself exclusively to composition. For eight [9:12:357] years (1803-1811) he held the appointment of orchestral conductor to Prince Eszterhazy, previously occupied by Haydn. It was not till 1816 that he again appeared in public as a pianist, his success being quite extraordinary. His gift of improvisation at the piano was especially admired, but his larger compositions also were highly appreciated, and for a time Hummel was considered one of the leading musicians of an age in which Beethoven was in the zenith of his power. In Prussia, which he visited in 1822, the ovations' offered to him were unprecedented, and other countries—France in 1825 and 1829, Belgium in 1826, and England in 1830 and 1833—added further laurels to his Crown. He died in 1837 at Weimar, where for a long time he had been the musical conductor of the court theatre. His compositions are very numerous, and comprise almost every branch of music. He wrote amongst other things several operas, both tragic and comic, and two grand masses (Op. 80 and 111). Infinitely more important are his compositions for the pianoforte (his two concert! in A minor and B minor, and the sonata in F sharp minor), and his chamber music (the celebrated septet, and several trios, &c.). His experience as a player and teacher of the pianoforte was embodied in his Great Pianoforte School (Vienna), and the excellence of his method is further proved by such pupils as Henselt and Ferdinand Hiller. Both as a composer and as a pianist Hummel continued the traditions of the earlier Viennese school of Mozart and Haydn; his style in both capacities was marked by purity and correctness rather than by passion and imagination. In his compositions there is much that is now antiquated; but to deny him all merit would be as uncritical as were his contemporaries in the opposite direction when they mentioned him in the same breath with Beethoven.
