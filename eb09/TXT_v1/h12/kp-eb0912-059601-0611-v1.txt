HYPATIA (Ύττατια or Ύπάταα), mathematician, philosopher, and finally one of the martyrs of paganism, was the daughter and disciple of the mathematician and philosopher Theon,^[1. For some account of whom see Suidas; compare Fabricius, Bibl. Gr., ix. 178 sqq. (1804). He observed an eclipse in 365.] and was born in Alexandria not earlier than 350 A.D.^[2. The date assigned by Wernsdorf (Diss. Acad. IV. de Hypatia, Wittenberg, 1747). Hoche (Philologus, xv.) gives 370.] After a long period of study (partly, perhaps, in Athens) she became a distinguished lecturer on philosophy in her native town, and ultimately became the recognized head of the Neo-Platonic school there (c. 400). The fascination of her great eloquence (she is said on more than one occasion to have proved an effective advocate in the courts of law), and the charm of a rare modesty and beauty, combined with her remarkable intellectual gifts to attract to her class-room a large number of disciples, over some of whom her influence was very great. Among these was Synesius, who afterwards (c. 410) became bishop of Ptolemais, several of whose letters addressed to her (τy φιλοσοφώ), full of chivalrous admiration and reverence, are still extant (Epp. 10, 15, 16, 33, 80, 124, 153). In the conflicts between the various elements of Alexandrian society which took place shortly after the accession of Cyril to the patriarchate in 412, she became closely identified as counsellor and friend with the prefect Orestes, and in the same degree made herself an object of fear and hatred to the Nitrian monks and the fanatical Christian mob, by whom she was ultimately murdered under circumstances of revolting barbarity (Lent, 415). Socrates has related how she was torn from her chariot, dragged to the Caesareum (then a Christian church), stripped naked, cut to pieces with oyster shells (άστράκονζ αveιλov), and finally burnt piecemeal. Most prominent among the actual perpetrators of the crime was one Γeter, a reader; but there seems little reason to doubt Γheodoret ’ s assertion of Cyril’s real complicity.

Hypatia, according to Suidas, was the author of com mentaries on the mathematician Diophantus and on the Conics of Apollonius of Perga, and also of an astronomical canon. None of these works have come down to our time; but their titles, combined with expressions in the letters of Synesius, who consulted her about the construction of an astrolabe, would seem to indicate that she devoted herself specially to astronomy and mechanics. Of her philosophical opinions nothing is known, except that they shared the general eclectic features of the Alexandrian NeoPlatonism. A Latin letter to Cyril on behalf of Nestorius, which has sometimes been attributed to her, is undoubtedly spurious. It can be read in Baluze. The story of Hypatia appears in a considerably disguised yet still recognizable form in the legend of St Catherine as recorded in the Roman Breviary (Nov. 25), and still more fully in the Martyrologies (see Jameson, Sacred and Legendary Art, p. 467 sqqf

The chief source for the little we know about Hypatia is the account given by Socrates (2Γ. E., vii. 15). The article in Suidas, which Gibbon has characterized as “curious and original,” must be received with some caution. It is on his authority that the somewhat doubtful statement is made that she was the wife of Isidoras the philosopher. She is the subject of an epigram by Palladas in the Anthology (ix. 400; ed. Jacobs). See Menage, Hist. Mul. Phil., p. 52; Fabricius, Bibl. Gr., ix. 187 sqq. ; Wernsdorf, op. cit. ; and the exhaustive monograph of Hoche in Philologus, xv. 435 sqq. (1860). An anonymous work entitled Hypatia,· or the history of a most beautiful, most virtuous, most learned, and every way accomplished lady, who was torn to pieces by the clergy of Alexandria to gratify the pride, emulation, and cruelty of their archbishop Cyril, commonly but undeservedly styled Saint Cyril, was published in London in 1720. The history of Hypatia has also been made the basis of an attractive historical romance by Charles Kingsley (1853).
