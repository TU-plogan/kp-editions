+=====================================================================+


HOLCROFT, Thomas (1745-1809), dramatist and miscellaneous writer, was born 10th December 1745 (old style) in Orange Court, Leicester Fields, London. His father, besides having a shoemaker’s shop, kept riding horses for hire; but he fell into difficulties some six years later, and was reduced ultimately to the necessity of hawking pedlery from village to village. The son accompanied his parents in their tramps, and besides the hardships incident to such a life had often to endure the consequences of his father’s passionate outbreaks of temper, which were, however, succeeded by equally violent transports of affection. In such circumstances he was disposed to regard it as an extraordinary piece of good fortune when he succeeded in procuring the situation of stable boy at Newmarket, an employment in which he manifested great coolness and courage, and acquired high proficiency. Previous to this he had received a pretty good education, and at Newmarket he spent his evenings chiefly in miscellaneous reading and the study of music. Gradually he also succeeded in obtaining a competent knowledge of French, German, and Italian. On the expiry of his term of engagement as stable boy he returned to assist his father, who had again resumed his trade of shoemaker in London; but after marrying in 1765, he procured the office of teacher in a small school in Liverpool. His subsequent career, like his earlier life, was hard and chequered, but it must suffice to state that, after failing in an attempt to set up a private school, he followed for several years the profession of an actor, often at a very meagre salary, and that he was more successful as a dramatist and novelist, but suffered much and frequent anxiety from pecuniary embarrassments and repeated disappointments. He died 23d March 1809 from enlargement of the heart, brought on, it is supposed, by the failure of several of his dramatic pieces. He was a member of the Society for Constitutional Reform, and on that account was, in 1794, indicted of high treason, but acquitted. The best known dramas of Holcroft are Duplicity, The School for Arrogance, The Road to Ruin, and The Deserted Daughter. Among his novels may be mentioned Alwyn and Hugh Trevor. He was also the author of Travels from Hamburg through Westphalia, Holland, and the Netherlands to Paris, and of some volumes of verse, and translated several works from the French and German with considerable elegance. The interest which still attaches to his career is, however, less on account of the intrinsic merit of his literary performances than his peculiarly chequered life and his persevering struggle to elevate himself above the ignorant and sordid condition of his early years. His Memoirs written by himself and continued down to the time of his Death, from his Diary 3 Notes, and· other Papers, by William Hazlitt, appeared in 1815, and has gone into several editions.
