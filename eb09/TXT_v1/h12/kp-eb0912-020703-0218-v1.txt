HORSERADISH (Ger., Meerrettig ; Fr., raifort = racine forte, cran de Bretagne-, Swed., Peppar-rot-, Russ., ehren), Cochlearia Armoracia, L., a perennial plant of the natural order Cruciferoe and tribe Alyssineoe, having radical leaves on long stalks, ovate or oval-oblong, 4 to 6 inches broad, about a foot in length, subcoriaceous, crenate or serrate, and coarsely veined; stem-leaves short-stalked or sessile, elongate, and tapering to their attachment, the lower ones often deeply toothed; flowers, which appear in May and June, ∣-inch in width, in flat-topped panicles, with sepals purplish, and petals white; and fruit a small silicula, which in the climate of England seldom bears seed. The horseradish is indigenous to eastern Europe. Into western Europe and Great Britain, where it is to be met with on waste ground, it was probably introduced from Russia (De Candolle, Géogr. Botan., ii. 654, 1855). It was wild in various parts of England in Gerard’s time. The root, the armoraciae radix of pharmacy, is ∣ to 2 inches or more in diameter, and commonly a foot, sometimes 3 feet in length; the upper part is enlarged into a crown, which is annulated with the scars of fallen leaves; and from the numerous irregular lateral branches are produced vertical stolons, and also adventitious buds, which latter render the plant very difficult of extirpation. From the root of Aconite {g. v., vol. i. p. 98), which has occasionally been mistaken for it, horseradish root differs in being more or less cylindrical from a little below the crown, and in its pale yellowish (or brownish) white hue externally, acrid and penetrating odour when scraped or bruised, and pungent and either sweetish or bitter taste (see Bentley, Pharm. Journ,, 1st ser., xv. 449, 1856). The fresh root yields on distillation with water about Ό5 per cent, of a volatile oil identical with that of black mustard, resulting from the mutual reaction of sinigrin (potassium myronate) and myrosin in the presence of the water. After drying, the root has been found to afford 11 ’ 15 per cent, of ash. Horseradish root is an ingredient in the spiritus armoraciae compositus of the British Pharmacopoeia. It possesses stomachic, diaphoretic, and diuretic properties, and hence is administered in atonic dyspepsia, chronic rheumatism, and dropsies. As a masticatory, or in the form of syrup or infusion, it is used for hoarseness. Gerard speaks of it as anthelmintic and emetic. Externally applied it acts as a rubefacient; and the juice with vinegar is a popular remedy for freckles. In common with other species of Cochlearia, the horseradish was formerly in high repute as an antiscorbutic. The root was, as well as the leaves, taken with food by the Germans in the Middle Ages, whence the old French name for it, moutarde des Allemands-, and Coles, writing in 1657, mentions its use with meat in England, where it is now chiefly employed as a condiment with beef. For the successful cultivation of the horseradish, a light and friable damp soil is the most suitable; this having been trenched 3 feet deep in autumn, and the surface turned down with a liberal supply of farm-yard manure, a second dressing of decomposed manure should in the ensuing spring be dug in 2 feet deep, and pieces of the root 6 inches in length may then be planted a foot apart in narrow trenches. During summer the ground requires to be kept free of weeds; and the application of liquid manure twice or thrice in sufficient quantity to reach the lowest roots is an advantage. When dug the root may be long preserved in good condition by placing it in sand. The horseradish tree is the Moringa pterygosperma of Gartner.
