HORNE, Thomas Hartwell (1780-1862), a well-known writer on Biblical introduction, was born in London on October 20, 1780, and from 1789-95 was educated at Christ’s Hospital, where Coleridge was an elder contemporary. On leaving school, his circumstances not permitting him to proceed to the university, he became clerk to a barrister, but early manifested an unconquerable passion for literary pursuits. When barely twenty years of age he published (1800) A Brief View of the Necessity and Truth of the Christian Revelation, which reached a second edition in 1802. In the years immediately following he became the author of several minor works, and in 1814, having been appointed librarian of the Surrey Institution, he issued his Introduction to the Study of Bibliography. This was followed in 1818 by the work to which he had devoted the best part of many years, the Introduction to the Critical Study of the Holy Scriptures, which rapidly attained a rare popularity, and secured for its author a high and secure place among contemporary scholars. In 1819 he received ordination from the bishop of London, although unpossessed of the customary university degree, and some time afterwards he was appointed to the cure of the united parishes of St Edmund the King and St Nicolas Aeons in London. On the breaking up of the Surrey Institution in 1823, he was appointed (1824) to superintend the classification and publication of the British Museum Catalogue. After the project of making a classed catalogue had been abandoned, he continued to take part in the preparation of the alphabetical catalogue, and his connexion with the museum continued to subsist until 1861, when his infirmities caused him to resign. He died in London on January 26, 1862.

Besides the works already mentioned Horne wrote numerous others of secondary importance, which, as catalogued in Allibone’s Dictionary by himself, exceed forty in number. The Introduction, edited by Ayreand Tregelles, reached a 12th edition in 1869 (4 vols. 8vo); but, owing to the recent rapid advances of critical science, it is now somewhat out of date.
