HUMERUS, Lars Johansson (c. 1642-1674), Swedish poet, more commonly known as Lucidor the Unfortunate, was born in Stockholm about the year 1642. His father, Captain Johan Erichsson, and his mother died in his infancy; in 1656 he was entered as a student of the university of Upsala, at the expense of his patron, Admiral Wrangel, whose sons he afterwards conducted through Germany, Italy, France, England, and Holland, and back to Sweden in the autumn of 1668. He returned to Upsala, received a professorship, and took the pseudonym of Lucidor, which he employed until his death. He stayed but one year at Upsala, and in the winter of 1669 settled again in Stockholm. There one of his poems gave offence to the Government, and he was banished from the city for a year and a day. After his return he lived by his pen, writing odes and epithalamia for the rich burghers. He boasted that he would “live like a poet,” that is to say, with but slight regard for the conventions of society. He was murdered on the night of August 13, 1674, in a cellar at Stockholm, by a drunken soldier, Lieutenant Arvid Storm, with whom he was quarrelling. The body of the poet was carried out into the street; but he only said, “I am stabbed,” and died. Storm was condemned to death for the murder, but was helped by his mother to escape. The stories, so long repeated, of Lucidor’s romantic intrigue with a lady of high rank, and his assassination in her arms, must be relegated to the domain of fable.

Lucidor’s poems were not collected until after his death, when they were published in a volume called Flowers of Helicon. He wrote verses, not merely in Swedish, but also in Latin, French, German, English, Italian, and Dutch. His style is deeply tinged with the prevalent fashion for conceit and tasteless ingenuity, but he possesses force and passion; and he is certainly the most important Swedish writer between Stjernhjelm and Dahlstjerna. The best edition of his works is that published in 1876 by J. Linck, who has dedicated a great deal of time and care to the investigation of the life of Humerus.
