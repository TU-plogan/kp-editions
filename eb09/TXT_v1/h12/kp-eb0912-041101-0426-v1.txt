HUTCHINSON, John (1616-1664), a Puritan soldier, son of Sir Thomas Hutchinson, was born at Nottingham in September 1616. After completing his education at Cambridge University he entered Lincoln’s Inn, but soon became tired both of the study of law and the amusements of London, and was meditating travel on the Continent when he accidentally made the acquaintance of Lucy, daughter of Sir Allan Apsley, whom he married in 1638. After his marriage he returned to Owthorpe, where the study of divinity and politics gradually led to a change of his sentiments in regard to the dispute between the parliament and the king At first he did not find a clear call to join the Parliamentary army, but the efforts of the Royalists to seize him as a disaffected person soon dissipated his neutrality, and, becoming governor of Nottingham, he with great firmness and courage held the town and castle against internal treachery and external attacks till the triumph of the parliamentary cause. Having bet n chosen to represent Nottingham in the new parliament, he became a member of the high court of justice for the trial of the king, and gave his vote for his execution, but, disapproving of the subsequent political conduct of Cromwell, he took no further part in politics during the lifetime of the Protector. After the Restoration he became member for the county of Nottingham, and he was included in the Act of Amnesty passed in favour of certain of the regicides. Subsequently, however, he was arrested upon suspicion of being concerned in a treasonable conspiracy; and after an imprisonment of ten months in the Tower of London, and of one month in Sandown Castle, Kent, he died 11th September 1664. The life of Colonel Hutchinson is now only of interest from the manner in which it is narrated in the Memoirs written by his wife, and first published in 1806, a w ork not only valuable for the picture which it gives of the time in which he lived, but for the simple beauty of its style, and the naïveté with Which the writer records her sentiments and opinions, and details the incidents of her private life.
