HOOK, Theodore Edward (1788-1841), novelist, dramatist, and improvisatore, was born in London 2 2d September 1788. At Harrow he received but a scant education, and although he subsequently matriculated at Oxford he never actually resided at the university. Indeed he seems to have abandoned all thought of serious study about 1802, on the death of his mother, née Madden, a lady of singular beauty and ability. The father, James Hook, a composer of some distinction, took great delight in exhibiting the extraordinary musical and metrical gifts of the stripling, and before many months the precocious Theodore had become “the little pet lion of the green room.” At the age of sixteen he scored a dramatic success with The Soldier's Return, a comic opera, and this he rapidly followed up with a series of over a dozen sparkling ventures, the instant popularity of which was hardly dependent on the inimitable acting of Liston and Mathews. But an overweening love of society withheld Hook from a lucrative career as a dramatic author, and for some ten of the best years of his life he gave himself up to the pleasures of the town, winning a foremost place in the world of fashion by his matchless powers of improvisation and mimicry, and startling the public by the audacity of his practical jokes. His unique gift of impromptu minstrelsy “mystified” Sheridan, astonished Coleridge, and eventually charmed the Prince Regent into a declaration that “something must be done for Hook.” The prince was as good as his word, and the victim of social success was appointed accountant-general and treasurer of the Mauritius with a salary of £2000 a year. For five delightful years Hook was the life and soul of the island, but in 1817, a serious deficiency having been discovered in the treasury accounts, he was arrested and brought to England on a criminal charge. It transpired that a sum of about <£12,000 had been abstracted by a deputy official, and for this amount Hook was held responsible.

During the tardy scrutiny of the audit board he lived obscurely and maintained himself by writing for magazines [9:12:149] and newspapers. In 1820 he launched the John Bull, the champion of high Toryism and the virulent detractor of Queen Caroline. Witty, incisive criticism and pitiless invective secured a large circulation for the newspaper, and from this source alone Hook derived, for the first year at least, an income of £2000. In the midst of his labours, however, he was arrested for the second time on account of his debt to the state, which he made no effort to defray. Confined for eight months in a sponging-house, he issued thence the first series of his lively Sayings and Doings (3d series, 1828). On his liberation he continued to work with his pen indefatigably, pouring forth in the remaining twenty-three years of his life no fewer than thirty-eight volumes, besides numberless articles, squibs, and sketches. His novels are not works of enduring interest, but they are saved from mediocrity by frequent passages of racy narrative and vivid portraiture. The best are Maxwell (1830), Love and Pride (1833), the autobiographic Gilbert Gurney (1835), Jack Brag (1837), Gurney Married (1839), and Peregrine Bunce (1841). Incessant work had already begun to tell on his health, when Hook returned to his old social habits, and a prolonged attempt to combine industry and dissipation resulted in the sad confession that he was “done up in purse, in mind, and in body too at last.” He died 24th August 1841. His writings in great part are of a purely ephemeral character; the less transient, touched though they be with a sparkling fancy, have long since passed out of favour; while the greatest triumphs of the improvisatore may be said to have been writ in wine. Putting aside, however, his claim to literary greatness, Hook will be remembered as one of the most brilliant, genial, and original figures of Georgian times.
