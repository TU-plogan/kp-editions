HUMBLE-BEE, a name applied by phonetic instinct under various inflexions (such as “Bumble-bee” in England provincially, and “Hummel” in Germany) to the large bees of the genus Bombus (which, like the French “Bourdon,” is probably also suggested by the noise made by these insects). They belong to the social section of the great family Apidoe, of which the common hive-bee is the type, and, like that well-known insect, live in colonies composed of the two sexes and neuters. Instead of a single female (or queen), however, many are found in one nest; and the workers do not hibernate. The female also differs from the queen hive-bee in having dense fringes of hairs on the pollen-plates of the hind legs, and a widened base to the hind tarsi, a structure necessitated by her having to work single-handed at the commencement of the season, as the workers and males do not survive the winter. Early in the spring these large hibernated females may be observed on the wing, each becoming the founder of a fresh colony, in which the neuters are first produced. There are two kinds of females, the smaller one only producing male eggs, but not surviving the winter. The number of individuals in a colony varies with the different species, and as a rule is least in those building their nest above ground. In one very common subterranean species, Bombus terrestris, as many as 107 males, 56 females, and 180 workers have been found in one nest. There is considerable difference between the males, females, and neuters; the last two differ, however, but little except in size, whereas the males often exhibit a very varying coloration, and have structural peculiarities, such as an additional segment to the abdomen, longer antennae and tongue, no pollen-basket, &c. They have also no sting, whereas both female and worker are armed like the hive-bee. Great difficulty exists in referring these three constituents to their proper species, owing to individual variation, alteration with age, and the difficulty of seeing all the members of a colony at the same time; so that naturalists are not by any means agreed as to the specific [9:12:343] βtatus of many of them, and the synonymy is very complicated. The nests are not constructed after the symmetrical fashion of those of the hive-bee, but consist of a collection of oval brownish cells, at first few in number, but receiving additions and extensions as the brood increases, and accompanied by cells containing pollen and honey. The workers assist in rearing the larvae, and in disengaging the individuals from their pupal integuments as they reach the perfect state; and it has been noticed that this metamorphosis is accelerated by a kiud of incubation. The nests are made under bushes, in banks, &c., sometimes as much as 5 feet from the surface. A well-known one is made by the “Moss-carder” humble-bee, Bombus muscorum, which has often been observed collecting the natural material for its dome, working in line. As usual with provident or social animals, these interesting insects are subject to encroachment by parasites of various kinds; most noteworthy among which are some species (there are three or four in England) of the closely allied genus Ap>athus (or Psi- thyms), superficially resembling exactly the true humble-bees, but with no pollen-collecting apparatus, and no workers. They exist apparently on friendly terms with their hosts, whose stores are at times materially preyed upon by the larvae of Volucella, a genus of Diptera or twowinged flies also resembling humble-bees. Various beetles, such as Antherophagus, Cryptophagus, Leptinus, &c., and the larvae of Tinea ι>ellionella, a small moth, also occur in their nests.

As regards distribution, the Bombi are found in Europe, America (North and South), Africa, India, China, and J ava, but not in Australasia, where, indeed, it has even been attempted to introduce some species for the purpose of fertilizing the introduced clover, for which the structure of the native insects is apparently insufficient. It is, however, in the northern zone that they flourish best, their hardy nature enabling them to exist in the Arctic regions, as far as man has penetrated; and the numerous additions continually being made to the list of known species from the Caucasus, the Amur district, Türkistan, Arizona, &c., point, not only to a wide geographical range, but to a large adaptation to some useful end. The experiments of Darwin, Müller, and others show how important a part is played by humble-bees in the economy of nature as plant fertilizers; and, though perhaps not exhibiting such highly-developed instincts as the hive-bee, they possess sufficient reasoning power to enable them, by perforating the base of the calyx of certain flowers, to obtain otherwise inaccessible honey.
