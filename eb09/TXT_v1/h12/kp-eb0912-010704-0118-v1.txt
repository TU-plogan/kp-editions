HOME, John (1722-1808), a Scottish dramatic poet, was born on 20th September 1722 at Leith, where his father, Alexander Home, filled the office of town-clerk. He was educated at the grammar school of his native town, and at the university of Edinburgh, where he graduated as M.A. in 1742. Though in his youth he was distinguished for vivacity, and showed a fondness for the profession of arms, [9:12:108] he ultimately studied divinity, and was licensed by the presbytery of Edinburgh in 1745. In the same year he joined as a volunteer against the Pretender, and was taken prisoner at the battle of Falkirk. Along with many others he was carried to the castle of Doune, from which, however, he soon effected his escape. In July 1746 Home was presented to the parish of Athelstaneford in Haddingtonshire, vacant by the death of Robert Blair, the author of The Grave. There he devoted himself to dramatic literature, and his first production, The Tragedy of Agis, was finished in 1749. He took it to London and submitted it to Garrick for representation at Drury Lane, but it was rejected as unsuitable for the stage. Being but little disappointed, he projected a new work, and having heard a lady sing the ballad of Gil Morice, he formed the idea of The Tragedy of Douglas, which after five years’ labour he completed, and took to London for Garrick’s opinion. It also was rejected, but on his return to Edinburgh his friends resolved that it should be brought out in that city, where it met with overwhelming success, in spite of the opposition of the clergy, who suspended one member of the presbytery for a month for having attended its representation. As the author of the tragedy might count on being dealt with yet more severely, Home resigned his charge in 1757, and shortly afterwards he was appointed lecturer in a Presbyterian chapel in Silver Street, London. In 1758 he became private secretary to Lord Bute, then secretary of state; and three years later his patron’s influence procured him a pension of £300 per annum. A Letter from a Blacksmith to the Ministers and Elders of the Church of Scotland, in which the manner of public worship in that church is considered, published in 1759, has been attributed to his pen. In 1760 Home brought out another tragedy, The Siege of Aquileia, which was put on the stage, Garrick taking the part of Aemilius. In 1763 he was appointed to the sinecure office of conservator of Scots privileges at Campvere. In 1769 Home’s tragedy of The Fatal Discovery had a run of nine nights; Alonzo also (1773) had fair success in the representation; but his last tragedy, Alfred (1778), was so coolly received that he gave up writing for the stage. From 1767 he resided either at Edinburgh or at a villa which he built at K il luff near his former parish. It was at this time that he wrote his History of the Rebellion of 1745, which appeared in 1802. Home died at Merchiston Bank, near Edinburgh, in 1808, in his eighty-sixth year. He was a man of great amiability of character, and numbered among his friends most of the Scottish liter vti of the last century. His writings, while they display fervid feeling, and have less artifici ιlity than the works of the poets of his time, are now, with the exception of Douglas, comparatively little known.

The works of Home were collected and published by Henry Mackenzie in 1822 (3 vols. 8vo), but several of his smaller poems seem to have escaped the editor’s observation. These are—“The Fate of Caesar,” “Verses upon Inveraray,” “Epistle to the Earl of Eglintoun,” “Prologue on the Birthday of the Prince of λVales, 1759,’’ and several “Epigrams,” which are printed in vol. ii. of Original Poems by Scottish Gentlemen, 1762.
