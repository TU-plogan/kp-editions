+=====================================================================+


HISTORY, in the most correct use of the word, means the prose narrative of past events, as probably true as the fallibility of human testimony will allow. This definition takes no account of chronicles in verse which were not uncommon in the Middle Ages. With this exception the definition is fairly exact, both in what it comprehends and what it excludes. Obviously prose narrative is not history when it deals with fictitious events, as in the case of the novel; and verse narrative, even when it deals with true events (as in the account of the battle of Salamis in the Persae of Aeschylus, or Guillaume le Breton’s metrical chronicle of the reign of Philip Augustus), is either more or less than history, and in any case a sub-species by itself.

In practice, the line between history and mythus is often not easy to draw; but the theoretical distinction is plain. History reposes, however remotely, on contemporary witness to the fact related. Written records are not absolutely indispensable, as tradition may supply their place and represent authentic contemporary testimony. But tradition is very insecure and apt to be equally inventive and oblivious. It is in the half light of tradition that mythus is born of the creative fancy of man, and the difficulty of separating fact from fiction in this border-land of mingled fable and reality very often amounts to impossibility.

But even authentic facts alone are not sufficient to constitute history. Many facts and dates are recorded with reference to China, Egypt, and Assyria in olden times, which in all probability are true; but these facts and dates are not enough to give those countries a history. The bare fact that a certain king reigned in a certain year, and conquered or was defeated in battle with a neighbour, is perhaps chronologically valuable, but it is not history. History only attains its full stature when it not only records but describes in considerable fulness social events and evolution, when it marks change and growth, the movement of society from one phase to another.

The field of history is in consequence very limited, both in time and space, in proportion to the length of human existence and the area of the earth’s surface occupied by man. Primitive and savage man has no history, because the struggle for existence consumes all his energies, and he has neither time nor faculty to think of himself as a social being, much less to make record of social events. But even when partially civilized, mankind is often incapable, not only of writing history, but of furnishing the materials of it. Under a system of caste, or conservative theocracy, or oppressive tradition, as in India, Egypt, and China respectively, the social evolution is so slow that it hardly seems to move at all. The grandson lives among conditions hardly differing from those of the grandfather. In such a state of things the very subject-matter of history is wanting. Nothing attracts less notice than immobility, and large populations have often lived under conditions which for whole generations did not seem to vary. The vast and vacant annals of the East show that the arts of peace and war may attain considerable development without history or its materials being produced in consequence.

If these views be correct we can only allow a period of about 4000 years as the limit of genuine history in point of time. The beginning would be with the historical books of the Old Testament. Before the Jewish records fail us the Greek have begun. The Romans follow in immediate succession, and the historical thread has never been broken since, though thicker and stronger in some epochs than in others. As regards area, history long dwelt exclusively on the shores of that inland sea which, if not the birthplace of the human race, have at least been the chief training-ground of its early youth and vigorous manhood. Civilization subsequently spread from the Mediterranean to remote islands and continents unknown to the ancients, and history has followed it. No doubt in time both will be coextensive with the globe; but that time has not yet come. It is still useful to remember that the materials of history now rapidly accumulating in the far West, the far South, and even the far East, owe their origin to that antiquity of which we are the heirs, to the civilization which took its rise in those ever memorable centres named Rome, Athens, and Jerusalem.

Early history is never critical and painstaking in the investigation of facts. Neither the historian nor his readers or hearers have reached a stage of culture in which accuracy is highly valued. Early history is essentially artistic, its object is much more to charm the fancy and warm the emotions than to instruct the understanding. A good story, pathetic or humorous, is appreciated for its own sake independently of its truth. Striking pictures, dramatic situations, often told in dialogue, scenes in which virtue and vice are depicted on a colossal scale— these are the chief objects of the early historical writer, who mingles fact and fiction with the same naïveté as his brethren, the writers of the early epos and drama. Indeed, their subjects are often the same,—the heroes whose prowess saved or achieved the national existence, the odious foreign foe who was beaten back; in either case characters appealing strongly to the imagination and the feelings, which would resent cold criticism, but gladly welcome eloquence and passion. History written under these circumstances has much of the character of the prose poem,— carmen solutum, as Quintilian called it. The artistic or imaginative element predominates in it rather to excess. Such is history as written by Herodotus and Froissart. The growth of accurate knowledge in other departments, the increased practice of affairs, the substitution of the political for the heroic and chivalrous sentiment, lead to a more sober and scrutinizing style of history without sacrifice of artistic form. Such is history as written by Thucydides and Tacitus.

Even a most hasty survey of so vast a subject as the historical literature of the world will be helped by its division.

History is of two kinds,—the old or artistic type of history, and the new or sociological type. The artistic type, invented by the Greeks, remained the ideal of history till comparatively recent times. Its aim was perfection of literary form, weight and dignity of language, depth of moral and sagacity of political reflexion. It was habitually careless and indifferent as regards research. But its chief distinction from the new history was a negative one; it had no conception of society as an organism, no suspicion of the depth and variety of the social forces which underlie and originate the visible events which it describes, often with admirable power. The new history is to a great extent characterized by opposite qualities. Its preoccupation about literary form is secondary, moral reflexion it rather avoids, but it is laborious beyond precedent in research, and above all it is pregnant with the notion that society is a great aggregate of forces moving according to laws special to it, and similar to those producing evolution and growth analogous to what we see in other forms of life. The remainder of this article could not perhaps be better employed than by a short examination of these two types of history, including some reference to the causes which brought about a transition from one to the other.

The Greeks were the inventors, and remain the unsurpassed masters, of the artistic form of history. That extraordinary insight into the true conditions of harmony, proportion, and grace which guided them in other departments of literature and art did not forsake them in this. As iq [9:12:20] the drama a few tentative and experimental essays soon led to the master works of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Aristophanes, so a few precursors were sufficient to direct Herodotus to the main outlines of historical composition. By one of those mysterious accidents, not to be accounted for, which produce genius, Herodotus was closely followed by the greatest mind that ever applied itself to history. Thucydides remains the unsurpassed ideal of artistic history. As the famous statue of Polycletus, called the Doryphorus, represented the proportions of the human body in such complete beauty “that it was regarded by the ancient artists as a canon of the rules on this point,” so the history of the Peloponnesian War may serve, as its author seemed to know it would, as a model which all may copy but none may equal. Art, differing from science, allows of something like final perfection. Scientific work, however admirable, is always speedily superseded. Great artistic works remain perfect in their kind, and such was the work of Thucydides. History never deviated from the lines laid down by the Greeks till the advent of the modern school towards the end of the last and the beginning of this century. Between Thucydides and Gibbon there is no change of the ideal plan on which history should be written, though of course there is every degree of success and failure in striving after its realization.

A history of history is a desideratum in literature. The merit of such a work, if properly done, would consist, not only in the criticism of particular authors, but in a comparison of their epochs and social surroundings, and a pointing out how these influenced the character and quality of their historical writing. It is, for instance, worthy of notice that history is far more sensitive and dependent on public freedom than either poetry, science, philosophy, or jurisprudence. All these have flourished under governments more or less despotic, but history never. Tacitus seems to have felt this in the depth of his heart when he said that he was able to write as he did because of the “rara temporum felicitas ubi sentire quae velis et quae sentias dicere licet.” Again, certain epochs are favourable to great historians, as periods of war are favourable to great soldiers. Rating the genius of the Greek historians as high as we please, and it is difficult to rate it too high, it is still manifest that they enjoyed exceptional advantages. The political condition of the Greek world in the 4th and 5th centuries b.c. was beyond measure stimulating to men of genuine historical power. That extraordinary collection of small states, full of the most active political life, full of wars, alliances, and brusque revolutions, was a scene of interest, of which no subsequent historian has ever seen the like. In this respect the Greek historians had a privilege similar to that enjoyed by the Greek sculptors. As the gymnasia displayed the finest type of manly beauty and strength ever seen, so the fervent energy and activity of the Greek states presented in unparalleled variety and fulness the features of political life most capable of interesting an historical mind. And it is perhaps hardly too much to say that what the palaestra was to Phidias, that the Peloponnesian War was to Thucydides.

Continuing this vein of reflexion, we might remark that it is a noteworthy fact that in history alone the Romans came nearest to their Greek models. Copyists in everything else, and inferior copyists, in history they equalled if they did not excel their masters. It is a moot point with many whether Tacitus should not be placed above Thucydides. In any case that steep inferiority which marked Roman imitation of Greek models in every other department was excepted in the case of history. Why was this so Î Obviously because the Romans possessed a robust national life in many respects more lofty and inspiring even than that of the Greeks. The genius of individual men was kindled by the propitious milieu. And a disastrous milieu, injurious to all productions of the mind, is peculiarly fatal to history. The decay of historical writing in the later period of the declining Roman empire is a sufficient proof. Nothing so debased as the Augustan History can be found in any other province of Latin literature, and when a man of real power like Ammianus Marcelliuus appears, if we compare him with Claudian in another department, we perceive that the muse of history is more austere than her sisters. The Middle Ages would offer the historian of history ample scope for connecting the quality of historical writing with the social surroundings of the authors. The great monastic houses, such as Malmesbury, St Albans, Eu, and many more, would be shown to have been such schools of history as they were, for very efficient reasons. The appearance of the modern Herodotus, Froissart, would seem meant expressly to show the union of opportunity and genius needed to produce great historical work. It was no accident which gave us the immortal chronicles. The first instalment of the Hundred Years’ War between France and England, the grand but abortive outburst of Parisian democracy under Étienne Marcel, the energetic action of the first serious States-General of France—these were subjects to arrest a real historical eye, such as Froissart had, in spite of his many shortcomings. The dramatic struggle between feudalism and monarchy in the 15th century found a competent if somewhat rustic Tacitus in Comines, more friendly but on the whole not less severe to his bourgeois Tiberius, Louis XI. In the stirring times of the 16th century historians abound—Italians, Frenchmen, Dutchmen—too numerous to mention and too distinguished to be passed over with perfunctory notice here. But how much would an historian of history have to say of Fra Paolo, Davila, De Thou, Grotius, to name only the chief? And then occurs a really surprising phenomenon. History disappears from the continent of Europe for a century and a half. Between the Thirty Years’ War and the Seven Years’ War the Continent produced no historians whom the world cares to remember, for Mézeray is remembered, though hardly read, on account of his quaint and occasionally graphic style. Yet this was the great age of Louis XIV., the classic age of French literature and philosophy, and the commencement of French science. But history withered under the blight of the Catholic and monarchical reaction. History was indeed being written in France, the most witty, profound, and graphic since the days of Tacitus; but it was history which the author kept for himself and a remote posterity; not for a hundred years was the world to be permitted to gaze with wonder and admiration on the incomparable memoirs of St Simon. But Rebellious and Revolutionary England gives us Clarendon and Burnett—cause and effect as usual. A review of the 18th century and its performances in history would conclude this interesting retrospect. But it is time to return from this digression to our more immediate subject.

The old type of history, one might say, was a species of portrait-painting which had often every merit except that of close likeness to the original. Whether it is quite just to say this will be presently considered. But it cannot be denied that the old writers generally thought more of the brilliancy of their colours and the effectiveness of their pictures than of their exact truth. “My siege is finished,” said Vertot, when offered new documents which stultified his narrative. The old masters of history resembled, it is to be feared (if so honourable a comparison can be considered derogatory), the old masters of painting. Both thought little of what we call “local colour,” of close conformity to the scene or object delineated, provided they produced [9:12:21] striking compositions with grand outline and rich tints which were attractive and beautiful for their own sake. When to this conception of their art we add their general apathy in research, the measure of their sins appears to be filled up in the eyes of a generation like ours, which has brought historical evidence under conditions nearly as stringent as those which regulate the depositions of a court of justice. Still it may occur to some persons that there is another side to this matter, and that the great men of old are not wholly without defence. They were indolent in research no doubt, or rather they did not attach the value that we do to it (if they had, they were not men to have spared their pains), but they were large, sympathetic, and humane. They wrote for a public composed of men of the world and not of specialists. Their manner is somewhat off-hand, but they are neither prigs nor pedants. After all, the most important facts of history, as Auguste Comte has weightily remarked, are the best known and the least dependent on minute rectification for their true appreciation. History has an ethical and psychological side as well as a documentary side supported by elaborate citation of chapter and verse for every statement. Chapter and verse, important as they are, are sometimes a little oppressive and overbearing. The most exhaustive knowledge of authorities will not give a dull man insight into character, or enable him to realize and paint a great historic scene, or teach him to use with skill the mass of erudition under which he staggers. It may be said generally, exceptions of course excepted, that the old historians were strong where their successors are weak, and the converse. Aiming chiefly at portraiture, they succeeded in it, as was only natural. Amid a crowd of errors on smaller matters, they often catch the true expression of a physiognomy, and hit off the salient points of a character with an insight and success which subsequent inquiry is often unable to modify. Bacon’s portrait of Henry VII. remains substantially correct, though he wrote his book in four months, remote from the means of knowledge accessible even in his day, which did not represent a tithe of the knowledge accessible now. Even down to the practice of introducing fictitious speeches into their histories, the old writers are not without defence. Nothing more than these speeches has moved the contempt and indignation of modern critics. Macaulay says the practice was absurd, and that if an English writer were to attempt it now he would be laughed to scorn. Yet men of the calibre of Macchiavelli, ^Grotius, and Bacon resorted to it. It is more a question of form and less of substance than at first glance appears. It amounts to this— How are we to render our impression of a past epoch 1 We may give it in broad statement, in carefully reasoned argument, supported by apt quotation and appropriate footnotes. This is the modern plan, and, to speak frankly, unquestionably the best. But it is well to listen without impatience to what can be said for the old plan by the other side. Mr Spedding, referring to the speeches which Bacon introduced into his history of Henry VIL, says:—“My own opinion is that the reader is less liable to be deceived by history written on this principle than upon the modern plan, though the modern be apparently the more scrupulous. The records of the past are not complete enough to enable the most diligent historian to give a connected narrative in which there shall not be many parts resting on guesses or inferences or unauthenticated rumours. He may guess for himself, or he may report other people’s guesses; but guesses there must be. The advantage of the old practice is that the invention appears in the undisguised form of invention; whereas the modern practice, by scrupulously eschewing everything like avowed and deliberate invention, leaves it to be supposed that what remains is all fact, whereas in most cases of the kind the writer is but reporting his own or another man’s conjecture, just as much as if he had sat down deliberately to compose a soliloquy or a speech in the first person” (Spedding’s Bacon, vol vi. p. 76). Every one must be glad to see even plausible reasons suggested for not regarding the funeral oration of Pericles or the speech of Galgacus as “absurdities.” Perhaps the truest view of this introduction of speeches into their histories by the ancients and their modern imitators is that it was their mode of offering generalizations. They adopted the concrete and dramatic form when we should use the abstract and impersonal, and perhaps, as Mr Spedding remarks, this practice was not necessarily exposed to more error than ours.

We have now to advert to the causes which led to the transformation of history from the old to the new type.

The inferior quality of history in the 17th century and the first half of the 18th is the more remarkable from the contrast presented by the brilliancy of contemporary literature in other departments. The age of Louis XIV. in France, as already remarked, and the age of Anne in England produced no histories of superior merit. Bossuet ’ s famous discourse on universal history is no exception, being much more an eloquent sermon than a history in the true sense of the word. Written by inferior men from a low point of view, or no point of view at all, history at last sank to such a degree in the public esteem as to be spoken of in a tone of contempt. Dr Johnson openly despised it, and D’Alembert did nearly the same. And yet the time produced great antiquaries—Madox and Rymer in England, D’Achery and Mabillon in France, Maratori in Italy, Leibnitz in Germany. But history had no stamina or muscle. It was also from our point of view blind and utterly stupid: it could not see the plainest facts, and it perverted the facts it did see. Not only the inferior men whose names are barely remembered and whose works are entirely forgotten, the Daniels, the Vellys, the Creviers, the Hooks, the Eckards, but men of such magnitude as Hume and Robertson, Gibbon and Voltaire, often show such an unintelligence as to the past that this unintelligence itself becomes an interesting historical phenomenon, casting no slur on the great writers who displayed it, but deserving consideration for its own sake.

When 18th century writers are arraigned for their defective appreciation of the Middle Ages (the great stumbling-block) and remote periods generally, their critics forget the historical positions of the men they criticize. To write history in the 18th century was something very different from what it had been before, and this in several ways. First of all, the mere lengthening of the historic retrospect had enormously increased the field of historical survey. A writer of the 18th century looked back on nearly as much as we do; he had behind him the recent modern period, the long Middle Age, the barbarian epoch, those of Greece and Rome. And it was honourable to the men of the 18th century that they did not shrink from the task of writing on this immense expanse of history, imperfectly as they were prepared for it. It seems to be sometimes forgotten that most of the historical writing of the ancients, and a good part of that of the moderns up to the 18th century, had been the writing of contemporary history, or history of a quite recent past. This is true of Herodotus (when he is not merely a traveller telling travellers’ stories), of Thucydides, of Polybius, of Sallust, of Tacitus, of Guicciardini, of Fra Paolo, of Davila, of Grotius, of Clarendon. Contemporaneous history may bring out some of the highest qualities of an historian—perspicacity, weightiness of judgment and language, skill in narrative, and so forth. But one quality it does not need and cannot display, insight into a remote age differing in culture,^politics, and religion from those amid which the historian lives. Yet it was [9:12:22] precisely the history of remote ages which the writers of the 18th century boldly undertook to treat. That they often failed is not surprising. It would have been a miracle if they had succeeded.

We are now so imbued with the notions of growth and development in all forms that we find no difficulty in applying them to society as well as other phenomena. But these notions were all but entirely wanting in the 18th century; indeed, they did not fully emerge till the 19 th had run a good portion of its course. It was difficult for all true sons of the 18th century to conceive of men or of societies different from the men and the societies they saw around them. Or if they were forced to admit that men could exist under conditions widely differing from those in which they themselves lived, they unhesitatingly pronounced them barbarians, unpolished, hardly worthy of attention. They consequently speak of past ages habitually in a tone of supercilious contempt which is to us highly amusing. Men who differed in every other opinion agreed in this. “The Athenians of the age of Demosthenes were a people of brutes, a barbarous people,” said Dr Johnson; and Voltaire was quite of his way of thinking on this point {Diet. Philosophique, art. “Anciens et Modernes ”). With such views or rather feelings it was impossible to understand the past; they did not even wish to do so. They mostly regarded their own age as the only one worthy of respect and admiration, the only one in which “polite manners” had existed. The past to them was mainly a record of crime, ignorance, folly, and fanaticism (notice the way in which the sober Robertson speaks of the crusades); and they did not even wish to see it as it really was. It is obvious that such men could not write history as we understand it. The moral prejudices of the age shut out a true view of past times. Indeed they preferred a distorted view, if it represented better their notions of the seemly and the noble. They had always a tendency to dress up the past in the garb of the present. The French writers surpassed the English in this foible. For them the only ideal of a king is Louis XI V., and all kings must be made to resemble him more or less, though of course they were not so great. This disposition reaches its acme of absurdity in Scipion Dupleix, historiographer of France, who died in 1661. Describing the baptism of Clovis, he represents the barbarian Frank as approaching St Remi, “with lofty port and grave demeanour, richly dressed, scented, and powdered, with long wig carefully curled and perfumed according to the custom of the ancient French kings.” More serious is the profound misapprehension of every great character and great period which differed from the current pattern. The unworthy interpretation of all political and religious phenomena with which the writers were unfamiliar, by sagacious references to state and priestcraft, is also apt at times to appear to us wilfully perverse, and even disingenuous. We may. be sure it was nothing of the kind, and only resulted from the inadequate degree of culture then attained.

But the historians in question were hindered not only by prejudice which they could not avoid from understanding the past; they were also hindered by a want of knowledge which it was impossible for them to have. To say nothing of the larger conceptions of society which we have only recently acquired, they were unfurnished with those preparatory means of accurately observing the past which were soon to be discovered. The science of economics, as we shall presently see, was about to throw a broad and vivid light on many hitherto obscure problems of history. But the writers in question did not yet enjoy the benefit of it, and surely the fault was none of theirs. When we see a man of the genius and erudition of Montesquieu {Grandeur et Décadence des Domains, c. 17) gravely ascribing the decline of old Rome to the fact that all the gold and silver after the division of the empire were carried to Constantinople, we realize the value of true conceptions relative to the wealth of nations. But in Montesquieu’s time the precious metals were regarded as the sole or chief sources of wealth, and he applied without hesitation to history a principle which he saw statesmen apply without hesitation to politics. Again, Gibbon, writing on the same subject, the decline and fall of Rome, considers the real cause to have been the reluctance of the soldiers to wear defensive armour. It seems hardly credible, but here are his words :—“They (the soldiers) complained of the weight of their armour, which they seldom wore; and they successively obtained permission to lay aside both their cuirasses and their helmets. The heavy weapons of their ancestors dropped from their feeble hands, and their pusillanimous indolence may be considered the immediate cause of the downfall of the empire” (chap. 27). Montesquieu and Gibbon were men of an historical genius second to none. Yet they could descend to such trivialities, and the reason was that the true sources of national wealth and military strength had not been laid open in their day. It would be easy to multiply examples of a similar kind, taken from the ablest writers, in which the most superficial explanation of wide-reaching events is hastily caught at, as if one were to explain an earthquake by a scratching of the earth’s surface. In fact the old writers might be likened to surveyors as contrasted with geologists. They have little or no conception of the forces at work under the surface they see.

But a change was near—a change in feeling and a change in knowledge. That singular modulation of key in the moral life of Europe, often called, for want of abetter term, the Romantic movement, which arrested and surprised the attention of the latter half of the 18th century, was felt in relation to history as well as to philosophy, politics, and religion. Whether represented by the fierce rebellion of Rousseau in France, or a milder literary reform in England and Germany, it essentially consisted in a weariness of and disenchantment with the present and the recent past, in a vague feeling after ideas and emotions outside the conventional circle in which men had been contented to live for several generations. The tastes and the tempers of men changed with a strange rapidity. The 18th century philosophy, as it is called, lately so high and apparently secure, was cast out with contumely. The recent idols—Locke, Hume, Voltaire, Diderot—were smitten down, and others needless to name were put in their place. The whole movement is now seen to have been retrograde, and finally abortive, though temporarily successful. But it had its raison d'etre and even its uses, as all social phenomena have. Among its uses was the service it rendered to history. As it was a first principle with the Romantics to burn what their predecessors had worshipped and the converse, the past which had been recently an object of contempt was put in the place of honour. Especially the Middle Age, so unjustly despised, seemed to rise out of its grave as a lovely vision full of knights and chivalry, troubadour song, and Gothic architecture, the latter just beginning to be appreciated. Where men had only recently seen barbarism, superstition, and ignorance, they and their sons saw an enchanted land of beauty, piety, and grace. Then came Sir Walter Scott, who turned a current already flowing fast into a headlong torrent. The Middle Age was studied eagerly, sympathetically, perhaps a little too much so; zeal never is according to knowledge. But the bringing of the Middle Age into the circle of serious historic study had an influence beyond its immediate object. When men had brought themselves to study and understand 11th century popes and emperors, monasticism, feudalism, scholasticism, they became bold and capable of further [9:12:23] adventures in historical enterprise. After the heroic ages of Christendom, the heroic ages of Greece were opened to explorers. And soon all exclusiveness disappeared. The whole past history of man was felt to be worthy of man’s study,—a wide field into which many labourers entered. So much for the change in feeling.

No less a change had taken place in the condition of knowledge. Speculation had for a long time been feeling its way to a closer contact with the problems suggested by the growing wealth and industry of the modern world. Adam Smith in his memorable work resumed, co-ordinated, and enlarged the labours of his numerous predecessors, and placed the study of economics on a new and positive basis. But the suggestive stimulus of his researches spread beyond the limits of the science with which he was immediately concerned. The indirect services rendered by political economy to history have not perhaps been adequately recognized. The elucidation of the sources of wealth in the present became a means of explaining the prosperity and decay of states in the.past, which soon led to valuable results, the more striking as they were unexpected. Hitherto wealth had been thought a source rather of degeneracy than of improvement. The great danger was always understood to be “luxury.” Poverty was the parent of virtue. Primitive times were virtuous because they were poor. Pagan philosophers and Christian saints had agreed in condemning riches as the source of all evil, and denying the rich man a high place in their ideal republic or the city of God. Political economy cleared up the confusion of thought here implied. The wealth of states has nothing to do with the excessive opulence of a small class. Never has the mass of the people in any country or in any age suffered from an overabundance of wealth. The excessive wealth of the few generally means the poverty of the many. In short, the evil lies in the great inequality of the distribution of wealth. These common-places of economics would have been paradoxes in the early part of the 18th century, and the historians of that age show a profound ignorance of their bearing, as was only natural. So, when they have to explain the decay of a state they seek to show that it had lost its gold and silver, or that luxury had made fearful inroads, or that martial valour had somehow strangely declined. The notion that poverty in the mass of the people was very often the chief and sometimes the only cause did not occur to them. When therefore Adam Smith devoted the third book of the Wealth of Nations to “the different Progress of Opulence in different Nations,” it seemed as if a lamp had suddenly been lit in a dark place. That book was in truth a lofty historical review of the facts of the past, guided by the principles of economic science. The question which has already come before us, and which exercised so much, as well it might, the thinkers of that age, the decline of Rome, was approached in a much more promising manner when one element of it, the decay of agriculture in Italy, was spoken of thus :—“Tillage in that part of ancient Italy which lay in the neighbourhood of Rome must have been very much discouraged by the distributions of corn which were frequently made to the people, either gratuitously or at a very low price. This corn was brought from the conquered provinces, of which several, instead of taxes, were obliged to furnish a tenth part of their produce at a stated price. The low price at which this corn was distributed to the people must necessarily have sunk the price of what could be brought to the Roman market from Latium or the ancient territory of Rome, and must have discouraged its cultivation in that country.” This was catching a glimpse of a vera causa of the effect to be explained, and the vein of thought thus opened proved to be richer the further it was explored.

Both the moral and the intellectual tendencies at work to produce a new temper with regard to history received an incalculable impetus from the French Revolution. That cataclysm revealed the deeper forces of society which had lain silent and unsuspected under the deceitful calm of the ancien regime in its latter days. It was very certainly a revelation, though light came from the flames of Tophet, in Mr Carlyle’s phrase. Men saw the depth of the abyss over which they had lived in quiet ignorance, and their notions on man, society, and history underwent a great change. Passions undreamed of were let loose, and the passions of the present threw light on those of the past. History was read with new eyes. “Whenever,” says a man who lived through the tempest and profited as much as any one by it,—“Whenever,” says Niebuhr, “an historian is reviving past times, his interest in them and sympathy with them will be the deeper the greater the events he has witnessed with a bleeding or rejoicing heart” (Preface to Hist, of Rome). Few generations have seen events which alternately made men’s hearts bleed and rejoice more passionately than Niebuhr’s own, and none have ever stimulated history so much. With the peace of 1815 historical studies acquired an activity and scope they never had before. All history, it was perceived, needed rewriting from new points of view, with more knowledge, deeper insight, keener sympathy. The French led the van of the new movement with their usual brilliancy and mastery of literary form. But it was their position as the nearest witnesses and the greatest sufferers and gainers by the Revolution which did most to open their eyes. A truly illustrious band of scholars and writers under the Restoration, the Monarchy of July, raised history into a position of honour it had never enjoyed before. Michaud, the two Thierrys, Sismondi, Guizot, De Barante, Michelet, and many more rendered services to history which must not be forgotten because on many points their labours have been superseded. It is indeed a capital proof of the merit of their labours that they furnished the means and the incentive to their supersession, a proof that their studies were vital and progressive. The Germans, with their solid erudition, were not slow in following the French. Between the two, the Middle Ages, Greek and Roman antiquity, and the history of the Christian Church were studied with a minuteness and breadth never known before. History had entered on its modern phase.

This is not the place to dwell in detail on the achievements of the modern school of historians. The whole field of history has been explored afresh with such superior insight, knowledge, and just conception of the task in hand that all historical writings anterior in date to the end of the 18th century are entirely superseded, with the single exception perhaps of Gibbon, who alone, as Mr Freeman says, has not been set aside by subsequent research. Ancient history, chiefly in consequence of the extraordinary zeal and diligence of the Germans in what they call the science of antiquity (Alterthumswissenschaft), has become a reality, vivid in interest, and fruitful in knowledge, instead of the nebulous unreality it had been before. The rejection of the fabulous elements in the histories of Greece and Rome was the first step, but a long one, which it required many years and much effort to make. The next was to obtain a firm grasp of the idea that the Greeks and Romans were living men, and not statues like the Elgin Marbles, and to look at their politics, institutions, and religions with the discriminating eye of common sense, and a real wish to see them as they were. The true nature of Athenian democracy, of the Spartan oligarchy, of the commons and patricians of Rome, of the party struggles which caused and justified the transition from the republic to the empire, has been put in a clear light, which can hardly be appreciated by those who are not aware of the darkness which it replaced. Points of [9:12:24] view aud lines of inquiry concerning the religion, government, institutions, taxation, and law of the ancient states have been opened up, of which the possibility in the old days was not suspected. The sociological knowledge of the present has illumined the past, an interesting example of which is afforded by the rapprochement between the English dominion in India and the Roman provincial administration.

The history of the Middle Age shows even greater results, and greater innovation, to which allusion has been already made. The great difficulty was the papacy. Between the Catholics, who regarded it as of divine institution, and the Protestants, who regarded it as a manifestation of Antichrist, and the sceptics, who despised both and regarded it as mere superstition, this great centre around which the life of the Middle Ages revolved had been unknown or misknown to a degree of absurdity. Gradually, as the 19th century arose wiser and sadder out of the chaos of the French Revolution, the immense part played by the church was at first dimly suspected, and at last with increasing clearness perceived. This must on every account be regarded as the greatest achievement of the modern school; it implied the unlearning of so many old errors, the acquiring of so many new truths, above all, the repression of so many deeply-rooted prejudices. It restored the continuity of history, in which the Middle Ages had hitherto appeared as an unexplained gap,—an unwelcome wedge of barbarism thrust between the ancient and modern civilizations.

After the Middle Ages, the period which has been most illumined by the new lamp of history is that of the early church and the whole subject of religious dogma and institutions. In spite of the fierce controversies which have raged over this region, a large residuum of undisputed fact has been rescued from ignorance and prejudice, and church history is no longer a legend, but one of the most interesting chapters in the annals of the human mind.

As regards modern history, we are oppressed and nearly overwhelmed with the mass of new materials and new discoveries which have been launched upon us. The diligent publication of state papers and documents, which all civilized states have taken in hand, has exceeded in the last half century all that had been done before in that direction. The result is that there are few periods of modern history which are not far better known to us than they were to the contemporaries who lived in them. But history in this field cannot boast of such laurels as she has won in the field of antiquity and the Middle Ages. There has been no great reversal of old points of view, no great triumph of historical perspicacity piercing through traditional error down to latent truth. Modern history has won its victories more by weight of metal than by the skill of its commanders, not that the generals have lacked skill, but they have had less occasion to display it.

The history of institutions has received much attention in recent times, and promises to be one of the most fruitful veins of inquiry yet opened, and this in reference both to primitive institutions, which are rather prehistorical than historical, and the constitutions of states which have reached adult political life. The old Aryan tenure of land and village communities, and ancient law, whether in old Rome or modern Bengal, have been the subjectsof elaborate investigation, embodied in works which mark a new departure in knowledge. The institutional history of political states is at the present momenr perhaps the subject which attracts the most lively attention of scholars. It is not confined to the constitutional history of England, though England, as the mother of parliaments, has a fair claim to priority of interest. But the subject is narrowed and degraded by contemplating it from the point of view of modern politics, and chiefly in reference to the popular freedom or national wellbeing produced. The earnest historical inquirer is as impartial as the pathologist who studies disease equally with health. The institutions of despotism have their raison Tetre and normal evolution as well as those of free governments, and the scientific historian will neglect the one as little as the other. In any case the history of the institutions of Europe from the times of the Frankish empire to the end of the French monarchy offers the widest field for courageous historical research. It has absorbed and transcended all those inquiries which used to be included under the somewhat jejune title of the history of civilization. Institutions in the secular order, aud religions in the spiritual order, are now seen to be the most massive and permanent factors in human life, capable indeed of evolution and change, but little susceptible to the immediate action of man’s intelligence and will, and yielding only to the new modifications brought about by time and the gradual transformation of ideas and moral conceptions, the result of increased knowledge.

It is hardly necessary to add that a broad distinction must be made between history and what has been called the philosophy of history, a term now replaced by the far better one “sociology,” invented by A. Comte. Sociology has the purely scientific aim of investigating the nature and constitution of societies, to discover the laws which regulate their growth and decay, to do in short for them what biology has already done for the animal and vegetable kingdoms. History, while it can never again dispense with the assistance of sociology, remains occupied with the description of the social organism (at a given period) in its ensemble, and the term “descriptive sociology” has been suggested as an improvement on the old one, history. We may question whether the innovation will be accepted or is needed. The human interest attaching to the story of man’s past fortunes will always provoke the means of its own satisfaction, and there is little doubt that history, the name and the thing, as the highest form of prose literature, will continue to instruct and console mankind to the remotest generations.
