HONFLEUR, a town of France, at the head of a canton in the arrondissement of Pont l’Évêque in the department of Calvados, is situated on the south side of the estuary of the Seine directly opposite Havre, and about 10 miles to the north of Pont l’Evêque and 37 miles to the north-east of Caen. With the general railway system of northern France it is connected by a line running by Pont l’Evêque to Lisieux; and a concession was granted in 1879 for another line to Pont-Audemer. As a town Honfleur has the typical aspect of a small old-fashioned seaport, equally heedless of symmetry in its plan and cleanliness in its economy. The most noteworthy of its buildings is the church of St Catherine, constructed entirely of timber work and plaster, and consisting of two parallel naves, of which the more ancient is supposed to date from the end of the 15th century. A process of restoration is at present (1880) going on under Government supervision. Within the church are several antique statues and a painting by Jordaens—Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane. The church tower stands on the other side of a street. St Leonard’s dates from the 17th century, with the exception of its fine ogival portal and rose-window belonging to the 16th, and its octagonal tower erected in the 18th. The ruins of a 16th century castle, and several houses of the same period, are the only buildings of antiquarian interest. The town-house, which contains the exchange and the commercial court, is of modern erection. On the rising ground above the town is the chapel of Notre Dame de Grâce, a shrine much resorted to by pilgrim sailors, which was founded in 1034 by Robert the Magnificent of Normandy, and rebuilt in 1606. Honfleur is the seat of a commercial college, a school of hydrography, a chamber of commerce, a custom-house, and various other Government offices, as well as of several consular establishments. The harbour, which consists of three basins, has been greatly improved between 1860 and 1875 by the extension of the pier and the formation of a new channel, which has a depth of 21 feet at neap tides and of 24 to 27 at spring-tides; and a fourth basin, decreed by the Government in 1879, will be completed by 1881. A reservoir of 120 acres in extent [9:12:141] affords the means of sluicing the channel. In 1878 the gross returns of the shipping showed 894 vessels, of which 586 were British, 118 Norwegian, and 62 French, the total burthen amounting to 200,939 tons; and there were besides 840 French coasting vessels, with 48,000 tons. The export trade consists almost exclusively of eggs (from 10 to 12 million dozens yearly), poultry, table-fruits, nuts, butter (9 to 12 million δ>), and similar produce for the London market; and the principal imports are coals, iron, wheat and oats, cement, wool, and marble, also deals from Norway, Sweden, and Russia, and oak timber from Germany. In 1879 the wheat imported from the United States amounted to 64,000 tons. Shipbuilding was formerly an extensive industry in Honfleur, most of the vessels of from 400 to 1200 tons belonging to the Havre shipowners issuing .from its yards; but the number now laid on the stocks is very small. Saw-mills, oil-factories, soap-works, paper-mills, and marble-works are the main industrial establishments. The population of Honfleur, estimated at 8800 shortly before the great Revolution, was 9946 in 1872. In 1876 the census showed 9037 inhabitants in the town and 9425 in the commune.

Honfleur, Latinized as Honflorvum, dates from the 11th century, and is thus four or five hundred years older than its greater rival Havre. During the English wars it was frequently taken and retaken, the longest English occupation being from 1430 to 1440. In 1562 the Protestant forces got possession of it only after a regular siege of the faubourg St Léonard; and though Henry IV, effected its capture in 1590 he had again to invest it in 1594 after all the rest of Normandy had submitted to his arms. In the earlier years of the 17th century Honfleur colonists founded Quebec, and Honfleur traders under Binot Paulmier established factories in Java and Sumatra. , Γhe German troops occupied the town in February 1871. Among the local celebrities are the admirals Doublet, Boitard, and Hamelin.
