HYTHE, a municipal and parliamentary borough of Kent, England, and one of the original Cinque Ports, is beautifully situated at the foot of a steep cliff near the eastern extremity of Romney Marsh, about half a mile from the sea, on a branch line of the South-Eastern Railway, 66 miles E.S.E. of London, 16 S.W. of Dover, and 5 W. of Folkestone. It consists principally of one long handsome street running parallel with the shore. On the slope of the hill above the town stands the fine old church of St Leonard, partly Late Norman and partly Early English, with a tower rebuilt about 1750. In a vault under the chancel there is a collection of human skulls and bones supposed to be the remains of ancient Britons and Saxons slain in a battle which took place near Hythe in 456. Of late the church has been undergoing restoration at a considerable cost, and it is proposed to complete the chancel, which was originally left unfinished. At Lympne there are the remains of a Roman castmm, and excavations made some years ago brought to light many interesting remains of the old Roman town, the Portus Lemanus. The site of the castrum is now occupied by the fine old castellated mansion of Studfall Castle, at one time the residence of the archdeacons of Canterbury, but at present used as a farm-house. Norman portions of the Lympne church originally built by Archbishop Lanfranc are still standing; and a small distance east from it is Shipway or Shepway Cross, where the great assemblies relating to the Cinque Ports used to be held until they were removed to Romney. Several bronze implements and weapons were discovered near Hythe in 1873, during the excavation of the railway line from Hythe to Sandgate. A mile north from Hythe is Saltwood Castle, of very ancient origin, but rebuilt in the time of Richard II. Hythe possesses a guild hall founded in 1794, and two hospitals, that of St Bartholomew founded by Haimo, bishop of Rochester, in 1336, and that of St John, of still greater antiquity but unknown date, and founded originally for the reception of lepers. A Government school of musketry, in which instructors of musketry for the army are trained, was established in 1854; and the Shorncliffe military camp is within 2∣ miles of the town.’ On account of its pleasant situation and its picturesque and interesting neighbourhood, Hythe has become a favourite watering-place. Baths were erected in 1854 at a cost of £2000, and the sea wall and parade has lately been extended eastwards to Sandgate, the total length being 3 miles. From the town to the sea-shore there is a stately avenue of wych elms. The area of the municipal borough is 1744 acres, and of the parliamentary borough 3571 acres. The population of the municipal borough in 1871 was 3383, and of the parliamentary borough 24,078. The latter includes the municipal borough of Folkestone.

Hythe occurs in old documents as Hethe, and in Domesday Book as Hede. The word is derived from the Saxon Hyth, meaning a harbour. The present town of Hythe rose to importance after the decay of West Hythe by the withdrawal of the sea, West Hythe having previously succeeded to the Portus Lcmαnus, whose decay had been due to a like cause. Since the reign of Elizabeth the harbour has been choked up with sand. It is a theory of some writers that the landing place of Julius C⅛esar on his first invasion of Britain was in the vicinity of Lympne. Anciently Hythe, with the parish of West Hythe, was within a “hundred” of its own. Along with Saltwood it was given in 1026 by Halfdan, a Saxon thane, to Christ Church in Canterbury; and it was afterwards held for knight's service by Earl Godwine. According to Leland, it at one time had a fine abbey and four parish churches. It succeeded to the ancient privileges which West Hythe enjoyed as a Cinque Port, its quota being 5 ships, 105 men, and 5 boys. When Earl Godwine ravaged the coast of Kent in 1052 ho took several ships from the harbour of Hythe. In 1293 the inhabitants with great valour repulsed the attacks of the seamen of a French man-of-war who had disembarked in the harbour and were beginning to plunder the town. In the reign of Richard II. a great conflagration destroyed 200 of the houses and 5 of the ships 7n the harbour. Hythe and Saltwood were given by Archbishop Cranmer to Henry VIII. in lieu of other estates, and they continued vested in the crown until the 17th year of Elizabeth, when the town received a charter of incorporation. It is now governed by 4 aidermen and 12 councillors, one of whom is mayor. From the 42d year of Edward III. it possessed the privilege of returning two m∏mhers to parliament, but since 1832 it has returned only one.
