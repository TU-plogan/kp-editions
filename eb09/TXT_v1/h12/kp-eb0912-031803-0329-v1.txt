HOUSTON, Samuel (1793-1863), an American general and statesman, was born near Lexington, Virginia, 2d March 1793. On the death of his father, a soldier of the revolution, in 1807, he removed with his mother to the frontier, and settling in Blount county, Tennessee, was soon on familiar terms with the Cherokee Indians. For a while he acted as clerk to a trader, and then as village schoolmaster; but in 1813, after a residence of nearly three years among the Indians, he joined the United States army. He served with Jackson in the war against Great Britain, and at the peace of 1815 had risen from the ranks to a lieutenancy. Although conscious of his success, and proud of having won Jackson’s friendship by his bravery, he then resigned his commission and turned to the study and practice of law at Nashville. In 1823 Tennessee returned him to congress, and four years later he was elected governor of the State. He married in January 1829, and in the April following, without assigning any reason, he suddenly abandoned his home and his office, and took up his residence among the Cherokees, by whom he was formally adopted as a member of their nation. Returning to Washington, he successfully pleaded their cause against the Government agents who had wronged them. In 1832 he settled in Texas, and was soon after elected a member of the convention called for the purpose of framing a constitution for that State, then in difficulties with the Mexican Government. On March 2, 1836, Texas declared its independence, and, on the 2d of April following, won it on the field of San Jacinto, where Houston, who had been appointed commander-in-chief of the Texas forces, with a body of 783 raw troops, defeated 1600 Mexican veterans led by Santa Anna. On the recognition of the independence of Texas, Houston was elected president of the new republic, and re-elected in 1841; and, when Texas was admitted to the Union in 1845, he was returned as one of its two representatives to the senate. There he distinguished himself as a zealous friend of the Indians, opposing the Kansas and Nebraska bill in a memorable speech (3d March 1854), and voting against the Lecompton constitution of Kansas. His decided opposition to secession obliged him in 1861 to retire from the office of governor of Texas, which he had held from 1859. He died at Huntersville, Texas, 25th July 1863. The hero of San Jacinto was above all things an able soldier, wary, intrepid, and resolute; but he also possessed as a legislator the qualities of rare foresight, cool discrimination, and fearless candour.
