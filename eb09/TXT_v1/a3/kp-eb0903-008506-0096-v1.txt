AUNGERVYLE, Richard, commonly known by the name of Richard de Bury, was born in 1281, at Bury St [9:3:86] Edmund’s in Suffolk, and educated at the university of Oxford. He entered the order of Benedictine monks, but was shortly afterwards appointed tutor to the prince of Wales. On the accession of his pupil to the throne as Edward III., he was promoted to various offices of dignity, and was finally made bishop of Durham, as well as lord high-chancellor and treasurer of England. He was several times engaged in embassies on the Continent, and became acquainted with many of the most eminent men of the time, particularly with the poet Petrarch. A portion of his correspondence with the latter has been preserved. At Oxford he founded a library for the use of the students, which he furnished with the best collection of books then in England, and appointed five keepers, to whom he granted yearly salaries. He died at his manor of Auckland, 24th April 1345, and was buried in the cathedral church of Durham. His works are—(1.) Philobiblon, containing directions for the management of his library at Oxford, and an elaborate eulogy of learning, written in very bad Latin,—first printed at Cologne 1473, then at Spires, 1483, and finally at Oxford, 1599; (2.) Epistoloe Familiarium, some of which are addressed to Petrarch; (3.) Orationes ad Principes, mentioned by Bale and Pits.
