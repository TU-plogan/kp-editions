ASCONIUS PEDIANUS, Quintus, author of some commentaries on Cicero, was born probably a year or two before the Christian era, and died about 83 a.d. He is supposed to have been a native of Padua. Some minor works ascribed to him have been lost; all that are now extant consist of commentaries on some of Cicero’s orations. These notes, written in very pure Latin, relate chiefly to matters of law, history, or antiquities, and are very valuable for the light they cast on some obscure parts of Cicero. As the commentaries on the Verrine orations deal more with questions of grammar, and do not show such purity of diction as the others, it has been conjectured that they are not the work of Asconius. The manuscript of the commentaries was discovered in 1416 by Poggio Bracciolini in the cellars of the convent of St Gall. He took a copy of it, from which, as the original has been lost, all subsequent reprints have been taken. The best recent edition is by Orelli and Baiter, forming part of their large edition of Cicero’s works. See also Madvig, De Asconii Pediani Commentariis Disputatio, Copenhagen, 1828.
