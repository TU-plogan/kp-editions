ASH (French, Frêne, German, Esche} is the name given to several kinds of trees. The taller or common ash (Fraxinus excelsior) belongs to the Natural Order Oleaceoe, the olive family. It is distinguished by its fruit, which is dry and winged. Normally the fruit should be two-celled and two-seeded; but generally, by abortion, there is only one cavity and one seed. The Hebrew word Oren, translated ash in Isaiah xliv. 14, cannot refer to an ash tree, as that is not a native of Palestine, but probably to the Syrian pine (Pinus halepensis). The ash is indigenous in Europe, and also extends to Asia. The tree is distinguished for its height and contour, as well as for its graceful foliage. It is one of the most useful of British trees as regards both timber and rapidity of growth. The tree attains a height of from 50 to 80 feet, and flowers in March and April, before the leaves are developed. It thrives best in a dry loamy soil, and, as it exhausts the soil in which it grows, it injures plants growing near it. The flowers grow in clusters, but are not showy. The leaves are compound, and unequally pinnate. A variety of ash, called Fraxinus heterophylla, diverse-leaved, has simple leaves. Another variety of ash is met with in which the branches are pendulous and weeping. Sometimes this variety is grafted on the tall stem of the common ash, so as to produce a pleasing effect. It is said that the weeping variety was first observed at Gamlingay, in Cambridgeshire. A variety also occurs with curled leaves, and another with warty stems and branches, called Fraxinτιs verrucosa. In Europe there is also a small-leaved ash, called Fraxinus parvifolia. In America there are several additional species—such as Fraxinus americana, the white American ash · F. j)ubescens, the black ash; and F. sam-bucifolia, the winter ash. Another plant which bears the name of ash is Fraxinus Ornus, or, more properly, Ornus europaea, the flowering or manna ash. Another species is Ornus rotundifoha, the round-leaved manna ash. The manna ash is a small tree found in Italy, and extending to Switzerland, South Tyrol, Hungary, Greece, Turkey, and Asia Minor. It also grows in the islands of Sicily, Corsica, and Sardinia. It blossoms early in summer, producing numerous clusters of whitish flowers. The word manna was first applied to the food supplied miraculously to the Israelites in the desert, but what it was cannot be determined. The name is now given to various saccharine exudations. The manna of commerce is collected almost entirely in Sicily from the manna ash. In order to get it, transverse cuts are made deep into the bark, so as to allow the manna to exude. The-best kind is called “flake” manna. It consists of manna sugar, or mannite. The mountain ash belongs to a totally different family from the common ash. It is called Pyms aucuparia, and belongs to the Natural Order P,osace<x, and the tribe Pomeae, which includes also apples, pears, <kc. Its common name in Scotland is the rowan tree, and it is well known by its succulent scarlet fruit. Pear trees are sometimes grafted on the mountain ash. The name of poison ash is given to Phus venenata, belonging to the Anacardiaceoe (Cashew family). The bitter ash of the West Indies is Simamba excelsa, which belongs to the Natural Family Simarubaceoe. The Cape ash is Ekebergia capensis, belonging to the Natural Order Meliaceae. The prickly ash, Xanthoxylon fraxineum, belongs to the Natural Order Xanthoxylaceoe.
