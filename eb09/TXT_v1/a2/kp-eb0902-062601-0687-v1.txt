ARNOLD, Samuel, a distinguished English composer, was born at London in 1740. He received a thorough musical education at the Chapel Royal under Dr Nares, and when little more than twenty years of age was appointed composer at Covent Garden Theatre. Here, in 1765, he produced his popular opera, The Maid of the Mill. In 1776 he transferred his services to the Haymarket Theatra In 1783 he was made composer to George III., and, ten years later, organist in Westminster Abbey, where, on his death in 1802, he was interred. His operas were very numerous and popular, but they have not lived. The best of them were The Maid of the Mill, Rosamond, Inkle and Yarico, The Battle of Hexham, The Mountaineers, He also wrote several oratorios, which have shared the fate of his operas. The first of them was The Cure of Saul, in 1767, which was very successful. The others are Abimelech, The Resurrection, and The Prodigal Son. In 1786 he began an edition of Handel’s works, which extended to 40 volumes, but was never completed. It is considered extremely inaccurate. He also published a continuation, in 4 volumes, of Dr Boyce’s Cathedral Music.
