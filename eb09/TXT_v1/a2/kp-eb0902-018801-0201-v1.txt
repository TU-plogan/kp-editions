APOLLONIUS, surnamed Tyanaeus, a Pythagorean philosopher, born at Tyana, the capital of Cappadocia, shortly before the Christian era. According to his biographer Philostratus, he studied grammar and rhetoric at Tarsus under Eu thy demus, but he soon left that gay and luxurious city for the quiet town of Aegae in the vicinity, where he spent his time in the company of philosophers and priests within the temple of Aesculapius. Among these he met Eυxenus, one of the followers of Pythagoras, and from him he learned with enthusiasm the doctrines of the Samian sage. While yet a mere youth he renounced all the ordinary pleasures of life. Abjuring the use of flesh and wine, he lived on the simple fruits of the soil, wore no clothing but linen and no sandals on his feet, suffered his hair to grow, and slept on the hard ground. He strictly observed the Pythagorean penance of five years’ silence, suffering often the most painful trials of his patience without a murmur. Philostratus relates so many wonderful stories of his hero—how on one occasion, for instance, he awed an excited populace to silence by the mere waving of his hands, how he performed many miracles with a word, and how he knew all tongues without ever having learned them—that some have questioned the very existence of Apollonius; while others, admitting with reason the fact of some such ascetic having lived about this time, regard him as a compound of magician, impostor, and religious fanatic.

After spending some time in the cities of Cilicia and Pamphylia, Apollonius extended his travels into the East, and wandered on foot over Assyria, Persia, and India, conversing with Magi, Brahmins, Gymnosophists, and priests, visiting the temples, preaching a purer morality and religion than he found, and attracting wherever he went admiration and reverence. At Nineveh he met with Damis, who became his adoring disciple and the companion of his journeyings, and left those doubtful records of his life which Philostratus made use of, and probably improved upon. The account of his exploits during his wanderings in India reads like the tales of the Arabian Nights; and where Damis cannot vouch for having seen the prodigies he mentions, he unhesitatingly adduces in support of them the authority of his master. From his visit to the Hill of Sages (described in the third book), Apollonius returned an accomplished sage himself, able to foretell earthquakes and eclipses, to cure the plague, to summon spirits from the unseen world, and to restore the dead to life.

On his return from the East he had the greatest reverence [9:2:189] paid him everywhere by Grecian priests and oracles. He visited Crete and Rome, where he astonished the magistrates by raising to life the dead body of a noble lady. Spain, Sicily, Egypt, Ethiopia, Greece, and Asia Minor became in time the scenes of his wanderings and his wonderworkings; and so distinguished had he become that even during his life he was raised almost to the rank of a divinity.

He is supposed to have died at Ephesus at a very great age, but his biographer finds it convenient to represent his end as involved in mystery, in order to heighten the reverence due to his hero. The words of the biographer are: “Here ends the history of Apollonius the Tyanaean, as written by Damis. Concerning the manner of his death, if he did die, the accounts are various.” Like Pythagoras, his master, he left no indication of his age; and Philostratus could not ascertain whether he died at Ephesus, or vanished at Lindus, or in Crete.

After his death Apollonius was worshipped with divine honours for a period of four centuries. A temple was raised to him at Tyana, which obtained from the Romans the immunities of a sacred city. His statue was placed among those of the gods, and his name was invoked as a being possessed of superhuman powers. The defenders of paganism, at the period of its decline, placed the life and miracles of Apollonius in rivalry to those of Christ; and some moderns have not hesitated to make the same comparison. There is no reason to suppose, however, that Philostratus entertained any idea of this sort in composing his life of Apollonius. That biography was undertaken by order of Julia, wife of the Emperor Severus, more than a century after the death of the subject of it; and it is extraordinary that Apollonius, if so renowned and widely known in his day, found no place in history for 120 years after his decease. The preamble of Philostratus, in which he professes to set forth things with which men were before unacquainted, is in striking contrast with the commencement of the Gospel of Luke.

Apollonius is not to be looked upon as a shallow and vulgar impostor, though to influence men’s minds he had recourse to artifices and pretensions unworthy of a true philosopher. With some of the spirit of a moral and religious reformer, he appears to have attempted, though vainly, to animate expiring paganism with a new and purer life. See Philostrδ,tus.
