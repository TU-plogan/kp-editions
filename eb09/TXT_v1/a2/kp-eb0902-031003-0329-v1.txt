ARAVALLI HILLS, a range of mountains in India, running for 300 miles in a north-easterly direction through the Râjputânâ states and the British districts of Mairwârâ and Ajmir, situated between 24° and 27° 10' N. lat., and between 72° and 75° E. long. They consist of a series of ridges and peaks, with a breadth varying from 6 to 60 miles, and an elevation of 1000 to 3000 feet, the highest point being Mount Abu, rising to 5655 feet, near the south-western extremity of the range. (See Abu.) The geology belongs to the primitive formation—granite, compact dark blue slate, gneiss, and sienite. Colonel Tod remarks the dazzling white effect of their peaks—an effect produced, not by snow, as among the Himalayas, but by enormous masses of vitreous rose-coloured quartz. On the north their drainage forms the Luni and Sakhi rivers, which fall into the Gulf of Cutch. To the south, their drainage supplies two distinct river systems, one of which debouches in comparatively small streams on the Gulf of Cambay, while the other unites to form the Chambal river, a great southern tributary of the Jamnâ, flowing thence, via the Ganges, into the Bay of Bengal on the other side of India. The Aravalli hills are for the most part bare of cultivation, and even of jungle. Many of them are mere heaps of sand and stone; others consist of huge masses of quartz heaped upon each other. The valleys between the ridges are generally sandy deserts, with an occasional oasis of cultivation. At long intervals, however, a fertile tract marks some great natural line of drainage, and among such valleys Ajmir city, with its lake, stands conspicuous. The hills are inhabited by a very sparse population of Mairs, an aboriginal race. For long these people formed a difficult problem to the British Government. Previous to our accession they had been accustomed to live, almost destitute of clothing, by the produce of their herds, by the chase, and by plunder. But Ajmir having been ceded to us in 1818, the Mair country was soon afterwards brought under British influence, and the predatory instincts of the people have at the same time been controlled and utilised by forming them into a Mairwârâ battalion. As the peaceful results of British rule developed, and the old feuds between the Mairs and their Râjput neighbours died out, the Mair battalion was transformed into a police force. The Aravalli mountaineers strongly objected to this change, and pled a long period of loyal usefulness to the state. They have accordingly been again erected into a military battalion, and brought upon the roll of the British army. The Aravalli hills send off rocky ridges in a north-easterly direction through the states of Alwar and Jaipur, which from time to time reappear in the form of isolated hills and broken rocky elevations to near Dehli.
