ANTIOPE (1), in Greek legend, the mother of Amphion and Zethus, was, according to the Odyssey (xi. 260), a daughter of the river god Asopus. In later poems, as in the Cyprτa, she is described as the daughter of Lycurgus, who appears as a king of Thebes. Her beauty attracted Jupiter, who, assuming the form of a satyr, took her by force. After this she was carried off by Epopeus, king of Sicyon, who would not yield his possession of her till compelled by her uncle Lycus. On the way home she gave birth, in the neighbourhood of Eleutherae, to the twins Amphion and Zethus, of whom the former, some supposed, was the son of the god, the other the son of Epopeus. Both were left to be brought up by herdsmen. At Thebes Antiope now suffered from the persecution of Dirce, the wife of Lycus, but at last escaped towards Eleutherae, and there found shelter, unknowingly, in the house where her two sons were living as herdsmen. Here she was discovered by Dirce, who ordered the two young men to tie her to the horns of a wold bull. They were about to obey, when the old herdsman, who had brought them up, revealed his secret, and they now carried out the punishment on Dirce instead. For this, it is said, Bacchus, to whose worship Dirce had been devoted, visited Antiope with madness, which caused her to wander restlessly all over Greece till she was cured, and thereafter married by Phocus of Tithorea, on Mount Parnassus, where at last both were buried. Their tomb is mentioned by Pausanias, ix. 17, 4, x. 32, 7.
