ARCHAeOLOGY, from αρχαίος, ancient, and λόγος, a description. The term Archaeology, like that of Antiquities, has been employed, until a very recent period, in a sense so restricted and arbitrary as strikingly to contrast with the latitude admissible according to the original derivation of the word. Literally it signifies the study of antiquity or ancient things; but its precise significance has been determined from time to time by the range of study and research most in favour. To some extent it has always been recognised as embracing whatever pertained to the early history of any nation, but in its details it was applied almost exclusively to the study of Greek and Roman art, or of classical antiquities generally. The progress of geology, and the application of sound principles of induction to the study of primitive antiquities, have wrought a great revolution, and few studies now rival archaeology in comprehensive interest.

In looking at the succession of strata of the earth’s crust it was assumed till recently that the student of man and his remains is limited to the latest superficial formation of post-tertiary strata. To the palaeontologist was assigned all ancient animal life of the fossiliferous strata, while the archaeologist treated of man and his works as things essentially distinct. The diverse functions of the two sciences are still clearly recognised; but the archaeologist is no longer supposed to be excluded either from quaternary or tertiary strata in his search not only for the remains of human art, but for the osteological evidences of man’s presence contemporaneous with the fauna of such geological periods. One class of archaeologists, accordingly, confidently anticipate the recovery not only of works of art, but of the fossil remains of man himself, in the pliocene, or even the miocene strata. So far, however, as any reliable evidence can guide opinion, it scarcely admits of question that neither has hitherto been found in older deposits than the later tertiary, or quaternary.

The actual remains of man, the specific form of his osseous structure, and above all of his skull, now receive the minutest attention; and the department of anthropology to which such investigations are specially assigned has latterly acquired a fresh interest from the inquiries suggested by novel theories as to the possible evolution of man from lower animal organisations. Nevertheless, the researches of the palaeontologist and of the archaeologist are based on essentially distinct evidence. The life of geological periods is investigated by means of the fossil bones and teeth which alone survive. Or if to these have to be added such illustrations of habits, food, and structure as are furnished by means of footprints, coprolites, and the like subsidiary evidence, still all are traceable, directly or indirectly, to the living organism. Man, on the contrary, in times altogether preceding history, is chiefly studied by means of his works. Archaeology thus forms the intermediate link between geology and history, though the reaction, at the revival of learning in the 16th century, which tended for a time to subordinate arts and science alike to classical authority, reduced it within greatly narrower limits. Nevertheless, the fitness of the term for the most comprehensive definition in relation to all which pertains to the past could not be entirely overlooked, and it is even employed repeatedly by Dr Prichard as nearly synonymous with palaeontology. In this, however, he has not been followed, and the name is now universally adopted to designate the science which deduces the history of man from the relics of the past. So comprehensive a subject necessarily admits of great subdivision. The most important general division will be treated of separately in the article on Classical Archaeology (p. 343, sqq.), while interesting branches of the study will be reviewed under the heads of Egyptian, Etruscan, Assyrian, Mexican, and Indian antiquities. Numismatics, pottery, heraldry, hieroglyphics, palaeography, and other subdivisions in lie manner deal with important details, and help to illustrate the comprehensiveness of the subject.

The innate cravings of the human mind for an insight into the future have shaped themselves into many forms of divination and astrology. But this desire is not more universal than that which prompts man to aim at a recovery of the secrets of the past. The question Whence Ï even more than that of Whitheri is found to give shape to the mythic legends of the rude barbarian, and to constitute an important element in the poetry and mythology of every nation’s oral and written history. With the progress of society such indices of the past are subjected anew to critical analyses; and we accordingly find abundant trace» of an archaeological spirit in the literature of every civilised nation. The influence of the same craving for a mastery of the past is seen adapting itself to the spirit of the age at every epoch of great progress. The revival of art and letters in the 14th and 15th centuries was signalised by a renewed appreciation of Greek and Roman models; and while the progress of opinion in the 16th century was accompanied by an abandonment of mediaeval for classic art, the tendency of Europe in our own day, amid many elements of progress, has been singularly consentaneous in the return not merely to mediaeval art, but to mediaeval modes and standards of thought, and in the attempt to attain to higher excellence than has been yet achieved by a more perfect development of the ideal of the middle ages.

The alliance of archaeology with geology, and the direction of geological research to the evidences of the antiquity of man, have largely contributed to its expansion, until in its comprehensive unity it embraces the entire range of human progress from the infantile stage of primeval arts to the earliest periods of written records. It has thus been developed into a systematic science, by which the intelligent investigator is enabled to pursue his researches with the aid of evidence older than all written chronicles, and tσ recover chapters of national infancy and youth heretofore-deemed beyond recall. The geologist, with no aid from written records, follows out his inquiries through successive periods of the earth’s history, and reveals the change» it has undergone, and the character of the living being» which animated epochs of the globe ages before man was-called into being. Beginning with the traces of life in the primary fossiliferous strata, he passes on from system to system, disclosing a vast succession of long extinct life, until in the latest diluvial formations he points to the remains of animals identical with existing species, and even to traces of human art—the evidence of the close of geological and the beginning of archaeological periods. Hero-archaeological science ought to be ready to take up the narrative, and with a more comprehensive minuteness of detail and greater certainty as to the conclusions arrived at. Such, however, until very recently, has not been the case. The geologist himself long confused the records of the transitional period by his mistaken reference of all diluvial traces to the Noachian deluge; and when, pausing, as he thus believed, at the dawn of the historic period, he turned to the archaeologist for the subsequent chapters of the history of life on our globe, it was only to receive a record of Roman traces at best but meagrely supplementing the [9:2:334] minuter details of the historian. Nearly the same was the case with all historic antiquity, with the single exception of the wonderful monuments of Egypt, which preserve to us the records of a civilisation in which we can recognise the origin of arts, letters, and all else to which the culture of the oldest historical nations may be traced.

Nevertheless, the evidences of the primitive arts, and the traces of a native civilisation originating among the prehistoric races of Europe, had been long familiar to the antiquary, though he failed to form any intelligent conception of their significance as historical records. Their interpretation on an intelligent and systematic principle is mainly due to the archaeologists and ethnologists of Denmark and Sweden, who from their very geographical position were happily freed from the confusing element of classical prejudices, and were compelled to seek in other than Roman sources an origin for the abundant traces of metallurgic art. Zealous British coadjutors speedily caught the hint, and freed themselves from the trammels which had so long narrowed their aim; the remains of primitive art were referred to true sources, or at least arranged under an intelligent system of chronological sequence; and thus the desultory and often misdirected labours of the antiquary have given place to researches characterised by scientific accuracy.

The system of primitive archaeology thus introduced has since been modified and carried out into ampler details, as the fruit of more extended discoveries, chiefly effected in France and England; but the three primary divisions, the Stone, the Bronze, and the Iron Periods, are still retained. The arrangement is warranted alike by evidence and by its practical convenience, though later research has given to the stone period a comprehensiveness undreamt of before, and so led to its subdivision into two ages of prolonged duration, with distinctive characteristics of primitive art. (1.) The Stone Period, as the name implies, is that in which the rude aboriginal arts, which the commonest necessities of man call into operation, are assumed to have been employed entirely on such available materials as stone, horn, bone, &c. (2.) The Bronze Period may in like manner admit of subdivision, though the term is conveniently employed, in its most comprehensive sense, for that era of progress in which the metallurgic arts appear to have been introduced and slowly developed—first, by the simple use of native copper, followed by the application of fire, the construction of moulds, and the discovery of such chemical processes as the alloying of copper and tin, and the consequent production of the beautiful and useful alloy which gives name to this the earlier metallurgic era. (3.) The Iron Period marks the era of matured metallurgic arts, and the accompanying progress consequent on the degree of civilisation which is the inevitable concomitant of such a state of things. While, however, those divisions hold good in their general application, they must not in every case be applied too rigidly. The archaeologist is constantly recalled to the* distinction between the researches of the palaeontologist, as dealing with the traces of organic life, and his own study of the works of a rational being marked by all the diversities traceable to the reasoning and volition of the individual workman. Local facilities have also modified the arts of primitive man in various ways. In some localities, as in North America, pure native copper abounds; while on the other hand, in certain districts of Africa iron occurs in such a condition that it appears to have been wrought by the primitive metallurgist from very remote times.

All those periods embrace eras concerning which no contemporary written records exist; and in relation to most of them nearly as little is known directly as of the older periods with which the geologist exclusively deals. It need not therefore excite surprise that the process of induction established on this basis has been challenged by historical writers of high standing, but whose exclusive labours on the records of periods admitting of documentary evidence and charter proof render them little disposed to sympathise with a course of reasoning relative to the history of man, such as has, in the hands of the geologist, revealed so much in relation to more ancient life. The further, however, that research is pursued, alike into the habits of living races of savages, and into the characteristics of the oldest traces of primitive art, the more clearly does such a process of development, from the first rude working in stone to the highest arts of the skilled metallurgist, become manifest.

The Australians, the Maories of New Zealand, and the whole widely-scattered races of the Polynesian Islands, the Caribs and other natives of the American archipelago, with all the nomade tribes of the New World, from Patagonia to the Arctic circle, were, when first discovered, without any knowledge of the metals as such, and supplied their wants by means of implements and weapons of stone, shell, bone, or wood. The civilised Mexicans and Peruvians, on the contrary, when first visited by the Spaniards in the 16th century, were familiar with the working of copper as well as gold,—though totally ignorant of iron, and also retaining for common purposes many of the primitive stone weapons and implements, only substituting the abundant obsidian of their volcanic region for flint. Greece passed from its bronze to its iron age within the period embraced in its literary history; and the mastery of the art of working the intractable iron ore is traceable with tolerable clearness in the early history of Rome, not very long before it came in contact with the trans-Alpine barbarians. Among most of the Germanic and Celtic tribes iron appears to have been already known when they first came in contact with the aggressive civilisation of the south; and from one of them, the Norici (in whose country, in the Austrian valleys of the Danube, this metal is still wrought with the highest skill), there is reason to believe that the Romans acquired the art of making steel.

If history is only to begin, as that of Britain has been made to do, with the date of the first collision with invading Rome, then, no doubt, stone and bronze periods are as meaningless as are eocene and miocene periods to the geologist who assigns the Mosaic deluge as the source of the earliest phenomena of his science. To those, however, who are willing to follow inductive reasoning to its legitimate conclusions it must be apparent that it is no visionary theory, but a system founded in well-established truth, which arranges the archaeological records of primitive history and the remains of human art into stone, bronze, and iron periods. Even here, however, an important distinction in the employment of such materials as a basis of inductive reasoning indicates the greatness of the revolution involved in the introduction among the living creatures inhabiting this earth of a being endowed with intelligence, and supplementing the natural resources of animal life by arts even of the most primitive kind. It must indeed be borne in remembrance that geological and historical chronology are very different things, and that the idea implied in the contemporaneousness of strata bears a very slight approximation to the coincidence of contemporaneous events and productions of an historical era. The doctrine of geological continuity is indeed challenged in certain respects; but on the whole, the geological formations, with their included organic remains, may be assumed to obey a natural and unvarying order; and so, within the compass of geological periods, to be of contemporaneous origin. But, notwithstanding certain extreme assumptions, based on the theory of evolution, and [9:2:335] involving the consequent existence of man in remote geological eras, so far as all actual evidence can yet guide us, it is correct to say that, geologically speaking, the entire history of man is embraced in one period. But in the works of art, which form the bases of archaeological induction, a new element—that of mind, or the reasoning faculty, along with the imitative and social arts—is introduced, and greatly complicates its subdivisions. The stone period of Britain or Denmark is analogous to that of the Polynesian Islands. So closely do their tools and weapons resemble each other that it requires a practised eye to distinguish the stone axe or flint lance-head found in an ancient British barrow from implements brought by some recent voyager from the islands of the Southern Ocean. Nor could the most experienced archaeologist undertake in every case to discriminate between the flint arrow-head dug from some primitive barrow of undated centuries before the Christian era, and the corresponding weapon brought by some recent traveller from Tierra del Fuego or regions beyond the Rocky Mountains. The inference is therefore legitimate, that in those Polynesians, Fuegians, or Indians of the North-West, we have examples of tribes in the same primitive stage as were the aborigines of Europe during its stone period. Chronologically, however, the stone period of Europe and that of the Pacific islands or the American continent are separated by thousands of years. In like manner, the bronze age of Mexico was undisturbed by all later elements when first brought into contact with the matured civilisation of Europe in the 16th century, while the close of that of Britain preceded the 1st century of our era. The same rule is applicable to the primitive archaeology of all countries; and a fertile source of error and misconception has already had its rise in the assumption that because Greece and Italy, Germany, Gard, Scandinavia, and Britain, have all had their primitive stone and bronze periods, therefore the whole must have been contemporaneous. It cannot therefore be too strongly enforced as one of the most essential points of variance in the reasoning of the geologist and the archaeologist, that the periods of the latter, though synonymous, are not necessarily synchronous; but that, on the contrary, nearly all the phenomena which pertain to the natural history of man, and to the historic development of the race, may be witnessed in their various stages in contemporary races of our own day—from rudimentary barbarism, and the absence of all arts essential to the first dawn of civilisation, to a state of greatest advancement in the knowledge and employment of such arts.

Some progress has already been made in an approximation to certain chronological data of much importance relative to such primitive periods of the history of nations. But the archaeologist, as well as the geologist, is learning to deal with periods of time which cannot always be measured either by years or centuries, but rather must be gauged by those chronological stages in the history of our planet in which epochs and periods take the place of definite subdivisions of solar time. Nevertheless, geological evidence of changes which are known to have occurred within the historic period supplies an important key to the approximate duration of certain eras characterised by traces of human art; and while by the intelligent observation of such remains in the superficial strata, mingling with the fossil evidences of extinct and familiar species of animal life, the link is supplied by which man takes his place in an unbroken chain of creative existence, sweeping back into so remote a past, the evidences of matured art pertaining to periods unrecorded by history supply later links of the same chain, and reunite the present with all former ages.

The system of primitive archaeology which is found applicable to British antiquities so closely corresponds in all its essential features to that of Europe prior to the era of authentic history, that the purpose of such an abstract as this will be most conveniently accomplished by presenting its leading points as examples of the whole, illustrating these in passing by the analogous remains discovered in other countries. The apparent simplicity of a primitive stone period has been considerably modified by recent research; and the careful study of the remains of ancient art, in their relation to accompanying geological phenomena, or of the evidences of artificial deposition in caves, barrows, chambered cromlechs, cairns, or other sepulchral structures, suggests the subdivision of prehistoric archaeology into a succession of epochs included within the period of non-metallurgic arts.

But before defining the archaeological subdivisions of time it is indispensable to glance at the palaeontological elements of the question, and the evidences they supply in relation to comparative chronology. One of the most remarkable phenomena affecting the conditions of life in Europe in recent geological epochs is the existence of a period, of long duration throughout the northern hemisphere, of a temperature resembling that of the Arctic regions at the present time. After a period more nearly approximating in its conditions the heat‘of the tropics at the present day, though otherwise under varying states towards the end of the tertiary epoch the temperature of the whole northern hemisphere gradually diminished, until the mountainous regions of Scotland and Wales—then probably of a much higher elevation—resembled Greenland at the present time; and this Arctic temperature gradually extended southwards to the Alps and the Pyrenees. The glaciers formed under the influence of perpetual frost and snow descended froπi those and other mountains into the valleys and plains over the greater portion of central Europe and northern Asia; and this condition of things, pertaining to what is known as the glacial period, was one of greatly prolonged duration.

After some partial modifications of this low temperature, and a consequent advance and retrocession of the glacial influences in France and elsewhere, along what was then the border lines of a north temperate zone, the glacial period drew to a close; a gradual but persistent rise of temperature carried the lines of ice and perpetual snow further and further northward, excepting in regions of great elevation, as in the Swiss Alps. This was necessarily accompanied by the melting of the vast glaciers accumulated in the mountain valleys throughout the protracted period of cold. The broken rocks and soil of the highlands were swept into the valleys’by torrents of melted ice and snow; the lower valleys were hollowed out and re-formed under this novel agent; and the landscape received its present outlines of valley, estuary, and river-beds from the changes wrought in this diluυian epoch. The enormous power of the torrents thus acting continuously throughout a period of prolonged duration, and the vast deposits of sand, gravel, and clay, with the embedded remains of contemporaneous animal and vegetable life with which they everywhere covered the plains, were viewed till recently solely in relation to the Mosaic narrative of a universal deluge, and were referred implicitly to that source. But recent though the epoch is when compared with older geological periods, its antiquity is enormous in relation to historic chronology; and instead of being the product of a sudden cataclysm of brief duration, it represents phenomena which required a period of long protracted centuries for their evolution.

Within this late tertiary, or quaternary, period are found the remains of animal life contemporary with primeval nιs,n and his earliest arts. The very characteristics of some of [9:2:336] the fossil mammals of the period, so diverse from all that vve have been accustomed to associate with man, help to suggest ideas of even an exaggerated antiquity for the era to which they are assignable, and to relegate it to the remotest conceivable antiquity consistent with all other evidence of the oldest traces of man or his arts seemingly contemporaneous with them. Of those now wholly extinct, the mammoth or Elephas primigenius, the Elephas antiquus, the Rhinoceros tichorinus, the Hippopotamus major, and such great cave carnivora as the Ursus speloeus and the Felis spelaea, are most noticeable for their great size, and in some cases for their enormous destructive powers, in striking contrast to the seemingly helpless condition of primitive man. Yet even some of those formidable mammalia probably owed their extinction fully as much to the presence of man as to any change in temperature and consequent alteration in the required conditions of climate and habitat. We are accustomed to regard the lion, tiger, leopard, panther, and others of the great Felidae as pertaining exclusively to tropical countries. They are in reality limited to tropical jungles and uncultivated regions of great extent, where the abundance of wild vegetablefeeding animals supplies their food. The existence of neither is compatible with the presence of man in any great numbers; but in his absence those beasts of prey greatly extend their range. The Indian tiger not only follows the antelope and deer in the Himalayan chain to the verge of perpetual snow, but the tiger, leopard, panther, and cheetah hunt their prey beyond that mountain range, even into Siberia.

The influence of man in the extirpation of the wild fauna is illustrated by another class of extinct animals of many historical regions, which yet survive in more favourable localities. The discovery of abundant evidence of a period in the history of central and southern France when the reindeer (Cervus tarandus) formed one of the chief sources both for the food of man and for the materials from which his weapons and implements were made, seems to carry us back to an era, inconceivably remote, when central France was in the condition of Lapland in mediaeval or still earlier centuries. But the climate of North Britain is not even now incompatible with the existence of the reindeer, and its favourite moss abounds in many parts of the Highlands. It need not therefore surprise us to learn that traces of the reindeer are by no means rare in Scotland; and numerous examples of its horns have recently been recovered in more than one Caithness locality, with the marks of sawing and cutting for artificial use, and lying among other remains i⅛ stone-built structures of a primitive population of North Britain. How old they are may not be strictly determinable, but they help us to the acceptance of a very modem date for the presence of the reindeer there; for Torfaeus states that so recently as the twelfth century the Jarls of Orkney were wont to crose the Pentland Firth to chase the roe and the reindeer in the wilds of Caithness. At the same date also we find the skin of the beaver rated for customs duties amongst articles of Scottish export specified in an Act of the reign of David I.

Another very characteristic animal pertaining to the prehistoric era of European man is the Megcbceros Hibernicus, or gigantic Irish elk. Its bones occurred with those of the Elephas primigenius, the Rhinoceros tichoτimιs, the Ursus speloeus, and other extinct mammals, alongside of human remains and works of art, in the famous Aurignac cave of the Pyrenees; and in the recently-explored Brixham cave, on the Devonshire coast, similar remains of the fossil rhinoceros, horse, and reindeer, as well as of several extinct carnivora, lay embedded in the same breccia with flint knives. And not only have the horns and bones of the Megaceros Hibernicus been recovered from Irish bogs and marl-pits, with marks of artificial cutting, but a rude Irish lyre, found in the moat of Desmond Castle, Adare, has been pronounced by Professor Owen to be made from the bone of this extinct deer.

So is it with the ancient Bovidae, not only adapted for the chase, but suitable for domestication; such as the Bos primigenius, the Bos longifrons, and the Bison priscus. Their remains have been found in submarine forests, or mingling in the drift or cave deposits with the Elephas primigenius, the Felis speloea, and others of the most gigantic fossil mammals; while abundant traces reveal their existence not merely contemporaneous with man, but within definite historical periods.

The great alluvial valley of the river Forth has yielded another class of relics connecting the gigantic fossil mammalia of a prehistoric epoch with man. The disclosures of the Carse of Falkirk have repeatedly included remains of the Elephas primigenius: and in at least one case its tusks were found in such perfect condition as to be available for the ivory-turner, though lying embedded at a depth of 20 feet in the boulder clay. But in the neighbouring valley of the Forth the fossil whale (Balaenoptera) has not only been repeatedly found far inland, buried in the alluvial soil, at levels varying from 20 to 25 feet above high-water mark, but in at least two instances the rude lance or harpoon of deer’s horn lay alongside of the skeletons; and near another of them were found pieces of stag’s horn, artificially cut, and one of them perforated with a hole about an inch in diameter. Flint implements, an oaken quern, and other ingenious traces of primitive art, recovered from the same alluvial soil, all tell of a time when the British savage hunted the whale in the shallows of a tide at the base of the Ochil hills, now between 20 and 30 feet above the highest tides and 7 miles distant from the sea.

There is no doubt that the disappearance of the whale from the British shores, like the reindeer from its northern valleys, is due far more to the presence of man than to any change of temperature so greatly affecting the conditions of life as to involve their extinction. Nevertheless it is convenient to recognise in the disappearance of-such emigrant species from the historic areas the close of the palaeontological age. The Urus, the Aurochs, the Bos longifrons, or native ox of the Roman period, and others of that important class of animals which man first began to turn to account for domestication, have also ceased to exist among European fauna; but this is clearly traceable to the destructive presence of man. Within three or four centuries the Urus (Bos primigenius') was still known in Germany; the Aurochs (Bos priscus) is even now preserved under special protection in Lithuania; and herds of British .wild cattle in Cadzow forest, Lanarkshire, and at Chillingham Park, Northumberland, perpetuate varieties otherwise extinct.

Reverting, then, to the classification which prehistoric archaeology admits of, in the light of its most recent disclosures, it appears to be divisible into four distinct epochs, of which the first two embrace successive stages of the age of stone implements.

1. The Palaeolithic Period is that which has also been designated the Drift Period. The troglodytes, or cave-dwellers, of this primitive era were to all appearance contemporaneous with the mammoth, the woolly-haired rhinoceros, and the great cave carnivora already named. In England, France, Belgium, and other countries of Europe, numerous caves have been explored which were undoubtedly the habitations and workshops of the men of this period. These caverns vary in character and dimensions according to the geological features of the localities where they occur; but all alike involve the simple feature [9:2:337] of recesses, more or less ample, affording comparatively dry and commodious shelter, and so being resorted to as places of habitation alike by wild animals and by man himself. But the most valuable for the purposes of the archaeologist are a class of caverns which occur in limestone districts, and which, from the combined mechanical action of the water operating on a rock easily eroded, and its chemical action when charged with a certain amount of carbonic acid in dissolving the calcareous rock, are found expanded into long galleries and chambers of large dimensions. There the same chemical agents, acting under other circumstances, have dissolved the limestone rock, and sealed up the ancient flooring at successive intervals, thereby furnishing a test of the duration of long periods of alternate action and repose, and yielding evidence of the most indisputable kind as to the order of succession of the various deposits and their included bones and implements.

In Belgium, at Dordogne, and in some parts of the south of France, the caves and rock-recesses are of a much simpler character. Yet there also favouring circumstances have preserved contemporary deposits of the ancient cave-dwellers, their works of art, the remains of their food, and even their cooking hearths.

The caves of the drift period accordingly present peculiarly favourable conditions for the study of the postpliocene period. Some of these caverns were evidently first occupied by the extinct carnivora of that period, as in i he case of the famous Kent’s Hole Cave of Devonshire, of which the lowest deposit is a breccia of water-worn rock and red clay, interspersed with numerous bones of the Ursus speloeus, or great cave-bear. Over this a stalag-mitic flooring had been formed, in some places to a depth of several feet, by the long-protracted deposition of carbonate of lime held in solution in the drippings from the roof. Above this ancient flooring, itself a work of centuries, later floods had superimposed a thick layer of “cave-earth,” in some cases even entirely filling up extensive galleries with a deposit of drift-mud and stones, within which are embedded the evidences of contemporaneous life—bones and teeth of the fossil elephant, rhinoceros, horse, cave-bear, hyaena, reindeer, and Irish elk; and along with these, numerous weapons and implements of chipped flint, horn, and bone—the unmistakable proofs of the presence of man. These, again, have been sealed down, in another prolonged period of rest, by a new flooring of stalagmite; and thus the peculiar circumstances of those cave deposits render them specially favourable for the preservation of a coherent record of the period. Here are the evidences of the animal life contemporaneous with the men of the caves during the drift period; here also are many of their smaller flint implements—the flint-cures and the chips and flint-flakes, showing where their actual manufacture was carried on; and the lances, bodkins, and needles of bone, which could only have been preserved under such favouring circumstances.

But besides the actual deposits in the caves, the river gravels of the same period have their distinct disclosures. The spear-heads, discs, scrapers, and other large implements of chipped flint are of rare occurrence in the cave breccia. Their size was sufficient to prevent their being readily dropt and buried beyond reach of recovery in the muddy flooring of the old cave dwelling; and the same cause preserved them from destruction when exposed to the violence involved in the accumulation of the old river drifts. In the north of France, and in England from Bedfordshire southward to the English Channel, in beds of ancient gravel, sand, and clay of the river valleys, numerous discoveries of large flint implements have been made—from the year 1797, when the first noted flint implements of the drift were discovered in the same stratified gravel of Hoxne, in Suffolk, in which lay bones of the fossil elephants and other extinct mammalia. The characteristics of the river-drift implements, as well as of the whole art of the stone age, have been minutely described and illustrated in various works, but especially in Evans’s Ancient Stone Implements, Weapons, and Ornaments of Great Britain. It is sufficient, therefore, to refer to such authorities for details.

But besides the numerous specimens of the manufactures in flint, horn, and bone, illustrative of the mechanical ingenuity of this primitive era, special attention is due to the actual evidences of imitative and artistic skill of the sculptors and draughtsmen of the same period.

Different attempts have been made, especially by French savans, to subdivide the palaeontologic age of man into a succession of periods, based chiefly on the character of the mammalian remains accompanying primitive works of art; and the two great subdivisions of the elephantine or mammoth age and the reindeer age have been specially favoured. Among the works of art of the cave-men of Perigord, in central France, contemporary with the reindeer, various drawings of animals, including the reindeer itself, have been found incised on bone and stone, apparently with a pointed implement of flint. But the most remarkable of all is the portrait of a mammoth, seemingly executed from the life, outlined on a plate of ivory found in the Madelaine Cave, on the river Vezère, by Μ. Lartet, when in company with Μ. Verneuil and Dr Falconer. If genuine—and the circumstances of the discovery, no less than the character of the explorers, seem to place it above suspicion—this most ancient work of art is of extreme value. The skulls and other remains of five individuals have been found to illustrate the men of this period. The cerebral development is good, and alike in features and form of head they compare favourably with later savage races. Their drawings embrace animals, single and in groups, including the mammoth, reindeer, horse, ox, fish of different kinds, flowers, ornamental patterns, and also ruder attempts at the human form. They also carved in bone and ivory. Some of the delineations are as rude as any recent specimens of savage art, others exhibit considerable skill; but the most remarkable of all is the representation of the mammoth. It has been repeatedly engraved, and as, to all appearance, a genuine contemporary effort at the portraiture of that remarkable animal, its worth is considerable. But this sinks into insignificance in comparison with its value as a gauge of the intellectual capacity of the men of that remote age. It represents the extinct elephant, sketched with great freedom of hand, and with an artistic boldness in striking contrast to the laboured efforts of an untutored draughtsman. Whatever other inference be deduced from it, this is obvious, that in intellectual aptitude the palaeolithic men of the reindeer period of central France were in no degree inferior to the average Frenchman of the 19th century.

2. This first or palaeolithic period, with its characteristic implements of chipped flint, belonging to an epoch in which man occupied central Europe contemporaneously with the mammoth, the cave-bear, and other long-extinct mammals, was followed by the second or Neolithic Period, or, as it has been sometimes called, the Surface-Stone Period, in contradiction to the Drift Period, characterised by weapons of polished flint and stone. The discovery and exploration of the ancient Pfahlbauten qt lake villages of Switzerland and other countries, including the crannoges of Ireland and Scotland, and of the kjökken-möddings or refuse-heaps of Denmark, Scotland, and elsewhere, have greatly extended the illustrations of this period, and given definiteness to the evidences of its antiquity. But while it thus includes works of a very remote epoch, it also [9:2:338] embraces those of later regular sepulture, with the sepulchral pottery of rudest type, the personal ornaments and other remains of the prehistoric races of Europe, onward to the dawn of history. It even includes the first traces of the use of the metals, in the employment of gold for personal adornment, though with no intelligent recognition of its distinction from the flint and stone in which the workmen of this neolithic period chiefly wrought.

The nearly indestructible nature of the materials in which the manufacturers alike of the palaeolithic and the neolithic period chiefly wrought, helps to account for the immense number of weapons and implements of the two prolonged ages of stone-working which have been recovered. The specimens now accumulated in the famous collection of the Christiansborg Palace at Copenhagen amount to several thousands. The Royal Irish Academy, the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, the British Museum, and other collections, in like manner include many hundreds of specimens, ranging from the remotest periods of the cave and drift men of western Europe to the dawn of definite history within the same European area. They include hatchets, adzes, gouges, chisels, scrapers, discs, and other tools in considerable variety; axes, lances, spear and arrow heads, mauls, hammers, and other weapons and implements of Avar and the chase; besides a variety of utensils, implements, and ornaments, with regard to which we can but vaguely guess the design of their construction. Many of these are merely chipped into shape, sometimes with much ingenuity, in other cases as rudely as the most barbarous and massive implements of the palaeolithic period. But from their association, in graves or other clearly-recognised deposits of the later period, with ground and polished implements, and even occasionally with the first traces of a time when the metals were coming into use, there is no room to question their later origin. In part they may be legitimately recognised, like the whole elements of archaeological classification, to mark different degrees of rudeness in successive steps towards civilisation; in part they indicate, as in manufactures of our own day, the economy of labour in roughly-fashioned implements designed only for the rudest work, or for missiles the use of which involved their loss.

To the same primitive period of rude savage life must be assigned the rudiments of architectural skill pertaining to the Megalithic Age. Everywhere we find traces, alike throughout the seats of oldest civilisation and in earliest written records, including the historical books of the Old Testament Scriptures, of the erection of the simple monolith, or unhewn pillar of stone, as a record of events, a monumental memorial, or a landmark. There is the Tanist Stone, or kingly memorial, like that set up in Shechem when Abimelech was made king; the Hoar Stone, or boιmdary-stone, like “the stone of Bohan, the son of Reuben,” and other ancient landmarks of Bible story; the Cat Stone, or battle-stone, a memorial of some great victory; and the stone set up as the evidence of some special treaty or agreement, like Laban and Jacob’s pillar of witness at Galeed. To the same primitive stage of architecture belong the cromlech, the cairn, the chambered baιτow, and other sepulchral structures of unhewn stone; as well as the weems, or megalithic subterranean dwellings common in Scotland and elsewhere, until, with the introduction of metals and the gradual mastery of metallurgic art, we reach the period of partially hewn and symmetrical structures, of which the great temple of Stonehenge is the most remarkable example. But it is in Egypt that megalithic architecture is seen in its most matured stage, with all the massiveness which so aptly symbolises barbarian power, but also with a grandeur, due to artistic taste and refinement, in which the ponderous solidity of vast megalithic structures is relieved by the graces of colossal sculpture and of an inexhaustible variety of architectural detail. There appears to be a stage in the development of the human mind in its progress towards civilisation when an unconscious aim at the expression of abstract power tends to beget an era of megalithic art. The huge cromlechs, monoliths, and circles still abounding in many centres of European civilisation perpetuate the evidence of such a transitional stage among its prehistoric races. But it was in Egypt that an isolation, begot by the peculiar conditions of its unique physical geography, though also perhaps ascribable in part to certain ethnical characteristics of its people, permitted this megalithic art to mature into the highest perfection of which it is capable. There the rude unhewn monolith became the graceful obelisk, the cairn was transformed into the symmetrical pyramid, and the stone circles of Avebury and Stonehenge, or the megalithic labyrinths of Carnac in Brittany, developed into colonnaded avenues and temples, like those of Denderah and Edfu, or the colossal sphinx avenue of Luxor.

Elaborately-finished axes, hammer-heads, cups, and vases of the late neolithic era serve to illustrate the high stage to which the arts of a purely stone period could be advanced, in the absence of any process of arrestment or change. But long before such a tendency to development into ornamental detail and symmetrical regularity of construction could be brought to bear on the megalithic architecture of the same era, the metallurgic sources of all later civilisation had begun to supersede its rude arts. To such remote eras we strive in vain to apply any definite chronology. At best we work our way backwards from the modem or known into the mysterious darkness of remotest antiquity, where it links itself to unmeasured ages of geological time. But by such means science has been able to add a curious chapter to the beginnings of British and of European story, involving questions of mysterious interest in relation to the earliest stages in the history of man. The very characteristics which distinguish him in his rudest stage from all other animals have helped from remotest times to perpetuate the record of his progress.

The evidences of the various acquirements and degrees of civilisation of the prehistoric races of Britain are derived not only from weapons, implements, pottery, and personal ornaments found deposited in ancient dwellings and sepulchres; but from still older traces supplied by chance discoveries of the agriculturist, miner, and builder, such as the implements of the ancient whalers of the Forth, or the monoxylous oaken canoes dug up from time to time in the valley of the Clyde, or even beneath some of the most ancient civic foundations of Glasgow. Both alike pertain to areas of well-defined historical antiquity, from the very dawn of written history, or of literate chronicles in any form; and both also have their geological records, preserving the evidence of changes of level in unrecorded centuries subsequent to the advent of man, when the whales of the Forth and the canoes of the Clyde were embedded in the alluvium of those river-valleys, and elevated above the ancient tide-marks of their estuaries. Another change of level, possibly in uninterrupted continuance of the ancient upheaval, has been in progress since the Roman invaders constructed their military roads, and built their wall between the Forth and the Clyde, in the 1st and 2d centuries of the Christian era.

By evidence such as this a starting-point is gained whence we may confidently deduce the colonisation of the British Islands, and of the north of Europe, at periods separated by many centuries from that in which our island first figures in history. The researches of the ethnologist add to our knowledge of this unrecorded era, by disclosing some of the physical characteristics of the aboriginal [9:2:339] races, derived from human remains recovered in cave-drifts, ancient mining shafts, bogs, and marl-pits, or found in the most ancient sepulchres, accompanied by rudest evidences of art; and the researches of Nillson, Eschricht, Gosse, Rathke, Broca, and other Continental ethnologists, along with those which have been carried on with minute care in the British Islands, disclose characteristic cranial types indicating a succession of prehistoric races different from the predominant types belonging to the historical period of Europe; and some of them probably contemporaneous with the changes indicated in the periods of archaeological time.

The very latest stage of archaeological antiquity, when it seems to come in contact with the dawn of historic time, was unquestionably one of complete barbarism, as is sufficiently apparent from its correspondence to that which the intercourse with European voyagers is bringing to a close among the islands of the Pacific. The ancient Scottish subterranean dwellings termed weems (Gaelic uamluιlι, a cave), or “Picts’ houses,” have been frequently found, apparently in the state in which they must have been abandoned by their original occupants; and from those we learn that their principal aliment must have been shellfish and Crustacea, derived from the neighbouring sea-beach, along with the chance products of the chase. The large accumulations of the common shell-fish of our coasts found in some of those subterranean dwellings is remarkable; though along with such remains the stone quern or handmill, as well as the ruder corn-crusher or pestle and mortar, repeatedly occur; supplying the important evidence that the primitive nomade had not been altogether ignorant of the value of the cereal grains.

The source of change in Britain, and throughout Europe, from this rude state of barbarism, is clearly traceable to the introduction of metals and the discovery of the art of smelting ores. Gold was probably the earliest metal wrought, both from its attractive appearance, and from its superficial deposits, and the condition in which it is frequently found, rendering its working an easy process. Tin also, in the south of Britain, was wrought at the very dawn of history: and, with the copper which abounds in the same district of country, supplied the elements of the new and important compound metal, bronze.

3. This accordingly indicates the transition from the later stone age to the third or Bronze Period, which, beginning apparently with the recognition of the native copper as a malleable metal, and then as a material capable of being melted and moulded into form by the application of heat, was followed up by the art of smelting the crude ores so as to extract the metal, and that of mixing metals in diverse proportions so as to prepare an alloy of requisite ductility or hardness, according to the special aims of the artificer.

Along with the full mastery of the working in copper and bronze the skill of the goldsmith was correspondingly developed; and the ornaments of this period, including torques, armlets, beads, and other personal decorations and insigma of office, wrought in gold, are numerous, and often of great beauty. The pottery of the same period exhibits corresponding improvement in material, form, and ornamentation; though, considering the mimetic and artistic skill shown in the drawings and carvings of the remotest periods, it is remarkable that the primitive pottery of Europe is limited, alike in shape and decoration, to purely arbitrary forms. This in its crudest conventionalism consists almost exclusively of varieties of zigzag patterns scratched or indented on the soft clay. This primitive ornamentation seems so natural, as the first esthetic promptings of the human mind, that it is difficult, if not in some cases impossible, to distinguish between the simple pottery of comparatively recent origin, recovered on the sites of old American Indian villages, and primitive pottery obtained from British barrows pertaining to centuries long prior to the Christian era. But the fictile ware exhibits an improvement in some degree corresponding to that of the metallurgic art, which everywhere throughout Europe furnishes weapons, implements, and personal ornaments of the bronze period, characterised by much grace and delicacy in form, and by an ornamentation peculiar in style, but not unworthy of the novel forms and material.

It was long assumed, alike by historians and antiquaries, that the beautiful bronze swords, spear-heads, shields, torques, armillae, <fcc., so frequently discovered, were mere relics of foreign conquest or barter, and they were variously assigned to Egyptian, Phoenician, Roman, or Danish origin. But this gratuitous assumption has been disproved by the repeated discovery of the moulds for making them, as well as of the refuse castings, and even of beds of charcoal, scoriae, and other indications of metallurgy, on the sites where they have been found. It has not escaped notice, however, that the transition appears to be an abrupt one from stone to bronze, an alloy requiring skill and experience for its use; and that few examples are recorded of the discovery of copper tools or weapons, though copper is a metal so easily wrought as to have been in use among the Red Indians of America. The inference from this fact is one which all elements of probability tend to confirm, viz., that the metallurgic arts of the north of Europe are derived from a foreign source, whether by conquest or traffic; and that in the beautiful bronze relics so abundant, especially in the British Islands and in Denmark, we see the fruits of that experience which the more ancient civilisation of Egypt and Phoenicia had diffused. The direct intercourse between the countries on the Mediterranean and the Cassiterides, or Tin Islands,—as the only known parts of the British Islands are called in the earliest allusions which are made to them by Herodotus, Aristotle, and Polybius,— abundantly accounts for the introduction of such knowledge to the native Britons at a veιy remote period. Phoenician and Carthaginian merchant ships traded to Cornwall centuries before the white cliffs of Albion were first seen from the Roman war-galleys. Greece also, not improbably, proved a mediator in this all-important transfer. It is at least to be noted that the forms of weapons, and especially of the beautiful “leaf-shaped sword,” as figured on the most ancient painted Greek vases, closely correspond to the most characteristic relics of the bronze period in the north of Europe and the British Isles.

In reviewing the characteristics of tlιis bronze period, the disclosures of native art on the American continent supply some singularly interesting and suggestive illustrations. There, throughout the whole northern regions of the North American continent and in the ruder areas of South America, as well as in the West Indian archipelago, a population was found consisting exclusively of rude nomad hunters, in a pure stone period of primitive savage art. Nor does it at all conflict with this that they were to a certain extent familiar with the resources of the rich copper regions of Lake Superior, where that metal is found in enormous masses in a malleable state. This they procured, and not only themselves employed it in the manufacture of weapons, implements, and personal ornaments, but distributed it by barter far down the Ohio and Mississippi valleys, and eastward to the great lakes, to the St Lawrence valley, and to the Hudson river. Silver and lead are also found in the same rich mineral region in metallic crystals, and were not unknown to the nativo tribes. But everywhere those metals were cold-wrought, as a mere malleable stone capable of being hammered into any desired shape, [9:2:340] but in total ignorance of the influence of fire or the use of alloys.

But wholly distinct from its rude Indian tribes, North America had its semi-civilised Mexicans and South America its more highly civilised Peruvians, who had learned to mine and smelt the ores of the Andes, and make metallic alloys wherewith to fashion for themselves bronze tools of requisite hardness for quarrying and hewing the solid rock. With these they sculptured the statues of their gods, and reared palaces, temples, and pyramids, graven with elaborate sculptures and hieroglyphics by a people wholly ignorant of iron, which have not unjustly suggested many striking analogies with the megalithic art of ancient Egypt. The huacas, or tombs of the Incas of Peru, and also their royal depositories of treasure, have disclosed many remarkable specimens of elaborate metallurgic skill,—bracelets, collars, and other personal ornaments of gold; vases of the same abundant precious metal, and also of silver; mirrors of burnished silver, as well as of obsidian; finely-adjusted silver balances; bells both of silver and bronze; and numerous common articles and tools of copper, or of the more efficient alloy of copper and tin,—all illustrative of the arts and civilisation of a purely bronze age.

4. The fourth or Iron Period is that in which the art of Smelting the ores of the most abundant metal had at length been mastered; and so iron superseded bronze for arms, sword-blades, spear-heads, axes, daggers, knives, &c. Bronze, however, continued to be applied to many purposes of personal ornament, home furniture, the handles of swords and other weapons; nor must it be overlooked that flint and stone were still employed for lance and arrow-heads, sling-stones, and other common purposes of warfare or the chase, not only throughout the whole bronze period, but far into the age of iron. Tho discovery of numerous arrow-heads, or flakes of black flint, on the plain of Marathon, has been assumed with good reason to point to the use of such rude weapons by the barbarian host of Darius; and the inference is confirmed by the facts which Herodotus records, that Ethiopian auxiliaries of the army of Xerxes, ten yeara later, were armed with arrows tipped with stone.

The essential change resulting from the maturing of the iron period lies in the unlimited supply of the new metal. Had bronze been obtainable in sufficient quantity to admit of its application to the endless purposes for which iron has since been employed, the mere change of metal would have been of slight significance. But the opposite was the case. The beautiful alloy was scarce and costly; and hence the arts of the neolithic period continued to be practised throughout the whole duration of the age of bronze. But iron, though so abundant in its ores, requires great labour and intense heat to fuse it; and it needed the prolonged schooling of the previous metallurgic era to prepare the way for the discovery of the properties of the ironstone, and the processes requisite to turn it to account. Iron, moreover, though so abundant, and relatively of comparatively recent introduction, is at the same time the most perishable of metals. It rapidly oxidises unless protected from air and moisture, and hence few relics of this metal belonging to the prehistoric period have been preserved in such a state as to illustrate the skill and artistic taste of the fabricators of that last pagan era, in the way that the implements of the three previous periods reveal to us the habits and intellectual status of those older times.

But the iron is the symbol of a period in which pottery, personal ornaments of the precious metals, works in bronze, in stone, and other durable materials, supply ample means of gauging the civilisation of the era, and recognising the progress of man in the arts, until we come at length to connect their practice with definite historical localities and nations, and the names of Egypt and Phoenicia, of Gadir, Massilia, the Cassiterides, and Noricum, illuminate the old darkness, and we catch the first streak of dawn on a definite historical horizon. Thus, with the master}’ of the metallurgic arts is seen the gradual development of those elements of progress whereby the triumphs of civilisation have been finally achieved, and man has advanced towards that stage in which the inductive reasonings of the archaeologist are displaced by records more definite, though not always more trustworthy, as the historian begins his researches with the aid of monumental records, inscriptions, poems, and national chronicles.

Within the later iron period, accordingly, we reach the era of authentic history. There is no room for doubt that, whatever impetus the Roman invasion may have given to the working of the metals in Britain, iron was known there prior to the landing of Julius Caesar. Within this archaeological period, however, the examples of Roman art and the influences of Roman civilisation begin to play a prominent part. To this period succeed the Saxon and Scandinavian eras of invasion, with no less characteristic peculiarities of art workmanship, as well as of sepulchral rites and social usages. In these later periods definite history comes to the aid of archaeological induction, while those intermediate elements of historical re-edification, the inscriptions on stone and metal, and the numismatic series of chronological records, all unite to complete a picture of the past replete with important elements for the historian.

The connection between archaeology and geology has been indicated, but that between archaeology and ethnology is of much more essential significance, and is every day being brought into clearer view. By the investigation of the tombs of ancient races, and the elucidation of their sepulchral rites, remarkable traces of unsuspected national affinities are brought to light; while a still more obvious correspondence of arts in certain stages of society, among races separated alike by time and by space, reveals a uniformity in the operation of certain human instincts, when developed under nearly similar circumstances, such as goes far to supply a new argument in proof of the unity of the human race.

The self-evident truths confirmatory of the principles upon which this system of primitive archaeology is based, may be thus briefly summed up :—Man, in a savage state, is to a great extent an isolated being; co-operation for mutual and remote advantage, except in war and the chase, is scarcely possible; and hence experience at best but slowly adds to the common stock of knowledge. In this primitive stage of society the implements and weapons which necessity renders indispensable are invariably supplied from the sources at hand; and the element of time being of little moment, the rude workman fashions his stone axe or hammer, or his lance of flint, with an expenditure of labour such as, with the appliances of civilisation, woιdd suffice for the manufacture of hundreds of such implements.

The discovery of the metallurgic arts, by diminishing labour and supplying a material more susceptible of varied forms as well as of ornamentation, and also one originating co-operation by means of the new wants it calls into being, inevitably begets social progress. The new material, moreover, being limited in supply, and found only in a few localities, soon leads to barter, and thence to regular trade; and thus the first steps towards a division of labour and mutual co-operation are made. So long, however, as the metal is copper or bronze, the limited supply must greatly restrict this social progress, while the facilities for working [9:2:341] il admit of that isolation so natural to man in a rude state; and these, added to the frequent discovery of copper, in its natural condition much more nearly resembling a ductile metal than the ironstone, abundantly account for its use having preceded that of the more abundant metal.

Great experience must have been acquired in earlier metallurgy before the iron ore was attempted to be wrought. In this, co-operation was indispensable; but that once secured, and the first difficulties overcome, the other results appear inevitable. The supply is inexhaustible, widely diffused, and procurable without excessive labour. The material elements of civilisation were thereby rendered available, and all succeeding progress might be said to depend on the capacity of the race.

The simplicity which characterises the archaeological disclosures of Scandinavia, Germany, Ireland, and other regions of trans-Alpine Europe lying outside of the range of ancient Greek or Roman influences, has contributed some important aids to the study of prehistoric arts; but the full significance of their teachings has yet to be tested by comparison with the primitive arts pertaining to Egypt, Greece, Asia Minor, and other ancient centres of earliest civilisation. To this certain singularly interesting disclosures of very recent date, which some have regarded as at variance with the foregoing classification of archaeological epochs, help to furnish the desired materials. The researches of Dr Heinrich Schliemann on one of the most memorable sites which epic poetry has selected for the mythic beginnings of history, have brought to light what he believes to be actual remains of the Troy of the Iliad. Dr Schliemann began his systematic explorations in 1871, and pursued them, during the available seasons, till the month of June 1873. With patient assiduity the accumulated debris on the scene of ancient civic settlement was sifted and opened up by regular excavations, till the natural rock was exposed at a depth of upwards of 50 feet. Throughout the whole of this, abundant traces of former occupation were brought to light; and so great an accumulation of debris and rubbish upon an elevated site affords undoubted evidence of the vicissitudes of a long-settled centre of population. To this specific evidence lent additional confirmation. The foundations of a temple, supposed to be that of the Ilian Athena of the time of Alexander, along with coins, inscriptions, and numerous remains of architecture and sculpture, combined to fix the era of an ancient, but strictly historical, period. At a further depth of upwards of 6 feet, broken pottery, implements of bronze, and charred wood and ashes, showed the traces of an older settlement which had perished by fire. But the artificial character of the debris encouraged further research; and when the excavations had been carried to about double the depth, Dr Schliemann came upon a deposit rich in what may be styled neolithic remains: axes, hammers, spear-heads, and other implements of polished diorite or other stone, weights of granite, querns of lava, and knives and saws of flint abounded, associated with plain, well-executed pottery, but with only two pins of copper or bronze to indicate any knowledge of metal. Continued excavations brought to light additional stone implements and weapons; until at a depth of some 33 feet, well-wrought implements and weapons of bronze, and pottery of fine quality and execution, revealed the traces of au earlier civilisation on the same ancient site.

In all this, while there is much to interest, there is nothing to surprise us. Here, near the shores of the Hellespont, at a point accessible to the oldest known centres of civilisation,—to Egypt, Phoenicia, Assyria, Greece, Carthage, and Rome,—a civilised community, familiar with the arts of the bronze period of the Mediterranean shores, appears to have yielded to vicissitudes familiar enough to the student of ancient history. After a time the desolated locality tempted the settlement of some barbarian Asiatic horde, such as the steppes of that continent could furnish even now. They were ignorant of metallurgic arts; though probably, like the savage tribes of the New World at the present time, not wholly unaware of the manufacture of implements and weapons of bronze or other metals. Such a local alternation of bronze and stone periods in a region lying in close proximity alike to vast areas of Asiatic barbarism, and to the most important centres of ancient civilisation', in no degree conflicts with a general system of succession of archaeological periods. Mexico and Peru, while in a purely bronze age, were overthrown by Spanish invaders. Large portions of their ancient territories were abandoned to utter barbarism, and even now are in the occupation of savage tribes. But the ancient city of Montezuma has been made the capital of a civilised state; the beds of its canals have been filled up, buιying therein obsidian, stone, and bronze implements, pottery, sculptures, and much else pertaining to its ante-Columbian era; and it only requires such a fate as its modem history renders conceivable enough, to leave for future ages the buried strata of a civic site revealing similar evidences of the alternation of semi-civilised, barbarian, and civilised ages, on the same long-inhabited site of Toltecans and Aztecs, Indian savages, and modern Mexicans and Spaniards.

That man has everywhere preceded history is a self-evident truth. So long as no scientific evidence seemed to conflict with a long-accepted chronology in reference to the antiquity assigned to the human race, it remained unchallenged, though the like computation had been universally rejected in reference to the earth as the theatre of his history, and we were content to regard the prehistoric era of man as no more than a brief infancy of the race. But the investigations and disclosures of recent years in reference to the whole prehistoric period have involved of necessity a reconsideration of the grounds on which a definite antiquity of comparatively brief duration has been assigned to man; and the tendency at present is rather to exaggerate than to diminish the apparent antiquity of the race. The nature and extent of the evidence which has thus far rewarded intelligent research have been sufficiently indicated above; and as it is still far from complete, the student of archaeology will act wisely in pushing forward his researches, and accumulating and comparing all available evidence, without hastily pronouncing any absolute verdict on this question. But, without attempting to connect with any historic chronology the men of the English drift, or the troglodytes of the mammoth or reindeer periods of France, it may be useful, in concluding this summary of primitive archaeology, to glance at the origin of civilisation, and the evidences of the antiquity of what appear to constitute its essential elements.

Everywhere man seems to have passed through the same progressive stages: First, that of the savage or purely hunter state; a condition of precarious instability, in which man is most nearly in the state of a mere animal subsisting on its prey. It is the condition of nomad life, incompatible with a numerous or settled population; exhausting the resources of national being in the mere straggle for existence, and therefore inimical to all accumulation of the knowledge and experience on which human progress depends. In tins primitive state, man is disclosed to us by the evidence with which the archaeologist now deals. He appears everywhere in this first stage as the savage occupant of a thinly-peopled continent, warring with seemingly inadequate means against gigantic carnivora, the contemporary existence of which is known to us only by the disclosures of geological strata or ossiferous [9:2:342] cave3, where also the remains of still more gigantic herbi-vora confirm the idea of man’s exhaustive struggle for existence. The nearest analogy to such a state of life is that of the modern Esquimaux, warring with the monstrous polar bear, and making a prey of the gigantic cetaceae of Arctic seas. Through how many ages this unhistoric night of European man may have preceded the dawn of civilisation it is at present vain to speculate. But this is noticeable, that there is no inherent element of progress in a people in the condition of the Esquimaux. To all appearance, if uninfluenced by external impulse, or unaffected by any great amelioration of climate, they are likely to prolong the mere struggle for existence through unnumbered centuries, armed, as now, with weapons and implements ingeniously wrought of bone, ivory, and stone, the product of the neolithic arts of this 19th century.

To this succeeds the second or pastoral state, with its flocks and herds, its domesticated animals, and its ideas of personal property, including in its earlier stages that of property in man himself. It pertains to the open regions and warmer climates of the temperate zone, and to the elevated steppes and valleys of semi-tropical countries, where the changing seasons involve of necessity the wandering life of the shepherd. This accordingly prevents the development of the arts of settled life, especially those of architecture; and precludes all idea of personal property in the soil. But the conditions of pastoral life are by no means incompatible with frequent leisure, reflection, and consequent intellectual progress. Astronomy has its origin assigned to the ancient shepherds of Asia; and the contemplative pastoral life of the patriarchs Job and Abraham has had its counterpart in many an Arab chief of later times.

The third or agricultural stage is that of the tillers of the soil, the Aryans, the ploughers and lords of the earth, among whom are developed the elements of settled social life involved in the personal homestead and all the ideas of individual property in land. The process was gradual. The ancient Germans, according to the description of Tacitus, led the life of agricultural nomads; and such was the state of the Visigoths and Ostrogoths of lateι∙ centuries. But this was in part due to the physical conditions of trans-Alpine Europe in those earlier centuries. Long ages before that, as the ancient Sanscrit language proves, the great Aryan family, of which those are offshoots, had passed from the condition of agricultural nomads to that of lords of the soil among a settled agricultural people. They had followed up the art of ploughing the soil with that of shipbuilding and “ploughing” the waves. They were skilled in sewing, in weaving, in the potter’s art, and in masonry. Their use of numbers was carried as high at least as a hundred before they settled down from their nomad life. They had domesticated the cow, the sheep, the horse, and the dog; and their pasu or feeders already constituted their their wealth, before the pecunia assumed its later forms of currency. They had also passed through their bronze and into their iron period; for their language shows that they were already acquainted with the most useful metals as well as with the most valuable grains.

The whole evidence of history points to the seats of earliest civilisation in warm climates, on the banks of the Nile, the Euphrates, the Tigris, the Indus, and the Ganges. The shores of the Mediterranean succeeded in later centuries to their inheritance, and were the seats of long-enduring empires, whose intellectual bequests are the life of all later civilisation. But trans-Alpine Europe, which is now yielding up to us the records of its prehistoric ages, is entirely of modern growth so far as its historic civilisation is concerned, and wherever it extends towards the northern verge of the temperate zone it is even now in its infancy. Here, then, we trace our w ay back to the first progressive efforts of reason, and find man primeval, in a state of nature, in the midst of the abundance pertaining to a genial and fertile climate, which rather stimulates his aesthetic faculty than enforces him by any rigorous necessity to cultivate the arts for the purposes of clothing and building. Thus employing his intellectual leisure, he begins that progressive elevation which is as consistent with his natural endowments as a rational being as it is foreign to the instincts of all other animals. He increases and multiplies, spreads abroad over the face of the earth, clears its forests, drains its swamps, makes its rivers and seas his highways, and its valleys and plains his fertile fields and pasture-grounds. Cities rise, with all the fostering influences of accumulated wealth and settled leisure, and with all the stimulating influences of acquired tastes and luxurious desires. The rude pictorial art—not ι*uder on the graven ivory of the troglodytes of the Aladelaine cave than on many a hieroglyphic drawing of the catacombs and temples of Egypt— employed in picture-writing, passes by a natural and inevitable transition from the literal representations of objects to the symbolic suggestion of ideas, to a wordalphabet, and then to pure phonetic signs. The whole process is manifest from the very infancy of Egyptian picture-writing, as crude as that with which the Indian savage still records his deeds of arms on his buffalo-robe, or carves the honours of the buried warrior on his grave-post Letters lie at the foundation of all high and enduring civilisation, yet we can thus trace them back to their infantile origin; and so onward in their slow transformations, as in the mingled pictorial and phonetic writing of the Rosetta stone hieroglyphics of the age of the Ptolemies. Through Phoenician, Greek, and Roman modifications, they have come down to us as the arbitrary symbols of sounds which the voice combines into articulate speech.

And as it is with letters so it is with man’s arts,— his drawing, carving, sculpture, architecture, weaving, pottery, metallurgy; and so with his science, —his astrology, astronomy, geometry, alchemy, and all else. The beginnings of all of them lie within our reach. We can trace back the measurements of solar time to the crudest beginnings of more than one ancient nation, with a year of 360 days. This, corrected to the definite approximation to the true solar year of a period of 365 days, became the vague year of the Egyptians, with the great Sothiac cycle of 1460 years, clearly pointing to a system of chronology which could not have been perpetuated through many centuries without conflicting with the most obvious astronomical phenomena as well as with the recurring seasons of the year.

Alan is, after all, according to the boldest speculations of the geologist, among the most modern of living creatures. If indeed the theory of evolution from lower forms of animal life is accepted as the true history of his origin, time may well be prolonged through unnumbered ages to admit of the process which is to develop the irrational brute into man. But regarding him still as a being called into existence as the lord of creation, endowed with reason, the demonstration of a prolonged existence of the race, with all its known varieties, its diversities of language, and its wide geographical distribution under conditions so diverse, tends to remove greater difficulties than it creates. No essential doctrine, or principle in morals, is involved in the acceptance or rejection of any term of duration for the human race; and the idea of its unity, which for a time was scornfully rejected from the creed of the ethnologist, is now advocated by the evolutionist as alone consistent with the physical, mental, and moral characteristics common to savage and civilised man, whether we study him amid [9:2:343] the traces of palaeolithic osteology and arts, or among the most diverse races of living men.

The process of research and inductive reasoning thus applied by the archaeologist to the traces of primitive art and the dawn of civilisation, is no less applicable to all periods. The songs and legends of the peasantry, the half-obliterated traces of ancient manners, the fragments of older languages, the relics of obsolete art, are all parts of what has been fitly styled “unwritten history,” and furnish the means of recovering many records of past periods which must remain for ever a blank to those who will recognise none but written or monumental evidence.

Proceeding to the investigation of this later and, in most of the higher requirements of history, this more important branch of historical evidence, the archaeologist lias still his own special departments of investigation. Tracing the various alphabets in their gradual development through Phoenician, Greek, Roman, and other sources, and the changing forms which followed under the influences of Byzantine and mediaeval art, a complete system of palaeography has been deduced, calculated to prove an important auxiliary in the investigation of monumental and written records. Palaeography has its own rules of criticism, supplying an element of chronological classification altogether independent of style in works of art, or of internal evidence in graven or written inscriptions, and a test of genuineness often invaluable to the historian.

Architecture, sculpture, and pottery have each their historical value, their periods of pure and mixed art, their successions of style, and their traces of borrowed forms and ornamentation, suggestive of Indian, Assyrian, Egyptian, Phoenician, Punic, Greek, Etruscan, Roman, Arabian, Byzantine, Norman, or Renaissance influences. Subordinate to those are the pictorial arts combined with sculpture and pottery, from earliest Egyptian, Greek, or Etruscan art to the frescoes and paintings of mediaeval centuries; and the rise of the art of the engraver, traceable through ancient chasing on metals, mediaeval niello-work, graven sepulchral brasses, and so on to the wood blocks, whence at length the art of printing with movable types originated. And a3 in the Old World so in the New, the progress of man is traceable from rudest arts of stone and copper to the bronze period of Mexico and Peru, where also architecture, sculpture, and pottery preserve for us invaluable materials for the elucidation of that prehistoric time which only came to an end there in the year 1492 a.d.

Heraldry is another element by means of which archaeology provides trustworthy canons of criticism in relation to written and unwritten mediaeval records. The seals and matrices, sepulchral sculptures, and engraved brasses, along with an extensive class of the decorations of ecclesiastical and domestic architecture, all supply evidence whereby names and dates, with confirmatory collateral evidence of various kinds, are frequently recoverable. From the same sources also the changing costume of successive periods can be traced, and thus a new light be thrown on the manners and customs of past ages. The enthusiastic devotee is indeed apt at times to attach an undue importance to such auxiliary branches of study; but it is a still greater excess to pronounce them valueless, and to reject the useful aids they are capable of affording.

No less important are the illustrations of history, and the guides in the right course of research, which numismatics supplies, both in relation to early and mediaeval times. But on this and other sections into which th? study of antiquities is divided, the requisite information will be found under the several heads of research. On many of those points the historian and the archaeologist necessarily occupy the same field; and indeed, when that primitive period wherein archaeology deals with the whole elements of our knowledge regarding it, as a branch of inductive science, and not of critical history, is past, the student of antiquities becomes to a great extent the pioneer of the historian. He deals with the raw materials: the charters, deeds, wills, grants of land, of privileges or immunities, the royal, monastic, and baronial accounts of expenditure, and the like trustworthy documents; by means of their palaeography, seals, illuminations, and other evidence, he fixes their dates, traces out the genealogical relationships of their authors, and in various ways prepares and sifts the evidence which is to be employed anew by the historian in revivifying the past. Architecture and all departments of the fine arts, in like manner, supply much evidence which, when investigated and systematised by a similar process, adds valuable materials to the stock of the historian, and furnishes new sources for the illumination of past ages. Such is a sketch of the comprehensive investigations embraced under the name of archaeology, which, carried on by many independent labourers, and in widely varied fields of research, have contributed important chapters of human history, and revivified ages long buried in oblivion, or at best but dimly seen through distorting media of myth and fable.

CLASSICAL ARCHAeOLOGY.

The province of classical archaeology is to investigate and determine the results of artistic activity among the Greeks and Romans, so far as that activity manifested itself in works of form and substance as opposed to the artistic expression of thought by unsubstantial means, as in the case of poetry or music. It ranges from the Greek temple as the highest form of artistic expression in this sense to the other extreme of the simplest object shaped for a purpose by human hands. A stone, rudely hewn with some design, an artificial tumulus, and common clay utensil, each represent, in a humble fashion, a thought artistically expressed in substance, and each reflect more or less accurately the artistic spirit of the time at which they were made. It ranges also from the earliest examples of workmanship down through the historical periods of development-and decline. So far classical archaeology may properly be called a section of the general history of art. It owes its independent position entirely to the peculiar circumstances under which its investigations are conducted. For example, when called upon to determine the date of an inscription from the forms and disposition of its letters, which, as works of art, must reflect the taste of the period in which they were incised, it has to bring to bear on the question a knowledge of palaeographical eccentricities. Or when the date of a coin has to be fixed, the standard on which it has been struck and the historical circumstances connected with it must be taken into consideration. Such, at least, is the practice of journals and societies devoted to classical archaeology. On the other hand, recent writers desire to confine these collateral inquiries to within tho narrowest possible limits. They have agreed to dismiss altogether mythological researches, which in Gerhard’s time formed one of the principal occupations of archaeologists. Most of them consent to epigraphy being classed under philology. With regard to numismatics, however, opinions are still divided as to whether it should be included under archaeology, on the ground of the immense importance of coins as monuments of art, or whether, on [9:2:344] account of their historical value, the study of them should be classed under philology. A similar question has been raised regarding topography. (See Conze, Ueber die Bedeutung der classischeιι Archäologie, Wien, 1869; Preller, Ausgewählte Aufsätze, pp. 384-425, über die wissenschaftliche Behandlung der Archäologie; Stark, in the Philologus, xiv. p. 645, and xvL p. 85.)

The material for the study of classical art consists of literary records and actual remains, among the former being included, though from another point of view belonging to the latter class, the inscriptions which have been found incised on sculptures, or more frequently on the bases left behind in Greece as worthless by the plundering Homans. The literary records have been collected by Overbeck, Antike Schriftquellen, Leipzig, 1868, and the inscriptions alone more recently by Hirschfeld, Til·uli Statuariorum Sculptorumque, Berlin, 1871. The actual remains may be arranged under the three classes of architecture, sculpture, and painting, with the first mentioned being included the industrial arts, in which principles of construction were applied, e.g., the furniture of temples and dwelling-houses, as opposed to the imitative arts. In the case of architecture proper, owing to the immovable nature of its monuments, dependence has to be placed on the trustworthiness of drawings and descriptions made on the spot by travellers. Sculpture, on the other hand, being comparatively easy of transport in all .cases, and having been for centuries the object of extraordinary avidity among cultivated people, is now fairly represented in all its important stages in any one of the principal museums of Europe. Painting, in its highest sphere, may be said to exist only in the record supplied by the occasional statements of ancient writers. But these statements embody the opinions of those whose judgment in regard to sculpture we have the means of verifying, and unless there were reason to suppose that persons accustomed to exact the greatest refinement in sculpture were lightly gratified in the matter of painting, their desultory remarks will furnish some idea of the ancient manner for which the remains of wall painting at Pompeii will serve as a foundation, though apparently executed by workmen rather than artists, and that at a time when the art had sunk to its lowest ebb. The skill in drawing attained by ordinary workmen is amply displayed in the painted vases.

Without attempting to subject the history of art to systematic study, the Greeks and Romans nevertheless devoted much attention to special branches of it. The fruits of their labours have in great part perished; but from what remains, and from the notices of what is lost, it appears that their researches took the direction either of explaining the principles of art, and especially those of architecture, or of collecting facts concerning artists and their works, or of describing the works of art which existed in this or that place, as in a catalogue. Of the first class of works we have lost all—and they were many— except Vitruvius. Of the second the losses are known to have been great, and, poor though the substitute for them undoubtedly is, we are still fortunate in possessing such in the notices collected by Pliny in his Historia Naturalis. We have besides a long series of epigrams, for which there was no dearth of point, in the works of well-known artists. For a similar purpose the rhetoricians chose frequently to draw comparisons from or to describe works of art; but owing to the object they had in view, they have left little that is of much practical good for the history of ancient art.

The same applies to the epigrammatists. (See O. Benndorf, De Anthologioe Graecae Epigrammatis quoe ad artes spectant, Bonn, 1862.) With regard to Pliny, it seems that, though himseif destitute of all critical faculty in matters of art, he frequently drew his notices from excellent authorities. The third class of ancient writers on works of art were the Periegetae, of whom only Pausanias survives (a.d. 160-180), his 'Ελλάδος Πίριζ/γτ/σις, in ten books, being of the highest value from an antiquarian point of view. For the criticism of art it brings little benefit.

As to the fate of works of art during the early centuries of Christianity, the first record we possess is that of Nicetas Acominatus, of Chonae in Phrygia, who died in 1216 {Narratio de Statuis Antiquis quas Franci post captam, anno 120i, Constantinopolim destruxerunt, Leipzig, 1830). In 1460 we have an anonymous description of Athens (Tà θέατρα και διδασκαλεία των Αθηνών, see L. Ross, Archäologische Aufsätze, i. p. 245), from which may be gathered a tolerable idea of the deep ignorance of the times. In Rome the rule was to destroy as far as possible all ancient sculptures, except such as were in some way identified with Christianity. The reaction against this manner of proceeding at first took the form of collecting ancient sarcophagi for the modern purposes of burying-grounds. By the 15th and 16th centuries this taste had developed into an enthusiasm, which spread even into the south of Germany, for the possession of ancient sculptures as models for the study of artists. In the beginning of the 17th century this enthusiasm gave way to a habit of viewing ancient works of art only as so many illustrations of ancient beliefs and modes of life, a habit in which the French and the Dutch were distinguished, and of which the results are nowhere more apparent than in Montfaucon’s L' Antiquité expliquée et représentée en figures, Paris, 1722, with its uncritical text and inaccurate engravings. The taste of the times preferred literature to art, and accordingly the collection of ancient monuments, adapted to the illustration of classical writers, and especially the poets, was assiduously followed. A typical example of the one-sidedness of this tendency is to be seen in Spence’s Polymetis, or an Enquiry concerning the Agreement between the Works of the Boman Poets and the Remains of the Ancient Artists, London, 1755, fol. A really valuable work of the period, however, was the collection of passages in the ancient writers bearing upon artists, entitled Catalogus Artificum, by Fr. Junius (François Dujon), which retained the position of a standard work until supplanted by Sillig’s Catalogus Artificum, Dresden, 1827, which in turn held its ground until the appearance of H. Brunn’s Geschichte der Griechischen Künstler, 2 vois., 1853 and 1859.

Up to the middle of the 17th century no steps had been taken to visit and explore the monuments of Greece. The pioneers in this work were J. Spon, a physician of Lyons, and George Wheler, an Englishman, who travelled together in 1675-76 through Italy, Dalmatia, and Greece, and published each a separate account of their journey (J. Spon, Voyage d'Italie, de Dalmatia, de Grèce, et du Levant, Lyon, 1678; G. Wheler, Journey into Greece, London, 1682). In the year previous to their arrival in Greece, the Marquis de Nointel, French ambassador at the Porte, had paid a short visit to Athens, and set Carrey, a French artist, to> work to draw the sculptures of the Parthenon and some of the buildings of the town. These drawings are now in the Bibliothèque at Paris, and though mostly sketched hurriedly, or from an awkward point of view, form an invaluable record of the sculptures of the Parthenon, destroyed shortly after (1687) by the bombardment of Athens by the Venetians under Morosini.

The discovery of Herculaneum in 1720 and of Pompeii in 1748 opened a new era in the history of archaeology. The antiquarian spirit gave way to an historical and scientific method, of which Count Caylus {Recueil d' Antiquités, Paris, 1752-54,7 vols.) may be regarded as the forerunner, and Winckelmann (1717-1768) as the actual founder. The fame of the latter rests on his two great [9:2:345] wo. ’ ks—(1.) the Geschichte der Kunst des Alterthums, Dresden, 17G4, and with additions, 1767; and (2.) Monumenti Antichi Inediti, Rome, 1767, 2 vols. fol. It was in the former that he elaborated his two theories—first, that the quality of artistic productions is always in harmony with the character and the events of the times; and, secondly, that ideal beauty originates in the union of individually-beautiful forms observed singly and apart in nature. Whatever may be said of the narrowness or want of precision in his artistic and philosophical speculations, it still stands to his great praise and renown that he was the first to undertake a vigorous examination of the terms, beauty and ideal, in their relation to nature. It was through his influence that the history of ancient art was introduced into the course of academical study by Heyne, that Goethe, Lessing, and Herder turned each the force of his consummate genius to ancient art, and that the pubheation of ancient monuments with critical apparatus received a new impulse. Among the immediate disciples of Winckelmann were Zoëga (1755-1809), Visconti (1751— 1807), and Millin. After Winckelmann, the next history of ancient art that appeared was Meyer’s Geschichte der bildenden Künste bei den Griechen und Römern, Dresden, 1824-36, 3 vols.; contemporary with which the only important contributions to the subject were those of C. A. Bυttiger and Hirt.

While German activity was engaged on theories of art based principally on the monuments existing in Italy, a practical view of the subject was taken in England, the first issue of which was that Stuart and Revett went to Athens in 1751, and spent nearly three years in exploring and drawing its remains, the result appearing in the work Antiquities of Athens, voL i., 1762; vol. ii, 1787; vol. iii., 1794; and vol. iv., 1816. The task begun by them was taken up by the Society of Dilettanti (founded 1734), whose first expedition under Dr Chandler, Revett, and Pars, an artist, in Greece and Asia Minor, was productive of two works—(1.) Ionian Antiquities (published in 1769, and again, largely increased by the researches of William Gell, in 1797); and (2.) Unedited Antiquities of Attica, 1817. At this time, Lord Elgin, then British ambassador at the Porte, had a large force of workmen employed in removing the sculptures of the Acropolis of Athens, which, after years of tossing hither and thither in London, at last, in 1816, found a resting-place in the British Museum, of which they continue to form the greatest ornament. In 1811-12 a number of English, German, and Danish travellers (Cockerell, Forster, Stackelberg, Haller, Linckh, and Brönstedt) undertook the exploration of Aegina at their own expense, and were fortunate in the recovery of the sculptures of the temple of Athene, now in Munich.

In 1812 the temple of Apollo Epicurius at Phigalia was explored by Cockerell, its sculptured frieze recovered and obtained for the British Museum, qnd its architecture elucidated in the still unapproached work of Cockerell, The Temples of Jupiter at Aegina, and of Apollo at Bassac, near Phigalia, 1860. Among the other researches undertaken about this period were—(1.) The French Expédition scientifique de la Morée, the chief result of which was the discovery of some fragments of the metopes of the temple of Zeus at Olympia. (2.) The excavations on the Acropolis of Athens, directed by L. Ross, in 1834-36. (3.) The excavations of Angell and Harris on the Acropolis of Selinus in Sicily in 1822-23, resulting in the recovery of three sculptured metopes of a very archaic style, and fragments of three more metopes (Samuel Angell and Thomas. Harris, Sculptured Metopes of the Ancient City oj Selinus in Sicily, London, 1826, fol.) (4.) The exploration of the same site by the duke of Serradifalco (L’Antichilà della Sicilia, Palermo, 1834), with the further gain of four metopes sculptured in a more advanced style (O. Benndorf, Die Metopen von Selinunt, Berlin, 1873). These sculptures are in the Museum of Palermo. /5.) The extensive operations in Etruria from 1828 onwards, the enormous spoils of which, consisting of painted vases, bronzes, &c., led to the foundation of the Instituto di Corrispondenza Arche-ologica at Rome, which has continued uninterruptedly, with the support of the Prussian Government, its publication of Annali, Bullettino, and Monumenti, furnishing a complete repertory of archaeological research up to the present day. (6.) The removal of the sculptures on the Acropolis of Xanthos (Fellows, Asia Minor, 1839, and Travels in Lycia, 1841), and the remains of the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus (Newton, History of Discoveries, &c., 1862, and Travels in the Levant, 1865), have been the principal additions of that class to our national collection, which, however, has been immensely enriched in objects of minor artistic importance, but of great archaeological interest, from excavations in Greece, at Camirus and Jalyssus in Rhodes, in Sicily, in the Cyrenaica, and in Cyprus. In the Crimea the excavations of the Russian Government have brought very important treasures to light (Antiquités du Bosphore Cimmérien conserves au Musée Impérial de Γ Ermitage, Petersburg, 1854; Comptes Rendus de la Commission Archéologique, from 1859).

The rapid and vast accumulation of new material after the time of Winckelmann required a new informing spirit. The first to assume this function was Thiersch, in three articles, “Ueber die Epochen der bildenden Kunst unter den Griechen,” 1816, 1819, 1825, in which he endeavoured to prove the influence of the Egyptians and Phoenicians on early Greek art. Against him appeared K. 0. Müller, denying altogether an exoteric influence, and comparing the development of Greek art to the organic development of plants, its various periods being coincident with the marked periods of political history. These opinions he propounded first in a series of articles (Kleine Schriften, ii. pp. 315-398), and afterwards in the celebrated Handbuch der Archäologie (1830; 2d ed. 1835; 3d ed. 1848, with additions by Weicker), which, with the plates by Oesterley (Denkmäler der alten Kunst), is still unsurpassed in its kind. Müller’s view has continued to be adopted by all the leading archaeologists since his time, among whom may be here mentioned Gerhard, Weicker, Otto Jahn, and the historians of art generally, Schnaase, Kugler, and Lübke. Besides the Handbuch, however, with its additional volume of Denkmäler by Wieseler, it is necessary, for the most recent information, to consult Brunn’s Geschichte der Griechischen Künstler, 2 vols.; Overbeck’s Geschichte der Griechischen Plastik, 2d. ed., 1872; Friederichs’s A’ainterne,Berlin, 1868; Kleine Kunst und Industrie, Berlin, 1871, by the same author; G. Semper. Der Stil in den technischen und tektonischen Künsten, Munich, 1860-63; C. Bötticher, Die Tektonik der Hellenen, 2d. ed., Berlin, 1872-3; Helbig’s Wandgemälde Campaniens, 1868; vol ii. of Schnaase’s Geschichte der bildenden Künste; Helbig’s Untersuchungen über die Wandgemälde Campaniens, 1873; the publications of the Instituto di Corrispondenza Archeologica of Rome, and the Archäologische Zeitung of Berlin. It is not assumed that this list exhausts the number of books that may be consulted with profit; but it is hoped that no essentially important work has been overlooked.

First Period.

The oldest remains of workmanship in Greece, if we except the series of stone implements discovered within the last few years in various localities, are the ruined walls of Tirynth and several other ancient citadels, the stupendous masonry of which, together with the primitive manner of construction by means of unhewn polygonal blocks of [9:2:346] immense size, led the later Greeks to believe that they had been the work of a mythical race of giants, Cyclopes, and to designate such masonry as Cyclopean. It was further said that these Cyclopes had come from Lycia, between which and Argolis, where the most remarkable of these walls are, there existed (whatever may be the value of this belief) a very frequent intercourse in the heroic times. Pausanias (iL 25, 8), speaking of the walls of Tirynth, which still, apparently, present the same aspect as when he saw them, remarks that the smallest of the blocks would be more than a load for a yoke of mules. Again (ix. 36, 5) he compares them with the pyramids of Egypt as regards the difficulty of the task of building and their colossal dimensions. Instead of the unsatisfactory Cyclopes, the Pelasgians, who preceded the Greeks in the occupation of the soil, are now accredited the authors of this primitive masonry, to which accordingly the much-abused term Pelasgic is applied. Pausanias (i. 28, 3) describes the oldest part of the walls of the Acropolis at Athens as the work of Pelasgic settlers there. In what relation of blood this race may have stood to the Greeks who succeeded them cannot be determined, but it is known that the Greeks adopted from them, among other religious beliefs and rites, those of Dodona; and since even this primitive style of masonry commended itself to them for a time, the Pelasgians must be regarded as having in some degree assisted in the artistic progress of their successors. The walls of Mycenae furnish an example of the fine skill with which the Greeks afterwards employed the Pelasgic construction, the blocks of stone being carefully jointed and hewn on the outer surface, while the interior of the wall is filled up with mortar and small stones. Mycenae claimed to be one of the very oldest towns of Greece, and its walle may fairly be regarded as the oldest known monument of Greek workmanship. A considerable advance of skill is noticeable in the masonry of the treasure-houses (thesauri), or dome-shaped and partly subterraneous buildings, which occur in several districts of Greece, and of which the treasury of Atreus (so named by Pausanias) at Mycenae is a typical example. It is built of circular courses of evenly hewn and jointed stones, the courses narrowing towards the top, and there held together by a keystone. It is not, however, an instance of vaulting in the true sense. The most remarkable features in the building are— first, the pilasters and tablets of coloured marble, decorated with a peculiar style of ornament, the elements of which are spirals and zigzags; and secondly, the sheets of bronze √vith which the interior walls were plated. Of the latter little more than the nails have been found with which they were attached. Of the former a number of fragments, some of which are now in the British Museum, have come to light. The disposition, and especially the profusion of ornament which they display, differ strikingly from the simplicity of Greek work as we know it, and have given rise to a theory which is now accepted as proved, that the Greeks at this time must have been strongly influenced by the example of Oriental artists (Schnaase, Geschichte der bildenden Künsten, ii., fig. 28, Diisseldorf, 1866). Meanrime, it is a fact of the first importance that this building, which Pausanias appears to have had good grounds for naming the treasury of Atreus, and thus assigning it to the heroic age before the time of Homer, furnishes a remarkable illustration of the descriptions of princely palaces given by the poet, according to whom the walls were plated with dazzling bronze, and the cornices, pillars, and doors enriched with work in other metals. When, therefore, a building in the remains of which a complete absence of Greek simplicity and a powerful suggestion of Oriental influence have been unanimously recognised, was found to correspond accurately with the descriptions of Homer, it was both time to inquire whether the frequent notices of works of art in his pages also point in the same direction, and reasonable to assume that his testimony elsewhere in matters of art was equally reliable. From the poet’s evidence on the condition of art in his time we gather that the various processes of working in gold, silver, iron, tin, and bronze j were known, with the exception of casting and soldering in the last-mentioned material, and of welding iron. Wood and ivory were carved and jointed, the art of pottery was known, and weaving and embroidery, the foundation of pictorial art, were practised. We hear of richly-ornamented articles of furniture, armour, and dresses. We read of the τeκτωv, χαλκ∈υs, and σκυτοτό/tos. Occasionally the names of particular artists are mentioned, as of Tychius, who made the shield of Ajax (Iliad, vii. 222), and of Icmalius, who made Penelope’s chair (Odyssey, xix. 60). On the other hand, the work of amateurs is often praised, as the couch made by Odysseus (Odyssey, xxiii. 189), and the figured garments worked by Andromache and Helena (Iliad, iii. 125, and xxii. 441). When the workmanship of an object is of surpassing beauty and the artist unknown, as in the case of the Sidonian crater (Odyssey, iv. 617), it is ascribed to the artist god Hephaestus, to whom also the same honour is done when the work, as in the case of the shield of Achilles, was a poetic creation. That Homer should in the same breath speak of an object as Sidonian and the work of a Greek god, is a singular mistake, which would hardly have been committed had the articles imported from the Phoenicians differed in style from articles of the same class produced by native workmen. So far, artistic feeling seems to have been directed exclusively to the decoration of objects of daily use. It had not yet aspired to the production of one object which could rest on its merits as a mere work of art,—as, for example, a statue. We have, indeed (Iliad, vi. 301), mention of a statue of Pallas at Troy; but the fact that women are described as placing drapery on its knees is sufficient proof of its having been a mere rude Xoanon, such as we find frequently represented on the painted vases. The same phenomenon occurs in the remains of Assyrian art, among which, with all the wealth of sculpture in relief and of the highest excellence, there are only three or four statues, and those of such exceeding rudeness that we are compelled to suppose that they were intended to be draped like the figure of Pallas just mentioned. We have seen that the ornaments of the treasury of Atreus at Mycenae pointed clearly to an Oriental origin. It is agreed that the relief of two rampant lions from above the gateway to the citadel of Mycenae (Muller’s Denkmäler der alten Kunst), which is the solitary existing instance of Greek sculpture from about Homeric times, is of an Oriental character in the composition, in the flatness of the relief, and in the design of the pillar which stands between the lions. We find further, as was pointed out by Layard (Nineveh, Appendix), among the many remains of the inferior arts from Nineveh, illustrations of the references to such matters in Homer, which are admirable in themselves, and are found nowhere else, except occasionally in the oldest Etruscan tombs. Now, as Assyrian art reached its culmination by about the 9th century B.c., we may assume that, contemporary with Homer, it was being practised with great activity. On the testimony of Herodotus we know that Assyrian wares were imported into Greece by the Phoenicians and sold in the heroic times; and, on the testimony of Homer, these same Phoenicians were in the habit of selling costly articles of furniture and dress to the Greeks of his time. Of early Phoenician art, however, we have no authentic remains, nor indeed any proof of its having had an independent existence at any time. We know the Phoenicians mainly as traders, and it is highly probable that in matters of art their [9:2:347] trade lay chiefly between the Assyrians on the one hand and the Greeks on the other. “It was the Phoenicians/’ says Brunn (DieKunstbei Homer, München, 1868), “-who brought from the East to the Greeks an alphabet which they modified and employed for a language peculiar to themselves; and it was the Phoenicians who brought to them from the same quarter an alphabet, so to speak, of art, which they also modified and employed for a language of art equally their own.” lie proceeds to define this alphabet of art as consisting of a knowledge of the processes of weaving and embroidery, of working in wood, ivory, and the various metals, with the exception of casting in bronze —with which and with sculpture in marble, which he also excludes, commenced the art of statuary, and commenced, therefore, the independence of true Greek art. Besides these processes of working, the Greeks derived from the same source at least some of the decorative patterns which we find in use in later times, though greatly modified. But, above all, they obtained from the Assyrians that manner of sculpture in low flat relief, and in parallel horizontal bands, which they appear to have practised almost exclusively down to the 7th century B.C.,—that is, down to the collapse of the Assyrian empire,—and after that to have retained as one of the charms of their architecture. If, then, an intercourse such as is assumed actually took place in Homer’s time between the Greeks and the Assyrians, who were then artistically in a very advanced condition, it will be necessary, before lightly calling the shield of Achilles a poetic dream, as has frequently been done, to see whether the poet may not have had before his mind some manner of a counterpart for it in Assyrian art. We need not suppose that such a shield ever existed. But a poet cannot create out of nothing; and it is clear from his division of the shield into five concentric bands, resembling the large bronze shields found at Caere some years ago in a tomb of very high antiquity, that he had before his mind the customary arrangement of ornaments in works of this kind. Now, on an Assyrian bronze bowl in the British Museum (Layard, plate 61), which exactly resembles in shape and is of about the same size as a boss of a shield, we have a representation of the earth and heavens which very strikingly recalls the decoration of the boss on the shield of Achilles; -while in the comparatively few remains of Assyrian sculpture we have cities at war, cities at peace, and many scenes from daily life, which vividly illustrate the Homeric description of the shield (see Brunn Die Kunst bei Homer , who deals with the various subjects in detail). It should be observed, however, that though the evidence of the Homeric poems and the remains of Greek art from the Homeric age both point to an Assyrian influence, the Greeks of later times looked ratheι-to Egypt as the land whence their ancestors had experienced their first impulse both in religion and in art. They believed that Daedalus, the first Greek sculptor who knew how to give movement to his figures, and was regarded as the father of Greek sculpture, had learned his art in Egypt. Diodorus of Sicily asserted that Telecles and Theodorus of Samus had visited Egypt, and on their return executed a statue of Apollo in the Egyptian style for a temple in Samus, each having made a half of it, and that apart from the other. Strabo (p. 806) compares the old Greek sculpture with the Egyptian; while Pausanias in several places (ii. 19, 3; iv. 32, 1) speaks^of Egyptian statues in Greek temples, or (i. 42, 3; yii. 5, o) of statues resembling the Egyptian in style. According to another theory, the influence of Egypt on Greek art, though admitted, is relegated to the time of Psammetichus, in whose service it is known many Greek mercenaries were employed, and through -whose inclination towards the Greeks an active intercourse sprang up between the two countries. Among the Greeks who visited Egypt at that ’ time were Thales, Cleobulus, Solon, and Pythagoras.

Of the connection which is assumed to have existed between the earliest monuments of Greek art and the contemporary art of Assyria, evidence is cited from remains of undoubtedly early workmanship in the countries of Asia Minor, Lycia, Lydia, and Phrygia, of which the two latter were intimately associated with the oldest traditions and religious beliefs of Greece. The peculiar feature of Lycian art is its tombs cut in the rock, of which the oldest class are direct imitations of wooden structures such as we may conceive the primitive temples of an Oriental race to have been. In Phrygia we have another class of rock-cut tombs of very remote antiquity, of which that of Midas (Semper, Der Stil, i. p. 429) is the best preserved example. Here the style of decoration is obviously derived from Assyrian tapestry. In Lydia we have tombs again, but they are in the form of immense tumuli,—as, for instance, that of Alyattes near Sardis, which astonished Herodotus by its size, being 1300 feet in diameter at the base, and over 250 feet high. Similar tumuli occur among the old Chaldeans.

With the immigration of the Dorian race commenced the development of an independent style of architecture in Greece, the first step apparently being the invention of a house supported by columns as the design for a temple. From the description given by Pausanias (v. 16) of one of these early Doric temples—that of Hera at Olympia, erected shortly after the Dorian immigration—we gather that it had the form of a temple in antis, surrounded by columns, and with not only a pronaos led into by two columns, but also a similar chamber at the back. One of the two columns of this latter chamber was of wood, apparently a reminiscence of a former style of construction in that material. About the same time originated also, it is supposed, the Ionic order, which though presenting a certain Asiatic richness of ornament strongly opposed to the severe simplicity of the Doric, was still a pure Greek invention. The fact of it having first appeared among the Greeks of Asia Minor is enough to account for its admission of a greater softness and flow of lines than was admitted in the Doric. With the new movement in architecture a fresh impetus was given to the art of sculpture. At first the reports sound somewhat fabulous,—as, for example, that in which Butades the Corinthian potter is described as having hit on the idea of modelling a face in clay and baking it along with his vases. Butades himself, however, is an historical person, and Corinth is known to have been a flourishing seat of potters and other artists as early as the time of the tyrant Cypselus (650 B.c.), through whose oppression it is said the artists, Eucheir, Diopus, and Eugrammus emigrated to Etruria, which afterwards became celebrated for its sculptures in terra-cotta. At the commission of Cypselus, or of his successor Periander, a colossal statue of Jupiter was executed at Corinth, and dedicated at Olympia. But the most remarkable specimen of early sculpture, presumably Corinthian, was the chest in which the infant Cypselus was concealed, and of which a detailed description is given by Pausanias (v. 17, 5, foL) The chest, itself of cedar, was ornamented with a wealth of figures in gold and ivory, arranged in parallel horizontal bands, and representing heroic legends and scenes from daily life, the names of the individual figures being inscribed boustrophedon, that is, in the manner characteristic of early times, and in what Pausanias calls very ancient letters. The François vase in Florence {Monumenti dell’ Instituto di Correspondenza Archeologica, vol. iv. pls. 54-58) gives a tolerable notion of what the composition must have been. Artistic activity was not then confined to Corinth. A school of sculpture in marble existed in Chius as early [9:2:348] as 660 b.c., and there also Glaucus is said to have discovered the art of welding iron (692 B.C.), the substitute for which had previously been nails. At this period we have frequent mention of splendid metal utensils, as, for instance, the enormous cauldron (Herodotus, iv. 152), with projecting gryphons’ heads and a support formed of kneeling figures, seven ells in height. As the oldest example of sculpture in bronze which he had seen, Pausanias (iii. 17, 6) describes a statue of Jupiter at Sparta, the work of Clearchus of Rhegium, whom some called a pupil of Daedalus. It was made of plates of bronze, beaten out to express the whole figure, and then fastened together with fine nails, the arts of soldering and of casting being still unknown. Of sculpture in this manner we possess only one example, the bronze bust found at Polledrara, near Vulci, and now in the British Museum. Throughout this early period the statues or images of deities seem to have retained their helpless primitive form, feelings of piety and gratitude being apparently expressed rather in gifts of metal utensils to the temples than in statues of the gods as in later times. No such statues exist now, but we have sufficient evidence of their want of artistic merit in the numerous representations of them which occur on the painted vases of a later period, when the sanctity of a spot is frequently indicated by such a figure. Apparently to this early and as yet barely historical period belongs a class of painted vases decorated with figures of animals and flowers arranged in parallel horizontal bands, and therefore both in the choice and disposition of the decorations presenting a marked instance of Assyrian influence. From their shape it appears that many of these vases were made to hold precious liquids, such as perfumes; and it is very probable that they were imported from the East with those perfumes, the names of which in the Greek language have an obvious Oriental origin. A considerable advance is noticeable in a second class of these vases, in which the human figure is introduced as the principal subject in the decoration, the designs being in general chosen from the heroic legends of Greece. These vases still retain the shape of the former class, the method of disposition in parallel bands, and the choice of subordinate ornaments. The names of the heroes are frequently written beside them, and sometimes the artist adds his own name. The alphabet in which these names are written is the old Corinthian, and hence the vases in question are also styled Corinthian. As to their date, it is agreed that they cannot be later than 620 b.c. With the introduction of the human figure as the subject most worthy of artistic rendering, commenced in vase painting also the independence of the potter’s art in Greece (Brunn, Probleme in der Geschichte der Vasenmalerei). Second Period.

From the date of the earliest historical notices of sculptors, backward to that usually assigned to the Homeric poems, there is an interval of several centuries, during which it would at first sight appear that the art of sculpture had made no sensible advance, if indeed it had not declined. This being improbable, an explanation must be sought for, either with Ulrichs (Die Anfänge der Griechischen Künstlergeschichte, Würzburg, 1871) in the confusion which seems to reign among the dates of the earliest sculptors, or with Brunn (Die Kunst bei Homer) in the theory that the art of sculpture in Greece during that interval was, like the contemporary art of Assyria, strictly confined to working in relief, and that in this direction it may well have made steady progress, though particular artists are not singled out for praise. It is with sculpture in the round, and with some particular invention, as that of welding iron or casting bronze, or with some new technical procedure, as the working of marble, that the first records of artists begin. With regard to the confusion in the dates of these records, it is true that in ancient times the artistic faculty was handed down in certain families, among whom there was also a partiality for certain names. But to assume on the strength of this, as Ulrichs does, that later writers, finding a recurrence of the same name, generally identified it with the most distinguished and hence probably the latest of the artists who bore it, is a means of peopling an apparent void which ought to be supported with better evidence than that which Brunn has controverted at almost every point. For example, in treating of Theodorus of Samus, of whom it is said that he invented the process of casting in bronze, and supposed that he was a contemporary of Polycrates, Ulrichs argues that there must have been two artists of that name (and suggests that there may have been several), because the one who invented bronze-casting must have lived before 576b,c., previous to which date this art may be inferred to have been known from the remark of Herodotus (v. 82), that the Epidaurians were ordered by an oracle to obtain figures of Damia and Auxesia, not χαλκού τ) λίθον, but £υλου. W hy -χαλκόν should not refer to hammered as well as to cast bronze, Brunn is unable to see. Again, it was Theodorus of Samus who built the substructure of the temple of Diana at Ephesus, and Ulrichs is at a loss to conceive how the people of that town could have remained till 576 B.c. without a temple worthy of their goddess. That the previous temple was unworthy of Diana cannot be proved by us, who are ignorant of the feelings of the Greeks in these matters, and who are aware that Jupiter himself had not even in his favourite Olympia a great temple till 456 b.c.

The view taken by Brunn is, as has been said, that until the invention of casting in bronze the Greek sculptors continued to work in relief except when images were required for the purposes of worship, and that in these cases, whether [9:2:349] the figure was of wood, stone, or bronze, the rude helpless form of ancient times was preserved. Stimulated, it may be supposed, by the achievements of the newly-invented art, sculptors now began to look to the possibility of producing in marble also a resemblance to the human figure in its substantial roundness. The scene of the first success in this direction was Chius, where a family which for three generations (Melas, Micciades, and Archermus) had been celebrated for its workers in marble, was at this time represented by the brothers Bupalus and Athenis. Works from their hands were to be seen in their native place, in Delus, Iasus, and Smyrna, and consisted, so far as we know, of draped figures of goddesses, with the one memorable exception of a statue by Bupalus intended as a caricature of the poet Hipponax, which was set up in Clazomenae. The poet took his revenge by circulating some verses which stung the sculptor so severely as to drive him to suicide by hanging. The school of Chius had a rival in that of Magnesia on the Maeander, at the head of which was Bathycles, whose fame is associated with the reliefs and figures on the colossal throne of Apollo at Amyclae (Pausanias, iii. 18, 9; Overbeck, Gesell, d. Griech. Plastik, i. p. 86). He and a number of his pupils or assistants had been purposely invited to the task, and what they accomplished was probably the best that could then be done, however short of the standard of later times it may have fallen in the eyes of Pausanias. One noticeable fact is, that after completing their work, they left behind portraits of themselves, and this, in connection with the portrait of Hipponax, may serve to show that sculptors had already begun to direct their attention to the individual features of the human face. As to the date of Bathycles, Pausanias was uncertain and modem critics are divided, some supposing him to have left Magnesia before its destruction, 636 B.c., others on the occasion of its capture by the Persians, 546 B,c. In favour of the latter date is the statement (Pausanias, iii. 10, 8) that the gold received from Croesus (563-549 b.c.) by the Lacedaemonians was made a gift of by them for the decoration of the figure of Apollo at Amyclae.

The new phase of art thus entered on, according to tradition, by the Ionians, was now taken up vigorously by the Doric sculptors, among whom the first to attain distinction were Dipoenus and Scyllis, natives of Crete, and members of the ancient guild of sculptors there, which took its name from the mythic Daedalus. Leaving Crete, they settled in Sicyon, probably on the invitation of the tyrant Clisthenes, and were there commissioned to execute at the public cost a group of statues of deities. Their work was, however, intemιpted by a disagreement which ended in the artists having to leave the town. They established themselves in Aetolia, and were allowed to remain there until, a plague having fallen on Sicyon, the oracle traced it to the wrath of the gods at seeing their statues incomplete. Dipoenus and Scyllis were recalled, and finished their work at a greatly increased price, from which it may be inferred, perhaps, that the original dispute lay in the matter of payment. Among the many sculptures which they executed in Sicyon and other Greek towns, as Cleonae, Argus, Tirynth, and Ambracia, some, it is said, were of wood and ivory, a combination of material which may be regarded as having suggested the chryselephantine sculpture of later times (Pliny, xxxvi. 4, 9, 14; Pausanias, ii. 15,1; 22, 5; Brunn, Gesch. d. Griech. Künstler, i. p. 43). l·or determining their date, we have a passage of Pliny in which he says, “Primi omnium inclaruerunt marmore sculpendo ;” adding, “Before Cyrus ascended the throne of Persia, about 576 b.c.” From their school proceeded Doryclidas and Dontas, who executed several figures and groups of deities in cedar and gold at Olympia for the Heraeum and the treasuries of the Epidaurians and Megaraeans; Clearchus of Rhegium, who worked in bronze; and Tectaeus and Angelion, from whom Callon, the celebrated Aeginetan sculptor, learned his craft. As a work of Tectaeus and Angelion, Pausanias (ii. 32, 5; ix. 35, 3) mentions a figure of Apollo at Delus, representing the god in a rigid attitude, the upper arms close to the sides and the fore-arms advanced, in his right hand a bow, and in his left a diminutive group of the three Graces. Contemporary with Doryclidas were Smilis of Aegina and Gitiades of Sparta, the former of whom is known to have executed a group of the Horae, to be placed with a figure of Themis by Doryclidas. From his hand was also a figure of Hera at Samus. Gitiades, who was at once sculptor, architect, and poet, erected the temple of Athene Chalkioikos, and made the figure of the goddess for it. The temple was coated with plates of bronze, on which were reliefs representing scenes from the legends of Hercules and Perseus, and from mythical incidents, among them being the birth of Athene.

Turning now to the remains of Greek sculpture, which may with more or less certainty be assigned to the period in which the foregoing sculptors were at work, we begin with the three metopes from the oldest of the temples on the Acropolis of Selinus, in Sicily, which up to now have been regarded as furnishing the first authentic, and as yet the clearest, glimpse of that early stage of Greek art when the foreign elements with which it had grown up were being fast eliminated, and the basis laid of a perfectly independent art. It is not within the range of absolute proof, though it is nearly so, that these metopes belonged to the temple erected by the Selinuntians soon after their settlement as colonists, 651 B,c., or, as others prefer, 628 (Benndorf, Die Metopen von Selinunt.') They are sculptured in tufa, and represent —(1), Perseus cutting off the head of Medusa in the presence of Athene; (2), Hercules carrying the Cercopes, bound by the heels, over his shoulders; and (3), a quadriga to the front. In the first two, while the movement proceeds from left to right, the faces are all turned broadly to the front, as if looking to the spectator for applause. It may be that the artist, in thus rendering the grimness and grotesqueness of his subjects with a more staring and vivid effect, had recourse, as is argued, to an innovation on the older manner of representing the figures altogether in profile. This much appears to be certain, from the minute attention w hich he has devoted to the structure of the knees, the lower parts of the legs, the feet, and the movement of the flesh on the shoulders, that the loss of half a face, entailed by a position in profile, would have grieved him. The drapery is stiff, and studiously arranged in neat folds, which are not always produced by the manner in which it is worn. The hair is disposed in a system of circular locks independent of each other. Tho proportions of the figures vary considerably, though uniformly characterised by a sohdity and heaviness which, from the similar appearance of Doric columns, has been designated as Doric in style. The remains of colour found on these sculptures showed that the aegis of Athene had been sketched on the breast with a reddish brown, and that the same colour had been applied to the ground of the relief. The maeander pattern on the broad fold of Athene’s chiton was painted brown, her eyes and eyebrows black. The eyes of the Gorgon were red. The folds of the short chiton worn by Hercules were partially left to be indicated by colour. The muscles are strongly exaggerated, so as to mark the extraordinary physical strength attributed to the heroes of the subject.

Markedly contrasting with these metopes is a marble relief found in Samothrace in 1790, and now in the Louvre, [9:2:350] distinguished for the flatness of the figures, which present the appearance of sections of men (Friederichs, Bausteine, i. p. 18). The subject, as we learn from the names inscribed by each figure, consists of Agamemnon seated, with the herald Talthybius, and Epeius, the sculptor of the wooden horse, standing behind him. The figures are lean and spare compared with those of Selinus; the folds of the draperies are merely indicated, and appear to have been completed in colour. The character of the inscriptions, which are in the old Ionian dialect, corresponds with that of the early vases. That this relief cannot be later than 500 B.c. there is no doubt; but all means of determining its date beyond that period fail. Nor is it safe to assign it higher antiquity than the Selinus metopes, on the ground that the figures are all in profile; for a position in profile was by no means an invariable characteristic of early sculpture, as may be seen by reference Co fie. 2, in which are given two examples of the extremely early gold ornaments from Camirus in the British Museum, in all of which the figures are placed full to the front (Millingen, Ancient Unedited Monuments, ii. pl. 1; Müller, Denkmäler, pl. 11, No. 39). From the sacred way leading up to the temple of the Branchidae at Miletus there are ten marble statues of seated figures now in the British Museum, for which they were obtained by C. T. Newton. Apart from their importance as works of ail assignable to this early period, one of them possesses the additional interest of being, as we learn from the inscription on it, a portrait of Chares, a ruler of the neighbouring Teichiousa. The other important examples of sculpture in this period are—(1), the architrave of the temple at Assus, in the Troad (Friederichs, Bausteine, i. p. 9); (2), three statues of Apollo—one found at Thera, and now in Athens, the second found at Tenea, and now in Munich, the third in the British Museum, where it is known as the Strang-ford Apollo. All three stand in the Egyptian manner, resting the weight of the body on both legs. The head sits rigidly on the shoulders, the brow retires, the eyes project and slope inward towards the nose, the lips are close, and the corners of the mouth turned up, producing something like a smile. The hair appears to have been completed with colour (Overbeck, Gesch. d. Griech. Plastik, 2d ed., i. fig. 8; Friederichs, Bausteine, i. p. 5).

In the course of our notice of this early period certain facts have assumed a prominence which calls for remark. First, it is to be observed that the earliest important schools of sculpture arose in the islands, particularly the islands of Chius, Crete, and Aegina. To what circumstance this was due—whether, for example, to a more active intercourse with Oriental nations—remains unexplained. Next to the islands, the coast of Asia Minor, Magna Graecia, and Sicily were productive of artists. From Crete the new impulse spread to the Peloponnesus, Sicyon, Argus, and Corinth. Secondly, for some reason, the sculptors then mostly worked in pairs. Thirdly, the various materials—bronze, marble, wood and ivory, and gold and ivory—were already in use as in later times. Fourthly, the subjects were—(1), religious and mythological, the epos being the main source; and (2), portraits and statues of successful athletes. Individual artists had at last begun to assert their peculiarities in the conception of the human form. They had begun to give up those general types which bear the same resemblance to a man as does his shadow cast by the sun. In the infancy of art, as in the early morning, the shadows are grotesque. As it advances they improve, till at noon the shadow is lost in the living figure.

In the earlier part of our period it is to be observed that the Dorian race still continued to furnish the sculptors of distinction, but the main centres of the art were now in the Peloponnesus instead of the islands. In Sicyon the reputation acquired by Dipoenus and Scyllis was enlarged by Canachus, whose works were spoken of in later times (Cicero, Brut. 18, 70) as models of the severe restrained style of the early schools. Statues of deities were his favourite subjects. His material consisted sometimes of wood, as in the figure of Apollo Ismenius at Thebes (Pausanias, ix. 10, 2); sometimes of gold and ivory, as in the figure of Aphrodite at Sicyon (Pausanias, ii. 10, 4); and sometimes of bronze, as in his celebrated statue of Apollo Philesius at Miletus, which is said to have differed from the Apollo at Thebes only in the material. A figure of Apollo answering in general terms to the description of this statue, occurs on certain coins of Miletus and in a remarkable bronze statuette in the British Museum. The attitude of the statuette is stiff, but less pervaded with rigidity than, for example, the Apollo of Tenea. The form, which is quite nude, shows an advance in the study of proportions. The shoulders are still square, but the chest is much fuller, and apparently rendered as if with a reminiscence of its expansion and heaving after athletic exertion. Canachus worked with his brother Aristocles, also a sculptor of high reputation, though of his works all we know is that he took part with Ageladas in the execution of three statues of Muses.

The schools of Argus and Aegina appear to have mostly confined themselves to working in bronze. At the head of the former stood Ageladas, whose principal reputation consists in his having been the instructor of the three great masters, Myron, Polycletus, and Phidias. Nine of his works are mentioned, including two statues of Zeus, but no description of his style is added, nor is anything regarding it to be inferred from the very diverse manner of his three great pupils. His date falls between 508 and 452 B.c. Argus had also Aristomedon, Glaucus, and Dionysius. In Aegina, where the quality of the bronze (Aeginetica aeris temperatura—Pliny, A r . H., xxxiv. 2, 5, 10; 8, 19, 75), as well as the artistic excellence of its sculptors, obtained a wide recognition, the first name of importance is that of Callon, a pupil, as has been said, of Tectaeus, and Angelion of Sicyon, and a contemporary of Canachus (Pausanias, vii. 18, 10), with whom, in respect of the severity of his style, he has been compared. Of his works we know only of a statue of Athene at Troezene, and a tripod with a figure of Cora at Amyclae. Possibly, like his contemporaries, his chief study was that of the finely-developed forms of successful athletes. Greatly beyond him in distinction was Onatas, under whose hands the art of Aegina achieved a [9:2:351] reputation which was perhaps only surpassed by that of Athens, and, owing to the political collapse of the island, waβ never obscured by the inferiority of later schools. His works, which appear to have been mostly of bronze, consisted of large compositions as well as of single statues of gods and heroes. After Onatas we have Anaxagoras, who was employed by the united Greek states to execute the bronze statue of Zeus (15 feet high) for Olympia, in commemoration of the battle of Plataeae. On the same occasion the Greeks dedicated two other works of art—a bronze statue of Poseidon (10∣∙ feet high) for his temple on the Isthmus; and a golden tripod, standing on a bronze support formed of three serpents, for the entrance of the temple at Delphi. In both cases the names of the artists are unrecorded, and probably it will not be wrong to assume that they also were of Aegina. The golden tripod was melted down during the Phocian war; but the support remained in situ till the time of Constantine, by whose orders it was removed to Constantinople and placed in the Hippodrome, where it still stands. In 1855 the earth which had accumulated round its base was removed by C. T. Newton, and the names of the Greek states inscribed on it revealed. (Newton, Travels in the Levant, ii. p. 25. For the discussion raised on the antiquity of this monument, see Friederichs, Bausteine, i. p. 64.)

In Athens we find in this period Endoeus, of whom the scanty records permit us to know almost nothing, and Antenor, the author of a bronze group representing the Tyrannicides, Harmodius and Aristogiton, and erected in the Agora at the foot of the Acropolis. That these figures were executed shortly after the incident which they were intended to commemorate, 550 B.c., is very probable. It is recorded that Xerxes carried them off to Susa in 480 B.C., and that they were restored to Athens by Alexander, or Seleucus, or Antiochus. In the meantime, to repair the loss, two sculptors, Critius and Nesiotes, were employed to replace the group (Pausanias, i. 8, 5; Arrian, Exped. Alex. iii. 16, 7; vii. 19, 2; Pliny, xxxiv. 19, 70). Whether the new sculptors were expected to reproduce the composition and the style of the lost figures—as, for example, Onatas did in replacing the figure of the black Demeter at Phigalia— cannot be ascertained. On the other hand, if the two marble statues in the museum of Naples {Mus. Borbon., viii. pls. 7, 8) have been rightly described as copies of the new group, and if it is right to conjecture that the group represented on certain tetradrachms of Athens, and, we may add, on a Panathenaic prize vase in the British Museum, was copied from the older group, on the ground that they were executed about the time when it was recovered from Susa, and therefore probably to commemorate that event, this much at least will be clear, that the composition of both groups was very much the same. On the other hand, the frequency with which statues and groups of statues of various kinds occur on the late tetradrachms of Athens, would equally perhaps require to be explained on the same hypothesis of a restoration, and for this we are not prepared. With respect to the marble statues just mentioned, it is to be observed that the expression of physical energy in them, side by side with a spareness and sinewiness, recalls the characteristic of Myron, and accordingly may be better ascribed to the later artist Critius, than to his predecessor Antenor. As comparable in many respects with one of the statues in Naples we give fig. 3.

At Rhegium, in lower Italy, the mantle of Clearchus had fallen on Pythagoras, unless it be true, as is also stated, that he had received his instruction from an otherwise unknown artist, Euchirus of Corinth. A list of the sculptures by Pythagoras (Overbeck, Antike Schrift quellen, 6.v. Pythag.) shows that he worked exclusively in bronze, that his subjects, with the exception of a group of Europa on the bull, in Tarentum, consisted of male figures, and these of a kind in which either a strongly-pronounced muscular action, or a marked capacity for it, must have been expressed. The most famous of them was his statuo of Philoctetes at Syracuse, of which the epigram writers declared that the expression of pain in it was such as to move the spectator. To disprove the conjecture that the pain might have been expressed in the face alone, there is a gem in the Berlin Museum (Overbeck, Gesch. d. Griech. Plastik, 2d, fig. 42) bearing what there is little doubt is a copy from the statue, from which Philoctetes appears to be suffering contortion through every limb from the wound in his foot as he tries to walk. And this, it may be added, while itself an accurate observation of the effect of such a wound, is an admirable illustration of the talent of Pythagoras for strained, and, what is more, a concentrated straining of, muscular action. From a statement of Pliny, it appears that he was the first to express the veins and sinews of the human form, and from Diogenes Laertius wo gather that he was the first to apply rhythmus and symmetry to his figures. The precise meaning of these latter words it is difficult to understand, with nothing better before us than a gem copy of one of the artist’s works. It will not, however, be far wrong if we take them to refer to that concentration of the entire action of the body upon one point which has been recognised in the figure of Philoctetes, and which we assume to have been the key to the composition of his groups. This interpretation is further in harmony with the statement of Pliny, seeing that an artistic purpose of this kind could not be carried out without the studious expression of veins and sinews (Brunn, Gesch. d. Griech. Künstler, i. p. 132).

We have seen how few of the existing monuments can be traced even conjecturally to the artists of this early period, whose names and praises have been handed down to us. Monuments of sculpture there are, manifestly assignable to this period, and some of them worthy of the fame of a great master. But whether the men who executed them were unhonoured in their time, or whether from the insufficiency of our literary records names well known in antiquity may have escaped us, cr whether, in fact, the best of these works at least may really have come from the hands of men otherwise well known, remains unexplained[9:2:352]. The last-mentioned possibility has been placed in a strong light by Brunn’s discussion on the sculptures from the temple of Athene at Aegina, now in Munich. Not that he would trace them directly to the hands of the artists Callon and Onatas of Aegina. What he aims at is to connect the characteristics of the sculptures intimately with the style recorded of these two men, and to leave the rest for conjecture. (Die Aeginetische Giebel-Gruppen, Bayer. Akad. 1869; and Ueber das Alter der Aegine- tischen Bildwerke, Bayer. Akad. d. Wissenschaft, 1867.) Of the figures in the western pediment, in which the combat over the dead body of Achilles was represented, only one is lost. From the eastern only five complete figures remain. The subject of it was a combat corresponding in its main features with that of the other pediment. In both the central object of the strife is a fallen hero; in both the goddess Athene appears on the scene. In the one group her figure is entire; in the other only her head remains. In the eastern pediment the only recognisable figure is that of Hercules, and from his presence it has been supposed that the subject of the composition was the combat of that hero and Telamon against Laomedon of Troy. The statues of this pediment are of a bolder and more advanced style than the others, from which it has been inferred that they may have been the work of a younger man, carried away by a new movement in art, while the others may have been the work of an older artist, hardened in the traditions of his school. One thing, however, is plain from the remarkable uniformity which reigns among the figures of both groups, that the artist or artists had hitherto been limited in their study to one type of the human form, and that the nude form of finely-developed athletes. Nowhere is there individuality, but everywhere an excessive carefulness in rendering the forms. The goddess Athene has all the rigidity of the ancient figures intended for a worship which little brooked innovations. The expression on the faces is throughout the same, and the hair is always rendered in one conventional manner. The figures are spare and hard, with as little flesh as possible. In both pediments the scene—a combat over a fallen hero·—is intended to stir our sympathy, but entirely fails. There is no straining of muscles, no expression of grief, and no sense of the emergency. We turn from the figures as a whole to the pleasing truthfulness with which the parts are rendered. To give them a greater air of vitality, the lips and eyes of the statues, with such accessories as drapery, sandals, and weapons, were originally coloured blue and red, while many small holes remain to show that part of the armour and aegis on the breast of Athene had been attached in metal, a fact which bears with great importance on the question of the polychromy of ancient statues. With regard to the date of these sculptures, the opinion is, that they could hardly have been executed more than fifty years before the time of Phidias (engraved, Müller, Denkmäler, i. pls. 6-8).

Among the other existing examples of sculpture assignable to this period we would select as most characteristic— (1.) A marble stele found (1838) in the east of Attica, and now in the Theseum at Athens (Friederichs, Bausteine i. p. 26), representing an armed warrior standing in profile, whose name, as appears from the inscription, was Aristion. The sculptor’s name, which is also inscribed, was Aristocles. The relief is low and flat, and executed with the greatest care and attention to details, particularly those of the armour. The ground of the relief was painted red and the armour blue, the ornaments on it being picked out with red. Remains of colour were also found on the lips and eyes, while the crest of the helmet appears to have been added in metaL Altogether, Aristion presents a touching picture of the old upright and severe warrior who fought at Marathon. (2.) Another marble stele in Orcho-menus, inscribed with the sculptor’s name, Anxenor of Naxus, and representing, in low flat relief and in profile, a man of years wearing a mantle, and standing, resting on his staff, holding a beetle towards the dog at his feet (Overbeck, Gesch. d. Griech. Plastik, 2d ed., i. fig. 23; Friederichs, Bausteine, i. p. 29). (3.) Another marble stele in Naples (Mus. Borbon. , xiv. pl. 10; Friederichs, Bausteine, i. p. 28), in which the drapery and the forms are still archaic, though showing a considerable advance on the stele of Aristion. (4.) Part of a metope from one of the temples of Selinus in Sicily (Benndorf, Die Metopen von Selinunt, pl. 5), representing a goddess, either Athene or Artemis, trampling on an armed male figure, probably a giant, whom she has hurled to the ground. As an example of the archaic manner of relief in this period, this fragment has no equal among existing monuments. The anguish on the face of the giant is depicted with deep feeling; nor is our emotion interrupted by observing that the beard retains its formal trimness, and that the hair remains in graceful ringlets, in no way partaking of the confusion. (5.) Marble relief found on the Acropolis of Athens, and preserved there, representing a female figure, possibly a goddess, stepping into a car (Friederichs, Bausteine, i. p. 25). This relief has been supposed, but without sufficient reason, to be a fragment of the frieze of the older pre-Periclean Parthenon. With more justice has it been compared in point of style with (6), the reliefs of the so-called Harpy tomb discovered at Xanthus in Lycia in 1838 by Sir Charles Fellows, and now in the British Museum (Friederichs, Bausteine, i. p. 37). (7.) From Xanthus the British Museum possesses another archaic frieze of higher merit, representing a procession of chariots, in which the horses are modelled with extraordinary care (Vr^chov, Antiquissima Monumenta Xanthiaca, 1872). (8.) Marble relief in Thasus representing Apollo,

Hermes, and nymphs (Overbeck, Gesch. d. Griech. Plastik, 2d ed., i. fig. 28). The figures have an Ionic slimness, such as we found on the architrave from Assus, but with finer proportions than that early work. (9.) Three small reliefs in terra-cotta from Melus (Overbeck, Gesch. d. Griech. Plastik, 2d ed,,L figs. 27, 26α,and 26δ), representing Orestes and Electra at the tomb of their father; Perseus mounted on Pegasus and carrying off the head of Medusa; and Sappho, seated, resting from her lyre and looking up towards Alcaeus, as at the moment when he said, “You sweet, black-haired, modest Sappho, I have something to say to you.” A fourth relief of this style is given in fig. 4.
[9:2:353]

The trimness and grace of these early reliefs had a charm for the artists and patrons of later times, especially the times of the first emperors, such as has been exercised in our day by the paintings of the pre-Raphaelite masters, and between the imitations then produced and the original models it is frequently difficult to draw a clear distinction. A critical list of these imitations—whether sculptured in relief or in the round—is given by Friederichs, Bausteine, i. pp. 71-95; and, with illustrations, by Overbeck, Gesch. d. Griech. Plastik, 2d ed., i. pl. 14. As examples of early sculpture in its inferior walk may be mentioned (10), a series of bronze statuettes which have served as stands of mirrors or otherwise as decorations of furniture. Those which have been or are still stands of mirrors are generally female figures, and it is to be observed that the oldest of them, as distinguished from the later examples, wear a heavy under-garment or chiton, apparently of worsted material, and over this again an ample and by no means light peplos.

If we are to credit the Greeks with having been introduced .by the Assyrians to one branch of art more than another, we should say it was the art of gem-engraving. Not that we possess Greek gems which compare in style and antiquity with those of Assyria, but, if for no other reason, because we find a technical process of so great difficulty existing at all in Greece at an early period. Perhaps the earliest examples of the art in Greece possessed of artistic merit are two scarabs from Aegina, one with the figure of a bowman in pure Aeginetan style, and the other bearing the inscription Kpeovτiδα iip.1 (Bullettino d. Inst. Arch. 1840, p. 140); three from Asia Minor, two of them being inscribed, the one 2^/xovoç, the other , Apκrτoτeiχης (Brunn, Gesch. d. Griech. Künstler, ii. pp. 633 and 604). The only glyptic artist mentioned in this early period is Mnesarchus of Samus, the father of Pythagoras. In contrast with the paucity of early gems from Greek soil is the immense number of scarabs yielded by the tombs of Etruria, which at least reflect the style of this period. The material consists principally of rock-crystal, carnelian, and banded agate, and the subjects, it is worthy of remark, are mostly taken from the heroic legends of Greece, figures of deities being exceedingly scarce, as indeed is also the case on the Etruscan bronze mirrors, which, however, are obviously of a later date.

Painting, or rather colouring, as it would be more properly described in its earliest phase, in which it was entirely subservient to architecture and ceramography, is said to have been first elevated to an art by Cleanthes of Corinth, who introduced the drawing of figures in outline; by Telephanes of Sicyon, who improved on this by indicating the principal details of anatomy; and finally by Ecphantes of Corinth or .Craton of Sicyon, by the introduction of colours (Pliny, N. H., xxxv. 3, 15). Again we have Eumarus of Athens, who is said to have first distinguished in his paintings men from women, probably by the means adopted in the early vases, that is, by painting the flesh white in the case of women. The historical truth of these statements may be doubted; not so, however, those that refer to Cimon of Cleonae, who made an unquestionable advance in the treatment of draperies, and in exchanging the conventional manner of rendering the human form for an approach to truthfulness to nature (Aelian, Var. ∏ιst., viii. 8; Pliny, N^. H., xxxv. 8, 6). Cimon appears to have been the founder of the early.Peloponnesian school oi painting. As the task imposed on painters at that time was mostly the decoration of the cella walls of temples, we must suppose that they executed their paintings on the prepared stucco of the wall either when it was fresh (al fresco), or when it was dry, by means of some binding material, a tempera'. Like their followers down to the time of Apelles, they used only the simple colours, white, yellow, red, and bluish black, in the mixing of which to obtain other shades they seem to have advanced very little, greater attention being directed to the drawing than to the colouring. From the school of Asia Minor, which, from the proximity of the Lydians, Phrygians, and Phoenicians, with their long practice in working in colours, may have arisen earlier than that of the Peloponnesus, the first name we hear of is that of Bularchus, who, according to Pliny (√V. H., vii. 38, 126; xxxv. 8, 55), produced a large painting of the taking of Magnesia, which he sold to Candaules, king of Lydia, for its weight in gold. From the coast of Asia Minor our records of painting pass to Samus, an island which was conspicuous in early times for the grand scale of its undertakings. There Mandrocles, who made the bridge of boats across the Bosphorus by which Darius crossed with his army 515 B.c., executed a large historical painting of this passage of the Persians across the bridge, with Darius seated, enthroned, on the shore. This picture, according to Herodotus (iv. 88), was placed in the Heraeum of Samus. To the Samian school belonged Calliphon and Agatharchus. It is also not unlikely that it had exercised some influence on Aglaophon of Thasus, the father and instructor of Polygnotus. From Corinth the art of painting, coupled with that of modelling in clay, passed to Etruria, lower Italy, and Sicily. At present the only examples of early Greek painting which we can adduce are furnished by the vases, a branch of the art which the ancients themselves regarded, it appears, with sufficient disrespect. For us, the vases, which have been preserved in great numbers, have this special value, that they present in an unbroken line, if in a comparatively degraded form, the various stages of Greek painting from its first beginnings under Oriental influence to its decline. The class which belongs to the period now before us is distinguishable from the others by the fact that the figures upon them are first scratched in outline on the red ground of the vase, and then filled in with black, the whole being covered with a varnish which seems to have lost nothing of its brilliancy. The other colours employed are white for the flesh parts of women and the hair of old men, white and a dark purple for the details of draperies and other accessories. The eyes are always placed full in profile, and the drawing of the figures is exceedingly, stiff and angular. By far the greater part of this class of vases have been found in the tombs of Etruria, and for this reason they were called Etruscan, a designation which they retained till the frequency of Greek inscriptions, recording the artists’ names upon them, contrasted with the total absence of Etruscan inscriptions, led to their being correctly traced to Greek workshops. As to their date, it has recently been argued by a high authority (Brunn, Probleme in der Geschichte der Vasenmalerei) that the greater part of these vases—in fact, all that have been found in Etruria, with at most two or three exceptions—are the production of Greek vase painters at a period not earlier than the end of the 3d century b.c., when a taste for the archaic manner must have revived. This theory has encountered much opposition. Applying it to the large collection of vases of this class from Etruria in the British Museum, one vase alone remains as a genuine example of the work of an early period. Whether we regard these vases as spontaneous productions or as imitations, they will serve to convey at best a dim idea of early Greek painting as a fine art. Of the next class of vases—those with red figures on black ground—some appear, from the severity of the drawing, to belong to the end of this period. The whole question of ancient vase-painting has been very fully and ably discussed by Otto Jahn in his Introduction to the Vasen- Sammlunq zu München.
[9:2:354]

In temple architecture the principles of both the Doric and Ionic orders were already fully established, the latter in Asia Minor and the former in Greece proper; and it is characteristic of the national importance attached to this branch of art, that not only was the best available talent of the time procured, irrespective of local connection, but also that architects appear to have found a public for the writings in which many of them narrated their proceedings, and described the appliances used by them in building, as did Chersiphron and his son Metagenes in regard to the temple of Diana at Ephesus; or laid down the principles they had followed, as did Theodorus with regard to the temple of Hera at Samus. Among the remains of Doric architecture assignable to this period, the first to be mentioned are the two temples at Paestum (Major, Les Ruines de Paestum, ou de Posidonie, 1768; cf. Schnaase, Bildende Künste, ii. fig. 36), of which the larger derives a special interest from the two rows of columns, one above the other, with which it is furnished in the interior, for the purpose of supporting, as it appears, a hypaethral roof. Differing in many details from the Paestum temple is that of Selinus, the sculptured metopes of which have already been described, and assigned to the commencement of this period. The columns are here slimmer, being 41 times the lowest diameter in height; but the architrave has gained in height and heaviness. A transition from the heaviness of the old Doric temples—of Paestum and Selinus, for example—to the graceful proportions of the Doric order in Attica is presented by the temple of Athene in Aegina, the columns of which, however, are still too short, being a little over 5 times the lowest diametèr in height, and the architrave and frieze too high for the Attic-Doric style. Of the Ionic order during this period the principal example was the temple of Diana at Ephesus, the construction of which, begun by Theodorus of Samus, was carried on by Chersiphron of Crete and his son Metagenes, and completed by Demetrius and Paeonius about the time of Croesus, 565-551 B.C., 120 years having, it is said, from first to last been consumed on the work (Strabo, xiv. 640; Vitruvius, vii. praef.; Pliny, A r . H., xxxvi. 14, 95). This temple having been burned by Herostratus, was restored under the direction of Alexander’s architect Dinocrates. The oldest instance of the Ionic order in Greece proper, so far as we know, was found in the treasury erected at Olympia by Myron, the tyrant of Sicyon, after his chariot victory, 658 B.c. This building consisted of two chambers, the walls overlaid in the ancient manner with bronze plates, and the one executed in the Ionic, while the other was of the Doric order. The architects of this early time were not, however, restricted to the erection of temples, but had other problems to solve, as, for example, in the Scias of Sparta, a round building with tent-shaped roof, used originally for musical performances and afterwards for public assemblies. Theodorus of Samus was the architect of the Scias. Probably the Odeum erected at Athens by Solon or Pisistratus had the same round form, and was intended for meetings of the same kind. Then followed the construction of theatres, that in Athens, which was of stone, having been commenced shortly after 500 B.c.

Third Period.

The splendid victories of Salamis, Plataeae, and Mycale, gave an immediate and powerful impulse towards public undertakings, and especially, so far as we are at present concerned, towards the erection of temples and monuments worthy of the just pride of the nation. A sense of freedom and relief from long and troublous fears must have been the ruling feeling of the time; and of the efforts, both intellectual and artistic, which such new-born feelings engender, history has its examples. Of all the Greeks, the Athenians had in that crisis earned the best title to patriotic emotions, and in Athens, above all Greece besides, the aspirations were highest. Nor were means wanting to second the boldest designs. The Peloponnesians had loitered in the great conflict with the Persians, and in sharing the new impulse they loitered also. The Persian invasion had not, however, been hurled back by a stroke of fortune, but, on the contrary, by the united action which discipline and sev,ere habits of life gave to the Greek forces; and in the same way the men who thereafter achieved the first triumphs in art, who diffused freedom throughout its realm, were men who had been trained in severe schools, where close study, no less than respect for popular feeling, restrained the exercise of the imagination. Accordingly, before we can appreciate the artistic freedom established by Phidias, we must see how far his early training prepared him to fight the battle. This can only be done by examining the works of other sculptors, either pupils of the same master, as were Myron and Polycletus, or probably contemporary, though more hardened in the traditions of their school, as was Calamis the Athenian, with whom we begin, remarking that the only known approximate date in his lifetime is from 468 to 464 B.c. The works of Calamis extended over a tolerably wide field of subject, and were executed partly in marble and partly in bronze; but with the exception of two copies of his statue of Hermes Criophorus at Tanagra, on the coins of that town, and in a marble figure in Wilton House, none of our remains of ancient sculpture have as yet been identified with his style. Cicero (Brut., 18, 70) and Quintilian (xii. 10, 7) speak of him as less rigid and hard in his rendering of the human form than Callon and Canachus; but the real advance with which his name is associated was in the rendering of expression in the female face, and in the treatment of draperies. A figure of Alcmene by him was highly praised (Pliny, A r . II., xxxiv. 19, 71), while his statue of Sosandra, on the Acropolis of Athens, is spoken of in the highest terms by Lucian (Imag., 4, 6; Dial. Meretr., 3, 2) for its chaste and tender expression, for its taste in dress, and for the noble bearing of the whole figure. His horses were always incomparable. To have attained the power of expressing modesty and mobile character in a figure was to have laid the foundation for idealism in its true sense; and Calamis was therefore on the same path with Phidias.

We come now to Myron, a native of Eleutherae in Attica, and a pupil of Ageladas of Argus. With rare exceptions, he worked in bronze, and that of the Aeginetan kind, while Polycletus émployed the bronze of Delus. His works, which were numerous, and scattered from Asia Minor to Sicily, may be divided into the four classes of deities, heroes, athletes, and animals, with a considerable variety ranging within’ each of the classes. He avoided female figures almost throughout; and though he was the author of statues of Dionysus and Apollo, it should be remembered that these deities had not become soft of form till Praxiteles made them so. He preferred the well-knit figures of athletes, or of Perseus or Hercules. His animals were marvels to the ancients; and the human figures in which he succeeded best were those in which purely physical qualities were pronounced. “Corporum tenus curiosus, animi sensus non expressit,” says Pliny of him. But, according to the same authority, he was careless in rendering the hair, from which it is to be inferred that his study of the human form did not lead him, as it did Pythagoras, to an anxious reproduction of all its details. Then we have the further statement of Pliny—“Primus hic multiplicasse veritatem videtur, numerosior in arte quam Polycletus, et in symmetria diligentior.” As we understand “multiplicasse veritatem,” it would mean that he exaggerated the truth of nature to give effect to the momentary attitude of his [9:2:355] figures. “Symmetria” we take to refer to the manner in which every member and part of the body was made to work together for the expression of one moment of action. Such a style at least presents a very obvious contrast to that of Polycletus, and would answer our expectations when we read that Myron’s statue of Ladas seemed about to leap from its base to seize the victor’s wreath, the last breath leaving his lips. (For a different interpretation see Brunn, Gesch. d. Griech. Künstler, sub Pythagoras). Among his figures of animals, that of a bronze cow which stood on the Acropolis of Athens, and was afterwards removed to the temple of Peace in Rome, was celebrated by numerous epigrams. Of his other works, some have been preserved in copies down to our own time. A copy of the figure of Marsyas (from his group of Athene and Marsyas) has been recognised in a marble statue in the Lateran Museum (JZom. d. Inst., vi. pl. 23; Annali, xxx. p. 374). Of his bronze statue of a Discobolus, famous in antiquity (Quintilian, ii. 13, 10; Lucian, Philops., 18) for the boldness of its movement and the carefulness of its execution, we have several copies, of which the best is the marble statue in the palace Massimi at Rome (Müller, Denkmäler, i. pl. 32, No. 139, ό). Another marble copy in the British Museum has not only had its head (if original) placed on the shoulders the wrong way, but has been made smooth on the surface by a vigorous rubbing down, which has destroyed the original lines. A third copy of bronze, about a foot high, is in Munich. (For a list of his other works, known only by name, see Overbeck, Ant. Schriftquellen — Myron. ) F rom the few copies of his statues which we possess, and the few ancient remarks as to his style, it seems impossible to frame a conception of his work which would justify the extraordinary reputation he enjoyed. We can picture the action of his figures, but we cannot estimate the equivalents for actual life and organism which he must have employed to have almost completely satisfied eyes accustomed to the .work of Phidias. This, however, we gather from the remarks on his statue of Ladas and .the Discobolus, that he seized for his representation the moment when the whole breath was held back for a final effort of strength—that moment, in fact, when the human figure is most truly statuesque. For an instant the body is then lifeless, so to speak, like the statue itself: the spectator suspends breathing, in sympathy.

We have reached the time of Phidias, and have now done with imperfections in sculpture, so far at least as they originated in want of knowledge either of the huinan form or of technical means. Phidias, the son of Charmides, was an Athenian, and must have been born about 500 b.c., or a little before, if we can trust the statement (Plutarch, Pericl., 31) that in the portraits of himself and Pericles, which he placed on the shield of Athene Parthenos, he appeared a bald-headed old man, while Pericles appeared handsome and full of vigour (K. O. Müller, De Phidioe Vita et Operibus Commentationes Tres, Gotting. 1827; Brunn, Gesch. d. Griech. Künstler, i. p. 157). A fragment of a marble shield in the British Museum, found on the Acropolis of Athens, and representing a combat of Greeks and Amazons, in which a bald-headed old man appears, has been recognised as a rough copy of the shield in question. Phidias began his career as a painter; then turning to sculpture, studied first under his townsman Hegias, and afterwards under the Argive master Ageladas. It may have been due to his training in this school that his first two important works were executed in bronze The first was a large group, commissioned by the Athenians to be paid for out of their booty from the Persian war, and to be dedicated at Delphi. The second was a colossal statue of Athene, the Promachos, also commissioned by the Athenians out of the Persian booty, and when finished erected on the Acropolis, between the Propylaea and Erechtheum, the top of the spear which she held, and the crest of her helmet being visible at sea from Cape Sunium (Pausanias, i. 28, 2). On certain coins on which the Acropolis is figured occurs a statue which seems to correspond with the description, except that the goddess there stands placidly, an attitude that does not suit the idea of a Promachos. This idea is finely embodied in a small bronze statuette (fig. 5), found on the Acropolis and now in the British Museum, representing the goddess striding forward. Otherwise it has little of Phidias in it. Possibly the Promachos statue was wrongly ascribed to Phidias in ancient times. Again profiting by the Persian spoils, he was employed by the Plataeans to execute a figure of Athene Areia for their new temple (Pausanias, ix. 4, 1). The figuré was of wood, covered with gold; the face, hands, and feet, of Pentelic marble; the whole being of colossal proportions. He had previously made a figure of Athene in gold and ivory for a temple at Pallene in Achaea, and this must be regarded as the first of his works executed in the material in which he afterwards achieved his greatest triumph (Pausanias, vii. 27, 2).

We must suppose that his faculties were now at their best, that he was fully aware of the peculiarities of treatment required by the different materials in which sculptors then worked, and had found the best scope for his own talent in chryselephantine sculpture. The two works with which his fame was chiefly associated were in gold and ivory,—the colossal statues of Athene for the Parthenon at Athens, and of Zeus for the temple at Olympia. After the completion of the former statue, Phidias accepted the invitation of the people of Elis to exert his highest power in fashioning for their temple of Zeus at Olympia a statue worthy of the majesty and grandeur of the supreme god of Greece. His workshop was near the Altis or sacred grove, where through successive centuries down to the 2d a.d. it was preserved and pointed out with feelings of reverence. The finished work was over 40 feet high, and represented the god seated on his throne, his right hand holding forward a figure of Victory, and his left resting on a sceptre on which the eagle was perched. On his head was a wreath of olive. The drapery was of gold, richly worked with flowers and figures in enamel, in the execution of which he was assisted by his brother or cousin Panaenus. On the footstool was inscribed the verse—

ΦetδiftS Xαpμiδoυ uiδs 'Mηvaios μ' iιrolησe

(Pausanias, v. 10, 2). The throne was mostly of ebony and ivory, inlaid with precious stones, and richly sculptured with reliefs, and in parts painted. Of this, the greatest work of Phidias, nothing but the description now remains (Pausanias, v. 15). The figure of Zeus seated on a throne, which occurs on coins of Elis struck in Roman times, may have been intended as a reminiscence of it. On the other hand, there is in the British Museum a silver coin of Elis, struck in the best period of Greek art, on [9:2:356] which is a head of the god so singularly powerful iu type that we are tempted to believe it to be a copy from the head of the statue of Phidias, appealing to the analogy of the coins of Argus with what is accepted as a copy of the head of the figure of Hera by Polycletus. Among the existing examples of Greek sculpture there is only one which claims to be a direct work of Phidias, and that is one of the two colossal marble statues on the Monte Cavallo at Rome, inscribed respectively “opus Phidiae” and “opus Praxitelis” (Clarae, Musée de Sculpture, yλ, 812 A,No. 2043). Grand as both are, the marking of the pupils of the eyes and the treatment of the armour prove them to have been executed in Roman times, probably as copies of celebrated statues. The originals must clearly have been the work of one master, and the inscriptions being thus wrong in ascribing them to two, must be held as worthless. On the other hand, we possess in the sculptures of the Parthenon a large series of works in marble at least designed or modelled by Phidias, and executed under his immediate care, if not in many ' cases finished by his own hands. These sculptures consist of figures in the round from the pediments, the metopes in high relief, and the frieze in low flat relief. The statues of the pediments have suffered most, and that mainly from two causes—the antipathies or necessities of the early Christians, who converted the temple into a church; and the fatal explosion produced by the falling of a shell among the powder stored in it during the Venetian bombardment under Morosini, 1687. The extent’ of the mischief on this occasion is known from the drawings previously made of the temple as it stood, 1674, by Carrey, an artist in the employment of the French ambassador at the Porte. In 1805, Lord Elgin, then British ambassador at the Porte, removed all the sculptures that could be removed with safety to the building, shipped them to London, where, after a long dispute as to their merits, they at last, in 1815, found a permanent resting-place in the British Museum. (For a narrative of these proceedings, but especially for an exhaustive work on the Parthenon, see Michaelis, Der Parthenon, Leipsic, 1871; the sculptures are best engraved in Museum Marbles,vol. vi.; the fragments in Athens, in Laborde, Le Parthenon, pls. 26-28). The subject of the eastern pediment was the birth of Athene; of the western, her contest with Poseidon for supremacy over Attica; but beyond the simple statement of Pausanias to this effect, we have no ancient record to enable us to identify the personages before whom these events took place. Hence the many different names which have been proposed from time to time for the surviving figures, especially for those of the eastern pediment, from which all the principal statues had disappeared before Carrey’s time. Assuming, however, with the most recent authority (E. Petersen, Die Kunst des Pheidias, 1874), that the birth of Athene took place in Olympus, and that the deities assembled at the birth of Aphrodite, as represented by Phidias on the base of the statue at Olympia, were the recognised Olympians of his time, we obtain, beginning from Helios on the left, Dionysus, Demeter, and Core, Iris [Apollo, Artemis, Hephaestus, Athene, Zeus, Hera, Poseidon], Nike [Ares, Hermes], Hestia, Peitho, Aphrodite, and Selene, those in brackets being missing. The western pediment has suffered a much harder fate, though the difficulty of recalling the lines of the original composition is less, owing to the preservation of drawings made by Carrey before the bombardment which destroyed it. The metopes were ninety-two in number; those of the east and west only remain on the building, but have suffered severely from malicious destruction. Those of the north side, which survived the explosion, remain in Athens in bad condition; those of the south were removed by Lord Elgin, with the exception of one now in the Louvre and some fragments in Copenhagen. The subject—a favourite one in the decoration of Greek architecture—was a combat between Centaurs and Lapithae. Traces of red colour were found on the ground of the relief and of green on the draperies. The armour had been attached in metal, as is proved by the existing holes for that purpose. Differences in style as well as in execution prove the variety of hands employed in the work, though everywhere is apparent the oneness of design which bespeaks the overseeing master. The variety of hands is equally manifest in the frieze, but here it takes the form of insufficiency of execution, which no doubt arose from the difficulty of supervising work which had to be done up on the building. The subject of the frieze is a long festal procession, in which, though every variety of movement of horse and foot, of young and old, of men and women, perhaps of gods and goddesses, is introduced, the calm dignity of national pride and the knowledge of national worth reign supreme. Its entire length is 524 feet, its height from the ground 40 feet, its relief very low and flat. About two-thirds of it is preserved, nearly the half being in the British Museum. As to the procession itself, there are two opinions: either it is the procession with which it was usual to accompany annually the newly-made robe for Athene Polias, or it is the procession in which the victors at the Panathenaic games advanced to the Parthenon to receive their prizes and to attend a sacrifice in honour of Victory.

The mantle of Phidias fell on his pupil Alcamenes (Pausanias, v. 10, 8), an Athenian, or, as others said, a Lemnian, the lofty conception in his figures of deities being highly praised (Quintilian, xii. 10, 8), while in point of gracefulness in womanly forms he appears to have excelled his master. His most celebrated work was a statue of Aphrodite for her temple, εv κηπoι<s, of which, however, the merit of the last touch was ascribed to Phidias (Pliny, xxxvi. 5, 16). Her cheeks, hands, and fingers were specially admired; but as to the attitude and general effect we have no information, and are not justified in accepting the Aphrodite of Melus in the Louvre as a copy of it, much less the original work. How far he may have been possessed of the power of creating new ideal types is not expressly recorded, except in the instance of his statue of a triple Hecate, probably such as we know her in later works. On the other hand, there was doubtless scope for extending the new influence of Phidias in such types as those of Aesculapius, Hephaestus, and Ares, and 'it has been conjectured that in his statues of these deities he succeeded in infusing the spirit of his master.

Scarcely less famous was another pupil of Phidias, Agoracritus of Parus, who so far identified himself with the master’s style that two marble statues of deities by him were sometimes ascribed to Phidias. The one was a figure of Nemesis in Rhamnus; the other, a statue of Rhea in the Metroon at Athens (Pausanias, i. 3, 5). From his hand were also, the bronze statues of Athene Itonia and of Zeus, in the temple of that goddess between Alal-comenae and Coronea (Pausanias, ix. 34, 1). Next we have Colotes and Thrasymedes of Parus, both of whom occasionally aspired to retain the chryselephantine technique of the master; and finally, Theocosmus of Megara.

How far the immediate successors of Phidias remained, whatever their peculiarities or eccentricities, still faithful to the general sentiment and manner of the master, merely varying but always preserving essentially the theme struck by him, cannot be ascertained, unless we take the sculptures of the temple of Athene Nike at Athens, or of the Erechtheum, as typical examples of their work. And indeed they are well calculated to produce the impression of having been executed during the lull which must have followed his great impulse. (For the relief on the frieze [9:2:357] and balustrade of the temple of Nike, compare Friederichs, Bausteine, i. pp. 187—193; Ross, Der Niketempel; Kekulé, Die Balustrade des Niketempels.) The treatment of the draperies has entirely lost the stiffness and formality of an early period, and become flowing, as in the style of the best times, but with the addition of a studied grace which seems due to a desire to elaborate more and more the simplicity of the draped figures of the Parthenon. The most probable date as yet suggested for this temple is 407 B.c. As to the Erechtheum, we have 406 B.C., on the authority of an inscription, as a year in which a report was made concerning the amount of work that remained to be done upon it. Of its sculptures the chief remains are the statues of the Caryatides, and certain fragments of the frieze, which had this peculiarity, that the reliefs were executed in Pentelic marble, and then attached to a ground of black Eleusinian stone. Of the original six Caryatides which supported the portico, five were in position in the time of Stuart and Revett in the first half of last century; the sixth, having been broken to pieces, was recovered in 1837. One of the five was removed by Lord Elgin, and is now in the British Museum. In the arrangement of the draperies vertical lines prevail; but only enough to show the architectural purpose of the figures, not to destroy their character as robes, or to affect their gracefulness. It is usual to compare with the sculptures of these two temples another series of reliefs which, though not found in Attica, are stated to have been the work of Ictinus, the architect of the Parthenon. We refer to the frieze from the temple of Apollo at Phigalia which was discovered in 1812, and is now in the British Museum. The subjects represented are combats between Greeks and Amazons and between Centaurs and Lapithae. In the composition the old ethos has given way to pathos; but the figures are still large in conception, and obviously studied with a view to truth as well as effect, though in the execution probably by provincial hands, many minor details have been overlooked. The energy of action throughout is not equalled in any other ancient sculpture now in existence, while the sense of pain in the w ounded, or of fright in the helpless women who run with their infants in their arms, makes the spectator shudder. From the fact that such vigour of action and intensity of pathetic expression have not been found in the metopes of the Parthenon or the frieze of the Theseum which are devoted to the same subject, but recur in a less degree in the frieze of the Mausoleum, there is an inclination to place the Phigalian reliefs by Ictinus in as late a period as possible after the erection of the Parthenon. (Engraved, Museum Marbles, vol. v.; Stackeiberg, Der Apollotempel zu Bassoe, 1828; see Friederichs, Bausteine, i. pp. 178—181.)

The difference of temperament between the Athenians and Peloponnesians was strongly marked in the schools of sculpture peculiar to each. Political rivalry had its exact counterpart in artistic rivalry, in which Phidias represented Athens, and Polycletus the Peloponnesus. The works of the latter appear to have been always chastened with an hereditary severity, to have been attractive by the purity of their style and the finish of execution, but not commanding in aspect. “Non explevisse deorum auctoritatem videtur,” the judgment of Quintilian (xii. 10, 7) is endorsed by the statement, that his great w ork, the chryselephantine statue of Hera at Argus, yielded to the statue of Zeus at Olympia by Phidias in grandeur and imposing aspect, but out-rivalled it in finish (Strabo, viii. p. 372). Copies of the head of this statue have been identified on coins of Argus, and in three marble heads of colossal size. The first, in Naples, is severe in style, and may have been executed about the time of Polycletus; the second, in the British Museum, has more freedom, but is still chastened by a severe expression; the third, in the Villa Ludovisi, bears the marks of having been executed at a still later period. It was not, however, in producing statues of deities that Polycletus delighted most; and if surpassed by Phidias in that instance, he was quite without a rival in his own province, the rendering of the form of ideal athletes. Of this class were his Diadumenus, his Doryphorus, and a third figure (unless the Doryphorus was meant by Pliny) known as the Canon. Of the first, several presumed copies in marble exist, two of them in the British Museum (fig. 7), but in no case furnishing an adequate illustration of his style. The same may be said of the copies of the Doryphorus. More in the nature of genre work was his bronze group of boys playing with knuckle-bones (ασ∙τpαγαλ⅛ovτ∈ς), which afterwards stood in the palace of Titus in Rome, and was by some regarded as the most perfect work of the master. This motive occurs in several existing sculptures, in no case characterised by a trace of the hand of Polycletus. Among them are, in the British Museum, a small group in terra-cotta of two women playing at this game, and a marble figure of a boy, part of a group, biting his companion’s hand. Coupled with his statue of Hera, that of an Amazon, executed by him for Ephesus, in competition with the foremost of his contemporaries, and adjudged the prize, will prove that the range of his talent was by no means confined to figures of athletes; and this is made further apparent by his bronze statues of maidens carrying sacred vessels on their heads, afterwards in the possession of Heius the Mamertine, from whom they were taken by Verres (Cicero, In Verr., iv. 3, 5), as also by his statue of the Samian, Artemon, nicknamed ό π€ρι.φόρητος.

None of the pupils of

Polycletus arrived at distinction. On the other hand, his style appears to have been closely followed by his younger contemporary, Naucydes of Argus, who executed a chryselephantine statue of Hebe, to accompany that, of the same material, by the master already described (Pausanias, ii. 17, 5; Kekulé, Hebe ∖ A pupil of Naucydes was Polycletus[9:2:358] the younger, of Argus, who is known as the author of several statues of victors at Olympia, and of a statue of Zeus Philius (Pausanias, viii. 31, 4), in which the expression resembled that of Dionysus.

In addition to the existing sculptures already mentioned in connection with one or other of the ancient masters, there are others which, though their authorship has not been ascertained, undoubtedly belong to the period now before us. From these w e select—(1.) A marble relief in Athens, found at Eleusis in 1859, and representing Demeter, Cora, and boy, for whom the name either of Triptolemus or Jacchus would be applicable (Jfonwwιβnii, vi. pl. 45.) With the exception of a marked severity both in the composition and in the details, which may be due either to archaism or to a studied solemnity, this relief compares admirably with the frieze of the Parthenon. (2.) From Eleusis also comes the upper part of a female figure supporting a basket on her head (Calathephorus), now in Cambridge, in a large fine style (Wieseler, Denkmäler, ii. pl. 8, No. 92). (3.) Marble relief of Orpheus and

Eurydice, in the Villa Albani, with its two replicas in Naples and Paris. (4.) Fragments of the metopes from the temple of Zeus at Olympia, found in 1829, and now in Paris. Doubtless these reliefs were executed at the time when Phidias was at Olympia engaged on the statue for this temple, and when his pupil Alcamenes was at work on the figures for the western pediment of it. In style, however, they differ considerably from that of the Attic sculptors; nor are there any means of identifying them with the style of Paeonius of Mende, who executed the statues for the eastern pediment (Expédit. Scientifique de la if orée, i. pls. 74, 78.) (5.) The metopes and inner frieze of the temple of Theseus at Athens are still in their original place, the style being compared with that of the metopes of the Parthenon, though the temple itself is usually believed to have been built by Cimon (Stuart’s Antiquities of Athens, 2d ed.. ii pl. 19)

Examples of what may be called a lower branch of sculpture (gem-engravingS are exceedingly rare in this period. So far as Athens is concerned, this will appear less remarkable if we suppose that gem-engraving and die-sinking were one profession, and remember that at least the latter must have been, with few exceptions, unpractised there in the best period, the coins being allowed, probably for commercial reasons, to retain the old stamp with which people were familiar. Possibly also the high ideal of the times was above the grasp of such artists, though it was seized pretty generally by the sculptors of stelae, who could hardly have been men of note. In the British Museum is a carnelian (fig 8) representing a youthful figure, seated, and playing on a harp-shaped instrument, which, with a little severity, admirably reflects the style of the Parthenon frieze. Of the coins of Sicily, the large piece known as the Demaretion, and struck in the year 479 b.c., furnishes an example of the rendering of horses, which compares finely, if more advanced, with the archaic frieze from Xanthus. Similarly w orthy of study are the coins of Gelon, which are probably as early as 470 B.c., and certainly are anterior to 410 B.c.

In the records of painting during the previous period it was noticeable that painters even then, in what appeared to be one of the earliest stages of the art, were accustomed to execute large compositions, such as battle scenes. The essentially decorative character of the art required that it should be so, just as in early sculpture, in which also the decorative element prevailed, our principal records are those of large compositions, such as the chest of Cypselus or the shield of Achilles. While the epos flourished, and the country was full of heroic legends, there can be little doubt but that the principal pleasure derived from works of art lay in the variety of the subject and the manner in which it was presented, that is, in the composition, and not in the truthful rendering of individual forms. To heighten the interest of the spectator, it was usual to write the name beside each of the persons that appeared in a picture, as we see it done on the early vases. The same was the case with the sculptured reliefs on the chest of Cypselus, which on this account presents a remarkable contrast to the shield of Achilles, on which, as in Assyrian sculptures, there is no prominence of individuals, and therefore no accurate study of the human form. It is not to be supposed that in the early stage of Greek painting individual forms "were studied with any other view than that of rendering the characters more intelligible; but with this a beginning was made to lift the art into a higher sphere. At this stage appeared Polygnotus, a native of Thasus, and a son of the painter Aglaophon, of whose probable connection with the early Samian school mention has already been made. Attracted to Athens by the opportunity presented by the new buildings which were then being erected, Polygnotus, either owing to some family tie or through the recommendation of his own ability, found favour with Cimon, to whose zeal and taste the new impulse for the improvement of the city was due. In company with, or perhaps rather with the assistance of, the Athenian painters Micon and Panaenus (the brother or cousin of Phidias), he was employed to execute wall paintings for the Stoa Poecile, the Theseum, and the Anaceum, or temple of the Dioscuri at the northern foot of the Acropolis. For his services, and especially for the disinterestedness of his character, Polygnotus received what was then regarded as the highest distinction—the freedom of the city of Athens. His friendship with Cimon was intimate, and led, it was said (Plutarch, Cimon, 4), to an affectionate acquaintance with Cimon’s half-sister, the beautiful Elpinice. From Athens he w as called to Delphi to execute a series of paintings for the two long walls of the Lesche, a building erected there by the people of Cnidus. The paintings, however, appear to have been commissioned by the Amphictyonie council, if it is right to be guided to that conclusion by the statement that the painter was rewarded with the rights of hospitality throughout the states included in the Amphictyonie league. On the wall to the right after entering the Lesche were painted scenes illustrative of the old epos of the taking of Troy (’Ιλίου 7rεpσtς). On the left was the visit of Ulysses to the lower world, as described in Book xi. of the Odyssey. The names of most of the persons were written by the side of the figures. The various groups and incidents depicted we know from the description of Pausanias (x. 25-31); and with the help of existing works of art in which the same subject recurs, we can form an idea of the composition (0. Jahn, Die Gemälde des Polygnotus in der Lesclιe zu Delphi, 1841; Weicker on the same subject in the Abhandlungen of the Berlin Academy, 1847; Watkiss Lloyd, in the Museum of Classical Antiquities, i. p. 44). Heydemann (Iliupersis, Berlin, 1866) republishes, for the illustration of his other figures, the famous Vivenzio vase in Naples (Mus. Borb., xiv. pls. 41, 43), which, pregnant with pathos as no other vase in existence, cannot well be identified with the style of Polygnotus, unless perhaps as regards the composition. He was employed at Thespiae on a stoa or temple, but from some defect his work had perished so far within a century after it was [9:2:359] finished that it had to be restored by Pausias of Sicyon. At Plataeae he painted for one of the walls of the pronaos of a temple the scene in which Ulysses appeared with the dead suitors at his feet. The companion picture was by an otherwise unknown artist, Onasias, the subject of it being the Expedition of the Seven against Thebes (Pausanias, ix. 4, 2). Lastly, Pausanias (i. 22, 6) ascribes to Polygnotus a series of paintings in the so-called Pinako-theke on the Acropolis of Athens. If he is right, the painter must then have been full seventy years of age. The subjects were—(1.) Ulysses carrying off the bow of Philoctetes; (2.) Diomede carrying off the Palladium of Troy; (3.) Orestes and Pylades slaying Aegisthus and the sons of Nauplius, who had come to his aid; (4.) Polyxena about to be sacrificed to the manes of Achilles; (5.) Achilles in Scyrus; and (6.) Ulysses meeting Nausicaa and her maids. The other pictures had become unrecognisable through the effects of time. This second mention of the decay of his works reminds us of the fleeting nature of the material with which the fame of the great painter was bound up. It was well that high honours were paid him in his lifetime. The enduring marble in which Phidias worked has preserved his fame to our times, to mock the indignities which he suffered in life. As regards the style of Polygnotus,, we have the distinction drawn by Aristotle (Poet., 2, 6; Polit., viii. 5) between it and that of Zeuxis—a distinction which he expressed by the words ethos and pathos. By ethos, as applied to the paintings of Polygnotus, we understand a dignified bearing in his figures, and a measured movement throughout his compositions, such as the Parthenon frieze presents, compared with the pathetic rendering of scenes in the frieze from the temple of Apollo at Phigalia, or in the frieze of the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus. It was also said (Pliny, A r . H., XXXV. 35, 58) that in place of the old severity and rigidity of the features he introduced a great variety of expression, and was the first to paint figures with the lips open; and further, he was accredited (Lucian, Imag., 7) with great improvements in the rendering of drapery, so as to show the forms underneath. He painted in monochrome on a white ground; so that, in fact, the principal charm of his work must have been in the drawing. His brother Aristophon appears to have also inherited an elevated conception and a power of carrying out large compositions. Among the younger contemporaries of Polygnotus were Dionysius of Colophon, laboriously accurate, and Pauson, the butt of Aristophanes (Thesmoph., v. 949, and elsewhere), remarkable for his talent of caricature and animal painting.

The works of these painters have entirely perished, nor in what remains of the work of their humble imitators, the vase painters, is there much that can be justly regarded as reflecting their style. Besides the Athenian lecythi, which give some sort of an idea of the effect of colours as employed by Polygnotus, there is a class of vases, with red figures on a black ground, which, by the treatment of the drapery as a transparent substance, recall the statement to the same effect made in respect of the great painter. In many cases, also, the figures are large in conception and measured in their movement.

The history of architecture during tlιis period is an unexampled record of great undertakings throughout Greece, but more especially in Athens, which, if. it had suffered most from the Persian invasion, had also in the end acquired the most ample means of repairing its ruins and adding fresh lustre to its aspect. Themistocles having been banished, the administration and the carrying out of works begun by him—such, for example, as the long walls connecting the city with the harbour—fell to Cimon. The city walls on the south side of the Acropolis were rebuilt, and a tower erected to command the entrance, which, however, being afterwards rendered useless by the ereoti on of the Propylaea, was removed to make way for the temple of Athene Nike. Among the new temples the first to be mentioned is the Theseum, which is not only well preserved still, but is also the oldest existing example of the Attic-Doric order (Stuart and Rivett, Antiquities of Athens, iii. pl. 7). The other temples, the erection of which may with great probability be traced to Cimon, are the Anaceum, or temple of the Dioscuri, at the foot of the Acropolis, on the north side; and a small temple, now quite destroyed, on the left bank of the Hissus, which existed in Stuart ’ ε time, and, from his drawing (Antiquities of Athens, L pl. 7), is seen to have been of the Ionic order, differing from the Attic-Ionic in wanting the dentils of the cornice, in having the base of its columns composed of a trochilus between two spirals, and in having its architrave quite plain. Cimon was succeeded by Pericles, under whose administration the resources of the city, not only in means, but in the talent of using the existing means, were applied with the greatest judgment and energy, foremost among his advisers being Phidias. According to Plutarch (Pericl., 133), Phidias exercised a general supervision over all the public works then going on. Apparently at this time was erected the Odeum, a building intended for musical performances, circular in form, and, as appears from the records of it (Vitruv., v. 9; Pausanias, i. 20, 4), brilliantly decorated with numerous columns in the interior, and with a tent-shaped roof of wood. It was the Acropolis, however, that was reserved for the crowning effort of architecture in this period. Within the space of probably not more than five or six years there rose on the site of an old temple of Athene, which had been destroyed by the Persians, the Parthenon, a model for all time of the Doric order, pure and perfect in its architectural forms and proportions. The architect was Ictinus, who was assisted by Callicratidas (Stuart, Antiquities of Athens, ii. pl. 7; Penrose, An Investigation of the Principles of Athenian Architecture, 1851; Beulé, L' Acropole d' Athènes ; Bötticher, Bericht über die Untersuchungen auf der Akropolis von Athen, 18G2; Michaelis, Der Parthenon, 1871). The next undertaking was the so-called Propylaea, a building which, though practically serving as an entrance to the Acropolis, aspired to a highly decorative character (Stuart, Antiquities of Athens, ii. pl. 42). The architect was Mnesicles. Contemporary with the building of the Propylaea, it appears, was that of the small temple of Athene Nike, on the Acropolis, which, on the removal of a Turkish structure in 1835, was recovered in almost all its parts, except some slabs of the frieze, brought by Lord Elgin to England, and now in the British Museuni (Beulé, L ’ Acropole, p. 124; Kekulé, Die Balustrade des Niketempels}. Outside of Athens the example of the Periclean activity was felt at Eleusis, where a great temple for the Mysteries was commenced, from designs by Ictinus, and carried to completion by the three successive architects, Coroebus, Metagenes, and Xenocles. The small temple, in antis, of Artemis Propylaea at Eleusis probably belongs to this period, as does also the temple of Nemesis at Rhamnus, of which we have still important remains. There is yet to be mentioned the Erechtheum, or temple of Athene Polias, on the Acropolis of Athens, which, though the only date we possess of it falls after the death of Pericles, bears the strongest impress, both in its architectural and sculptured forms, of the great age. The date referred to is the twenty-third year of the Peloponnesian war, and occurs in an inscription found on the Acropolis in several pieces, in which is given the report drawn up by a commission appointed to inspect the progress of the works (Inwood, The Erechtheum of Athens, 1827; Rangabé, Ant. ∕λ√Z., Nos. 56-60; Corpus [9:2:360] Inscript. Groec. No. 160). In the British Museum, besides part of this inscription, are several specimens of the architectural decoration, and one of the Caryatides (or draped female figures who supported the portico), in which the simplicity of the drapery and the dignity of the pose are quite in the spirit of the Parthenon sculptures. The temple of Apollo Epicurius at Phigalia, in Arcadia, the work of Ictinus, the architect of the Parthenon, necessarily belongs also to this period (Cockerell, Temples of Jupiter at Aegina and Apollo at Phigalia). The great temples at Olympia and Delphi, though begun earlier, may also be reckoned among the works of this period, to which also belongs a large series of Doric temples in the Greek towns of Sicily and Magna Graecia, particularly those of Syracuse, Agrigentum, Selinus, Egesta, and Metapontum. Of these the most remarkable are the southern temple in the lower town of Selinus, and the somewhat more recent temple of Zeus at Agrigentum.

Fourth Period.

Since the beginning of our last period, the political and social circumstances of Greece have suffered a marked change. More or less it was then accepted as a dogma that, provided the state was flourishing, the prosperity of individuals mattered little. All were for the state, and by their union in the state’s emergency had achieved a glorious freedom, the sense of which filled the national mind, and prepared it to respond with a fostering sympathy to the efforts of artists, whom it also inspired. Yet, conscious as they must have been of their own services, the men of that generation turned rather in pride to the deeds of their ancestral heroes, and in humility to the assistance of the gods. They sought to frame their conduct on the traditions of the past. They were rigorous and strong in thought. Passion was a thing to deplore, not to study, analyse, and represent. The national history was still unchequered. Nor was the house of Hellas as yet to any degree openly divided against itself. There was no need of artists—whether poet, as Aeschylus, or sculptor, as Phidias—to depict the struggles of passion or other conditions of the mind. Now this is all changed. The nation has lost its unity, and the Peloponnesian war has made havoc of its resources. Aeschylus has given way to Sophocles and Euripides, Phidias to Scopas and Praxiteles. Poets and sculptors of the new generation have chosen as their theme the representation of pathos and of the conditions of the mind generally. That such was the character of what is called the second Attic school of sculpture is known principally from the records of artists. Of works directly from the hand of any of the masters of this school there is no example in existence, so far as we know at present. On the other hand, there are many copies of their works, from which, with the aid of records, some idea may be formed of their style.

The first of the artists of this school λvas Scopas, a native of Parus, and, as it would seem, the son and pupil of Aristandrus, a worker in bronze, in which material the son appears to have commenced his career as a sculptor. An example of his work in bronze was the statue of Aphrodite sitting on a goat, in Elis (Pausanius, vi. 25, 2). This subject occurs on a fragmentary cameo in the British Museum. Marble, however, was a material more congenial to his style. The first years of his activity were spent in the Peloponnesus, and particularly at Tegea in Arcadia, where the erection of a temple, in honour of Athene Aiea, in the place of one that had been burned 395 b.c., was under his direction as regards both the architecture and the sculpture. About 380 B.c. he settled in Athens, where for nearly thirty years he maintained a reputation for an unparalleled power of rendering the human or divine figure, not imposing, but attractive by the charm of bearing, and the expression of that feeling which for the moment the person was most sensitive to. Sometimes this feeling was one of excited passion accompanied by great bodily agitation, as for example, in the case of his statue of a Maenad at Athens, in the attitude of rushing with head thrown back and streaming hair, and holding a slain kid in her hand. At other times the passion he sought to express was one of peaceful inspiration, as in the statue of Apollo Citharoedus, with long flowing robe and head thrown back as in a dreamy enjoyment of the strains from his lyre. When considerably advanced in life, possibly over sixty years of age, Scopas was invited by Artemisia, the queen of Caria, to assist or direct the sculptures for a monument which she was erecting at Halicarnassus in memory of her husband Mausolus. Accompanied by Bιyaxis, Leochares, and Timotheus (or Praxiteles, as others said), he proceeded thither, but as to what part he had in the work we have no information. The site of the Mausoleum was discovered and excavated by Mr C. T. Newton in 1856-7, the result being the recovery of an important part of the sculptures, which, with the slabs of the frieze previously known, now constitutes the principal illustration of the art) of that time (Newton, Discoveries at Halicarnassus, Cnidus, and Branchidae, 1862). While occupied on the Mausoleum, or after its completion, Scopas executed several sculptures for other towns in Asia Minor, as at Cnidus, Ephesus, and Chryse in the Troad. In a temple of Neptune, erected in Rome by Cn. Domitius Ahenobarbus, was a large com-, position by Scopas, representing Poseidon, Thetis, and Achilles, attended by nereids riding on dolphins and hippocamps, and by tritons and other marvellous creatures of the sea. Not as a copy of tlιis work, but as reflecting vividly the manner of this scιrlptor, has been accepted the large marble relief in Munich (O. Jahn, Berichte der Sächs. Ges. d. JJ‰, 1854, pls. 3-8), representing the marriage of Poseidon and Amphitrite. How far the merit belongs to Scopas of having introduced into.Greek art the ideal types of those marine beings who personified the element of the sea, is unknown. In a temple of Apollo at Rome there was further a large composition, representing the slaughter of the children of Niobe, about the authorship of which there were two opinions,—the one ascribing it to Scopas, the other to Praxiteles. While this dubiety is itself proof that the two artists were rivals in the power of expressing pathos and suffering, there is a considerable probability that the composition in question was more adapted, of the two, to the genius of Scopas. Of this work there exists what is believed to be a more or less complete copy in the series of marble statues in the gallery of the Uffizi at Florence. The work is very uneven throughout, as might be expected in Roman copies; but the dramatic character of the action, and the powerful rendering of pain and suffering in the faces, still bespeak the style of the original sculptor, who, whether Scopas, Praxiteles, or another, was certainly an Athenian artist of the first half of the 4th century B.C. (Friederichs, Bausteine, i. pp. 230- 246). Another example of the style of this period, in the combination of beauty with a lovable and touching expression of face, is the so-called statue of Leucothea, in the Glyptotheke of Munich, which there are grounds for assigning to Cephisodotus, the father, it would seem, of Praxiteles, who is recorded to have made for Athens a statue of Irene with the boy Plutus in her arms, which, as it appears on the coins of Athens, closely resembles the Leucothea. This Cephisodotus, standing as he did in the period between the old and the new Attic schools, seems to have shared the qualities of both, but to have inclined rather to the latter.

That Praxiteles was directly a pupil of Scopas is not [9:2:361] proved even by the fact that he worked in the same artistic vein and spirit, with a result which rendered his style undistinguishable from that of the older master to the eyes of Roman connoisseurs. Still, it will be safe to assume that he was largely influenced in his youth by the then favourite sculptures of Scopas. The scene of his labours was mostly Athens and the neighbouring towns. That he accompanied Scopas to Halicarnassus to assist with the sculptures of the Mausoleum, as is stated, is probably true; but from the fact that elsewhere in place of his name occurs that of Timotheus, it has been inferred that he may there have abandoned his original intention, and confined himself to the execution of those statues for towns in that district of which we have records. About 340 B.c. he returned to Athens, and there remained till his death, studying, with Phryne as his model, the expression of sensual beauty in its highest type. Like Scopas, he had little taste for bronze in comparison with marble, with its surface finely sensitive to the most delicate modulation. Unsatisfied with even this, he endeavoured to soften the asperity of the marble in the crude parts by a process of encaustic, in which, or perhaps rather in the colouring of the draperies, he employed in difficult cases the contemporary painter Nicias (Pliny, A r . 7∕.,xxxv. 39, 122). That he was peculiar in thus tinting the marble, and an exception among other Greek sculptors, cannot be meant, in the face of so many instances as we now have of the application of the circumlitio in the remains of Greek sculpture and architecture (Semper, Der Stil, i. pp. 498 and 514). The fact, however, of his being mentioned in connection with it may be taken as a proof that the process was an exceedingly refined one, since his favourite subjects were those of youthful or feminine ideal beauty, in w hich it is to be supposed that the tints corresponding to those in nature would appear almost evanescent in their delicacy. Of his works, the number of which was unusually large, the most celebrated were—(1.) The marble statue of Aphrodite at Cnidus, of which the more or less modified copies, as the Venus of the Capitoline Museum and the Venus de Medicis, together with the ancient records, show that the goddess was represented standing nude at the moment when she has left her bath, and, being sensitive to the air, presses her left leg against her right, and looks towards the drapery which she has already laid hold of with her left hand. Originally commissioned by Cos, but declined on account of its nudity, this statue was replaced by another of Aphrodite, with which the marble statue in the Louvre, found in Melus in 1820, has frequently been compared. But before accepting it as an illustration of the type of Aphrodite by Praxiteles, or of the more highly praised figure of the goddess by Scopas, it is necessary to bear in mind that on a base found with it, which, though now lost, is vouched for on creditable authority, was inscribed the name of the artist, Alexandrus, son of Menides of Antioch, who must have lived after Alexander the Great (Friederichs, Bausteine, i. pp. 331-334). (2.) A statue of Aphrodite at

Thespiae; beside which was placed (3) a portrait statue of Phryne; and (4), a statue of Eros, in Parian marble, of which there are two accounts,—either that it was given by him to Phryne in token of his admiration, or that she contrived to obtain it by a ruse, and then dedicated it at Thespke. The figure of Eros was here not that of a boy, as in later art, but was taken from the period of youth at which love is purely ideal, and the whole being is pervaded by an elevating ardour. Apparently exhibiting the same refinement of youthful form was his statue known as the " Celebrated Satyr,” in Athens. Of his Apollo Sauro-ctonus several copies of inferior merit exist. His statue of Artemis Brauronia at Athens had a mouth inviting to a kiss.

The ablest of the contemporaries of Scopas and Praxiteles were Bryaxis, Timotheus, and Leochares, of whom the last worked chiefly in bronze, and travelled over a wide field of conceptions, including deities, portraits, mythological and allegorical subjects. Another new type which belongs to this period is that of Serapis by Bryaxis. From the time of Philip and Alexander the Great, portrait statues furnished a large part of the occupation of sculptors, and in this they were not confined to living models, as we gather, for example, from the portraits of Sappho and Corinna by Apollodorus, a sculptor of this time,—a fact from which it may be inferred that portraiture was still inclined to idealism, though doubtless a strong tendency to realism had already set in.

The development of the art of sculpture in the Argive-Sicyonian school, corresponding to that just described in the second Attic school, was begun by the Corinthian Euphranor, whose principal study was directed with the view of modifying the hitherto canonical proportions of Polycletus, to suit the changed tastes with which he had probably become impregnated during his long stay in Athens. To this end he introduced a smaller head and a slimness of the arms and legs -which gave a greater lightness to the figure, and which, under the hand of his follower Lysippus, became the favourite type of ideal athletic statues. Lysippus, a native of Sicyon, and originally employed as an ordinary worker in bronze, rose by dint of study to the position of a sculptor of the first order. Nor was the quality of his work more surprising than the quantity. About 1500 statues and groups in bronze were counted as having been produced in his workshop, and among them two at least of colossal size—the statue of Jupiter at Tarentum, 60 feet high, and that of Hercules in the same place. The masterpieces which he appears to have studied most were those of his townsman Polycletus. Like Euphranor, however, he was compelled to seek a new system of proportions,—to exchange the immovable dignity and repose by which the old masters suggested the possession of physical power, for new attitudes, in which the exercise of physical power should be made apparent by its effect on the body and on the face. The colossal frame of Hercules was a favourite study with Lysippus, for this reason especially, we presume, that of all the ancient heroes he was represented in the legends as bearing about with him always the effect of the arduousness of his labours. There was no gaiety or elasticity in his composition. A figure of an athlete in the act of scraping the sweat and dust from his body, Apoxyomenus, which enjoyed a high reputation in Rome, where it stood before the baths of Μ. Agrippa, has an additional interest for us in the fact that a marble copy of it still exists, which, though of inferior work, forms an admirable illustration of the statements re-gardiιιg[9:2:362] the proportions adopted by Lysippus, viz., a small head and comparatively long slim arms and legs {Monumenti d. Inst. Arch. v. pl. 13; Friederichs, Bausteine, i. p. 286). That he was also equal to the times in the production of allegorical figures may be gathered from the description (see Overbeck, Schriftquellen, Lysippus) of his bronze statue of Cairus, a personification of what is vulgarly called the “nick of time.” It remains to point out, with reference to the style of Lysippus, that he confined himself mostly to the rendering of male forms, and that in regard to the few female figures by him there is no mention of the charm of sensual beauty which characterised the second Attic school; nor, again, do we find that other characteristic of theirs, the expression of pathos, in the male figures by him. His animosa signa must be taken as expressing physical life— anima, not animus.

Among the remaining sculptures which belong to this period the most remarkable are—(1.) The sculptures of the so-called Nereid monument discovered at Xanthus, in Lycia, by Sir Charles Fellows, and now in the British Museum. These sculptures consist of (a) a series of female figures in the round, about the size of life, wearing a thin long drapery through which the forms are entirely visible; (δ and c) a broad and a narrow frieze, both representing battle scenes. While the design of the narrow frieze is singularly Assyrian in conception, that of the broader frieze and the statues in the round is purely Greek, at Qne time suggesting the style of the Parthenon sculptures, at another the refining and movement of the second Attic school (Fellows, An Accoujιt of the Ionic Trophy Monument excavated at Xanthus, London, 1848; W. W. Lloyd, The Nereid Monument, London, 1845). (2.) The reliefs on the monument of Lysicrates, a round building in Athens, popularly known as the Lantern of Demosthenes. The victory which it was erected to commemorate was gained in the year 334 B.c. The subject is Bacchus and his suite transforming the Tyrrhenian pirates into dolphins. The figures are powerful, but light of foot and tall. The unusually large spaces between the groups and figures is suggestive of the lonely distances on the sea-shore, and in this respect the frieze seems to encroach on the province of painting {Marbles of the British Museum, ix. pls. 22-26). (3.) A series of portrait sculptures, for which reference is made to Friederichs, Bausteine, i. pp. 290-308. The great bronze head (fig. 10) placed here may, on further consideration, require to be moved to an earlier period, though the many carelessnesses in details which it exhibits seem at present to render such a step unadvisable.

Besides sculptors, otherwise famous, who applied themselves to toreutic art, there were others who made this their principal occupation. Of these we know Mys, who executed the designs on the shield of the bronze Pallas of Phidias on the Acropolis of Athens; and, more celebrated, Mejtor, who worked chiefly on silver bowls and cups, for wh'ιch fabulous sums were afterwards paid by Roman collectors. He must have lived before the time of Alexander the Great, since some of his works perished in the burning of the temple of Diana at Ephesus. Two other caelatores apparently of this period were Acragas and Boethus.

A branch of art allied to the caelatura is that of die-sinking and gem-engraving. Of the former the finest examples during this period are the silver coins of Syracuse, especially the decadrachms with the head of Arethusa on the obverse and a quadriga on the reverse. The presence of the engraver’s name on many of these coins is testimony of the value attached to their work. From this source we know the engravers Cimon and Euaenetus. Other names, such as Euclides, Eumenus, Eumelus, Phrygillus, and Sosion, also occur on smaller silver coins. With the exception of Athens, where the archaic type was preserved, there is a general feeling for beauty throughout the Greek coinage of this period, the specimens most deserving of study being those of Arcadia, of the Opuntian Locri, of the Macedonian kings Philip and Alexander, of the Chalci-deans of Thrace, of Cydonia in Crete, w here the name of the engraver Neuantus occurs, and of Lesbus. In gemengraving during this period the fame of Pyrgoteles is [9:2:363] known, but of all the existing gems which bear his name it may be questioned whether one reflects adequately his style. It may be taken as certain that some of them are from his hand. He was the court engraver of Alexander the Great, whose portrait he made on an emerald. The marble head here given (fig. 11) shows a distinctly realistic tendency, compared with the head on the coins. Possibly the portrait of Alexander which appears on the coins of his successor Lysimachus was in some way drawn from the gem (Brunn, G each. d. Griech. Künstle)’, ii. p. G29). Among the few examples of gems that can be unhesitatingly assigned to this period is the chalcedony with the figure of a crane found in Kertch, and now in the Hermitage, St Petersburg, bearing the signature of Dexamenus of Chius, ΔEΞAMEN02 EΠOIE XIO2 {Compte Kendu de lα Comm. Arch, pour Vann. 1861, p. 147, pl. vi. 10).

In painting, the transition from the style of Polygnotus to that of the new school was again, as has been said, a transition from ethos to pathos, from character and noble bearing to beauty and effect. The change, as elsewhere, was in harmony with the spirit of the times; but of the steps by which it was brought about two deserve attention; the first is the exigencies of scene-painting, on which Sophocles, and, after his example, his older contemporary Aeschylus, laid great value. In this direction the artist of the day was Agatharchus of Samus, who also wrote an account of the decorations executed by him, and by this led to the investigation of the principles of perspective in painting by Democritus and Anaxagoras. The second step was the gradation of light and shade and of colours introduced by Apollodorus, who for this service is regarded as the founder of the new school. At the door opened by Apollodorus entered Zeuxis, as he himself is reported to have said, into the sanctuary of art. Not that Zeuxis was directly a pupil of the older master. All that is known of their relations to each other consists of mutual compliments. That the charm of Zeuxis’s popularity was in great part due to novelty of situation and effect might be inferred from the statement regarding his picture of a centauress suckling her young, the spectators of which forgot the painter in the subject. On the other hand, the story of his having constantly before his eyes five of the most beautiful maidens of the town of Croton while he was painting his figure of Helena, suggests that he must have been a close student of form and perhaps also of colour. His figures were of a large mould, as in the earlier school, and for this reason his heads and limbs appeared a little coarse to Roman connoisseurs accustomed to the elegance of a later time. In this direction a great step in advance . was made by his contemporary Parrhasius of Ephesus, who like Zeuxis also lived some time in Athens, enjoying the society of Socrates, and vaunting his personal appearance as well as his artistic powers. The dominant faculty of drawing in Parrhasius led him to choose his subjects from male heroic figures, and led him also, it will be charitable and not without analogy to conjecture, to produce the immoral scenes with which his name is connected. From excellence in drawing and colouring the next step was towards a just conception of the subject on hand, and this step was taken by Timanthes, of the island of Cythnus. One of his great pictures was the tragic scene of the sacrifice of Iphigenia, in which the expression of sorrow was rendered with a masterly gradation, from the bystanders (Calchas, Ulysses, Ajax, and Menelaus) up to Agamemnon, in whom the deep grief of a father was expressed by his covering his face and turning it away from the spectator. This subject, with various modifications, and particularly with the absence of the gradation of grief among the bystanders, but still obviously preserving the profound pathos of a great original, occurs in Pompeian paintings, and on a Greek relief in the gallery of Florence (0. Jahn, Archäol. Beiträge, p. 378). Whether or not a resident at Ephesus, the centre of Asiatic painting, it is clear that Timanthes stood in close relation to the school there. Contemporary with the Asiatic school existed in Greece proper two schools of painting, of which the one, with its seat in Sicyon, seems to have studied most drawing and a system of form and proportions; while the other, centred at Athens, but including some Theban painters, looked rather to the expression of pathos and the emotions of the mind. The founder of the Sicyonian school was Eupompus (401- 381 B.c.) It was, however, to his pupil Pamphilus that it owed most of its reputation, and became a school for practical instruction which attracted students from remote quarters. From his distinction in mathematics and geometry, and from the fact of his having introduced drawing as a general element of instruction for youth, it is inferred that his teaching was mainly directed to the reproduction of form. On the other hand, it is also known that his researches led to an improvement in the colours employed in encaustic painting, and further that this art was carried to its highest perfection by his pupil Pausias. In a middle position between the Sicyonian and Attic schools stood Eιiphranor the Corinthian, of whom as a sculptor mention has already been made. His subjecte were of the higher grade of historical painting, being mostly large compositions of mythological scenes or historical events, of which an example was to be seen on the portico of Zeus Eleutherius in the Agora of Athens. In Thebes, where since the recovery of freedom from the Lacedaemonians a new impulse for art as well as politics had been felt, a school of painting was formed, apparently at first under the influence of that of Sicyon. At its head was Nicomachus, a son and pupil of Aristiaeus. A greater fame was achieved by his son Aristides, as an example of whose work, Pliny (A. 7I., xxxv. 36, 98) quotes a picture from the capture of a town in which a mother appeared mortally wounded, and with a harrowing expression of dread on.her face lest the child clinging to her breast should suck blood instead of milk. His activity extended to portraiture and to genre subjects; but he worked by preference in the encaustic process, the credit of inventing which has been wrongly ascribed to him. Among the other painters of note who followed the manner of the second Attic school of sculpture there remains only Nicias, a son of Nicomedes of Athens, and a pupil of Antidotus, from whom he learned the extreme care of execution originally taught by Euphranor.

In the person of Apelles, the son of Pytheas, a native of Colophon, were combined, if we may judge from his reputation, all the best qualities of the hitherto existing schools of painting. It should, however, be remembered that what we know of him comes entirely from Roman and late Greek sources, and represents rather the taste of these times than a critical judgment on his works. He was a pupil of the otherwise unknown painter Ephorus of Ephesus, which town, already celebrated as a centre of painting, he adopted as his home. But so high was then the reputation of the Sicyonian school, headed by Pamphilus and Melanthius, that on completing his studies at Ephesus he repaired to Sicyon, either to see for himself or to profit by the fame of these masters. From Sicyon ho proceeded, perhaps through the influence of Melanthius, to the court of Macedonia, where he was employed, first by Philip, and afterwards, under circumstances of the greatest intimacy, by Alexander, whom he accompanied as far as Ephesus on his expedition into Asia. Of the figures of deities painted by him the most renowned was that of Aphrodite Anadyomene, originally in the temple of Aescu-lapius in Cos, represented rising out of the sea, and wring·- [9:2:364] Painted vases.

ing the wet out of her hair, with swelling bosom and an expression of desire in her eyes. A second figure of the goddess, also intended for Cos, remained unfinished at his death. Of personifications and allegorical figures or groups, such as delighted the age in which he lived, we have examples—of the former in his group of Bronte, Astrape, and Ceraunobolia; and of the latter in his famous picture of Calumny. Partly of this character also were his two pictures of Alexander grouped with Castor, Pollux, and Victory; and Alexander in a triumphal car, beside a personification of war, in the form of a captive with hands bound behind back and seated on armour. The execution of subjects of this nature, for which thought and reflection are mainly required as opposed to the poetic and spontaneously creative faculty of a true artist, has been urged as detracting from the greatness of Apelles, and to this extent, no doubt, he was subject to the weakness of his times. Like Correggio, with whom he has been compared, he Hved at a time when the great creative spirit had passed away, and it remained for him, as for the Italian master, to discover the last resources of his art for the attainment of powerful effect and absolute finish simultaneously. To refine the harmony of his light and tones, as well as to protect his paintings from dirt, he employed a peculiar black glaze λvhich broke the sharp contrasts of colours (Pliny, A". II., xxxv. 97) required for such powerful effects as the appearance of Zeus hurling lightning. With regard to his colours little is known. The statement that he used only four (Pliny, N. II., xxxv. 50, 92) may or may not be correct (Cicero, Brut., 18). Of his mere skill we have an example in the figure of Hercules, afterwards in Rome, of which it was said that the face, though turned away from the spectator, was suggested almost as vividly as if it had been actually painted (Wustmann, Apelles' Leben und Werke, 1870). In technical skill Apelles confessed himself equalled by his contemporary Protogenes the Rhodian, claiming, however, as his own special superiority, that he knew when to stop. The fault of Protogenes was over-elaboration. On one painting he is said to have worked seven or eleven years, finishing it with four separate glazes to protect it from injury. Of the painters of this period there are still to be mentioned Antiphilus, a native of Egypt, and a pupil of Ctesidemus; Theon of Samus, who was praised for his happy choice of the right moment at which to seize an action; and Aetion.

Though the works of the masters of this period have wholly perished, there remain two sources from which some idea may be gathered of their manner,—first, a number of Pompeian paintings, which, though executed in a later age, and often intentionally varied from the originals, are still copies of the spirit and manner of the works of this time; and secondly, a large series of painted vases, which, though the production of inferior workmen, display a wonderful facility of execution, a splendour of glaze, and an application of colours which show that the example of the great painters had not been neglected. The figures stand out in red from the black ground of the vase; for the accessories, red, yellow, violet, black, blue, green, and gilding are employed. It is not, however, alone from their possession of certain traits which are assumed to have characterised the style of painting in this period that these vases are assigned to it. There exists a small but increasing series of painted vases which had been gained at the Panathenaic games at Athens, on several of which is inscribed the name of the archon for the year in which they were obtained. We have thus the exact years in which these vases were made, and at the same time specimens of the art of the time, from which a comparison is easily made with the larger series of undated vases (see Catalogue of the Vases of the British Museum).

[CLASSICAL—FOURTH

With the close of the Periclean period in Athens the Aιchitec-public desire for more temples seems to have ceased; soture. that the architecture of the period now before us is to be traced rather in works of utility, whether public or private. Of the former class are—(1), the stadium at Agrae for the athletic competitions at the Panathenaic festival; (2), the gymnasium; (3), the store-house at the Piraeus, built to contain the equipments of 1000 ships. From private sources were (4), the temple of the Muses, said to have been erected by Plato, in the Academy; and (5), the choragic monument of Lysicrates, which is the only existing example of Athenian architecture of this time (Stuart, Antiquities of Athens, i. pls. 23-30). A greater architectural activity prevailed in the Peloponnesus. At Tegea was erected, under the direction of Scopas, a temple which scarcely yielded in splendour to that of Zeus at Olympia. The laying out and building of new towns which followed upon the recovery of freedom by Thebes under Epaminondas, gave abundant scope for architects. A remarkable example of this was Megalopolis in Arcadia, which was built in an elliptical form, on the principle laid down by Hippodamus of Miletus, and carried out in the Piraeus, Thurium, and Rhodes. A more magnificent example of a new town erected in this period was Alexandria, founded by Alexander to be the first city of the world of which he was master, and built in that spirit by his favourite architect Dinocrates. The model of Alexandria was adopted by the successors of Alexander for the many new towns raised by them, as, for example, Antioch on the Orontes, the architect of which was Xenaeus. The temples of Asia Minor erected in the time of Alexander may be judged from the ruins of those of Athene Polias at Priene, of Artemis at Magnesia on the Maeander, and of Artemis at Ephesus, of which last the site has lately been excavated, with the result of confirming the few existing statements regarding its dimensions and style. The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, and the Nereid monument of Xanthus, are instances of temple architecture modified for the purposes of a tomb.

Fifth, Period.

The conquests of Alexander had opened to the Greek gaze the East, gorgeous in its personal attire and equipments, and unlimited in its resources for the encouragement of personal vanity. Alexander appeared in Asiatic costume, and what became the monarch was shortly found becoming to the subject. Under his successors, in what is called the Macedonian, or, better, the Hellenistic period, the opulence and taste for luxury of the times led artists to aim at producing works conspicuous for picturesqueness; not, however, that picturesqueness which is born of a fine fancy, but that which originates in a studied effort to throw a gleam of romance over a plain historical incident. The creation of ideal types of deities ceased, and the production of allegorical figures, which had found acceptance in the preceding age, took its place. These figures were simply studies of character, and implied a faculty of observation which the existing portraits of this period on coins and in marble warrant us in estimating highly. To this, no doubt, was added a power of generalisation which enabled the artist to deduce a type from a number of individuals, as, for example, in the type of Gauls introduced by the school of Pergamus. In figures of deities or heroes the old types were retained. It was in portraiture that the essential characteristic of the time consisted. With art in this condition Graecia Capta enthralled her Roman captors, and the further development of this phase of art was transferred to Rome. For this reason we shall here follow the unusual plan of classing the Hellenistic and Roman art under one period.

The two principal schools of sculpture of the last period tU [9:2:365] are represented in this by the sons of the two great masters of each,—the Athenian school by the sons of Praxiteles,

Cephisodotus and Timarchus, who worked together. The former appears to have been the more gifted of the two, if we may judge from the pains bestowed on certain statues of deities by him alone. Of their contemporaries little is known beyond that their chief occupation was in portrait sculpture. The traditions of the Sicyonian school were left in the hands of the sons and pupils of Lysippus, of whom the ablest was Euthycrates, who preserved the severity of the older schools in opposition to the tastes of his times. The effect of this upon his pupil Tisicrates led to so close a reproduction of the manner of Lysippus, that in many cases it was difficult to distinguish his work from that of the old master. In the same spirit, and with greater success, worked Eutychides of Sicyon, and Chares of Lindus in Rhodes. From the hands of Eutychides we know of a bronze statue of the river Eurotas, in which the mobility of water was finely suggested in the human form (Pliny, A r . H., xxxiv. 8, 78), and a highly-praised statue of Tyche (Pausanias, vi. 2, 7) for the town of Antioch, of which several copies exist, including a small one in silver in the British Museum. Chares Î3 known mainly as the author of the bronze Colossus of Helius at Rhodes, a statue 105 feet high, which after standing a marvel to all for fifty-six or sixty-six years, was broken across the knees and thrown to the ground by an earthquake. The rising importance of Rhodes encouraged the foundation of a school of sculpture which adopted the manner of Chares, and aimed at effect by colossal proportions and picturesque situations. To this school belonged Apollonius and Tau-riscus, the authors of a colossal marble group which has been identified with that in the museum of Naples, known as the “Farnese Bull,” and representing Amphion and Zethus in the act of binding Dirce to the horns of a bull in presence of their mother Antiope, and, whether copy or original, an admirable illustration of the Rhodian school. The moment seized by the artists is one of profound pathos; but, justly deserved as the punishment of Dirce may have been, it is impossible to look upon it without pain. The same feeling, it may be imagined, was awakened in the spectator by the bronze group of Athamas seized with insanity after slaying his son Learchus, by Aristonidas, another artist of the Rhodian school. From the instances of subjects in which cruelty and deep emotion'were combined, it has been argued that the group of Laocoön, which was the work of three Rhodian artists—Agesander, Athenodorus, and Polydorus—may properly be assigned to the Rhodian school of this period. On the other hand, it is argued by critics of seemingly equal competence, that the subject of the Laocoön is too harrowing for the Greek taste even then, and must have been executed under the influence of the favourite cruelties practised in the Roman circus. The decision between these two opinions is left entirely to taste, owing to the ambiguity of the words of Pliny. From Rhodes we pass to Pergamus, where, under the courtly influence of Attalus I. (241-197 B.c.) and Eumenes II. (197-159 b.c.), was formed a school of sculp ture which derived a vigorous impulse as of a new life from the strange class of subjects it was called upon to undertake. It was called upon to glorify the decisive victory of Attalus over the Gauls (239 B.c.) by groups and large compositions of battle scenes, in which the first difficulty was to produce the type of these barbarians, and to carry it out consistently in the various attitudes and incidents of a battle; as, for example, in their dogged submission under captivity, or their grim expression under pain; or, again, the abject misery of their wives when a battle had been lost. Nor was Attalus content to adorn his own capital with artistic productions. To Athens he made a present of four groups representing battles between gods and giants, between Athenians and Amazons, between the Greeks and Persians at Marathon, and between his own army and the Gauls in Mysia, showing in each case the defeat of a barbarous race. The height of the figures was 31 feet, and that there must have been a considerable number of them is clear from this, that the occurrence of Bacchus in the group of the Gigantomachia presupposes the existence of the other superior deities. Of the entire series nine figures have been identified in various museums (Engraved, Monumenti dell' Inet. Arch., ix. pls. 19-21; Brunn, Annali dell' Inst. Arch. 1870, pp. 292-323; and Bullettino, 1871, pp. 28-31; Clarae, pl. 280, No. 2151); while to the same school belong the dying Gaul in the Capitoline Museum, known as the “Dying Gladiator,” and the group of a Gaul and his wife in the Villa Ludovisi (Müller, Denkmäler, i. pl. 48, No. 218).

After the loss of national independence little remained for the Greeks to do but to profit by the liberal patronage of their Roman masters, whose cupidity in matters of art was by no means satisfied with carrying off as many as possible of the existing sculptures. The increased demand led to a new energy, of which Athens was at first naturally the centre, whence the term “-New Attic” is applied to the sculpture of this period. As, however, this new energy was chiefly directed to the reproduction of the favourite types of the old masters, the result was not, as under other circumstances it might have been, the formation of a new school properly so called. At this time the principal sculptors were Polycles of Athens, his son Timarchides, his grandson Dionysius, and another Dionysius, all of whom, after earning a reputation by their work in various parts of Greece, appear to have followed Metellus to Rome, which now became the artistic centre of the world. Towards the end of the republic there lived in Rome a sculptor, Pasiteles, who, if not superior to the artists of the new Attic'period in point of creative power, was certainly more gifted than they with skill and carefulness in the execution of his work, which ranged over statuaria, sculptura, and [9:2:366] caelatura, including chryselephantine figures, for which a taste had revived. As, however, none of his works exist now, we can only judge of his manner by that of his pupil Stephanus, from whose hands we have the statue of Orestes in the Villa Albani (Annali dell’ Inst. 1865, pl. D; Friederichs, Bausteine, i. p. 112). It is called Orestes from its resemblance to the male figure in the group of Orestes and Electra in Naples, with which, as an imitation of the archaic style, it may be compared. In both, however, it has been observed that the archaism is limited to the proportions, attitude, and general aspect, but that the details of anatomy have been worked in from the living model. This, which constituted the peculiarity of Stephanus, is assumed to have characterised the school of Pasiteles, first, because Stephanus, in an unusual manner, describes himself on the base of the statue as a pupil of Pasiteles; and secondly, because the same peculiarity to some extent is found in the group of Orestes and Electra in the Villa Ludovisi by the sculptor Menelaus, who again describes himself as a pupil of Stephanus (Friederichs, Bausteine, i. p. 427). Doubtless this affectation of archaism was to meet the taste of the time, for which also archaic works were collected from Greece. By the extreme elaboration of his work, Arcesilaus, who lived in Rome in Caesar’s time, obtained considerable fame, but', on the other hand, limited greatly his productivity. Of his two principal statues, the Venus Genetrix and the Felicitas, the latter was never finished. Copies of both exist, but they are of too mean a kind to suggest a proper estimate of the sculptor’s merit. While in ideal sculpture the artists of this time were content to copy, with trifling varieties of detail, the works of the old masters, they appear to have disclosed considerable original talent in realistic sculpture, that is, in portraiture and in the historical representations with which triumphal arches and other like buildings were decorated, though here again they had models ready to hand in portraits, battle scenes, and triumphs of the Hellenistic period. A sculptor who had to celebrate a Roman victory over barbarians had his model in works of the same class by the school of Pergamus. When he introduced an ideal figure, as that of Victory writing on a shield, he adopted an old type. In the grouping of his figures there is this peculiarity, that they are frequently arranged on the principles of painting rather than of sculpture, and it is supposed that this originated in the earlier Roman custom of celebrating victories by paintings hung up in public places, which paintings appear to have been based on those of the Alexandrian period, and, at any rate, were sometimes executed by Greek artists. (For a thorough investigation of this subject see Helbig, Campanische Wandmalerei, Leipzig, 1873.)

When public encouragement of art takes the form of a desire for reproduction from ancient masterpieces, it is natural that such minor arts as those of caelatura and gemengraving should flourish. The production of silver vases adorned with subjects in relief had become a profitable occupation in the wealthy times of Hellenism. It was not, however, till the latter half of this period that truly fabulous sums came to be paid for work of this kind, in which Pasiteles and Arcesilaus, already mentioned as sculptors, achieved great success. Besides them we hear of Posidonius of Ephesus, Zopyrus, Pytheas, and Teucrus. Among the many existing examples of silver work of this period, one—a vase found in 1761 at the Porto d’Anzo, and belonging to the Corsini family—has been identified as a copy of the silver vase by Zopyrus representing the acquittal of Orestes before the Areopagus. The immense number of existing statuettes, vases, utensils of various kinds r in bronze and silver, dating from this period, are evidence of its artistic activity, and at the same time of the closeness with which Greek models wero adhered to.

Under the influence of the luxurious tastes in the times of the Ptolemies, gem-engravers aimed mostly at effect, and to this end sought out specimens of onyx and sardonyx which from their own splendour would lend a charm to the work. A gem was now a thing to be worn flauntingly.. Hence the chief examples of the art are the cameos, of which from the latter half of this period we have still some magnificent examples. Of these, the most important, artistically, is the large cameo, now in Vienna, representing, in a partly allegorical and partly literal fashion, the suppression of the Pannonian revolt by Tiberius and Germanicus (Müller, Denkmäler, i. pl. 69, No. 377). Larger and richer in figures, but much inferior in work, is the cameo in ∙the cabinet of medals in Paris (Müller, ibid. No. 378). Besides producing cameos for personal ornament, the gem-engravers of this period were also employed on the production of drinking-cups of onyx and other precious stones, of which the tazza Farnese in Naples is the best existing example (Mus. Borb., xii. pl. 47). When stones were too costly, glass was used, as in the famous Portland vase in the British Museum, and in numerous cameos. Compared with the cameo-engravers, who, as if conscious of the inferiority of their work, withheld their names from it, the engravers of intaglios very frequently asserted their merit by adding their names. Among the names thus handed down are those of Dioscu-rides, his son Eutyches, Athenion, Protarchus, Solon, Euodus, and others of lesser note.

In the history of painting during this period few names of importance occur. In the earlier part of it the traditions of the school of Sicyon were maintained by Nealces, from whose hands we know of a picture of Venus, and of a naval engagement between Persians and Egyptians on a river which was localised as the Nile, by the presence of a crocodile and an ass drinking at the edge; and Timanthus, who painted a battle between the troops of Aratus and the Aetolians. In the Athenian school, Athenion, though dying young, produced some works which were favourably compared with those of the older master, Nicias. About this time the production of painted vases, driven out of fashion by vases in silver and other metals, so far ceased to attract skilled workmen, that it can hardly be fair to regard the large number of so-called Apulian vases belonging to this period as evidence of the contemporary style of painting. The ornament and the colours are always florid, the figures are drawn mechanically as from a set design, and thu dimensions are very frequently large. According to the theory advanced by Brunn (Probleme in der Gesch. der Vasenmalerei), almost the whole of the vases found in Italy with black figures on red ground, which previously were considered archaic, were produced about this time, and are but feeble imitations of the early style made to please the Roman taste for archaic work. As to the general feebleness that prevails among them there can be little question. It remains to be seen, however, whether Brunn has' not placed them at too late a period.

With the scanty records of painters, and the depreciatory remarks in regard to the art of their time made by Pliny and Petronius, we have to compare the immense series of paintings from this period still existing in Italy, and particularly those of Pompeii and Herculaneum, an examination of which will show that the painters then, like the contemporary sculptors, drew their inspiration, and apparently to a tolerably close extent their models, from more ancient works. Had they been gifted with original genius, they could not have excluded, when painting landscapes, the views of the immediate neighbourhood; and yet on all the walls of Pompeii or Herculaneum there is perhaps not [9:2:367] more than one subject which can be positively identified as local. Nor would they have avoided so systematically as they have done subjects from the national Roman legends, which were then in high favour, and attracted poets like Virgil and Ovid. But while a complete dearth of imaginative power may be denied them, these painters w ere possessed of a fine eye for pictorial effect, and of a refined taste in the management of their colours (Helbig, Wandgemälde Campaniens, to which is prefixed an elaborate inquiry into the technical processes employed; and Helbig, Campanische Wandmalerei, 1873, where the sources from which these painters drew are fully pointed out).

Closely allied to painting is the art of mosaic-working, which, though occasionally employed for the pavements of the earlier temples, as in the pronaos of the temple at Olympia {Expédition de la Morée, i. pl. 63), did not till after the time of Alexander assume an importance which entitled it to be ranked as an independent art. The first mosaic artist of consequence whom we hear of is Sosus of Pergamus, celebrated as having introduced the practice of decorating floors of houses with imitations of characteristic objects, such, for example, as the accompaniments of a feast in a dining-room. From Pergamus, Ephesus, Alexandria, and the chief towns of the Macedonian period, the art was afterwards transferred to Rome, where the numerous villas and palaces furnished it with abundant occupation. As an example of the work of this later time we have the large mosaic found on the Aventine in 1833, and now in the Lateran, which bears the name of Heraclitus as its author, and which, with its representations of all manner of remains from a feast, is an illustration of the class of subjects introduced by Sosus. We still possess a splendid example of their rendering of historical subjects in the mosaic found in 1831 in the Casa del Fauno at Pompeii, representing a battle between Alexander and the Persians (Müller, Denkmäler, i. pl. 55, No. 273).

What was said of the progress of architecture at the close of last period should be here borne in mind, as it continues to apply to the first half of the period now before us. While the building of Alexandria supplied a model and an impulse, which the successors of Alexander availed themselves of, in the construction of new towns, the example of boundless luxury, in the decoration of even temporary monuments, which was set by Alexander in the erection of a funeral pyre for Hephaestion in Babylon, was also eagerly followed by his successors. From the work of Callixenus on Alexandria we have (Athenaeus, v. p. 196) a description of the tent erected by Ptolemy Philadelphus for a Dionysiae festival, and of the splendid colossal barge of Ptolemy Philopator on the Nile (ibid. p. 204, d). Still more magnificent and stupendous in its dimensions was the ship of Hiero of Syracuse, with its granaries, dwelling-houses, towers, gymnasium, and park, for the construction of which Archimedes and the Corinthian Archias were employed. Greece proper, however, shared little in this prodigality. Thebes was, indeed, restored after its destruction by Alexander; and Athens, still the eye of Greece, obtained many marks of favour from the princes of the time, w ho sought to identify their names with her glory by erecting public monuments of various kinds.

The presence of countless specimens of Greek art in Rome, carried off by plunderers like L. Mummius, produced a general craving for Greek architecture also. The first step in this direction was taken by Q. Caecilius Metellus, who brought a Greek architect, Hermodorus of Salamis, to Rome to build a temple to Jupiter Stator in the pure Greek style. The public favour w ith which this was riewed may be gathered from the fact, that shortly after we find D. Junius Brutus employing Hermodorus to build a temple to Mars. Of the Roman architects who during the republic adopted the Greek style, the most distinguished were Cossutius and C. Mutius. The Greek had either supplemented or become blended with the native Roman architecture when the extraordinary activity in building, of w hich Pompey and Caesar were the leaders, set in, not only in Rome, but throughout the provinces of the empire. The building of temples and monuments, which under Augustus had been the chief occupation of architects, gave way under his immediate successors to constructions of a more useful and sometimes of a colossal type, such as bridges, canals, aqueducts, and harbours. The enlargement of the imperial palaces on the Palatine, particularly the construction of the golden house of Nero, gave scope to the boldness of design and extravagance of execution possessed by the architects Celer and Severus. In the following times those of Vespasian, Titus, and Domitian were characterised by a series of buildings which had not their equal in the architectural history of Rome, as, for example, the Colisseum, a building erected to contain 87,000 spectators, and still in its ruins the most striking monument of imperial Rome. While the chief interest of Trajan was in the construction of roads, bridges, and harbours, his successor, Hadrian, was not only himself ambitious as an architect, but gave a new impetus to the erection of splendid buildings throughout the empire. From this time onward Roman architecture began to sink rapidly, its original tendency to florid decoration obtaining more and more free rein, till finally discrimination was abandoned. The ruins of Palmyra and Baalbec (R. Wood, London, 1827), the arch of Severus, the baths of Caracalla and Diocletian, and the arch of Constantine, are evidence of this.
