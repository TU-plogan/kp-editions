ARISTAeUS (from αpιστoς, best), a divinity whose worship was widely spread throughout Greece, but concerning whose origin and career the myths are somewhat obscure. The account most generally received connects him specially with Thessaly. Apollo carried off from Mount Pelion the nymph Cyrene, daughter or granddaughter of Peneus (Peneius), and conveyed her to Libya, where she gave birth to Aristaeus. From this circumstance the town of Cyrene took its name. The child was at first handed over to the care of the Hours, or, according to another version, to the nymph Melissa and the centaur Chiron. He afterwards left Libya and came to Thebes, where he received instruction from the Muses in the arts of healing and prophecy, and married Autonoe, daughter of Cadmus, by whom he had several children, among others, the unfortunate Actaeon. He is said to have visited Ceos, where, by erecting a temple to Zeus Icmaeus (the giver of moisture), he freed the inhabitants from a terrible drought. The islanders worshipped him, and occasionally identified him with Zeus, calling him Zeus Aristaeus. After travelling through many of the Aegean islands, through Sicily, Sardinia, and Magna Graecia, everywhere conferring benefits and receiving divine honours, Aristaeus came to Thrace, where he was initiated into the mysteries of Dionysos, and finally disappeared near Mt. Haemus. While in Thrace he is said to have caused the death of Eurydice, who was bitten by a snake while fleeing from him. Aristaeus was essentially a benevolent deity; he was worshipped as the first who introduced the cultivation of bees, and of the vine and olive; he was the protector of herdsmen and hunters (and was therefore called vo/xtos and dγpeυs); he warded off the evil effects of the dog-star; he possessed the arts of healing and prophecy. In ancient sculptures and coins he is represented as a young man, habited like a shepherd, and sometimes carrying a sheep on his shoulders. Occasionally he is accompanied by a bee or a dove.
