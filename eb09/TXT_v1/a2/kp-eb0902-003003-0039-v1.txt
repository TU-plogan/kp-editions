ANGLESEA, Arthur Annesley, Earl of, lord privy seal in the reign of King Charles II., the son of Sir Francis Annesley, Lord Mount√Norris, and Viscount Valentia, in Ireland, was born at Dublin 10th July 1614. He was for some time at the university of Oxford, and afterwards studied law at Lincoln’s Inn. In the beginning of the civil war he sat in the parliament held at Oxford; but afterwards became reconciled to the opposite party, and was sent commissioner to Ulster in 1645, to oppose the designs of the rebel Owen Roe O’Neal. He was president of the council of state after the death of Cromwell, and was principally concerned in bringing about the Restoration. He succeeded to his father’s titles in 1660, and in 1661 was enrolled in the English peerage as Lord Annesley of Newport-Pagnell, Bucks, and Earl of Anglesea. During Charles’s reign he was employed in various important affairs, was made treasurer of the navy, and for some time held the office of lord privy seal. Annesley was a person of great abilities and of very extensive learning, and was well acquainted with the constitution and laws of England. In his lifetime he published, several works, chiefly of a polemical and political character. He died in April 1686.
