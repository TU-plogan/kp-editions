ARCADIA, an inland and mountainous country of ancient Greece, bounded on the N. by Achaia, on the W. by Elis, on the S. by Messenia and Laconia, and on the E. by Argolis, and almost shut in from the neighbouring states by a natural rampart. Its most important heights were Cyllene, the birth-place of Hermes, in the north-east, Erymanthus in the north-west, Artemisium and Parthenium in the east, and Maenalus and Lycaeus in the south. It was watered by the Alpheus, the largest river of the Peloponnesus, the Helisson, the Ladon, the Erymanthus, and a number of smaller streams which cut their way, in many cases by underground passages, through the limestone rocks. In the east there were several lakes, as those of Orchomenos and Stymphalus; and in the north-east, near Nonacris, was the great waterfall of the Styx, which produced such a deep impression on the ancient Greek mind. Arcadia seems to have been inhabited from the earliest times of Grecian history by the same race of people, which down to the days of Roman dominion continued to be distinguished from the neighbouring states by greater simplicity and inertness of life. Deprived by their position of the quickening influence of commerce, broken up into small and almost independent communities by the physical character of their country, and thus having hardly any proper national existence, the Arcadians acquired a certain awkwardness in dealing with their more vivacious neighbours, who laughed at Arcadian stupidity, while they were pleased with Arcadian hospitality, and almost envied Arcadian repose. Like other mountaindwellers they were determined defenders of their liberty, and their history is chiefly taken up with united or sporadic conflict against Spartan invasion. About the time of the foundation of Megalopolis (370 B.c.) a certain unity and consequent power were attained, but it was not long ere matters fell back to their former condition. Ultimately the whole country joined the Achaean League, and was afterwards incorporated with the Roman province of Achaia. The most important towns in Arcadia were Tegea, Stymphalus, Cleitor, Pallantium, Pheneus, Caryae, Nonacris, Methydrium, Heraea, Mantinea, Lycosura, according to Pausanias, the most ancient town in Greece, and Megalopolis, one of the most recent. The Greek and Roman poets celebrated the simplicity of Arcadian life and character, not without a certain touch of satire; but by moderns, such as Sannazar and Sydney, the country and its inhabitants have been idealised and elevated into a type of pure pastoral happiness.
