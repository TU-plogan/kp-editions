ASHTON-UNDER-LYNE, or Ashton, a parliamentary borough in the county of Lancaster, and hundred of Salford, on the northern bank of the river Tame, 6∣ miles east of Manchester, and 197 from London. Like Manchester, it has had a rapid growth from an insignificant country town to a populous and thriving borough. Notwithstanding this it is well built, and contains many spacious streets and handsome public edifices. Among the latter are 4 large churches, 15 dissenting chapels, a spacious town-hall, and a very large and prosperous market-house. There are three banks, a savings-bank, a theatre, a mechanics’ institute, and numerous week-day and Sunday schools. The corporation have built, at a cost of £16,000, a magnificent set of public baths. There are three newspapers published in the town. At a short distance to the north of the town are the infantry and cavalry barracks, erected in 1843 at a cost of £42,500, and the union workhouse, erected in 1851 at an expenditure of £12,000. A magnificent infirmary, built and endowed by public subscriptions, fronts the workhouse. A large public park is provided for the people midway between this and neighbouring borough of Stalybridge. A union hospital for infectious and other diseases has just been completed. The modern growth of Ashton dates from the introduction of the cotton trade in 1769. It enjoys many facilities for manufacturing industry, coal being very plentiful in the neighbourhood, four important railway lines passing through it, and canals connecting it with Manchester, Huddersfield, and Derbyshire. The town, though essentially modern, has an origin of great antiquity, and still exercises many of its ancient feudal customs and manorial privileges. It is divided into four wards, governed by a mayor, eight aidermen, and twenty-four councillors; and since the Reform Act of 1832 it has returned one member to the House of Commons. In 1821 it had a population of only 9222, which in 1851 had increased to 29,798, chiefly engaged in spinning cotton yarn and weaving ginghams and calicoes by machinery in the numerous large factories. Population of parliamentary borough in 1871, 37,389; of municipal borough, 31,984.
