ARCHANGEL, a government of European Russia, lying between lat. 61° and 71° N., and long. 29° and 68° E. It is bounded on the N. by the White Sea and Arctic Ocean, on the W. by Finland and Olonetz, on the S. by Vologda, and on the E. by the Ural Mountains. It comprehends the islands of Nova-Zembla, Waigatz, and some others. Its area is estimated at 286,739 square miles, and its population in 1867 was 275,779. The climate is for the greater part of the year intensely cold. That part of Archangel which lies within the arctic circle has a very desolate and sterile aspect, presenting little to the eye but extensive plains of sand and moss. The winter is long and severe, and even in summer the soil is frozen at a little depth below the surface. The rivers are closed in September, and scarcely thawed before July. South of the arctic circle the greater part of the country is covered with immense forests, with extensive lakes and morasses, while other parts afford excellent pasturage. The spring is moist, with cold, frosty nights; the summer, a succession of long foggy days; the autumn moist; and the rivers are closed from October to April. The northern districts are incapable of being cultivated, and the inhabitants support themselves by fishing and the chase. In the southern districts considerable quantities of hemp and flax are raised, but grain crops are little attended to, and the bark of trees is ground with com to eke out the scanty products of the harvest.· Potatoes are grown as far north as 65°. The principal wealth of the government consists in its immense forests, furnishing materials for shipbuilding, which is carried on to a considerable extent. The horses and cattle are diminutive, except in the district of Kholmogory, where excellent cattle are reared. The calves are sent to the St Petersburg market, where the veal is especially prized. Gold is found in the circle of Cola, naphtha and salt in those of Kem and Pinega, and coal, or rather lignite, in several places in Mezen. The preparation of pitch and tar is an active branch of industry; and in the districts around Archangel coarse linens are manufactured to a considerable extent, as well as cordage, mats, leather, tallow, turpentine, and potash. This government is divided into eight circles, viz.—Archangel, Shenkursk, Mezen, Cola, Onega, Pinega, Kholmogory, and Kem. Its chief rivers are the Onega, Pinega, Dwina, Mezen, Petshora, and Ousa. Sulphurous springs are found in the circles of Kholmogory and Shenkursk. The population was originally Finnish, but it is now chiefly Russian, with some Samoides and Laplanders.

Archangel, the chief town of the Russian government of the same name, is situated at the head of the delta of the Dwina, on the right bank of the river, in lat. 64 β 32' 8" N., and long. 40° 33' E. As early as the 10th century the Norsemen had commercial settlements in the district; but the modern town may be said to date from the visit paid by the English voyager, Chancelor, to the monastery of St Nicholas, whither he was driven by stress of weather in 1553. An English factory was soon after erected there by consent of Ivan II., and in 1584 a fort was built, and a town gradually gathered round it, which received the name of Arlehangelsleoi^Gorod, from a monastery dedicated to the archangel Michael. The town long remained the only seaport of Russia, and enjoyed remarkable prosperity. Czar Boris Godunoff (1598-1605) made the trade through Archangel to Moscow open to all nations, and Holland and Germany took advantage of the permission. In 1655 the exports amounted to 600,000 roubles. In 1668 the great bazaar, or “Gostinnoi-Gorod,' , â strong building of stone, was commenced at the command of Alexei Michaelovich, and employed the labour of thousands of Tatar prisoners for 16 years. In 1693-94 Peter the Great visited the town, which was then at the height of its prosperity; the average annual value of the exports from 1691-1700 to England alone amounting to £112,210. When, in the beginning of the 18th century the czar was establishing St Petersburg, he did all he could to divert the population and prosperity of Archangel to the new metropolis, causing many of the wealthier inhabitants to remove, and imposing heavy taxes on the commerce. As a natural consequence, the northern city declined. In 1762 it received the same immunities as St Petersburg, and since that time has gradually recovered its former prosperity. It is the seat of an archbishop and of a civil and a military governor, and has one Protestant and ten Greek churches, an ecclesiastical seminary, a gymnasium, academies for navigation and engineering, a naval hospital, and a Government bank. The manufactures are linen, leather, canvas, cordage, [9:2:369] mats, sugar, and beer. The exports are flax, flax-tow and codilia, oats, linseed, wheat, deals, tar, pitch, rosin, mats, beef and pork, calf and seal skins, train-oil, cordage, feathers, and linseed cakes. Flax, in large quantity, is used in the spinning factories in the interior. The imports are coal, oil, wine, coffee, sugar, tea, logwood, furs, lead, salt, and fish. The total value of the exports in 1874 amounted to £1,234,390 in 472 ships, of which 62 were steamers and 220 coasting vessels, a large proportion being carried to Great Britain. The coasting trade between Archangel and Norwegian Finmark is extensive. The domestic trade consists chiefly in meat, fish, train-oil, game, and furs. By river and canal Archangel is in connection with a large part of European Russia, and a telegraph line unites it with St Petersburg. The harbour is at the island of Solombaly, about a mile below the town, and is open only from June to October. A bar at the month of the Dwina, with only 13 or 14 feet of water, obliges vessels of greater draught to load and unload outside by means of lighters. About 12 miles below the town there is a Government dockyard, with slips for building vessels, and also some warehouses belonging to merchants in the city. The best season of the year in Archangel is from the middle of June to the middle of August. After that period the nights become cold; and in September it is often stormy. The shortest day has only 3 hours 12 minutes, the longest 21 hours 48 minutes. Population in 1867, 19,936.
