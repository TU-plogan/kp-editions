APULIA, the name applied to a district of southern Italy, the limits of which were not very definitely or permanently marked. It is usually regarded as having been bounded by the country of the Frentani on the N., Samnium on the W., Calabria and LucaDia on the S., and the Adriatic on the E. The northern portion comprised the district sloping eastward from the Apennines, but did not take in any part of the mountains themselves; while the southern portion was occupied by a rocky off-shoot of the main chain, which left only a narrow but fertile strip of land along the sea. On the northern part of the coast was the remarkable mountain-mass of Garganus, forming an enormous promontory. Apulia was watered by the Tifernus fBifemd), the Frento (Fbrtore), the Cerbalus (Cervaro), the Aufidus (f)fantd), and a number of intermittent mountain streams. The soil for the most part was calcareous and arid, but in winter afforded abundant pasturage for the sheep, that in ancient times as now were driven during the summer to the neighbouring highlands of Samnium. Of the mingled population of Apulia, the Apulians proper (of Oscan race, it is supposed), the Daunians (perhaps of Pelasgian origin), and the Peucetians or Poediculi (likewise Pelasgian), seem to have been the principal elements. The prevalent language, according to Mommsen’s investigations, was distinct from the Oscan and related to the Greek. Direct Greek influence—probably emanating from Tarentum—is evident in the workmanship and inscriptions of the coins and vases and other remains which have been discovered throughout the region. The more important towns were Larinum (1), Teanum, Luceria, Arpi, Salapia, Sipontum, Canusium, Barium, Egnatia, and Venusia. Reduced under Roman dominion in the 4th century b,c., Apulia for the most part continued true to the Roman cause till the time of the second Punic war, when it was greatly distracted and suffered grievously from the hostile operations of both the belligerents. It belonged to the second region of Augustus, and from the reign of Constantine was governed along with Calabria by a “Corrector.” For several centuries after 476 it was alternately under the power of the Lombards, the Goths, the Saracens, and the emperors of the East; and about the 10th century was regularly governed by the last by means of a “catapan” or deputy, who has left the designation of his office, Cata-panata, in the modern corruption Capitanata, applied to the northern portion of the present Apulia. It was conquered by the Normans under William Bras-de-Fer, who took the title of Comes Apuliae in 1042, was raised along with Calabria to a dukedom by Robert Guiscard in 1057, and in 1127 was united to the Sicilian monarchy. The namo [9:2:217] Apulia ia still employed as a geographical, but no longer as an ethnological or political designation.
