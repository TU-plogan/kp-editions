ANTINOMIANS (αντί, against, and νό/ios, law), a term first employed by Luther as a designation of the followers of John Agricola, who maintained that the moral law was not binding, as such, upon Christians (see Agricola, J ohannes). In this, as in many other cases, however, the thing existed long before the name. From the 1st century of the Christian era downwards, there have been those who, on one ground or other, denied that the law was of use or obligation under the gospel dispensation, and the term Antinomian is, accordingly, applied with sufficient propriety to many who lived at an earlier date than the sect or school to describe whom Luther invented it. It would seem, from several passages in the New Testament (Rom. iii. 8, 31, vi. 1; Eph. V. 6; 2 Pet. ii. 18, 19), in which the apostles warn their followers against perversions of their doctrine as an excuse for licentiousness, that Antinomianism, in its grosser form, found a place even in the primitive church. It is to be noticed that this first manifestation of the heresy seems to have been due to the same cause as that which operated in the case of Agricola,—a mistaken interpretation of the doctrine of justification by faith. The Gnostic sects, several of whom are classed as Antinomian, seem to have [9:2:130] proceeded on the principle, that being spiritual their nature could not be corrupted whatever their moral conduct might be. Gnostic Antinomianism seems; therefore, to have been in this'respect analogous to that of the High Calvinists, some of whom went so far as to maintain that an elect person did not sin -even when he committed actions in themselves wicked. Such were the Antinomians in England during the Protectorate. A doctrine so extreme, and sanctioning so unmistakably an immoral life, is to be carefully distinguished from the Antinomianism combated by Luther, which was a matter of theory not necessarily affecting conduct. It is not easy to apprehend or to state with clearness the precise views of Agricola as to the relation between the Christian and the moral law. His own statements were more than once modified or retracted in the course of discussion, and there can be no doubt that Luther made him responsible for opinions which he did not hold. The exaggeration characteristic of all controversies seems to have prevailed ’in this case to an unusual extent on both sides, and neither disputant should always be taken literally at his word, whether he speaks for himself or for his opponent. It was probably a desire to establish Luther’s negation of the Roman Catholic doctrine of good works on some firm ground of principle, that first led Agricola to insist as he did on the essential incompatibihty between the law and the gospel. The law of Moses, he taught, was for the Jews alone, and was not a rule of life to Christians, who might with safety altogether neglect it. On the other hand, he never denied that the Christian was under a moral government, with an adequate sanction, which laid him under obligation to lead a holy life. What he maintained was that the New Testament furnished all that was.necessary for impulse and guidance in the path of Christian duty, hot in the form of positive precepts so much as of principles and motives. Thus explained, the difference between the orthodox and Agricola’s· party reduces itself within a comparatively narrow compass, though, after the fullest explanation, it remains a real difference and a standing subject of controversy.
