ARIÉGE, a department of France, bounded on the S. by Spain, W. by Haute-Garonne, N.E. by Aude, and S.E. by Pyrénées Orientales. It embraces the old countship of Foix, and a portion of Languedoc and Gascony, and has an area of 1889 square miles. The southern part is occupied by the Pyrenees, which here contain some of the highest peaks in France; as, Pic d’Estats (which is 10,811 feet above the level of the sea), Montcalm (10,512), Font-argente, and Montleon. Communication with Spain is afforded by a large number of ports or cols, which are, however, for the most part difficult paths, and only practicable for a few months in the year. The northern portion consists of a kind of plateau, broken by beautiful and fertile valleys. Ariége belongs to the Garonne basin, and is watered by the Salat, the Arize, and the Ariége, with their tributaries. The climate is mild in the south, but naturally very severe among the mountains. The country affords excellent pasture, and a considerable number of cattle, sheep, and swine are reared; but there is little arable land, and what exists is broken up into small crofts. There is abundance of minerals—lead, copper, manganese, and especially iron, being largely obtained. Alum is found at Mas-d’Azil, alabaster among the mountains, buildingstone at Pamiers, marble at Belesta, &c. Warm mineral springs are common. The preparation of woollen cloths, the forging of iron, and manufacture of steel are the principal industries; while soap, paper, and wooden wares are likewise produced. Among the celebrated men of the department are Gaston de Foix, Pope Benedict XII., and Pierre Bayle. The chief town is Foix; the arrondissements, Foix, St Girons, and Pamiers. Population, 244,798.
