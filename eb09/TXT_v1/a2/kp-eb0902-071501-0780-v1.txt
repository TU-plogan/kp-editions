ASPEN TREE, called also the trembling-leaved poplar (Populus tremula), is a native of Britain, and is found generally in moist places, sometimes at a considerable elevation, 1600 feet or more, in Scotland. It flowers in Britain in March and April. The name “trembling” is applied to it on account of the constant movement of the leaves even with a gentle breeze. This mobility depends on the leaves being suspended by leaf-stalks flattened laterally, and when subjected to a slight wind, by their friction on each other they give rise to a rustling sound. It is supposed that the mulberry trees (Becaim) mentioned in 1st Chronicles xiv. 14, 15, were really aspen trees. The wood of the tree is white, and is made use of by turners. In France sabots are made of it; and the charcoal made from the wood is used in the manufacture of gunpowder. The leaves are in some countries of Europe employed as food for cattle, sheep, and goats.
