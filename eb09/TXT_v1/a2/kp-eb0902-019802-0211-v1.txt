APOSTOLIUS, Michael, a Greek theologian and rhetorician of the 15th century. When, in 1453, the Turks made themselves masters of his native city, Constantinople, he fled to Italy, and there obtained the protection of Cardinal Bessarion. But engaging in the great dispute that then raged between the upholders of Aristotle and Plato, his zeal for the latter led him to speak so disrespectfully and contemptuously of the more popular philosopher and his defender, Theodorus of Gaza, that he fell under the severe reprehension of his patron, who was too thoroughly a follower of Plato to wish his cause to be maintained by weapons so unworthy. He afterwards retired to Crete, where, with a “proud humility,” he earned a scanty living by the teaching of children and the copying of manuscripts. Many of the productions of his pen are still to be found in the libraries of Europe. One of them, a copy of the leones of Philostratus at Bologna, bears the inscription: “The king of the poor of this world has written this book for his living.” Of his numerous works a few have been printed :—∏αpoι∕uαι, Basle, 1538, now exceedingly rare; a collection of proverbs in Greek, of which a fuller edition appeared at Leyden, “Curante Heinsio,” in 1619; Oratio Panegyrica ad Fredericum III. in Freher’s Scriptores Rerum Germanicarum, vol. ii,, Frankfort, 1624; Georgii Gemisthi Plethonis et Mich. Apostolii Orationes funebres duae in quibus de Immortalitate Animae exponitur, Leipsic, 1793; and a work against the Latin Church and the Council of Florence in Le Moine’s Varia Sacra. Apostolius died about 1480, leaving two sons, Aristobulus Apostolius and Arsenius. The latter became bishop of Malvasia (Momembasia) in the Morea.
