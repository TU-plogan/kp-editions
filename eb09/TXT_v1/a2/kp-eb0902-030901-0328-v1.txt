ARARAT. This name, originally designating a whole district of Asia (Gen. viii. 4), has long been appropriated by the uniform usage of Europeans to the lofty Armenian mountain which stands on the confines of the Russian, Turkish, and Persian dominions, in lat. 39° 42' N., long. 44° 35' E., known to the Armenians as Masis, to the Turks as Ak-Dagh, and to the Persians as Kuh-i-Nuh, or Noah’s Mountain. Whether the tradition, which makes it the resting-place of the ark, is of any historical value or not, there is at least poetical fitness in the hypothesis, inasmuch as this mountain is about equally distant from the Black Sea and the Caspian, from the Mediterranean and the Persian Gulf. Another tradition—accepted alike by Christians and Mahometans—fixed on Mount Judi, ιa the south of Armenia, as the ark’s resting-place. There so-called genuine relics of the ark were exhibited, and a monastery and mosque of commemoration were built; but the monastery was destroyed by lightning in 776 a.d., and the tradition has declined in credit. Mount Ararat is the culminating point of the Armenian plateau, which reaches at its base a height of 3000 feet. From this it rises in a graceful isolated cone (having at its side the more perfect but less lofty cone of Little Ararat) far into the region of perennial snow. It was long believed by the Armenian monks that no one was permitted to reach the “secret top” of Ararat with its sacred remains. The summit, however, has been frequently reached in the course of this century. Tournefort had failed in 1700; the Pasha of Bayazeed had been equally rmsuccessful; but on Sept. 27, 1829, Dr Parrot of Dorpat, a German in the employment of Russia, set foot on the “dome of eternal ice.” Ascents have since been made by Antonomoff (1834 and 1843); Wagner and Abich (1845); Chodzko, Chanykoff, Moritz, and a party of Cossacks in the service of the Russian Government (1850); Major Stuart (1856); and Colonel Monteith (1856). Mr Freshfield, who reached within about 800 feet of the summit in 1868, thus describes the mountain:—“It stands perfectly isolated from all the other ranges, with the still more perfect cone of Little Ararat (a typical volcano) at its side. Seen thus early in the season (May), with at least 9000 feet of snow on its slopes, from a distance and height well calculated to permit the eye to take in its true proportions, we agreed that no single mountain we know presented such a magnificent and impressive appearance as the Armenian Giant.” It has been ascertained that the higher peak, or Ak-Dagh, is 17,112 (1331 higher than Mount Blanc), and the lower, or Allah-Dagh, about 13,085 feet above the level of the sea. That the mountain was of volcanic origin was well known, but all eruptive activity was supposed to have long ceased. Reineggs was discredited, it may be justly, when he spoke of seeing it in eruption in 1785. But in 1840 there was a vast eruption of sulphurous vapours from its sides, and a tremendous earthquake shook the surrounding country. The village of Arguri and the monastery of St James were destroyed, and great damage was done to Nakhchevan, Sharur, and Ardubad. Major Voskoboinikoff ’ s Report {Athenaeum, 1841, p. 157) was, as V agner has pointed out, erroneous in some of its details, but in the main trustworthy. There are a number of glaciers in the upper portion, and the climate of the whole district is ∖ery severe. The greater part of the mountain is destitute of trees, but the lower Ararat is clothed with birches. The fauna and flora are both comparatively mea< τ re.
