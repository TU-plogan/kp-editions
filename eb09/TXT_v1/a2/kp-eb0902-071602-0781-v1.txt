ASS, The Domestic— Asinus vulgaris, Gray—differs chiefly from the horse in its smaller size, in the presence of long hair, forming a tuft, only at the extremity of the tail, and in the absence of warts on its hind legs. Its fur, usually of a gray colour, is characteristically marked with a longitudinal dorsal streak of a darker hue, with a similar streak across the shoulders, but white and black varieties also occur. The ass has been from time immemorial under the dominion of man, and it is doubtful w hether the original wild stock is anywhere to be found at the present day,— the specimens that have been described as wild being probably the descendants of individuals that have escaped from the domestic βtate. A wild variety of ass (Asinus toeniopus), found in Abyssinia, has the long acute ears and the bray peculiar to the domestic kinds. It is said also to have cross bands on its legs, a feature occasionally met with in our tame breeds; and this fact has led Darwin and others to conclude that in the wild ass of Abyssinia the original of the domestic animal is to be found; the stripes which occasionally appear on the legs of the latter being regarded as instances of reversion to the ancestral type (Proceedings of Zool. Society, 1862). The marked aversion of the domestic ass to cross the smallest streamlet, an aversion which it shares with the camel, and the evident delight with which it rolls itself in the dust, seem to point to arid deserts as its βriginal home. The ass has generally been the object of neglect and ill treatment; and attempts have seldom been made to improve the breed by selecting and matching the finer specimens. It has thus gradually sunk into the dull and obstinate creature -which we are accustomed to see. Its reputation for stupidity is not, however, of recent origin. The ancient Egyptians hated it, and symbolised an ignorant person by the head and ears, and the Romans thought it a bad omen to meet an ass (Fosbrooke’s Antiquities'). In the Middle Ages the Germans of Westphalia made the ass the symbol of St Thomas, the unbelieving apostle; and the boy who was last to enter the school on St Thomas’ day was called the “Ass Thomas” (Gubernatis’s Zoological Mythology, vol. i. p. 362). That the ass possesses qualities, which, if developed by careful selection and humane treatment, would make it a worthy companion of the horse as the servant of man, is seen in the too rare instances in which it has received proper attention. In Southern Europe—especially in Spain, Italy, and Malta—the ass is carefully bred, and has thus been greatly improved. No less than £200, it is said, is sometimes paid in Spain for a stallion ass. In the state of Kentucky, where mules are in great request as beasts of burden, asses, imported from the south of Europe, are reared with scrupulous care, and with such success, that from an average height of fourteen hands the Ken-tuckiana[9:2:717] have raised these animals to fifteen and even sixteen hands. That the diminutive size of the ass in cold countries is due as much to neglect as to rigour of climate seems proved by the fact, that in the north of India, where it is used by the lowest castes, the ass does not attain a height greater than that of a Newfoundland dog. It is, however, among the south-western nations of Asia and in Egypt that the ass has received that attention usually bestowed in this country on the horse, and it is there that it is to be seen in greatest perfection. The Arabs and Persians know the pedigrees of their asses, and by careful selection and interbreeding they have formed and perpetuate many useful races. Thus in Syria, according to Darwin, there are four distinct breeds:—“a light and graceful animal with agreeable gait used by ladies, an Arab breed reserved exclusively for the saddle, a stouter animal used for ploughing and various purposes, and the large Damascus breed with peculiarly long body and ears.”^[1. Animals and Plants under Domestication, vol. i. p. 62.]

The ass, there is little doubt, was first domesticated in Asia,—probably prior to the domestication of the horse,— whence it passed at a comparatively late period into Europe, for in the time of Aristotle it was not found in Thrace. In England there is evidence of its presence so early as the time of the Saxon Ethelred, but it does not appear to have been common till after the time of Queen Elizabeth. The koulan, or wild ass (Asinus Onager, Gray), differs from the domestic species in its shorter and more rounded ears, and in the greater length and finer form of its limbs. Its fur shows the dark streak along the back, but the streak across the shoulders does not appear to be a constant character. It is chiefly to be met with in the plains of Mesopotamia, in Persia, in Cutch, on the shores of the Indus, and in the Panjab, congregating in herds under a leader, and migrating southwards on the approach of winter. The adults are exceedingly shy, so that it is difficult to get within rifle range of them. According to Layard, who had ample opportunity for observing them during his researches around Nineveh, “they equal the gazelle in fleetness, and to match them is a feat which only one or two of the most celebrated mares have been known to accomplish.” In the same region, over 2000 years ago, Xenophon, during the famous expedition of Cyrus, observed herds of wild asses so “fleet that the horsemen could only take them by dividing themselves into relays, and succeeding one another in the chase.” The young are sometimes caught during spring by the Arabs, who feed them with milk in their tents. They are hunted chiefly by the Arabs and Persians, by whom their flesh is esteemed a delicacy. Their food, according to Dr Shaw, consists mainly of saline or bitter and lactescent plants; they are also fond of salt or brackish water. The leather known as shagreen, from the Turkish term sagri, is made from the skin of the ass; the ingrained aspect which it bears is not, however, natural to it, but is produced by a chemical process described by Pallas. The milk of the ass, containing more sugar and less caseine than that of the cow, closely resembles woman’s milk, and has long been valued as a nutritious diet where the digestive organs are weak.
