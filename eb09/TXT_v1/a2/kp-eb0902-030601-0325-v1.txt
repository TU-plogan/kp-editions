ARAL, a vast lake or inland sea, in the west of Asia, situated between lat. 43° 42' and 46° 44' N., and long. 58° 18' and 61° 46' E. It was known to the Persian geographers as the Sea of Khuwârizm or Khwarezm, from the neighbouring district of the Chorasmii, and derives its present name from the Kirghese designation of Aral Denghis, or Sea of Islands. Its length, from north to south, is 265 miles, and its breadth, from east to west, about 145. It is the greatest body of water in the steppes of Asia, next to the Caspian Sea, and is one of the largest lakes in the world. Its level is 117 (or, according to recent explorations, which, however, require verification, 250) feet above the Caspian, which is 84 feet below the Black Sea. It is bounded on the JSΓ. by the Ural steppes; on the W. by the rocky plateau of the Ust-Urt, which separates it from the Caspian; on the S. by the alluvial district of Khiva; and on the E. by the Kysyl-Kum, or Red. Desert, and the Kara-Kum, or Black Desert. In the north the shore is comparatively low, and the coast-line is broken into a number of irregular bays, of which the most important are those of Sary-Chaganak and Paskevitch; and on the west an almost unbroken wall of rock extends from Chernycheff Bay southwards, rising towards the middle to a height of 500 feet. The southern coast is occupied by the delta of the Oxus (Jîhûn, Amu-Daria, El-Jiryan), which divides into a number of channels, the most important of which, beginning from the west, are the Aibugir or Laudan, the Ulu-or Ulkun-Daria (Great River), and the Kuvan-Jarma, Kuk, or Yangy Su (New River), as it is variously called. The Laudan forms a vast swamp, 80 miles long, and about 20 broad, before it disembogues into the sea; and the whole of the neighbouring reaches are extremely shallow. The only other tributary of any size is the Jax-artes (Sîhûn, Syr-Daria, Shâsh), which enters towards the northern extremity of the east coast, and is suspected to be shifting its course and embouchure more and more to the north. The whole eastern coast is fringed with multitudes of small islands, and a number of considerable size are situated in the open towards the north and west. Kug-Aral, which is the largest of all, lies across the northern portion opposite the mouth of the Syr-Daria, and cuts off what is called the Kitchkine Dengis, or Little Sea. Proceeding south we find in succession, Barsa-Kilmas, Nicholas Island, Bellinghausen, Lasaroff, and, near the mouth of the Taldyk, Takmakdty. Upon some of these islands the Russian explorers found large numbers of antelopes, which showed by their perfect fearlessness, combined with their curiosity, that they had hitherto been undisturbed by man. For the most part the Sea of Aral is comparatively shallow, the depth towards the west coast being 37 fathoms, and towards the centre only 15. Navigation is rendered dangerous by the frequency and violence of the storms, and the almost total absence of shelter for ships. The northeast wind is the most prevalent, and sometimes blows for months together. The only other craft, except the steamships of the Russians, that venture on the waters, are the flat-bottomed boats of the Kirghese. The first vessel ever known to have been launched on the Aral was conveyed across the desert in pieces by the Russian Admiral Boutakoff, about 1848. The sea abounds with fish of various kinds, as the sturgeon, silurus, carp, and especially a species of herring; thus agreeing in its ichthyology with the Caspian, from which it is distant 150 miles. The water is only slightly brackish. During winter the northern portion is completely frozen, but towards the south it is very seldom that ice is formed to any extent. The Aral has no visible outlet; and to account for there being no increase in its size, it was supposed that there might be a subterraneous communication with the Caspian Sea or the Sea of Khuzar; but the evaporation is so great as not only to maintain an equilibrium, but even, it has been thought, to produce, as in the case of the Caspian, a gradual diminution. In regard to the period of the formation of the Aral there are two theories, each supported by high authority. According to Sir H. Rawlinson (^Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society, March 1867) the disturbances which produced the present lake took place in the course of the Middle Ages; while Sir Roderick Murchison contends (Journal of Roy. Geog. Soc. 1867, p. cxliv., &c.) that the Caspian and Aral have existed as separate seas before and during all the historic period, and that the main course of the rivers Jaxartes and Oxus was determined in a prehistoric period. The former bases his opinion largely on historical evidence, and the latter trusts principally to geological data. The whole subject has been recently reviewed in Die Aralseefrage, by Robert Roesler, Associate of the Imperial Academy of Sciences, Vienna, 1873.
