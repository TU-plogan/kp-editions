ASPARAGUS. The young shoots of Asparagus officinalis (Nat. Ord. Liliace<x) have from very remote times been in high repute as a culinary vegetable, owing to their delicate flavour and diuretic virtues. The plant grows wild on the south coast of England; and on the waste steppes of Russia it is so abundant that it is eaten by cattle like grass. In common with the marsh-mallow and some other plants, it contains a chemical principle called asparagin, to which it owes its medicinal qualities. The roots of asparagus were formerly used as an aperient medicine, and the fruits were likewise employed as a diuretic. Under the name of Prussian asparagus, the spikes of an allied plant, Ornitho-galuτn pyrenaicum, are used in some places.
