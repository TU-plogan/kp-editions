ARGOS. The most important city of this name was situated in the eastern part of the Peloponnesus, about 3 miles from the sea. By the Greeks themselves it was regarded as the most ancient of all their cities, and as the local habitation of many of their earlier heroes. Here Inachus and his descendants had reigned for many generations, until the arrival of Danaus the Egyptian, with his fifty daughters, whose dynasty, glorious with the names of Perseus the Gorgon-slaycr, and Eurystheus the master of Hercules, held sway over Argos, and Tiryns, and Mycenae, till it, in its turn, was succeeded by the still more important dynasty of Pelops. The Dorian invasion and conquest followed, and Argos became the head of a Dorian confederation, extending its authority over a large portion of the neighbouring territory. Between this region (Argolis) and Sparta, however, there were no natural boundaries, and a conflict arose between the two states about the border land of Cynuria. For a time, under the despotic management of Pheidon, Argos maintained its ground; but Sparta ultimately established its claim in spite of the dubious result of the famous duel of the 600, which was fought for the decision of the dispute, and the strength of the Argives was completely crushed by Cleomenes at the battle of Tiryns. A temporary ascendency of the serfs in Argos, an extension of the franchise, and a permanent adoption of a more democratic constitution, seem to have been the consequences of this national exhaustion and the subsequent reaction. During the Persian war Argos was indifferent and neutral, but in the contest for power which ensued between Athens and Sparta, the old antipathy against the latter was sufficient to make the Argives stanch allies of the former. In the 4th century b.c., the democratic constitution of the city degenerated into a reign of terror (2κυταλισ/ζόΐ), which in its turn gave place to a series of tyrannies, from which escape was ultimately found in the Achaean League and the Roman domination. Pyrrhus perished in an unsuccessful attack on the city in 272 B.c. In the 13th century of our era, Argos fell into the possession of the Franks, from whom it passed into the hands of the Byzantine despots; and in 1463 it was taken by the Ottoman troops. Here in the darkest period of Greek ignorance lived one of the few representatives of the ancient learning, Theodosius Zigomali (Crusius’s Turcogrcecia). In the time of Pausanias the number of temples in Argos and its neighbourhood was remarkable, the most important of them being the Heraeum, or temple of Hera, the ruins of which, visible from the acropolis of Argos, but nearer to Mycenae, were discovered in 1831 by Colonel Gordon of Cairness (see plan in Leake’s Peloponnesiaca, 1846). Within the city the greatest was the temple of Apollo Lyceus. Remains still exist of the cyclopean architecture of the acropolis, of the theatre, which was of great extent, and of an aqueduct which can be traced for miles to the north-west. In the 5th century b.c., Argos was the seat of a great school of statuary under Ageladas, but it did not contribute to the long roll of Greek literature more than the names of Telesilla and Sacadas, of whom the latter was better known, as a musician. The limits of Argolis varied at different times, but it was only under the Romans that they were understood to embrace the districts of Phlius, Cleonae, Epidaurus, Troezen, and Cynuria.
