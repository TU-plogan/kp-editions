population,—are rarely bloody; the object being most often with the one party to carry off, and with the other to protect, a flock of sheep or a herd of camels': booty is aimed at, not slaughter. If positive hatred or a desire to kill exist, such feelings are usually limited to two or three individuals at most, one of whom has perhaps been ridiculed in satirical verse, to which they are very sensitive, or had a distant relation killed in some previous fray. Bloodshed, too, is expensive, as it must be made up for either by more bloodshed or by paying the price,—the “deeah,” as it is called, and which varies, according to the importance of the person killed, from ten to fifty camels, or even more. Previous to Mahomet’s time it was left optional to the injured tribe either to accept this kind of compensation or to insist on blood for blood; but the Prophet, though by his own account despairing of ever reducing the nomade portion of his countrymen to any fixed observances, succeeded on this point in establishing among them the rule, that a fair “deeah,” if offered, must of necessity be accepted: a merciful regulation, tending to cut short otherwise interminable feuds.

Instances are, however, not wanting in Arab history of fiercer and more general Bedouin conflicts, in which the destruction, or at least the complete subjugation, of one tribe has been aimed at by another, and when great slaughter has accordingly taken place. Such were the wars of Pekr and Thagleb in the 6th century, of Kelb and Howazin in the 8th, of Harb and Oteybah in the 18th, with others. But these are comparatively rare events.

Brigand-The Bedouins regard the plundering of caravans or a 8 e ∙ travellers, whether on business or otherwise, simply as a supplementary measure that takes the place of passports or custom dues exacted elsewhere. The land is theirs, they say, and trespassers on it without leave must pay the forfeit. Hence whoever can show anything equivalent to a permission of entrance into their territory, has, in the regular course of things, nothing to fear. This permission is obtained by securing the protection of the nearest Bedouin sheykh, who, for a politely-worded request and a small sum of money, will readily grant the pass, in the shape of one or two or more men of his tribe, who accompany the wayfarers as far as the next encampment on their road, where they hand their charge over to fresh guides, equally bound to afford the desired safeguard. In the interior of the peninsula the passport is given in writing by one of the local town governors, and is respected by the Bedouins of the district; for, however impudent and unamenable to law these nomades may be on the frontiers of the impotent Ottoman government in Syria or the Hejaz, they are quiet and submissive enough in other and Arab-governed regions of the peninsula. But the rash traveller who ventures on the desert strip without the precautions above mentioned is likely enough to atone for his negligence by the loss of his luggage; and should he resist, perhaps his life also.

(Tribes Utterly ignorant of writing and unacquainted with books, the Bedouins trust to their memory for everything; where memory fails, they readily eke it out with imagination. Hence their own assertions regarding the antiquity, numbers, strength, &c., of their clans are of little real worth; even their genealogies, in which they pretend to be eminently versed, are not to be much depended on; the more so that their own family names hardly ever exceed the limits of a patronymic, whilst the constantly renewed subdivisions of a tribe, and the temporary increase of one branch and decrease of another, tend to efface the original name of the clan. Few tribes, accordingly, now preserve their ancient, or at least their historical titles; and the mass of the Bedouin multitude resembles in this respect a troubled sea, of which the substance is indeed always the same, but the surface is continually shifting and changing. As, however, no social basis or ties are acknowledged among them except those of blood and race, certain broad divisions are tolerably accurately kept up, the wider and more important of which may here be noted.

First, the Anezah clan, whose pasture-grounds extend Anezah. from Syria southward to the limits of Jebel Shomer. It is numerous, and, for a Bedouin tribe, well armed. Two-thirds of the Arab horse trade, besides a large traffic in sheep, camels, wool, and similar articles, are in the hands of these Anezah Bedouins. Their principal subdivisions are the Sebaâ. on the north, the Woold-Alee on the west, and the Ruâla on the south; these are generally on bad terms with each other. If united, they could muster, it is supposed, about 30,000 lances. They claim descent from Rabeéah. Second, the Shomer Bedouins, whose pasturages Shomer. lie conterminous to those of the Anezah on the east. Their numbers are about the same. Thirdly, in the northern desert, the Howeytat and Sherarat, comparatively small Howeytat. and savage tribes. Also the Soleebee clan, which, however, is disowned by the Arabs, and seems to be of gipsy origin. Next follow, in the western desert, the Benoo-Harb, a Harb, powerful tribe, supposed to muster about 20,000 lances. Their origin is from Keys-Eylan. They are often troublesome to the Meccan pilgrims. In the eastern desert are the Moteyr, the Benoo-Khalid, and the Ajmans, all numerous Moteyr. clans, often at war with each other. To the south, in Nejd itself or on its frontiers, are the Hodeyl, Oteybah, and others, others. These all belong to the “Mustareb,” or northern Arabs.

The Bedouins of southern or “pure Arab” origin are Southern comparatively few in number, and are, it seems, with few Bedouins, exceptions, even poorer and more savage than their northern brethren. Al-Morrah, on the confines of Oman, Al-Yam and Kahtan, near Yemen, and Benoo-Yas, between Hareek and the Persian Gulf, are the best known. The total number of the Bedouin or pastoral population throughout Arabia appears, including men, women, and children, not to exceed a million and a half—it may even fall short of it.

Whatever be the clan, the only authority it submits to Organisais that of its “elder,” or “sheykh,” a title which, however, tion. does not necessarily imply advanced age, but is given to any one who, on account of birth, courage, wealth, liberality, skill, prudence, or some other fortunate quality or accident, has been chosen to the leadership. Descent has something to do with rank, but not much, as every individual of the tribe considers himself equal to the others; nor are the distinctions of relative riches and poverty greatly taken into account. This is natural in a state of things where property itself, consisting almost wholly of live stock, is of an essentially uncertain and fluctuating character, and the Bedouins have no other. To the “sheykh” all disputes are referred; he is consulted, though not necessarily obeyed, on every question which regards the general affairs of the tribe, whether in peace or war; there is no other magistrate, and no law except what he and the other chief men of the clan may consider proper. But in fact, for most personal and private affairs, every man does pretty much what is right in his own eyes.

Nominally Mahometan, most of the Bedouins pay slight Religkn. attention to the ceremonial precepts of the Koran; the five daily prayers and the annual fast of Ramadhan are not much in favour among them; and however near a tribe may be to Mecca, few of them visit it as pilgrims. Wahhabee influence exercised, sword in hand, has, however, of late enforced some degree of Islamitic observance among the Bedouins of Nejd and the adjoining districts: elsewhere nomade Mahometanism is pretty nearly confined to the profession of the Divine Unity; among the remoter and wilder tribes sun-worship, tree-worship, and no worship at [9:2:248] 248 ARA

all, are not uncommon. Some clans even omit the rite of circumcision altogether; others, like the tribe of Hodeyl, south of Mecca, perform it after a fashion peculiar to them-y 3 τalx selves. Nor are the social and moral injunctions of Islam 3 X better observed. Marriages are contracted without any legal intervention or guarantee; the consent of the parties, and the oral testimony of a couple of witnesses, should such be at hand, are all that are required; and divorce is equally facile. Nor is mutual constancy much expected or observed either by men or women; and the husband is rarely strict in exacting from the wife a fidelity that he himself has no idea of observing. Jealousy may indeed occasionally bring about tragic results, but this rarely occurs except where publicity, to which the Bedouins, like ah other Arabs, are very sensitive, is involved. A maiden’s honour is, on the other hand, severely guarded; and even too openly avow ed a courtship, though with the most honourable intentions, is ill looked on. But marriage, if indeed so slight and temporary a connection as it is among Bedouins deserves the name, is often merely a passport for mutual licence. In other respects, Bedouin morality, like that of most half-savage races, depends on custom and public feeling rather than on any fixed code or trained conscience, and hence admits of the strangest contradictions. Not only are lying and exaggeration no reproach in ordinary discourse, but even deliberate perjury and violation of the most solemn engagements are frequent occurrences. Not less frequent, however, are instances of prolonged fidelity and observance of promise carried to the limits of romance. “The wind,” “the wood,” and “the honour of the Arabs,” are the most ordinary oaths in serious matters; but even these do not give absolute security, while a simple verbal engagement will at other times prove an inviolable guarantee. Thus, too, the extreme abstemiousness of a Bedouin alternates with excessive gorgings; and, while the name and deeds of “robber” are hardly a reproach, those of “thief” are marked by abhorrence and contempt. Patience, or rather endurance, both physical and moral, few Bedouins are deficient in; wariness is another quality universally developed by their mode of life. And in spite of an excessive coarseness of language, and often of action, gross vice, at least of the more debasing sorts that dishonour the East, is rare among them. Of their hospitality, as also of many other points common between them and the town Arabs, we shall speak further on.

Personal In person most Bedouins, men or women, are rather appearance. undersized, the result probably of hardships endured through uncounted generations; their complexion, especially in the south, is dark; their hair coarse, copious, and black; their eyes dark and oval; the nose is commonly aquiline, and the features well formed; beard and moustache are apt to be somewhat scanty. The men are active, but not strong; the women, rarely otherwise than plain.

Dress. Their dress is simple enough; that of the men consist ing in a long cotton shirt, open at the breast, and often girt with a leathern girdle; a black or striped cloak of hair is sometimes thrown over the shoulders; a handkerchief, folded but once, and generally black, more seldom striped yellow and red, covers the head, round which it is kept in its place by a piece of twine or a twisted hairband. To this costume a pair of open sandals is sometimes added. No other article of dress is worn,—neither trousers nor turban; but under the shirt, round the naked waist, a thin strip of leather plait is wound several times, not for any special object, but merely out of custom. In his hand a Bedouin almost always carries a slight crooked wand, commonly of almond-wood; with this he guides his camel when on the road, and amuses himself by playing with it at other times. Among the Bedouins of the south a light

BIA [arab rack—· wrapper takes the place of the handkerchief on the head, and a loin-cloth that of the shirt.

A woman’s attire is hardly more complicated; wide loose Women’s drawers, though these are sometimes dispensed with; next dress, a long shirt, and over it a wide piece of dark blue cloth enveloping the whole figure, the head included, and trailing on the ground behind. Very rarely does a Bedouin woman wear a veil, or even cover her face with her overcloak, contenting herself with narrowing the folds of the latter over her head on the approach of a stranger. Her wrists and ankles are generally adorned with bracelets and rings of blue glass or copper or iron, very rarely of silver; her neck with glass beads; earrings are rare, and noserings rarer. A few comparatively rich women indulge in more elegant ornaments and fuller dress. Boys, till near puberty, usually go stark naked; girls up to six or seven.

On a journey a Bedouin invariably bears with him a Weapons, light sharp-pointed lance, the stem of which is made of Persian or African cane; the manner in which this is carried or trailed often indicates the tribe of the owner. The lance is the favourite and characteristic weapon of the Arab nomade, and the one in the use of which he showβ the greatest skill, throwing it, at need, to a considerable distance with unerring aim. Frequently, too, he girds on, or rather suspends from a kind of shoulder-belt, a sword, straight or crooked a3 may be; the blade is often of little value, rusty, and not over sharp; the scabbard of wood. The weapon which comes third in frequency is a gun; this is still in almost every instance a matchlock, clumsy and foul, taking from five to ten minutes to load and fire, when, indeed, it can be fired at all, which is not always the case. Yet with such wretched implements at his disposal, a Bedouin is seldom other than a good marksman. Flint-guns may here and there be met with nowadays; but percussion or breech-loaders never. Nor are pistols any part of a Bedouin’s war equipment. But whether in peace or war, he is seldom without a knife: this in the north is only a large clumsy clasp or sheath knife; but in Yemen, Oman, and the intervening regions it develops into a broad and crooked dagger, a truly formidable weapon, on the ornamentation of which the Bedouin of the south bestows what skill or wealth he may happen to possess.

For defensive armour a Bedouin on a foray, or preparing Armour, for a serious engagement, sometimes puts on a coat of mail, the manufacture of Yemen or Baghdad; its links are thin, but closely plaited, and often are two or even three deep. To this he adds a helmet, a mere iron head-piece, without visor or crest. Pennons and banners are rarely used by the nomades, whose chief tactics consist in surprise, as their main object is plunder, both of which require, not display, but secrecy. For though the Bedouins are undoubtedly brave and reckless enough of life, their own as well as that of others, where a cause requires it, they have the good sense never to venture blood unnecessarily or on insufficient grounds. Indeed on all points and in all their dealings, shrewd, calm, good sense, joined with a humorous and sarcastic turn of mind, may be said to be the base of their character; their passions, strong and lasting, are kept in habitual control; and in these regards, as in a lively and poetical imagination, and a wonderful power of untaught eloquence, they resemble their more settled countrymen of the towns and villages. In their principal faults, too—instability, restlessness, envy, rancour, untruthfulness, and sensuality—they resemble them also.

Much has been said and written of the independence of Indej. writhe Bedouins, and of their having never submitted them-ence. selves to a foreign yoke; and prophecy has been called in to explain a fact which a little reflection would have showτι to imply nothing marvellous or exceptional what-A[9:2:249] Bedouin camp.

ever, but to be merely the natural result of condition and circumstances. À nomade popιdation, thinly scattered over a large and open space of meagre pasture-land, will always be unconquerable, because it offers next to nothing to conquer. When in camp, a Bedouin’s tent consists of a few coverings of the coarsest goat-hair, dyed black, and spread over two or more small poles, in height from 8 to 9 feet, gipsy fashion. If it be the tent of a sheykh or man of consequence, its total length may be from 30 to 40 feet; if of an ordinary person, it w ill offener fall short of 20. Sometimes a partition separates the quarters allotted to the women and children; sometimes they are housed under a lower and narrower covering. A piece of rough carpet or an old mat may or may not be spread on the sandy floor; while camel-saddles, ropes, halters, and the like, constitute the entire furniture of the dwelling; ornament there is none. To the list two or three cauldrons for cooking, one or two platters, and a wooden drinking bowl, must be added; and with these, including the master’s arms in one side of the tent, and his spear stuck in the ground at the door, the household valuables are complete. When the time comes for moving, all these several articles are easily fastened in bundles on the backs of one or more camels; the men mount their saddles, the women their litters; and in an hour the blackened stones that served for a cooking hearth remain as almost the only sign where the encampment has been. When the tribe is once on its way across the desert, pursuit is difficult; and were the fugitives overtaken, they would offer nothing to repay the trouble of their pursuers. It may be worth the while of nomades such as these occasionally to plunder each other, but it can hardly be worth the while of any foreign power to plunder, still less to attempt to subdue them, and in this lies the whole secret of their imagined independence.

From the Bedouins, or “Ahl Bedoo,” we now turn to the “Ahl Hadr,” or the dwellers in fixed abodes. These constitute about six-sevenths of the population of Arabia proper, and it is from them alone that a just appreciation of the Arab character and customs can be formed.

Though the clan and the family form the basis and are the ultimate expression of the civilised Arab society, they do not, as is the case among the Bedouins, sum it up altogether; local feelings and duties, the consequences of settled life, having deeply modified the character alike of the individuals and the race among all Arabs, town or country. Still, blood is the first thing taken into account; and, indeed, the possession of written records, and habits of order and reflection, enable the settled Arabs to acquire and retain a more accurate knowledge and nicer distinction of pedigree and race than could be expected or found among the unreflecting and half-barbarous Bedouins.

Throughout the peninsula, but especially on the western side, the family of Koreysh is even yet regarded as the noblest of Arab races, indeed of the world; and its members, on the strength of their connection with the Prophet, all bear the title of “Shereef,” sometimes also, as in Yemen, that of “Seyyid,” or “lord.” Besides the advantages which naturally follow popular respect, they hold in several districts of Arabia—in Mecca itself, for example, in Aboo-Areesh, and in some parts of Yemen—the positions and emoluments of local hereditary governors. But they do not assume any regular distinctive mark, like the green turban so often worn in Turkey or Persia; nor in private life do they enjoy any immunity, either explicit or prescriptive, from the ordinary obligations of law.

“Sheykh,” or elder, “Emeer,” or ruler, “Imam,” or preceder, and “Sultan,” or monarch, are personal and often, though not necessarily, hereditary titles of rank. “Walee,” or governor, is a word the use of which is limited

BIA 249

to Yemen and Oman. “Sheykh,” on the contrary, is universal; every village, however small, every separate quarter of a town, has a “sheykh,” in whom is lodged the executive power of government—a power loosely defined, and of more or less extent according to the personal character and means of the individual who wields it. A village “sheykh” is a sort of head magistrate and chief of police, or like a sheriff of old times. His power is, however, occasionally limited, particularly in towns, by that of the “kadee,” or “judge,” whose duty consists in the official, though rather arbitrary, interpretation of the law, and whose sentence ought, in theory at least, to precede the action of the sheykh. But as the Koran, the sole authentic authority in all matters, legal or civil, throughout Arabia, never accurately distinguished between the two classes, and its phrases, besides, are vague and capable of admitting different and even opposite interpretations, the administration of law and justice has in consequence always remained extremely irregular, and dependent much more on the personal good sense and integrity of the officials, or too often on their want of those desirable qualities, than on any methodised system. The sheykh has no fixed income; he is usually a landed proprietor, sometimes a merchant; many sheykhs, however, abuse their power for their own private advantage. Nor is his office strictly hereditary, though it may become accidentally so.

Emeer is a higher title, restricted to a governor of a Emeer, district or province, especially in Shomer, Nejd, and the rest of the central region. An emeer is in most respects nothing but a magnified sheykh; he has, however, the advantage of drawing a considerable portion of his income from the country he administers. Thus in Nejd the emeers receive and retain, partially in Wahhabee governments, wholly in others, the “zekat,” or tithes, varying from one-twentieth up to one-fifth of the value of property, besides other occasional dues, fines, <fcc.; in Hasa, Bahreyn, Katar, Mahrah, and Hadramaut the emeer can also claim the fishery tax and customs. Beyond Wahhabee limits he has the ordinary, within them the extraordinary, power of life and death; in all cases he can punish by imprisonment and fine. Part of his office is to hold public audiences daily, on which occasions every one who chooses, of whatever rank or condition, has the right of coming forward and of presenting any complaint or petition. Sometimes the emeer takes the matter thus brought before him into his own hands at once; sometimes he refers it to the radee, or to the elder and more respectable inhabitants, who in these meetings take seat near the emeer, and form a kind of improvised council. The emeer himself wears about him no distinctive badge of office; nor is he approached with any ceremony beyond that of ordinary Arab politeness. In the Wahhabee provinces, or those where Wahha-beeism, though no longer dominant, has made a permanent impression, as in Shomer for instance, the emeer commonly takes on himseif the duties of the Friday “imam,” not unlike those of precentor in Presbyterian worship, in the public mosque; now and then he preaches a sermon. Ilis position is generally hereditary, but not always in direct line.

The title of “sultan,” or king, one of doubtful antiquity, Sultan, has been assumed by the hereditary Wahhabee ruler of Riad, the capital of Nejd; it is also often applied to the sovereign of Oman, and to some petty princes in the south of the peninsula. In practice it adds little or nothing to the dignity of emeer, but implies a larger territorial range of authority.

Where the Wahhabee doctrines have definitely estab-Religion, lished themselves, as in Nejd, Yemameh, Hareek, Aflaj, and Jebel Aseer, the Mahometan code, as laid down in the Koran, is observed more strictly perhaps than in any other

250 ARA part of the Eastern World. Besides the principal mosque, or « ia≡ " for Friday prayers, indispensable in every town o∕ village, smaller praying-places, or mesjids, are erected in eveιy quarter. These buildings are mere oblong rooms, flat-roofed, supported on numerous rough pillars placed close to each other, and with no architectural or decorative beauty whatever; but are kept scrupulously clean, and laid down partly with mats, partly gravel In most cases there is no minaret attached, the times of prayer being merely announced by the “mùeddin,” or crier, from the roof itself. Punctuality in attendance is enforced by the « mu tow was,” or “compellers” of “obedience,” a set of self-elected zealots, who parade the towns and villages with sticks in their hands, take note of the defaulters from prayers, or transgressors otherwise of the letter of-the law, and punish them with reproaches or even blows. Marriage, divorce, inheritance, purchase, every detail of life is regulated in exact accordance with the Koran; even conversation is liable to censure unless thickly interlarded with words of religious import; while after night-prayers talking is a luxury prohibited altogether. Yet, though these Wahhabee Arabs are bigoted even to fanaticism among themselves and with their fellow-countrymen, they are remarkably tolerant towards strangers, and often unite with the extreme of theoretical exclusiveness a good deal of the practical scepticism and indifference common to their race.

Orthodox These Wahhabees all belong to the orthodox sect of sects. Ebn-Hanbal, and are in fact its most exaggerated expression. In the eastern provinces, Hasa, Katee, Bahreyn, and Katar, the Malikee sect is more common; as also, it is said, in Hadramaut, and in some parts of Yemen. But in Yemen generally, and throughout the Hejaz, the Shaféyee sect, orthodox like the two others, predominates. There are no Hanefees in Arabia, except a few Turks or Indians settled on the western coast. “Sheéah,” too, or votaries of Ali and his family, in the Persian sense of the word, are by no means common in the peninsula, and where found are often of foreign origin.

Khowaιij. But all along the Persian Gulf, in Hasa, Bahreyn, and Katar, a considerable proportion of the inhabitants are not Mahometans at all, that is, in the ordinary acceptation of the word, but “Khowarij,” or “secedere,” belonging to the Karmathian school already mentioned; while in Oman, the little peninsula or cape of Ras-el-Rheymah excepted, where Wahhabeeism has made good its footing, the bulk of the people belong to the Beyadee or Abadee sect, a Karmathian offshoot nearly allied in doctrines and in practice to the “Ismaileeyah” of Syria. For a detailed account of either the reader may with advantage consult Silvestre de Sacy’s admirable treatise on the “Batineeyah,” or secret sects of the Mahometan East, prefixed to his History of the Druses. Somewhat akin to these, but of a less marked divergence from orthodox Islam, are the Zeydees, of whom great numbers exist in Yemen. Lastly, paganism, or rather the fetichism that takes for its scope a stone, tree, or some other natural object, appears to exist in Mahrah, in the southern Jowf, and in various small half-isolated spots on the borders of the great desert, or Dahna. Vestiges of Sabaism, or the worship of the heavenly bodies, are said to linger among the wilder Bedouin tribes, who even yet compute the year from the rising of Soheyl or Canopus, and prostrate themselves to the morning sun. It is also noticeable that even such of the southern Arabs as are professedly Mahometan, are far less zealous and much laxer in their ways than the Arabs of the north; in fact, the Islam of the latter was indigenous, that of the former acquired or compulsory.

Except in a few places on the west coast long exposed to Egyptian, Turkish, and Indian influences, no dervishes

Nor are Arabs, generally speaking, super- on * stitious in other respects: of dreams and omens they make little account; nor does the apprehension of ghosts, spectres, apparitions, demons, and the like often disquiet their hours of loneliness or darkness; stories of such a character, though embodied here and there in Arab literature, in the Thousand and One Nights for example, are less frequently of Arab than of foreign origin, generally Persian. Nor do Arabs often seek to convert others, except it be their own purchased negro slaves, a facile acquisition, to Mahometanism, or molest those of other religions. Jews exist undisturbed in great numbers near Teyma and in the south; Hindoos worship cows and burn their dead without interference in Oman; only old custom, it would seem, and the memory of long and bitter ware, prohibits the practice of the Christian religion in Arabia proper,—Aden alone, of course, where the British flag proclaims absolute tolerance, excepted.

Slavery is still, as of old times, a recognised institution Slavery, throughout Arabia; and an active traffic in blacks is carried on along the coasts of the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea, but especially the former.

The slaves themselves are chiefly brought from the east African coast districts down as far as Zanzibar, and from the Galla tribes in the interior; a few Abyssinians, too, are sometimes imported. Slaves are usually employed in Arabia as herdsmen or as domestic servants, rarely in agricultural works; they also form a considerable portion of the bodyguards with which Eastern greatness loves to surround itself. Like their countrymen elsewhere, they readily embrace the religion of their masters, and become zealous Mahometans, though rarely according to knowledge. Arab custom enfranchises a slave who has accepted Islam at the end of seven years of bondage; and when that period has arrived, the master, instead of exacting from his slave the price of freedom, generally, on giving him his liberty, adds the requisite means for supporting himself and a family in comfort. Further, on every important occasion, such as a birth, circumcision, a marriage, or a death, one or more of the household slaves are sure of acquiring their freedom. Hence it comes that Arabia is densely sprinkled with a free black population; and these again, by intermarriage with the whites around, have filled the land with a mulatto breed of every shade, till, in the eastern and southern provinces especially, a white skin is almost an exception. This has taken place all the more readily that in Arabia there exists no prejudice against negro alliances; no social or political line separates the African from the Arab. A negro may become a sheykh, a kadee, an emeer, or whatever his industry and his talents may render him capable of being. This occurs frequently, particularly in Nejd, Yemen, and Hadramaut; in the Hejaz and the north, on the contraτy, a faint line of demarcation may be observed between the races.

Both town and village Arabs are, as a rule, serious in Character, gait and demeanour, and very observant of politeness, not only in the manner, but even in the substance of their conversation. In temper, or at least in the manifestation of it, they are studiously calm; and an Arab rarely so much as raises his voice in a dispute. He prides himself on an unnιffled exterior, and will bear much with careful seeming calm that would drive a European to the extreme of impatience and rage. But this outward tranquillity covers feelings alike keen and permanent; and the remembrance of a rash jest or injurious word, uttered years before, is too often the cause of violence and bloodshed.

Besides, however, the individual shades of character, there exist marked tribal or almost semi-national diversities[9:2:251], among the Arabs. Thus, the inhabitants of Hejaz are noted for courtesy and blamed for fickleness; those of Nejd are distinguished by their stern tenacity and dignity of deportment; the nations of Yemen are gentle and pliant, but revengeful; those of Hasa and Oman cheerful and fond of sport, though at the same time turbulent and unsteady. Anything approaching to a game is rare in Nejd, and in the Hejaz religion and the yearly occurrence of the pilgrim ceremonies almost exclude all public diversions; but in Yemen the well-known game of the “jereed,” or palm-stick, with dances and music—the latter very barbarous, it must be allowed—is not rare. In Oman such amusements are still more frequent. Again, in Yemen and Oman, coffee-houses, where people can resort for conversation, and where public recitals, songs, and other diversions are to be met with, stand open all day; while nothing of the sort is tolerated in Nejd. So it is also with the ceremonies observed on occasion of circumcision or marriage—occasions of gaiety and pastime on the coast, but passed over with little of the like observance in the central provinces.

An Arab town, or even village, except it be the merest hamlet, is invariably walled round; but the ramparts are low, and seldom of any stronger material than dried earth; they are occasionally flanked by towers of like construction, such as befit a country where cannon are unknown and fire-arms are yet at the matchlock stage. A dry-ditch often surrounds the whole. The streets are utterly irregular— some broad, some narrow, all tortuous; the houses are of one or two storeys, very rarely of three, with flat mud roofs, little windows, and no external ornament. If the town be large, the expansion of one or two streets becomes a market-place, where are ranged a few shops of eatables, drugs, coffee, and, very rarely, cottons or other goods. Many of these shops are kept by women. The chief mosque is always near the market-place; so is also the governor’s residence, which, except in size and in being more or less fortified Arab fashion, does not differ from a private house. Drainage is unthought of; but the extreme dryness of the air obviates the inconvenience and disease that under other skies could not fail to ensue, and which in the damper climates of the coast make themselve3 seriously felt. But the streets are roughly swept every day, each householder taking care of what lies before his own door. Whitewash and colour are occasionally used in Yemen, Hejaz, and Oman; elsewhere a light ochre tint, the colour of the sun-dried bricks, predominates in an Arab town or village, which looks at a distance like a large dust-heap in the centre of the bright green ring of gardens and palm-groves all around. Baked bricks are unknown in Arabia, and stone buildings are rare, especially in Nejd. Palm branches and the like, woven in wattles, form the dwellings of the poorer classes in the southern districts. Many Arab towns possess watchtowers, like huge round factory chimneys in appearance, built of sun-dried bricks, and varying in height from 50 to 100 feet, or even more. Indeed, two of these constructions at the town of Birket-el-Mawj, in Oman, are said to be each of 170 feet in height, and that of Nezwah, in the same province, is reckoned at 140; but these are of stone. Some of these watch-towers are so built as to serve also for citadels or places of refuge; but none could offer a minute’s resistance to any kind of artillery, though formidable obstacles to men whose only means of attack are lances and matchlocks.

The principal feature in the interior of an Arab house is the “kahwah,” or coffee-room, as from its destination it is commonly called. It is a large apartment spread with mats, and sometimes furnished with carpets and a few cushions. At one extremity is a small furnace or fireplace, for preparing coffee. In this room the men congregate; here guests are received, and even lodged; women rarely enter it, except at times when strangers are unlikely to be present. Some of these apartments are very spacious, and supported by pillars; one wall is usually built transversely to the compass direction of the kâabeh; it serves to facilitate the performance of prayer by those who may happen to be in the kahwah at the appointed times. The other rooms are ordinarily small, and appropriated to the use of the females of the family and to domestic life.

In hospitality the Arabs of our time have in no degree degenerated from their former reputation, though Shomer, Nejd, Yemamah, and Hasa excel in this respect the other provinces. A stranger’s arrival is often the occasion of an amicable dispute among the wealthier inhabitants as to who shall have the privilege of receiving him; and though three days are often popularly spoken of as the limit of such entertainment, practice sets no precise bounds to its length; and an Arab host always carefully abstains from putting any question to his guest as to when he is going, or where. Indeed, if the guest be discreet and acceptable in his manners, he will soon find himself on the footing of one of the family; and even the women of the house will come in to sit and converse with him not less freely than they would with their own relations.

Arab cookery is of the simplest. Roughly-ground wheat cooked with butter; bread, in thin cakes, prepared on a heated iron plate or against the walls of an open oven; a few vegetables, generally of the leguminous kinds; boiled mutton or camel’s flesh, if the circumstances of the host allow of such luxuries; dates and fruits,—this is the menu of an ordinary meal. Roast meat, fried, stewed—in a word, anything but boiled—is rarely seen, such dishes exceeding the skill of the cooks, who, as a rule, are the women of the household. Rice is eaten in wealthy houses, and fish is common on the coasts. Among the Bedouins, millet-cakes, half-cooked in ashes, or a broth prepared from the gritty seeds of the “samh” (a species of Mesembry-anthem,um) i often take the place of bread; and their meat cookery is equally wretched. Game, such as venison, partridge, and hare, is served up on rare occasions. Camel meat is a favourite, but to a stranger a very insipid dish, in southern Nejd, Yemamah, Hareek, and Aflaj. Spices are freely employed in town cookery; butter much too largely for a European taste.

After eating, the hands are always washed with soap, or some substitute for it, commonly the ashes of an alkaline plant. A covered censer with burning incense is then passed round, and each guest perfumes his hands, face, and sometimes his clothes; this censer serves also on first receptions, and whenever special honour is intended. In Yemen and Oman scented water often does duty for it. Coffee, without milk or sugar, but flavoured with an aromatic seed brought from India, is served to all· This, too, is done on the occasion of a first welcome, when the cups often make two or three successive rounds; but, in fact, coffee is made and drunk at any time, as frequently as the desire for it may suggest itself; and each time fresh grains are sifted, roasted, pounded, and boiled—a very laborious process, and one that requires in the better sort of establishments a special servant or slave for the work. Among the Bedouins the use of coffee is rare, though they are fond of it when they can get it Arabs in general make only one solid meal a-day—that of supper, soon after sunset; nor even then do they eat much, gluttony being rare among them, and even daintiness esteemed disgraceful. Wine, like other fermented drinks, is prohibited by the Koran, and is, in fact, very rarely to be met with, though the inhabitants of the mountains of Oman are said to indulge in it On the coast spirits of the worst quality [9:2:252] are sometimes procured; opium and hasheesh have also but few votaries in Arabia. On the other hand, wherever Wahhabeeism has left freedom of action, tobacco-smoking prevails, the manner of smoking varying considerably, according to the district. Among the Bedouins and the poorer classes of the upland regions a short pipe of clay, called a “sebeel,” red or black, is in vogue. The wealthier townsmen prefer long pipes with large open bowls; but the most frequent use is made of the water-pipe, or “narghileh,” of which implement every form, kind, and dimension imaginable may be found in Arabia. The tobacco smoked is generally strong, and is either brought from the neighbourhood of Baghdad or grown in the country itself. The strongest quality is that of Oman; the leaf is broad and coarse, and retains its green colour even when dried; a few whiffs have been known to produce absolute stupor. The aversion of the Wahhabees to tobacco is well known; they entitle it “mukhzee,” or “the shameful,” and its use is punished with blows, as the public use of wine would be elsewhere.

In dress much variety prevails. The loose cotton drawers, girded at the waist, which in hot climates do duty for trousers, are not often worn, even by the upper classes, in Nejd or Yemamah, where a kind of silk dressing-gown is thrown over the long shirt; frequently, too, a brown or black cloak distinguishes the wealthier citizen; his head-dress is in its character the same as that of the Bedouins — namely, a handkerchief fastened round _ the head by a band—only of better materials. But in Hejaz, Yemen, and Oman, turbans are by no means uncommon; the ordinary colour is white; they are worn over one or more skull-caps—sometimes fifteen—till the head is rather burdened than protected. Trousers also form part of the dress in the two former of these districts; and a voluminous sash, in which a dagger or an inkstand is stuck, is wrapped round the waist. Meanwhile the poorer folk and the villagers often content themselves with a broad piece of cloth round the loins, and another across the shoulders. In Oman trousers are rare, but over the shirt a long gown, of peculiar and somewhat close-fitting cut, dyed yellow, is often worn. The women in these provinces commonly put on loose drawers, and some add veils to their head-dresses; they are fond of ornaments (gold and silver), and overcharge themselves with them; their hair is generally arranged in a long plait hanging down behind. All men allow their beards, whiskers, and moustaches full growth, though none of these are much to speak of, particularly among the Arabs of the south, who are a thin-haired race. Most shave their heads, and indeed all, strictly speaking, ought by Mahometan custom to do so; but many, peasants especially, Bedouins, and the like, neglect it. An Arab seldom or never dyes his hair. Sandals are worn more often than shoes, but the heat of the ground in the daytime allows none except the very poorest to go wholly barefoot. Lastly, though no class or occupation lays claim to any particular style or article of dress, legists, writers, imams, and others connected with the service of the mosques, generally affect greater amplitude and less variety of colour in their turbans and vestments than other people.

In person the Arabs are a remarkably handsome race,— tall, lithe, well-formed, dark-eyed, and dark-haired. Deformed individuals or dwarfs are rare among them; nor, except leprosy, of which frequent instances may be met with throughout the peninsula, does any disease seem to be hereditary among them. The frequency of ophthalmia, though not in the virulent Egyptian form, is evidently attributable to the nature of the soil and the climate. They are scrupulously clean in their persons, adding to the prescribed ablutions of the Mahometan code frequent supererogatory washings of their own; and take special care of their teeth, which are generally fine, though toothache is by no means unknown in Arabia. Simple and abstemious in their habits, they often reach an extreme yet healthy old age; nor is it common among them for the faculties of the mind to give way sooner than those of the body. To sum up, physically and morally they yield to few races, if any, of mankind; mentally, they surpass most, and are only kept back in the march of common progress by the remarkable defect of organising power and incapacity for combined action which they share with many other nations of the East, and some, it would seem, of the West also. Lax and imperfect as are their forms of government, it is with impatience that even these are borne; and we have already seen that of the four caliphs who alone reigned—if reign theirs could be called—in Arabia proper, three died a violent death; and of the Wahhabee princes, the most genuine representatives in later times of pure Arab rule, almost all have met the same fate.

Of the revenues of Arabia it would be difficult to form anything like a correct estimate. Palgrave has stated the yearly receipts of the Nejdean treasury, inclusive of the tribute then (1862) paid into it by Bahreyn and the west of Oman, to be nearly £106,000 sterling—no very large sum.

The revenues of Oman itself, then in a comparatively prosperous condition, are estimated by the same author at nearly ten times the amount, but may possibly have been overrated by him, as those of Yemen were perhaps by Niebuhr. Certainly the general condition of these provinces—the restricted character of the cultivation and the evident poverty (not absolute want, indeed, for that is rare) of the greater number of the inhabitants—do not convey to the visitor the idea of large national wealth or extensive resources. There can, however, be no doubt that both the coast districts of Arabia, in their varied and valuable products, and the central plateau, with its palmgroves, well irrigation, and wide pasture-lands, might, under a judicious administration, become the sources of much greater revenues, both public and private, than is now the case. The mines, too, in the metamorphic districts of Yemen and Oman, remain yet to be properly worked. As for the desert proper, which, as we have seen, occupies about one-third of the peninsula, it must, like the ocean of Childe Harold, remain what it is to the end of time.

In the 7th century Arabia sent forth armies that attacked and conquered nearly half the then known world. But the secret of her conquests lay not in the number of her warriors, but in a resolute purpose, a unity of aim, and an enthusiasm which concentrated in itself and intensified every motive of human action. In later ages she has been reduced to the defensive, and has shown herself not always equal even to that: witness her conquest by the Turks in the 16th, and by the Egyptians in the present century. Once only, at the moment when Wahhabee union and zeal half restored for a few years the energy of early Islam, did her armies go forth to invade the neighbouring territories of Mesopotamia and Syria; but it was to plunder rather than to conquer, and the results lasted no longer than the invasions themselves.

Yet on the defensive Arabia had much in her favour, and that from many causes. The first is, that there is little to defend, since, the coast of Yemen and the districts of Bahreyn and Oman excepted, there is very little to excite the cupidity of an invading, and nothing to satisfy the exigencies of an occupying force. The second is, that the mountainous nature of Yemen and Oman themselves, and the narrowness of their labyrinthine defiles added to [9:2:253] the extreme heat of the climate, and the scarcity of available provisions, would make even those provinces hard to attack, harder to retain. A third cause is in the broad strips of desert that gird the central districts as with a moat of sand, and send long arms of barrenness here and there into the heart of the cultivated or pastoral regions, so as to render military operations on a large scale in the interior almost impossible. A fourth and a very serious obstacle to invasion is the character of the inhabitants. Personal courage, wonderful endurance of privation, fixity of purpose, and a contempt of death rare even in the bravest Europeans, are qualities common to almost every race, tribe, and clan that compose the Arab nation; and though their undisciplined troops are unfitted to meet a better trained enemy in a regular battle, in skirmishing and harassing they have few equals, while at close quarters their individual impetuosity often disconcerts the more mechanical fortitude of organised regiments. To this our own troops gave testimony in the engagements of Shenaz, 1810, and of Ras-el-Hadd, 1819 and 1820, when, with swords and spears alone, the Arabs of Oman maintained a desperate struggle against guns and bayonets, neither giving nor receiving quarter. Nor are they wholly ignorant of tactics, their armies, when engaged in regular war, being divided into centre and wings, with skirmishers in front, and a reserve behind, often screened at the outset of the engagement by the camels of the expedition. These animals, kneeling, and ranged in long parallel rows, form a sort of entrenchment, from behind which the soldiers of the main body fire their matchlocks, while the front divisions, opening out, act on either flank of the enemy. This arrangement of troops may be traced in Arab records as far back as the 5th century, and has often been exemρhfied during the Wahhabee wars in our own day.

The military contingent of Nejd, including that of all the adjoining provinces that constitute central Arabia, Jebel Shomer excepted, is reckoned by Palgrave at 47,300 from among the settled, and at about 8000 from among the nomade inhabitants. That of Shomer is estimated by the same authority at 14,000 of the first, and at about 16,000 of the second category. Oman, including the neighbouring and allied districts, is said to supply about 112,000, all from towns or villages.

We thus obtain a total of about 197,300 fighting men for what represents a full half of the Arab peninsula. If, therefore, we calculate the entire military force of the land from Suez to Aden, and from the Red Sea to the Indian Ocean, at 400,000 fighting men, we shall probably be not far from the truth. But while remembering, on the one hand, that this is no standing army, nor composed of regular and disciplined soldiers, it should not be forgotten that, in case of invasion, their energy, and, it may be, their numbers, would be doubled by the enthusiasm of patriotism; and that not every male only, but every woman would, in the excitement of the struggle, take part in the national defence.

Indeed, at all times Arab women have distinguished themselves by their bravery hardly less than Arab men. Records of armed heroines occur frequently in the chronicles or myths of the pre-Islamitic time; and in authentic history the Battle of the Camel, 656 a.d., where Ayeshah, the wife of Mahomet, headed the charge, is only the first of a number of instances in which Arab amazons have taken, sword in hand, no inconsiderable share in the wars and victories of Islam. Even now it is the custom for an Arab force to be always accompanied by some courageous maiden, who, mounted on a blackened camel, leads the onslaught, singing verses of encouragement for her own, of insult for the opposing tribe. Round her litter the fiercest of the battle rages, and her capture or death is the signal of utter rout; it is hers also to head the triumph after the victory of her clan.

There is little education, in our sense of the word, in Arabia. Among the Bedouins there are, of course, no schools, and few, even of the most elementary character, in the towns or villages. Where they exist, little beyond the mechanical reading of the Koran, and the equally mechanical learning of it by rote, is taught. On the other haud, Arab male children, brought up from early years among the grown-up men of the house or tent, learn more from their own parents and at home than is common in other countries; reading and writing are in most instances thus acquired, or rather transmitted; besides such general principles of grammar and eloquence, often of poetry and history, as the elders themselves may be able to impart. To this family schooling too are due the good manners, politeness, and self-restraint that early distinguish Arab children. In the very few instances where a public school of a higher class exists, writing, grammar, and rhetoric sum up its teachings. Law and theology, in the narrow sense that both these words have in the Islamitic system, are explained in afternoon lectures given in most mosques; and some verses of the Koran, with one of the accepted commentaries, that of El-Beidawee for example, form the basis of the instruction.

(jreat attention is paid to accuracy of grammar and purity of diction throughout Arabia; yet something of a dialectic difference may be observed in the various districts. The purest Arabic, that which is as nearly as possible identical in the choice of words and in its inflections with the language of the Koran, is spoken in Nejd, and the best again of that in the province of Sedeyr. Next in purity comes the Arabic of Shomer. Throughout the Hejaz in general, the language, though extremely elegant, is not equally correct; in Hasa, Bahreyn, and Oman, it is decidedly influenced by the foreign element called Naba-thaean, that removes it still further from its original character. In Yemen, as in other southern districts of the peninsula, Arabic merges by insensible degrees into the Himyaritic or African dialect of Hadramaut and Mahrah. The Arabic spoken by the nomade or Bedouin tribes, especially those of the north, is tolerably correct, but the pronunciation is often inexact.

The principal territorial divisions of Arabia have been already indicated, but a detailed list may here not be out of place. They are, accordingly, on the western side—

The Hejaz, subject in great measure to Ottoman authority, and extending from 28° to 21° N. lat. Its principal towns aie Yambo and JiDDAHonthe sea-coast, Medinah and Mecca in the interior; all of which are separately described in the articles under these headings. The inhabitants are partly nomade, partly settled, in about equal proportions. The Hejaz includes the Beled-el-Haram, of sacred territory, immediately adjoining Mecca; and the Tâif, a mountainous but fertile district to the S. E. of that town.

Jebel Aseer, a mountainous tract along the coast immediately south of the Hejaz. Its inhabitants are of the Wahhabee sect, and are governed by their own sheykhs, with an emeer residing at Kolakh, the principal town or rather village of the region. The Turks have lately invaded it, but to no great purpose.

Aboo Areesh, along the coast, from 17° 40' to 15° 50' N. lat. This . district, now occupied by the Turks, detached itself from Yemen . about a century ago. Its inhabitants live in villages: the soil is poor, but the fisheries abundant. o t

Tehamah. This name is given to the shore strip from 15 50 to ' Aden, 12° 47' N. lat. Its principal towns are Loheya, Hodeydeh, and Mokha; the two former of these are seaports, of 4000 or 5000 souls each; the last is celebrated for its export of coffee, but its population does not exceed 8000 souls at most. There are numerous fishing villages along the coast, and some inland hamlets; the district is now partially occupied by the Turks. . ,. , . , ,

Yemen. Under this title are included thirty mountain districts, dependent on the “imam” or prince of Yemen, who resides at Sanaa, the capital, a town which is said, in the extent of its edifices and gardens, to have once rivalled Damascus, but which at present scarcely contains 20,000 inhabitants. It is surrounded by turreted walls, with seven gates: the mosques, public baths, and market-n[9:2:254] 1 ace are all modern. Inland there are several small independent states, accurately enumerated by Nιebuhη t ^ e A bes A or only authority for what regards this part of Arabia In extent Yemen constitutes about one-tenth of the superficies of the peninsula. It is thickly peopled throughout, with countless villages; the nomades are few in number. It has been recently invaded by the Turks.

Jowf, a large oasis in the desert, adjoining Yemen on the east. It contains the ancient capital of south Arabia, Mareb, with the ruins of the famous dyke that bears its name, besides many villages. The inhabitants are warlike; the country is said to be fruitful, but little is known of it with certainty, nor has any European ever visited it.

Nejran, an independent province on the north-east of Yemen. It is fertile and thickly peopled; the inhabitants are mostly villagers, and belong to a sect allied to that of the Beyadees in Oman. The principal town, situated on the highroad of Sanaa, bears the same name as the district.

Kalâat-Bisha, Shahran, Kahtan, Taslees, Belad-el-Kobeyel, and others—small districts, each governed by its own shβykh, except the last named, of λvhich the inhabitants are chiefly nomade; the others are agricultural. They are situated to the east and north of Yemen, on the confines of Nejd.

Hadramaut, an extensive region, occupying the south-east coast and inland. Niebuhr, our best authority for this part of Arabia, as for Yemen, describes it as being divided into several small principalities, of which Shibam on the south, and Ainad further north, are the chief. The only towns really known are Dafar and Kesheen, ports of the coast; they are both small and unimportant. The inhabitants are all governed by their own chiefs. Of their race and language mention has been made before; their mode of life is partly nomade, partly settled.

Mahrah, a continuation of Hadramaut northwards, up to Ras-el-Hadd. Its inhabitants, who appear to be the least civilised among all the Arab races, pay an irregular allegiance to the sultan of Oman: The country is said to be sandy, and thinly peopled; the Bedouin tribes of Al-Morrah and Aboo-Alse frequent its pasturages.

Returning inland, we find the north and centre of Arabia thus divided :—

Jowf, an oasis south of the Syrian frontier. It contains seven principal and some smaller villages. The population is set down at 40,000 souls; they are governed by an emeer, who depends on the prince of Shomer.

Teyma, a thinly-peopled district west of Jowf. Its inhabitants are mostly. Bedouin, and each clan obeys its own sheykh. The total population is 12,000.

Kheybar, a collection of small villages and encampments on the north-west of the Hejaz; several of the tribes inhabiting it are of Jewish origin. The population is given at 25,000.

Jebel Shomer, an important province, including the mountain ranges of Aja and Solma south of Jowf. Its capital, Hayel, stands on the highroad between Bosrah and Medinah; it possesses a public market-place, and may contain about 15,000 or 16,000 souls. The villages of the province are forty; the total population 162,000, who are given to agricultural and pastoral pursuits in about equal proportions. The emeer or prince is hereditary, and allied with, though not dependent on, the government of Nejd.

Upper Kaseem, an oblong strip of land, lying between the mountains of Shomer and the valley of Lower Kaseem, which latter belongs to Nejd. The soil is sandy, but not unfertile. It contains about twenty villages, besides many hamlets. The population is stated at 35,000. This district is subject to the emeer of Shomer.

The principal Bedouin tribes of this part of Arabia are the Shomer, who indeed have given their name to the province; the Sherarat; the Howeytat; the Benoo-Ateeyah; the Maaz; the Téy, a very ancient and famous tribe, of southern origin, whose emigration hither dates from many centuries before Mahomet; and the Wah-hideyah. The total population is estimated at 166,000 souls; but this does not include the Bedouins of Teyma and Kheybar, who together, it is said, muster an equal number.

There remains Nejd, a name including the whole central inhabitable district of Arabia, and which is divided into nine provinces. They are as follows :—

Ared, the centre province, in which the present Wahhabee capital, Riad, is situated. The town is very ancient, and has a population of 30,000. It possesses a palace, where the sultan of Nejd resides, and many other considerable buildings. The fortifications are extensive, but of unbaked brick only, as are also the dwellings of the town; near Riad may still be seen the mins of the ancient capital, Dereyéeah, demolished by Ibrahim Pasha in 1817. Besides Riad, Ared contains many villages so large as to merit the name of towns; the land is generally fertile, cultivation abounds, and the total population exceeds, it is said, 100,000. v .

Sedeyr, an extensive province, north of Ared, and situated in the highlands. of the Toweyk mountain chain. Its principal town, Mejmaa, is fortified, Arab fashion; the ancient towns, Jelajib, Toweym, and others are situated here. The number of large villages is twenty-five; the entire population is 140,000. They are a brave and intelligent race, and furnish the choicest contingent to the Wahhabee armies.

Yemamah, a fertile district, south of Ared, celebrated in all ages of Arab history for the bravery of its men and the beauty of its women. It forms an important part of the Wahhabee empire. Its principal town is Manfoohah; but it includes many others, such as Khorj, the neighbourhood of which, from its fertility, is called the paradise of Nejd; the number of inhabitants is said to equal that of Sedeyr.

Hareek, a mountainous oasis on the extreme southern verge of Nejd, at the commencement of the great desert, or Dahnâ. Principal town, Hootah. The inhabitants are all zealous Wahhabees; their number is stated at 14,000. The villages are 16 in number.

Aflaj, a small and hilly district south-west of Ared. The inhabitants are Wahhabees, and number 16,000; the villages, of which Kharfah is the chief, are twelve in all.

Wadi Dowasir, a long shallow valley, reaching down from Aflaj in the direction of Yemen; the soil is sandy and unproductive. It contains fifty small villages, besides hamlets, and the population is estimated at 100,000, all Wahhabees. They have a bad reputation for illiberality and meanness of disposition.

Soleyel, also a Wahhabee province. It forms the junction between Wadi Dowasir and Yemen; its principal town bears the same name as the district. Its villages are given at twenty-five, its inhabitants at 30,000.

Woshem, a small, compact, but important district west of Ared, of which it is the key. Its principal town, Doramah, offered a determined resistance to Ibraham Pasha in 1817. Here, too, is Shakrah, a large commercial centre; Kowéy, near which was fought the decisive battle between the Egyptian and Wahhabee troops; and other villages, twenty in all. Inhabitants, 80,000, all Wahhabees. The country is well supplied with water, and the ground productive.

Kaseem, a wide fertile valley west of Woshem, and belonging to the Wahhabee government. It possesses three large towns—Onezzah, Bereydah, and Rass—besides about 60 villages and numerous hamlets. The inhabitants are a busy and thriving, but not a very warlike race; they are computed at 300,000. These districts constitute Nejd proper, and form the bulk of the present Wahhabee monarchy.

Coming now to the east coast, we find Hasa, a large province occupying almost the whole region conterminous with the upper half of the Persian Gulf. Its principal town, Hofhoof, possesses a remarkable fortress, said to be of Karmathian construction, besides a large market-place and several handsome buildings. Close by is the more modern town of Mebarrez, almost equalling the capital itself in size. The province is in general well-watered and fertile; the number of villages about fifty, that of the population 160,000. This region belongs to the Wahhabee government, but has lately been occupied by the Turks.

Kateef, a small, marshy, but fertile district on the shores of the Persian Gulf, directly opposite to Bahreyn. It belongs, like Hasa, to the Wahhabees; the principal town, also called Kateef, was once the residence of the dreaded Karmathian princes. The climate is unhealthy; the population is estimated at about 100, 000 souls.

The most considerable nomade tribes in this district are the Ajman, Benoo-Hajr, Benoo-Khalid, Meteyr, Oteybah, Sebaâ, Kahtan, Harb (a numerous and warlike clan), Anezeh, and Al-morrah. Their whole number does not probably exceed 80,000; the nomade population of central Arabia bearing no proportion to the settled, whereas a reverse condition exists on the northern frontier, and above all in the Syrian desert.

Continuing our review of the eastern districts, we next find—

Bahreyn, a name given to the two large islands of Menameh and Moharrek, both celebrated for pearl fisheries off their shores. They are governed by a chief of their own, of the family name of Khaleefah; but pay an uncertain allegiance, sometimes to the government of Baghdad, sometimes to that of Oman. Numerous villages cover the islands, of which the soil is fertile; but the chief resources of the inhabitants are maritime and commercial. Population, 70,000.

Katar, the pearl-fishery coast east of Hasa. Its inhabitants, said to be 135,000 in number, find an almost exclusive occupation in the pearl trade; inland the region is barren and desert. This province depends on the chiefs of Bahreyn, but it also pays tribute to Oman.

Sharjah, a coast strip, with a seaport of the same name, east of Katar. It belongs to Oman, but has been often occupied by the Wahhabees. Sharjah is a great depot for slaves brought from the east African coast; the inhabitants are mostly concerned in the trade. The province counts thirty-five villages and 85,000 inhabitants. The present governor, Khalid-ebn-Sakar, whose authority also extends over the two next districts, is almost independent of the sultan of Mascat.

Roos-el-Jebal, also known as the Jowasimah, or Private Coast. The chief village, Râs-el-Kheymah, was destroyed by the English in 1810, and again in 1819; although since rebuilt, it has ceased to be [9:2:255] a nest of robbers. This coast is very mountainous, and the inhabitants, mostly Wahhabees, are savage in the extreme. Their number is said not to exceed 10,000; they speak a dialect of their own, almost unintelligible to the Arabs of the neighbourhood.

Kalhat, the coast region east of Cape Mesandom. Its principal village is the small seaport of Leemah; the other hamlets are about forty in number. The population, a rough seafaring set, is stated at 60,000.

Batineh. This district includes the whole plain between the mountains of Oman and the sea-coast as far as Ras-Heyran, east of Mascat. It is the richest, best-watered, and most thickly populated in all Arabia, and contains several considerable towτιs, of which Mascat is the chief; and where the sultan, or, as he is sometimes called, imam, of Oman resides. The other principal towns are Matrah, Barkah, Sohar, and Shcnaz, all seaports of some activity along the coast; more than seventy other small towns and villages are reported to be scattered through the interior. The population, all Biadeeyah, and mortal enemies of the Arabs of Neid, is said to be 700,000.

Dahirah, the north-western province of Oman, having for its principal town that of Bereymah, besides several places of less importance. It is the only district where the nomade population nears any proportion to the settled: the total population is given at 80,000. The Wahhabees of Nejd have often occupied and still continue to harass this part of the country.

Jebel Akhdar. This province, including the great fertile and well-peopled chain of the “Green Mountains,” is to the kingdom of Oman what the province of Ared is to that of Nejd, the backbone of the land. Here are the two towns of Nejwah and Bahhileh, formerly residences of the sultan; besides Zekee, Minah, and about seventy villages. The inhabitants are warlike, the women stately and beautiful; all belong to the sect of the Biadeeyah. The population is stated at about 600,000.

• Belad Soor, a coast district, said to be moderately fertile from Mascat to Ras-el-Hadd. The port of Soor is the only place of any note, but several small villages are said to exist near the coast. Population about 100,000; among them are the Benoo-Aboo-Alee Arabs, famous for their brave resistance to our own troops in 1819-20.

Lastly, Jaylan, a wild region of which little is known, except that the inhabitants are uncivilised, and resemble in all respects those of Mahrah, with which province theirs is conterminous.

The entire population of Arabia proper has been variously estimated; some authors make it reach 12,000,000, others reduce it to 7,000,000. Taking the approximate statistics above given, we find for the whole of central Arabia, including Jowf, Shomer, and Nejd, about 1,500,000 settled inhabitants, with 500,000 Bedouins or nomades; thus 2,000,000 may perhaps fairly represent the complete number. The east coast--Hasa, Bahreyn, Oman, and their adjoining districts—furnishes 2,500,000 more. Yemen is said to contain over 1,000,000: Hadramaut and Mahrah cannot be very populous: the Hejaz certainly is not. 3,000,000 is the maximum estimate of both taken together, nomades or villagers. To these must be added the tribes of the Sinaitic peninsula, and of the northern frontier. These, may possibly bring the sum of the Arab population to 8,500,000, or even 9,000,000, with a quota of about one-fifth Bedouin to four-fifths of settled Arabs; to such small numerical proportions has the nation shrunk that once ruled by land and sea from the Indus to the Atlantic, and that even now, by its religion and institutions, gives the law to one-eighth of the human race.

The history of Arabia and its inhabitants naturally divides itself into two distinct and even dissimilar periods, that, namely, which preceded the era of Mahomet, and that which followed it. Each of these two periods, though comprising in its extent several minor phases and fluctuations, now of advance, now of retrogression, bears, however, a well-marked general character of its own. The first of the two periods is distinguished as one of local monarchies and federal governments; the latter commences with theocratic centralisation dissolving into general anarchy.

The unrestrained imagination of Arab chroniclers has indeed added to their annals a third or pre-historic tract, peopled with heroes and giants, men of renown, sons of Anak, much resembUng thoso who figιιre in early Jewish records, and, it may be not unfairly presumed, of analogous authenticity. To such belong the fabulous tribes of ’Ad in the south, of Thamood in the north, anil of Tasm and Jadis in the oentre of the peninsula. Very gorgeous are the descriptions given of “Irem,” the “city of pillars,” as the Koran styles it, supposed to have been erected by Shedad, the latest despot of ’Ad, in the regions of Hadramaut; and which yet, after the annihilation of its tenants, remains entire, so Arabs say, invisible to ordinary eyes, but occasionally, and at rare intervals, revealed to some heaven-favoured traveller. Vague reports of the colossal ruins of Egyptian Thebes and Karnak probably originated the fancy. To Thamood are ascribed the more substantial traces of rock excavations in the north-western Hejaz; while Tasm and Jadis are described as more scenite or Bedouin-like in their manners and mode of living. Mahometan tradition, a mere travestie of the Jewish, and mostly derived from rabbinical sources, has attempted to construct a pseudo-genealogy of a Noachian character for every one of these imaginary or vanished clans. Further yet, it has, in its eagerness to find a confirmation of its own central idea, everywhere ascribed their extinction to supernatural wrath, brought down on them, now by the rejection of some apocryphal prophet of the Divine Unity, now by atrocious misdeeds like those recorded of the inhabitants of Canaan or the Cities of the Plain. The sober historian, however, will, in the absence of any reliable evidence, documentary or monumental, abstain from pronouncing either on the character of these aboriginal tribes, or on the manner and causes of their disappearance.

The first dawning gleams of anything that deserves to be called history disclose Arabia wholly, or nearly so, under the rule of a race of southern origin; the genuine, or, as they are sometimes termed from a mythical ancestor Kahtan, the Kahtanee Arabs. These, again, we find subdivided into several aristocratic monarchical governments, arranged so as to form a broad framework or rim round the central wilds of the peninsula.

Oldest and chiefest among the Arab monarchies was that of Yemen; its regal residence is said to have been in the now abandoned town of Mareb, in the extreme south. After a devastating inundation, referred with some probability to the first centuιy of the Christian era, the seat of government was removed from the ruins of Mareb to Sanaa, a city which has continued the metropolis of Yemen to the present day. The Yemenite kings, descendants of Kahtan and Himyar “the dusky,” a name denoting African origin, and each adorned with the reiterated surname of “Tobba,” a word of African etymology, and signifying “powerful,” are said to have reigned, with a few dynastic interruptions and palace revolutions, for about 2500 years; dining which long period they commanded the direct obedience of the entire southern half of the peninsula; while, by their tribute-collectors, and by chiefs of kindred or delegated authority, they indirectly governed the northern. One of these monarchs is asserted, though historical criticism will hardly admit the assertion for fact, to have subdued the whole of central Asia, and even to have reached the boundaries of China; while another anticipated, so runs the story, the later and more authentic conquests of his race on the north African continent. In both these cases Arab chroniclers seem to have appropriated for their own rulers, not without some additional exaggerations, the glories and exploits of the Egyptian kings. But that theirs was a vigorous and in some respects a civilised government, is attested alike by the literary and architectural relics of their time. Their sovereignty was at last overthrown, 529 a.d., by an Abyssinian invasion, and was re-established 603 a.d. as a dependency of the Persian empire, till in the year 634 it was finally absorbed by Mahometan conquest

Next in importance to the kingdom of Yemen came the subsidiary monarchy of Hira, or, more correctly, Heerah, situated in the northeasterly province of Arabian Irak. Its kings, a collateral branch of the royal race of Sanaa, governed the western shore of the lower Euphrates, from the neighbourhood of Babylon down to the confines of Nejd, and along the coast of the Persian Gulf. The duration of their empire, founded in the second century after Christ, was 424 years. This kingdom paid an uncertain allegiance to their more powerful neighbours, the Persian despots; and from time to time exercised considerable influence over the turbulent tribes of Central Arabia, till, like Yemen, it sank before the rising fortunes of Mahomet and his followers.

A third monarchy, that of Ghassan, lorded it on the north-west over lower Syria and the Hejaz: its independence was somewhat tempered by unequal alliances with the Homan, and subsequently the Byzantine empire. It was founded in the first century of tho Christian era, shortly after the flood of Mareb; and its duration, till subdued by the all-conquering prophet, exceeded 600 years.

A fourth government, that of Kindeh, detached itself from Irak] early in the fifth century, and united under its sceptre the tribes of] northerly Nejd and even those of Oman, for about 160 years. Its kings were, like those before mentioned, of Yemenite origin; but their rule was weak and disturbed by frequent wars.

Much has been written by Arab authors regarding the great inundation, as they term it, of Arem or Mareb, possibly a tropical cyclone of more than ordinary destructiveness, like that of 1867 in the West Indies; and this event they love to assignas the proximate cause which dispersed the families of Yemen over northern Arabia, and led to the foundation of the kingdoms of Irak and Ghassan. But the reality of the events, physical or political, symbolised by the [9:2:256] “flood of Arem,” a counterpart, after its fashion, of the biblical flood, cannot now be well deciphered. . 1 . , ,

This is however, certain, that the Yemenite Arabs, and especially those who tenanted the south of the peninsula, had during the period now cursorily sketched, attained a very fair degree of civilisation · that arts and commerce flourished, that wealth was accumu-late⅛ literature cultivated, and talent held in esteem. On all these points we have not only the uncertain and distorted testimony of foreign authors, such as Strabo, Pliny, Diodorus, Ptolemy, and the like, but the more positive though fragmentary evidence afforded by the national writings, chiefly verse, that have survived to our day. In its general character and institutions the kingdom of Yemen seems to have borne a considerable resemblance to the neighbouring one of the Nile valley, on the other side of the Red Sea, and, like it, to have reached at a very early epoch a relatively high degree of prosperity and social culture, from which, however, it had long declined before its final extinction in the 7th century. But the daughter-kingdom of Hira had, as was natural, something of a Persian tinge; while that of Ghassan took a more Byzantine colouring. Lastly, the nomadic element predominated in the ill-cemented monarchy of Kindeh.

But while the sceptre of Yemen was yet, in one form or other, outstretched over the length and breadth of the land, and its children, the genuine or African Arabs, formed a complete and dense circle of population all around, the centre of Arabia remained the stronghold of a different though kindred race, composed of tribes almost wholly scenite, in their mode of living wild and ferocious; less susceptible of culture, but gifted with greater energy and concentration of purpose than their southern cousins. The latest recorded emigration of this branch of the Arab stock had been not from the south but the north; and instead of the mythical Kahtan, they claimed a no less mythical Adnan, or his supposed grandson Nezar, for their ancestor; their language, though radically identical with that spoken by the genuine Arabs, was yet dialectically different in several respects, and nearer to the Syriac or Hebrew. Lastly, unlike the Arabs of the south, they had little disposition for agriculture, and even less for architecture and the fine arts; their instincts leading them to a pastoral and consequently a nomade life. The almost infinite ramifications of these “Mustareb” or ‘ ‘ adscititious Arab” tribes lead ultimately up to five principal stocks. These were Rabeéah, which, however, laid some claim to a Yemenite kinsmanship in the east centre of the peninsula; Koreysh, on the west; Keys, or Keys-Eylan, and Hawazin, on the north; and Γameem in the middle.

History has left unrecorded the exact date of their arrival in Arabia; nor has she defined the period during which they remained tributaries, though often refractory, of the kings of Yemen. But in the 5th century of the Christian era there appeared among the Mustareb tribes a leader of extraordinary talent and energy named Koleyb, sprung from the tribe of Rabeéah, who having, in the fashion of William Tell, slain with his own hand the insolent and licentious tax-gatherer sent them from Sanaa, raised the banner of general revolt in Nejd; and, in the battle of Hazaz, 500 a.d., broke for ever the bonds of Yemen from off the neck of the northern or scenite Arabs. This done, Koleyb aspired to unite his countrymen into one vast confederacy, over which he himself exercised for a time an almost kingly power; but the scheme was prematurely broken off by his own assassination. Left now without a master, but also without a ruler, the “Mustareb” tribes found themselves involved in a series of wars that lasted during the whole of the 6th century, their heroic period. Yet in spite of severe losses sustained in battie by this or that particular clan, their power as a whole went on increasing, till at t⅛e dawn of the 7th century they had wholly absorbed the feeble kingdom of Kindeh, and encroached yearly more and more on the narrowing bounds of Yemen, Irak, and Ghassan. Nor, probably, would they have stayed till they had become absolute lords over the whole, or nearly the whole, of the peninsula, had there not developed itself from among themselves a still more energetic element which, before many years had passed, reduced both northern and southern Arabs alike to common obedience, then raised them to an unexpected height of common glory, and at last plunged them, along with itself, into one comprehensive decline and ruin. This new and potent element was the well-known clan of Fihr or Koreysh. Its families, of Mustareb descent, had at an early period, which subsequent and Mahometan chroniclers have tried to identify with the fortunes of the mythical Ismael, established themselves in the southerly Hejaz, near the town of Mecca, a locality even then the principal religious and commercial centre of Arabia. Already, at the beginning of the 5th century, the chiefs of Koreysh had, by a mixture of violence and craft very characteristic of their race, rendered themselves the masters and the acknowledged guardians of the sacred “Kâabeh.” This square stone temple, or rather shrine, itself of unknown antiquity, was situated within the precincts of the town of Mecca; and to it the Arabs were in the habit of bringing yearly offerings, and of making devout pilgrimages, for centuries before Mahomet had adopted it into the new ritual of Islam as the house of the true God. The keys of the consecrated building had originally been in possession of delegates appointed by the monarch of Yemen, but the Koreysh Arabs, having once obtained them, held them fast for ever after, and successfully repelled every effort, both of their own pagan competitors and of the invading Christian Abyssinians, 570 a.d., to recapture or to seize them. Their possession of the temple-keys not only gave the tribe of Koreysh a semi-religious pre-eminence over all the other clans of Arabia, but also placed at their disposal the treasures of gold, silver, jewels, and other offerings accumulated by the pagan piety of ages in the temple of Mecca.

A more important, as also a more creditable, source of wealth to the Koreysh clan was their Red Sea coast traffic, particularly with the ports of Yemen and Abyssinia. Jiddah has been always the chief westerly seaport, and Mecca, which is only a few leagues distant, the principal inland emporium of Arab trade; and under the dominating influence of the clever and active merchants of Koreysh, both places acquired special prosperity and importance.

Lastly, only a day’s journey distant from Mecca, was held, in the pre-Islamitic times, the great yearly fair and gathering of Okad, so called from the name of the plain where it used to assemble,—a national meeting, frequented by men of all conditions, from all quarters of the Arab peninsula, and lasting through the entire month of Dhoo-l-kaadeh, which in pagan, as subsequently in Mahometan reckoning, immediately preceded the ceremonies of the annual pilgrimage. Here horse-races, athletic games, poetical recitals, and every kind of public amusement, diversified the more serious commercial transactions of an open fair, that, in its comprehensiveness, almost assumed the proportions of a national exhibition; here, too, matters of the highest import, questions of peace and war, of treaty and alliance, of justice and revenge, were habitually treated by the chiefs of the northern Arabs; the “children of Mezar,” to give them their favourite “Mustareb” patronymic, assembled in a sort of amphictyonie council, not less ancient, but, while it lasted, much more influential throughout Arabia than that of Thebes ever had been in classic Hellas. In this assembly the immediate local proximity of the Koreysh chiefs, joined to their personal wealth, courage, and address, assigned them a predominant position.

Of their pedigree, which, as is well known, includes that of Mahomet himself, ¼ r e have a carefully—too carefully, indeed, for authenticity—constructed chronicle, bringing the family tree up in due form to Ishmael, the son of Abraham, of whom the Koreysh figure as the direct descendants. In the same artificial annals the Yemenite or genuine Arabs appear under the cousinly character of the children of Joktan, the son of Heber. On these points all Mahometan annalists are equally positive and distinct; all other Arab testimony equally adverse or silent. That a fable so utterly defiant of reasonable chronology, and even of the common sense of history itself, should have been adopted as matter of fact by Arab vanity and ignorance, is less surprising than that it should have found favour in the eyes of not a few, indeed of most, of our own European writers. Enough here to say that Mahometan chroniclers, by adopting as irrefragrable historical authoιity the Jewish records, and then retouching them here and there in accordance with their own special predictions and tenets, have succeeded in concealing the truth of their own national identity and story from themselves and even from others, under an almost hopeless incrustation of childish fiction. A correcter version of Arab history and pedigree will, so far as possible, be given towards the end of the present article. To sum up, at the opening of the 7th century of our era, and coincidently with the first appearance of the prophetic autocrat and destined remodeller of Arabia, the overteeming ħfe and energy of the great peninsula was, broadly taken, thus divided :—Foremost stood the tribe of Koreysh, with their allies, a powerful confederacy composed of tribes belonging to the Mustareb or northern stock, and occupying the upper half of the westerly coast and region. Next in importance came the countless independent and, thus far, uncentralised clans of the centre of the peninsula; they, too, mostly are of Mustareb origin, though a few claimed the more ancient and aristocratic kinsmanship of Yemen; but without, however, paying any allegiance to its rulers. Lastly, to the south, east, and north, still existed the noble but enfeebled relics of the old Yemenite kingdoms of Sanaa, Hira, and Ghassan, half-sunk into Persian or Byzantine vassalage, and exerting little authority, even within their own ancestral limits.

But, however important to the country itself and in their ultimate results to the world at large, might be the events that took place within Arabia during the pre-Islamitic epoch, they had small bearing on the nations outside the peninsula. The Yemenite queen of Sheba’s ambassage to Solomon, even if an historical event, led at least to no historical results; and with other coeval rulers and nationalities, Greek, Persian, and Macedonian, the Arabs rarely came into any other contact than that of distant and desultory traffic. Nor do the frontier skirmishes by which an Antigonus or a Ptolemy attempted, without success, to gain a footing in Arabia, deserve more than a passing notice; and Pompey him seif, victorious elsewhere, was foiled on its frontiers.

At last, during the reign of Augustus, Aelius Gallus, the Roman [9:2:257] prefect of Egypt, undertook a military expedition against Yemen itself, with the -view of annexing that region, which report enriched with immense treasures, to the Roman empire. With an army composed of 10,000 Roman infantry, 500 Jews, and 1000 Naba-theans, he crossed the Red Sea in 210 galleys, and landed at Moilah, or Leuce Come, in 25° N. lat., near the modern Yambo. After some delay, the consequence of disease and disorganisation among his troops, he marched southward until he reached the inland district and city of Nejran, on the nearer frontier of Yemen. The town of Nejran he is said to have taken by assault, as well as a few neighbouring places, probably mere villages, of little note. Meanwhile a large force of Arabs had assembled to oppose him, but Gallus easily defeated them, and advanced to Mareb itself, then, we may suppose, the capital of Yemen. But the Roman soldiers, unaccustomed to the heat of the tropical climate, and much reduced in numbers, were incapable of laying siege to that town; and their general found himself thus forced to retreat, and recrossed the sea to Egypt without having effected any permanent settlement on the Arab side. Later attempts made by Roman governors or generals under Trajan and Severus were restricted to the neighbourhood of the Syrian frontier; and the ruined cities of Bosrah and Petra yet indicate the landmarks of the extreme southerly limits reached by imperial dominion over Arab territory.

More serious, and more lasting in its consequences, was the great Abyssinian invasion of Yemen in 529, when Aryat, son or lieutenant of the king of Abyssinia, landed in Aden with an army of 70,000 men, to avenge his co-religionists, the Christians, who had been cruelly persecuted by Dhow-Nowas, king of Yemen, himself a proselyte to, and an ardent propagator of, the Jewish code. The expedition was successful; Dhow-Nowas perished; Christianity was proclaimed; and for seventy-six years the Ethiopian conquerors retained subject to their rule the southern and ricner half of the peninsula. Their king Abraha even advanced, in 569 a.d., the year of the birth of Mahomet, as far as Mecca; but beneath its walls suffered a repulse, which has been magnified by the Koran and Mahometan tradition into the proportions of a miracle. Persian assistance, furnished by the great Chosroes, ultimately enabled the Arabs under Seyf, son of Yezen, the last direct lineal descendant of the old kings of Sanaa, to liberate their territory from its dusky usurpers, 605 A.D.

The 7th century had now commenced, and before long the wonderful successes of Mahomet, or, in more correct orthography, Mohammed, 622-632 a.d., while they closed in one great centralising effort the era of Arab progress and development within the land, opened a marvellous phase of new activity and almost boundless extension without. The story of the great prophet and of his book, the obstacles he encountered and overcame, his labours, his reverses, his wars, his final and decisive success, belong to the separate article that bears his name. Here it may suffice to state that at his death, 632 a.d., the eleventh year of the Islamitic era of the Hejrah or flight, which he himself had founded, Mahomet left the entire Arab peninsula, with the sole and transient exception of the tribe of Tameem, and a few Yemenite clans, who for a short while preferred the revelations of his rival Moseylemah, the “false prophet” of Nejd, united under one sceptre, and in one creed.

After the disputes which might naturally be expected from a general election and turbulent electors, and which, fomented by the ambitious and intriguing Ali, nephew and son-in-law of the prophet, ran so high between the “Ansar,” or chiefs of Medinah, and the “Mohajireen,” or those of Mecca, as to threaten the premature disruption and extinction of the Islamitic empire, Abu-Bekr, father of Ayeshah, the favourite wife of Mahomet, was chosen to be the great man’s caliph,—“Khaleefah” is the Arab word— or successor. His reign lasted only two years; but it sufficed for the subjugation of the rebel tribes of Ncjd and Yemen, the conquest of Damascus, and the commencement of the long career of victory that carried the arms, the language, and the institutions of Arabia over half the old world, from the banks of the Indus to the shores of the Atlantic, and from the burning sands of the mid-African desert to the green vineyards of pleasant France. These events we will now pass in cursory review.

Syria, distracted by long sedition and the bitter rivalry of ecclesiastical sects, fell a first and comparatively easy prey to the hardy invaders. Led by Khaled, the boldest and most talented among the early Mahometan generals, the Arab troops occupied Bosrah, overran the region of Hauran, and advanced against Damascus. The Byzantine army hurriedly sent by the Greek emperor Heraclius to the relief of the besieged town, was defeated with tremendous slaughter on the plains of Lznadin, where fifty thousand men are said to have fallen on the Christian side alone; and Khaled, following up his victory, instantly invested the capital of southern Syria. After a seventy days’ siege, and in spite of the brave defence made by the Christian garrison under the leadership of Thomas the patrician, son-in-law of the emperor himself, Damascus was taken, half by storm, half by capitulation, on the 3d of August, 634 a.d., 13 a.h.; and amid all the vicissitudes of succeeding centuries has remained ever since, not only a Mahometan, but an Arab city.

Heraclius, who, unaware at first of the importance of the crisis, had hitherto remained almost inactive in Antioch, his north-Syrian residence and capital, now, roused to exertion, collected an army of 80,000 men, the greater number of whom, reinforced by 20,000 auxiliaries from among the Ghassanide Arabs, were led at first by the emperor himself, then by Manuel, a tried Byzantine general, to meet the ever-advancing Mahometans. These last, under the standard of Khaled, had already added Homs or Emesa, Baalbec or Heliopolis, and Hama, the Hamath of Scripture, to their list of conquests. They now fell back on a strong position behind the windings of the Yermook or Hieromax, a small stream issuing from the southern slopes of Mount Hermon, which now bears the name of Jebel-esh-Sheykh. The battle, in which Manuel took the offensive, Khaled the defensive part, raged for several days, and ended in the total defeat of the Greeks, 636 a.d., who are said to have lost upwards of 100,000 men, including Manuel himself, while at least 5000 of the victors remained on the field. Syria was now open to the Arabs; and Jerusalem, which, with the difficult and mountainous district of south-eastern Palestine, had hitherto been prudently neglected by Mahometan strategy,; capitulated, 637 a.d., to the caliph Omar, who, apprehensive lest Khaled, if left to himself in Syria, should establish a semi-independent principality of his own, came thither in person to receive the keys of the holy city. Aleppo, and Antioch itself, soon followed last the sea-coast, with Jaffa, Beyrout, Tripoli, and its many other towns and ports, was overrun; and within six years from the death of Mahomet the entire Syrian region, from Mount Taurus to the Red Sea, had become what, so far as language and usages are concerned, it has never since ceased to be, an Arab province. Within a short time after, Mesopotamia underwent the same fate; and the conquests of Tarsus and Diar-Bekr brought the Arabs in immediate contact with the uplands of Armenia and Koordistan, which for all succeeding times remained the ultimate limits of their permanent occupation.

With so much fighting on their hands to the west of the Euphrates, the Arab conquerors had for awhile refrained from attacking the great Persian empire to the east of that river, except by a few desultory and for the most part unsuccessful raids. Nor did the battle of Hira, in which the Arab armies under Jereer destroyed a large body of Persian troops, and avenged the previous losses of their countrymen, more than restore the apparent balance between the two empires. But Yezdegird, the last of the Persian monarchs, rashly provoked the extreme chances of a decisive war by sending his best general, Rustum, across the Euphrates with an army of 120,000 men, to offer battle to the Arabs, then commanded by Saad, a native of Yemen, in the open plains of Kadeseeyah or Cufa, not far from the site of ancient Babylon. After four days’ hard fighting, the Persians gave way, having lost the greater number of their men, besides the imperial standard, once the apron, so tradition said, of an Ispahan patriot blacksmith, and for many ages the palladium of Iran. T he Arab general, profiting by the utter discomfiture of his opponents, crossed the Euphrates and the Tigris, took possession, almost without resistance, of the royal capital of Medain or Ctesiphon, where spoils of immense value were found, and pushed on to the more ancient metropolis of Susa, in Chusistan. But the completion of the work of conquest was reserved to his successor in the field, Nooman Ebn-Mekran, who in the battle of Maha vend, 641 a.d., near Ecbatana or Hamadan, destroyed the last hopes of Persian independence. Yezdegird fled, to fall soon after by the hand of an obscure assassin; and his daughter, earned away captive, was taken in marriage by Hasan, the son of Ali—an ill-omened marriage, that, by its dower of Persian pretensions and sympathies, contributed not a little to the disunion and subsequent downfall of the Arab empire. The whole of Persia, from the Caspian and the Euphrates to the Indian Ocean, now received the religion and the rule, though not the language, of Arabia; Khorasan, Kerman, Mekran, Seistan, and Balkh, were next subdued, and for a while the Oxus became the eastern limit of Arab dominion. Thus before a century had elapsed the entire region west of the Indus obeyed the Arab and Mahometan caliph of Damascus.

Westerly the first Arab conquest was Egypt. This important acquisition was made by Aτnroo, a man alike distinguished as a general and a statesman, during the reign of the caliph Omar. Farmah, or Pelusium, the easterly key of Egypt, was first reduced, and the conquerors, proceeding inland, assured their communications with Arabia and the Red Sea by the occupation of the Delta and Cairo. Thence, after much hard fighting, they reached and invested the city of Alexandria, and a fourteen months siege was rewarded by the capitulation of that city, December 22, 640 A.D. No further resistance was offered; the Coptic population gladly exchanged the polished but heavy Greek yoke for the barbarous but lighter rule of the Arabs; and Egypt, like Syria, has remained socially, though not politically, a dependency of Arabia to the present day. The subjugation of northern Africa, including Tripoli, Carthage, Tangier, and the entire coast from the Nile to the Atlantic, occupied sixty years more; but in the battle of Utica, [9:2:258] (598 Λ D the last remnants of the Byzantine empire were obliterated from the souttem shores of the Mediterranean, and Africa was no less closely and permanently annexed to the Arab empire than Svria and Egypt had already been. ,

’ b ∖t last, at the opening of the 8th century, Musa, the talented and ambitious administrator of these vast provinces received the well-known message of the traitor, Count Julian, that brought on the invasion of Spain. At the order of Musa, his lieutenant, lank, crossed the straits which yet bear his name, 711 A.D.; and soon after disembarking in Andalusia, met and defeated the armies oi Spain in the decisive battle of Xeres, where Roderick, last ot the Gothic kings, lost his crown and life. Tarik, 16,000 of whose soldiers are said to have remained on the field, requested and received fresh troops, with which he speedily reduced Malaga, Granada, Cordova, Seville, and finally the Spanish capital, Toledo, itself. Musa now followed in person, took the command somewhat abruptly from his lieutenant, received the submission of Saragossa and Barcelona, reached the Pyrenees, and reduced the whole of Spam, Galicia excepted, to an Arab dependency. His own recall and disgrace, the result of court intrigue and royal ingratitude, stayed awhile the further spread of the Arab torrent.

But in 731 a.d. the celebrated Mahometan general, Abd-er-Rahman, at the head of a numerous army, crossed the Pyrenees, and by the victories, or rather massacres, of Arles and Bordeaux, reduced the whole of France south of the Loire. But at Tours he met the main French army, commanded by Charles Martel, mayor of the palace, and founder of the Carlovingian dynasty. Here, in a bloody battle of seven days, the tide was turned. Abd-eτ-Rahman himself fell, and his troops were dispersed, and fled, never to return. Not long after, 759 a.d., Pepin, son of Charles, delivered France from the lingering vestiges of Mahometan rule. Spain, however, remained for more than five centuries an Arab settlement; and her language, literature, and usages bear even yet the imprint of those who ιτιled her so long. Sicily too, Candia, Rhodes, Cyprus, Malta, Sardinia, and even Corsica, with other islands of less note in the Mediterranean, became each in turn, though none for long, Arab possessions. In Asia Minor, on the contrary, on the shores of the Black Sea, and east of Samarkand, the Arab invaders, in spite of brave and reiterated attempts, two of which, 670 and 717 A.D., were directed against Constantinople itself, were never able to make good their footing. But at the close of the Benoo-Omeyyah dynasty, 755 a.d., their empire comprised the whole basin of the Mediterranean, with the exception of its northern side; in Africa its only limits were the great central desert, in Asia the plateau of Kobi and the Indus, and throughout almost all these regions the Arab element either remained absolutely predominant down to our own time, or has at least left distinct traces of its existence.

We must now give a brief glance at the internal condition and institutions of this vast empire, which were such as to afford from the very first no favourable omen of political stability. Mahomet, when dying, not only omitted to name a successor, but, worse still, designated no electors; and through all the centuries of Arab rule the conditions both of elective and of hereditary right were never accurately defined. Hence the early rivalries, already alluded to, between the “Ansar” and the “Mohajireen ;” and hence, not long after, the yet more dangerous contention between the family of Omeyyah, from which 0thman, the third Mahometan caliph, descended, and the kindred house of Hashim, the more immediate relatives of the prophet. Meanwhile, within the ranks of Hashim, itself, Ali, nephew of Mahomet, and husband of Fatimah, his only daughter, denying every right of free election, advanced his own special title to the throne by the presumed claim of nearness of blood, a title persistently urged by his descendants, and for centuries a constant source of dissension and weakness in the empire. Nor, whilst the nomination of the caliph himself, the centre and keystone of the Arab political edifice, was thus left undefined, were the remaining details of the construction at all préciser in their character. No accurate line of demarcation separated the executive from the judicial, or these again from the financial department; no municipal organisations were established or even acknowledged; absolute despotism was the only form of government, whether primary or delegated, in the capital as in the provinces; actual resistance and revolt the only remedies against its abuse. Such an empire might conquer, but could not govern, at least for long.

These inherent evils manifested themselves by their unmistakeable bad effects from the very first. Once only, when Abu-Bekr died, 634 a.d., after only two years of reign, the elective accession of Omar, the austerest, but also the most capable of all the early Arab rulers, was sanctioned by an almost unanimous approval; though even then the restless intrigues of the ambitious and unprincipled Ali made themselves manifest. After a glorious reign of ten years, the conqueror of Syria, Persia, and Egypt, perished, 644 A.D., assassinated by a Persian slave, Firooz by name; and Othman, son of Affan, of the noble family of Abd-esh-Shems, was elected in his place. The twelve years of his administration were ceaselessly disturbed bv the insubordination of Ali and his partisans, who at last, impatient of delay, broke into the residence of the ancient caliph at Medinah, and murdered him there, 656 A.d. Stained with blood, Ali usurped the throne; while Aye-shah, daughter of Abu-Bekr, and widow of the prophet, collected round her the avengers of the blood of Othman, and the first civil war of Islam was inaugurated by a hard-fought battle, known as the “Day of the Camel,” near Bosrah, 656 a.d. Ayeshah was defeated; but the cause of Othman was soon after taken up by his talented kinsman, Muawwiyah, governor of Syria, who in tho battle, or rather series of battles, fought near Sofeyn, on the upper Euphrates, 658-9 A.D., broke the strength of Ali’s faction. Driven from Syria, Egypt, and Arabia, Ali retired to Cufa, where an assassin’s dagger avenged on his own person the crime by which he had opened the way to ill-gotten and precarious power, 660 a.d.

Muawwiyah, left by his rival’s death sole though not undisputed emeer-el-moomeneen, or “ruler of the faithful, fixed his seat of government at Damascus, where he and the fourteen succeeding princes of his line ruled for eighty-nine years. Victorious abroad, his dynasty, generally called by European authors the “Ommiade,” from the name of Omeyyah, father of the race, was for its first forty years harassed by frequent insurrections within the limits of the empire. The initial disturbances from which all that succeeded directly or indirectly took rise, were due to the intrigues of the two sons of Ali, Hasan and Hoseyn, both of whom were deeply imbued with Persian superstition, and who thereby soon gave the schism that they headed a religious as well as a political character.

After the death of the lazy and contemptible Hasan, his younger and more active but equally faithless brother Hoseyn, raised the standard of revolt in the eastern provinces, where he hoped to gather round him his Persian auxiliaries; but before he could draw his followers to a head he was met at Kerbela, on the Euphrates, by the well-organised troops of the caliph Yezeed, son of Muawwiyah, and perished miserably, 680 a.d. His descendants and kinsmen, for there were many, continued, however, now one of them, now another, to revive the pretensions of their family; and for more than a century they disquieted the empire, especially on its eastern and southern frontiers, with sedition and rebellion. At last their evident defection from orthodox belief, joined to the extravagance and licentiousness both of their teaching and practice, so disgusted the Arab race that scarcely any adherents were left them, except among the Moorish tribes of northern Africa, where their influence, founded on the strangest impostures, predominated for a time, and. in the still more congenial soil of Persia. There indeed the sect obtained a permanent footing and ultimate supremacy. Thus originated and thus was perpetuated the first and widest spread of Mahometan schisms; the adherents of the legitimate caliphate and the orthodox doctrine assuming the name of “Soon-nees” or “Traditionalists,” while the sectaries of Ali are known as “Sheéah” or “Separatists” to this day. .

More formidable, however, to the Damascus princes, though sooner extinguished, was the revolt of Abd-Allah, son of Zobeyr, a brave but narrow-minded leader, and nearly connected by blood with Mahomet himself. Supported by the townsmen of Mecca and Medinah, besides a great proportion of the northern or “Mustareb” tribes, he was for more than ten years acknowledged as caliph by half the Arab world, till slain by Hajjaj Ebn-Yousef, the greatest of the Syrian generals, during the storming of Mecca by the Damascene troops, 692 a.d. The intrepid but ferocious Mukhtar, at first a supporter of Abd-Allah but afterwards his rival, and head of the “Khowarij” or “seceders,” maintained a separate revolt on his own account in Cufa, till slain in battle by Musâab, son of Zobeyr, brother of Abd-Allah. The “Khowarij,” however—brave and well-meaning though visionary men, some of whom were nothing else than over-zealous Mahometan priests or reformera; others, sectaries of Ali and his family; others, again, free-thinkers of republican tendency—found a new and successful leader in the courageous Shebeeb, a native of Hasa, who for several years maintained their cause on the upper Euphrates, while the revolt of a large portion of the Ommiade army itself, in the extreme east of the empire, where the caliph’s own general, Abd-er-Rahman, headed the insubordination, shook the empire to its foundations. But over these and other enemies triumphed the military and administrative skill of Hejjaj; and it was only under him, the scourge of rebels, and pillar of the Ommiade caliphs, 705 a.d., that anything like real internal tranquillity was even for a brief period given to the empire.

Half hereditary, half elective, the family of Omeyyah numbered fifteen successive princes on the throne, mostly men of talent, able administrators, and some of them distinguished authors and poets. But their personal merits were unavailing against the downward progress of disorganisation, the necessaιy result of an essentially defective system of government, and rapid territorial extension out of all proportion with the means of consolidation; and the latter years of their dynasty present a melancholy scene of turbulence and confusion. Then appeared a new enemy, more dangerous than any of the preceding, to the Damascus sceptre, in the person of Ibrahim, great-grandson of Abbas, the uncle of the Prophet, who after long and secret intrigues, now gave himself out as the acknowledged [9:2:259] head of the family of Hashem, from old time the hereditary enemies of the no less noble family of Abd-esh-Shems and Omeyyah, and consequently the legitimate claimant of sovereign power. His cause was upheld by the terrible Abu-Muslim, a gloomy but talented fanatic, native of Khorassan, who raised on Ibrahim’s behalf the standard of revolt in Kerman. Soon Persia and its adjoining provinces, despairing of findin" to themselves a worthy leader among the frivolous descendants of Ali, joined the kindred ranks of the children of Abbas. Ibrahim, indeed, perished; but his younger brother, Abd Allah Abu-Abbas, more known in history as “Es Saffah,” or “the Bloodshedder,” took his place, and was proclaimed caliph everywhere to the west of the Euphrates. Syria, Arabia, and Egypt still held out for Merwan, the last of the Ommiade caliphs; but the great military talents, stained by remorseless cruelty, of Abu-Muslim, turned the scale. The decisive battle was fought on the banks of the river Zab, near Irbeel (the Arbela of classic history), 749 a.d., and the whole of Syria was soon after overrun by the black-turbaned aιτnies of Persia. Merwan himself, after much unavailing display of personal courage, fled to Damascus, and thence to Egypt, where he was overtaken and killed by his pursuers, 750 a.d.

Urged on by the pitiless Abu-Muslim, who shortly after himself fell a victim to the suspicions of his own equally cruel but more treacherous master, the victorious Saffah sought out everywhere the members, however remote, of the Omeyyah family, and put them to death under circumstances of the most infamous barbarity. The very tombs of the dead were broken open, and the bones of the great Muawwiyah and his noble successors dispersed. One youth of the doomed house alone, Abd-er-Rahman byname, effected his escape to the still friendly provinces of Africa, and thence to Spain, where he founded the illustrious dynasty that reigned in Cordova over the Iberian peninsula for two centuries and a half.

But with the fall of the Benoo-Omeyyah dynasty and the caliphate of Damascus fell the prosperity of Arabia herself, never again to rise. Arabs of the noblest, wealthiest, and most gifted stock, descendants of the princely Abd-Shems, the head of Koreysh in pre-Islamitic times, the Ommiade princes had established the centre of their government in a city intimately connected by land and by sea, by commerce and by nationality, with Arabia proper and the Hejaz, and in steady adherence alike to the feelings and policy of their race, they always regarded their native country as the choicest jewel in their own imperial crown. They were Arabs first and caliphs afterwards. Hence it was from Arabia that they drew almost exclusively the officials of their world-wide administration, both for peace and war; the provincial governors, generals, collectors, judges, administrators of their nomination were all, or nearly all, of Arab blood; and the improvement or enrichment of Arabia herself, the facilitation and extension of Arab trade and commerce, and the encouragement of Arab talent, literary and artistic, were the foremost of their cares. Meanwhile the peninsula, obedient indeed to the caliph as to its supreme head, but retaining in great measure the local institutions of its hereditary government by chiefs and in tribes, enjoyed a degree of general tranquillity, and even of comparative unity, that it had never realised before, nor has ever since. Even the hereditary rivalry between the northern or “Mustareb” Arabs, who about this time assumed the title, which they still bear, of ‘ ‘ Keysee,”—a title derived from the numerous and influential stock of “Keys-Eylan,” and thence communicated to the rest—and the southern or “Yemenee” Arabs, a rivalry founded in diversity of race, fostered by long and bloody wars, and continued, though under certain modifications, to our own time, might, and often indeed did disquiet, but could not overthrow, the beneficial order of prevailing tranquillity.

With the accession, however, of the Abbaside caliphs, 750 a.d., the good days of Arabia came to an end. Though they also were, like their Ommiade predecessors, Arabs by origin, and indeed of the purest Arab blood, they owed their place on the throne, not to Arab partisans, but to the influence and the aπns of the anti-Arab and eastern provinces, Persian, Tatar, and Turkoman, beyond the Tigris; whilst the Arab half of the empire had almost unanimously declared for their supplanted rivals. Hence the Abbaside policy rested on a non-Arab base; and its representatives, although descendants of Koreysh and Hashim, systematically neglected or even depressed the Arab element of their rule, while they strengthened and elevated the Irano-Turanian or central Asiatic. Their throne, at first transferred from Damascus to Hashimeeyah, the newly-founded residence of Abd-Allah Es Saffah, on the Euphrates, was soon after removed further east to the banks of the Tigris. Here, close to the ruins of the old Persian capital of Madain, the second Abbaside caliph, Almansur, laid, 760 a.d., the foundations of that great city which, under the Persian name of Baghdad, still remains a monument of his personal energy and of the policy of his race.

Within its walls, surrounded by Persian ministers or slaves, amongst whom the family of Barmek has attained a tragical celebrity, and by an armed body of Turkish or Turkoman guards, at first their servants, but before long their masters the descendants of Abbas held for a century the substance, and for four centuries more the shadow of a sceptre. Some of their names, and that of Haroon-el-Rasheed, 768 to 809 a.d., in particular, are connected with great events and famous memories, but the records of their reigns belong to .Perso-Asiatic rather than to Arab history. Indeed, from the death of the eighth caliph of the race, El-Mosta-sim, 842 a.d., to the accession of the last of their dynasty, El-Mostasim, 1242 a.d., these princes were mere puppets in the hands of the Persian, Koord, Turkoman, or Turkish mercenaries, by whom they surrounded themselves as a protection against their own Arab subjects. Meanwhile province after province separated itself from their empire, and reasserted its own native character and independence, till in 1258 A.D. the pagan and Tatar chief Holagoo, grandson of Genghis-Khan, stormed Bagdad, and extinguished the decrepit dynasty of Abbas in the blood of the last caliph. Yet Arab genius, though deprived of political support, maintained by its philosophical and literary vigour through all those dreary centuries, nor has even in our own time wholly lost, a certain intellectual ascendancy in Baghdad and its vicinity.

Meanwhile the Arabian peninsula itself, neglected or despoiled by the Abbaside caliphs, had sunk year by year more deeply into clannish disorganisation, till the revolt of the Karmathians, about the end of the 10th and the beginning of the 11th century, detached Arabia definitely from the overgrown empire that she herself had founded. This revolt had been long preparing. Hatred of centralised rule, a strong attachment to local, tribal, and even in some places semi-municipal organisation, both joined to a deep underlying scepticism, had from the very first originated and fostered throughout Arabia a wide-spread, though covert opposition to the establishment of Islamitic despotism, and jealousy of the predominance conferred by Mahomet and his successors on their kinsmen of the northern and western tribes, and on Koreysh in particular, had united in secret antagonism to Islam and the caliphate the other tribes of the peninsula, but especially those of the centre, east, and south. Hence the Karmathian outbreak soon took the form of an Arab reaction against foreign and uncongenial influences and institutions, and being such, could hardly fail of substantial success. As to the special tenets professed by the Karmathians—so called from Karmath, their mystic founder, circ. 890 A.D.—they were, in their ultimate expression, pantheistic in theory and socialist in practice.

From the sea-coast provinces of Bahreyn and Katar, its first avowed centre, the uprising, headed by its terrible leader Suleyman Abu-Jahir, spread rapidly over the rest of Arabia; and in the year 929 of our era Mecca itself was stormed, and the Kâabeh ruined by his troops, while the sacred black stone itself was carried off to Hasa, where it remained twelve years. The feeble attempts of the Abbaside caliphs to check the movement proved utterly ineffectual; all was confusion, and for two centuries more a bloody partisan war, or rather an ever-recurring series of petty wars, devastated the peninsula. When this at last gave place to the quiet, not of peace but of exhaustion, Arabia, from Syria to Aden, was, with the sole exception of the narrow Hejaz coast-strip, detached in fact as in name from the pseudo-Arab empire of Baghdad, and had returned to its primitive independence. But by the same process the land had relapsed, hopelessly this time, into the semi-barbarism that invariably follows a prolonged vicissitude of petty tyrants, vicinal wars, interrupted communications, waste of life and property, and the fatal insecurity of universal lawlessness. Ease, wealth, trade, science, literature, all had perished from Arabia, till after a long anarchy, of which little memory is preserved, and that little of less interest, the country subdivided itself into · the provincial sections that, with slight modifications, it has retained ever since. Oman, with the adjoining regions of Katar and Hasa, was organised into a semi-elective monarchy of a limited character, under the leadership of the Nebhan and subsequently of the Yâarebah clan; while its rulers, in opposition to the orthodox head of Islam at Baghdad or elsewhere, assumed the half spiritual title of Imam, and have since retained it. Yemen, the wealthiest and most populous territory of Arabia, split up into an infinity of petty provinces, governed each by a distinct prince, while some one or other would from time to time assert a transient sovereignty over the rest. The barbarous districts of Mahrah and Hadramaut on the south-east, with the mountain fastnesses of Nejd and Shomer, were abandoned to the anarchy of clannish alliances or feuds. The Hejaz alone, with the sacred territory or Haram of Mecca, under the headship of the “shereefs” or “nobles,” the lineal descendants of Koreysh, retained some kind of constituted authority connected with the outer world, and paid a respectful but distant allegiance, sometimes to the government of Baghdad, more often to that of Egypt.

For, on the ruins of the Aghlabite dynasty, founded by Ibrahim Ebn-Aglab, the general of Haroon-el-Rasheed in North Africa, 797 A.D., with the inland city of tbo Keyrawan for capital, there had arisen, 909 a.d., a new kingdom, that oftheFatimites, so designated from one Obeyd-Allah, its originator, a real or pretended descendant of Ali and Fatimah. These Fatimites, able but tyrannical mvstics, having united under their rulo the whole of the north [9:2:260] African coast, invaded Egypt; and Moezz-Allah their caliph, hav-i∏o ’ 972-3 a.d., driven the Abbasιde governor from the shores of the Nile, established his own throne in the city of Cairo, which his victorious general Jowher had founded the year previous. From this capital he and his descendants ruled for two centuries more, not only over Egypt, lower and upper, but, though at the price of frequent wars, over Syria to the east and Tripoli to the west, till the last of the Fatimite caliphs, Adhid-Billah, was, 1171 A.D., dethroned by the Koordish conqueror Salah-ed-Deen, better known in history and romance as Saladin, the chivalrous opponent of our own Richard I. But though no Arab prince has ever since reigned in Egypt, the Hejaz with its sacred cities remained annexed to that country, and Yemen in part followed suit.

At last, 1517 A.D., the Turkish sultan, Selim I., conquered Egypt, and obtained from the last real or supposed surviving Abba-sise kinsmen of the prophet a formal investiture of the Mahometan caliphate, which thus definitely changed the character of that office from national to politico-religious. On this occasion the shereef of Mecca presented the sultan with the keys of the city; and the Arab tribes in general, those of the east excepted, proffered their allegiance to the Ottoman government. This subjection, real in Hejaz and Yemen, nominal elsewhere, the country continued for half a century, till the shereef Muttahir, impatient of a foreign yoke, attacked and routed the Turkish force of occupation, then commanded by Murad Pasha, and for a short time re-established Arab independence. Selim II. sent fresh troops, who at first gained some advantages over the Arabs; but in 1630 the Yemenite chief Khasim expelled the Turks from the whole of his native province, and restored a shadow of the old Himyarite throne at Sanaa. Here, 1761 a.d., the celebrated Danish traveller, Niebuhr, found the Imam, as he was styled, of Yemen, governing thirty provinces, six on the coast and twenty-four inland, besides several smaller states; and possessed of an income, chiefly derived from the custom-dues of Loheya, Mokha, and other seaports, equalling, it was thought, £1,000,000 sterling per annum. The standing army was reekoned at 5000 men, mostly infantry. Subsequently, Wahhabee encroachments on the north, the British occupation of Aden to the south, and Egyptian invasion under Mehemet Ali and his successors, considerably weakened the power of the Imam of Sanaa, till in 1871 a Turkish army, sent from Syria, took the capital, and put an end to the Arab dynasty of Khasim. At the present date Yemen is a province of the Ottoman empire, though with every prospect of not long remaining so.

Between the Hejaz and the Ottoman government the yearly pilgrimage, with the accompanying largesses of the Ottoman sultans, formed a more enduring link; one interrupted, indeed, from time to time by occasional rebellions, but as often renewed by Arab neediness, till the province, with its sacred cities, was definitely annexed, though only for a time, by the great Egyptian usurper Mehemet Ali.

But in the rest of the peninsula, in Nejd, Oman, Mahrah, Had-ramaut, and the other adjoining districts, the Ottoman claims were from the beginning of the 17 th century absolutely ignored, and no collision was possible, because no point of contact existed. This state of things was, however, at last modified by the Wahhabee movement, one of the most important in the history of Arabia, and the end of which we have not yet seen. Of this a brief account must now be given.

Bom at the town of Horeymelah, in the centre of Nejd, 1691 a.d., Abd-el-Wahhab, or the “Servant of the Bountiful,” had in early life travelled far in Mesopotamia and Syria, report even adds India, seeking knowledge in observation and the conversation of the learned, to whom his own superior intelligence gave him recommendation everywhere. Returning in mature life to the secluded quiet of his native land, he gave himself up to thought and study, mostly theological. Convinced by the comparison between what he read and what he had seen in his travels, and continued to see around him in Nejd itself, where hardly a vestige of Mahometanism remained, that the primitive faith of Islam had become considerably corrupted in theory and totally so in practice, and that Turks, Persians, and Arabs, were all of them in fact, though after different fashions, no longer true Muslims, but mere idolaters and polytheists, he determined himself to inaugurate a reform that should reassert the doctrine and practice of the Koran as they had been at the beginning.

The invocation of saints, including Mahomet himself, a practice borrowed by Mahometanism from foreign example; the honours paid at the shrines and tombs of the dead; the use of intoxicating liquors; the wearing of silk and gold—to sum up, every belief or practice directly or indirectly condemned by the Koran, or even not sanctioned by it—with all these Abd-el-Wahhab declared open war. His special and notorious prohibition of tobacco, a prohibition rigorously observed by his followers, and which subsequently became in a manner their distinctive badge, must be attributed to an excess of sectarian puritanism; nor can it be doubted that hatred of foreigners, and of the Turks in particular, had a large share in the zeal manifested by himself and his disciples for what they, not altogether wrongly, considered as in a peculiar sense the national or Arab religion; it was a view that had the sanction of the Koran itself.

Like Mahomet, Abd-el-Wahhab commenced his preaching when about forty years of age, and, like the prophet, soon drew down on himself the persecution of those he failed to convert. Driven from Eyaneh, where he had established himself, by the hostility of its chiefs, themselves stirred up to persecution of the rigorous doctrines by the far-sighted Arav, governor of the neighbouring province of Hasa, he found refuge with the sheykh Mohammed Ebn Saood, the warlike chief of Dereyceyah, who put his sword and that of his clan at the disposal of the new apostle. The reform thus supported soon extended itself, partly by persuasion, partly by force; and when Abd-el-Wahhab died in 1787, at the advanced age of ninety-six, he had already seen his doctrines dominant from the coast of Bahreyn to the confines of Mokha and Aden.

His disciple and patron, Ebn Sâood, after many victories gained over the governor of Hasa and other enemies or rivals, died in 1765, leaving the whole of Nejd, now consolidated into one government under one head, to his son and successor Abd-el-Aziz, who, on his accession, now assumed the titles of Imam and Sultan. Under this chief the important provinces of Abu-Areesh, south of Mecca, and of Nejran, on the frontier of Yemen, were added to tho Wahhabee dominions. These conquests, or rather annexations, naturally enough excited the alarm of Ghalib, the shereef or governor of Mecca, who by his representations succeeded in at last awakening the long negligent Turks to the danger which threatened their frontiers from the national and religious union of the Arab race. Orders were issued from Constantinople, and in 1797 an army of 5000 Turks, with an equal number of allied Arabs, advanced into Hasa, which had already become Wahhabee territory, and laid siege to Hofhoof, the capital of the province. But harassed by the Wahhabees and fearful of risking a general engagement, they retired without having effected anything except to provoke the bitter resentment of an enemy who had now learned not only to hate but to despise them. The consequence was that the Wahhabees before long took the initiative; and in 1801 their collected armies invaded the territory of Baghdad, and laid siege to Kerbela, a locality famous for the tomb of Hoseyn the martyr, son of Ali, and a centre of popular Mahometan superstition. The town was stormed, the inhabitants massacred, and spoils of immense value were transferred from its shrines to the Wahhabee treasury. Victorious on the east, the Wahhabee arms were next directed westward; Taif, the well-known pleasure-ground of Mecca, was invaded and subdued with great bloodshed in 1802; and in the April of the following year Mecca itself, though not till after a brave resistance, came into Wahhabee possession. Ghaleb fled to Jiddeh, the only place in Hejaz that held out against the invaders; and Sâood, son of Abd-el-Aziz formally assumed the government of Mecca, whence he dictated to the Porte the terms on which alone he declared that he would henceforth permit the observances of the yearly pilgrimage from all parts of the Mahometan world. Shortly afterwards he succeeded in person to the Wahhabee imamate, his father having been assassinated by a Persian in the mosque at Deréyeeyah.

Under Sâood the Nejdee kingdom attained its greatest extension and prosperity. Internally its government was such as that of Arabia had been under the first caliphs and their 0mmiade successors,—namely, a despotism regulated by the prescriptions of the Koran; and the revenues at Sâood’s disposal fluctuated between £200,000 and £300,000 yearly. This sum he expended chiefly for military purposes. In 1804 he conquered Medinah, plundering the rich offerings accumulated by the superstition of ages round the prophet’s tomb, besides treating the inhabitants of the town with great severity.

From this date till 1811, open war, in which the Wahhabees were generally successful, was waged between them and all their neighbours on every side, but especially against the Turks, whose Synan possessions were ravaged sometimes by Sâood’s best general Abu-Noktah, sometimes by his gigantic negro lieutenant Hark, up to Anah on the Euphrates, and within sight of the walls of Damascus. At this time, too, the inhabitants of Bahreyn and the adjoining coast having embraced Wahhabee doctrines, combined them with profitable piracy on the Persian Gulf, till the British expeditions sent from Bombay in 1810 and 1819 broke up the robber nest of Ras-el-Kheymah, and set bounds to the insolence of the piratical zealots.

For during these events the customary pilgrimage of Mecca and Medinah had been interrupted, the Wahhabees allowing none but such as conformed to their own doctrines and habits to approach the sacred cities. Thus the whole extra-Arabian Mahometan world was roused to indignation against the new and exclusive reform; and the Ottoman Porte, after some futile efforts of its own, consented to entrust the chastisement of the Arabs to its doubtful and already over-powerful Egyptian vassal, Mehemet Ali.

In 1811 this cruel and treacherous but highly talented man began the work, and, in spite of many difficulties and even reverses, never faltered in it till it was fully accomplished. The details of [9:2:261] the campaign that reduced Arabia, though only for a few years, to an Egyptian province, being well known, a very summary mention may here suffice.

Tousoon Beg, son of Mehemet Ali, commanded the first expedition. It was directed against the northern Hejaz, and landed in 1811 at Yembo, which town the Turks took and made a base of further operations. A severe check inflicted on them by the Arabs in January 1812 retarded their advance, but by the end of the year Tousoon stormed Medinah, and his troops made a frightful massacre of the Wahhabee garrison and inhabitants; to which atrocity the treacherous murder of 1500 more, who after holding out long and bravely in the town castle, had surrendered on terms of safe-conduct, was soon added. Meantime the intrigues of Mehemet Ali detached the shereef Ghaleb from the Wahhabee cause; and Jiddeh was treacherously surrendered to the Turks in 1813. Mecca and the Taif district were immediately occupied by Ottoman troops. Mehemet Ali now came over in person; and his troops having been reinforced by those of his son Tousoon, he felt himself strong enough to break his promises to the sheykh Ghaleb, whom he arrested, dispossessed of power, and sent to die in exile.

For a year and a half Mehemet Ali remained at Mecca, collecting his forces for a decisive blow. Meanwhile, in 1814 Sâood had died, leaving as successor his son Abd-Allah, a chief equal to his father in every respect except prudence, in which he was unfortunately deficient. Mehemet Ali having completed his preparations, left Mecca early in 1815 with a large army, and advanced towards Yemen; while the Wahhabees, who are said to have been 30,000 strong, occupied the mountain pass of Bishâ on the way, and rashly hazarded a general engagement. The battle, in which Mehemet Ali displayed much personal courage, was desperate, and ended in the utter discomfiture of the Arabs, several thousands of whom were killed on the field. Mehemet Ali followed up his victory, and in a few months had reduced the entire mountainous district north of Yemen, besides taking alive as prisoners Bakrooj and Tami, two of the most renowned Wahhabee chiefs, both of whom, in violation of his promises, he made be put to death with atrocious tortures. But the exhaustion of his own soldiers obliged him to relinquish his further march south; he returned to Mecca, and in the summer to Egypt; Tousoon Pasha, left to conduct the war, concluded peace with the Wahhabees, and shortly after himself died of the plague. The treaty he had signed was disavowed both at Cairo and Constantinople; and in September 1816 the celebrated Ibrahim Pasha, adopted son of Mehemet Ali, landed at Yembo, and commenced the final campaign. For more than a year he exercised his troops in frequent but well-timed and generally successful skirmishes with those of Abd-Allah, who in person commanded the Wahhabee armies; while his crafty diplomacy, equal to that of Mehemet Ali himself, won over tribe after tribe to the Egyptian cause. Well supplied with provisions, and his flanks covered by his Arab allies, Ibrahim, in spite of a severe repulse beneath the walls of El-Rass, subdued the entire province of Kaseem, entered Nejd on the northwest by the pass of Shakrah, and in April 1818 appeared beneath the walls of the capital, Deréyeeyah, on which Abd-Allah with his forces had retreated.

The siege lasted five months, and was conducted with great ability by Ibrahim, whose military skill at last triumphed over the determined courage of the garrison and inhabitants. Not, however, till the town had been gradually reduced to a confusion of ruinous heaps did Abd-Allah consent to surrender, and then only on honourable terms, which, as usual, the conqueror granted freely, but with no intention of observing. The Wahhabee chief was sent under strong guard to Egypt, and thence to Constantinople, where, December 19th, 1818, ho was beheaded in the public square in front of St Sophia.

Deréyeeyah was razed to the ground by the conqueror, and remains at this day, like Eyaneh, a formless heap. The provinces of Hareek and Hasa submitted after slight resistance; and the whole of Arabia, Oman excepted, now lay at the mercy of Ibrahim, who showed none. After a bloody series of executions and massacres, he placed garrisons in all the strongholds that he permitted to remain standing; and Arabia had to submit to the military conscriptions and other exactions and oppressions that have ruined, and still ruin, every other province of the Ottoman empire, aggravated in this case by the licentiousness of the conquerors and the long outstanding mutual hatred of Turk and Arab.

Ibrahim returning to Egypt, left Khaleel Pasha as vice-regent of Arabia, who for a while maintained despotic rule over the country. But Turkee, the younger son of Abd-Allah, who on the downfall of his family had fled to the mountainous fastnesses of Toweyk, soon organised guerilla bands, that, aided by the peasants, succeeded in rendering the central and eastern provinces of the land untenable by the Turks. The inhabitants of Hareek and Hasa were the first to throw off the yoke; and the town of Riad, celebrated as the birthplace, 1400 years before, of the prophet Museylemah, now became the restored Wahhabee capital. Turkee, like so many other Arab rulers, fell the victim of an assassin, but his son Feysul succeeded to his ability as well as to hi« popularity and power. The Egyptian government, by this time at open war with the Ottoman, made several unavailing attempts to put down the revolt; but the wars between Mehemet AH and the Porte in Syria and Anatolia diverted its serious attention from the less important, because poorer, acquisitions made by Ibrahim in Arabia, till in 1842 Khoorshid Pasha, the last representative of Egyptian rule, was, partly by force, partly by craft, for Feysul was a master in both, compelled to quit his frontier residence in Kaseem; and this populous province was re-annexed to the Wahhabee empire, while Aseer, throwing off foreign rule, returned to Wahhabeeism and independence.

Hasa, Hareek, the whole of Nejd, Kaseem, and the provinces adjoining Yemen on the north, with Aseer, were now re-united under the sceptre of Feysul, and a broad belt of Wahhabee rule thus again stretched across the centre of the peninsula, from the Red Sea to the Persian Gulf. But over Bahreyn, Oman, and Yemen, the Wahhabees, though they have frequently attempted it, have never been able to re-establish their former dominion; and in Shomer and Jowf to the north, between Nejd and Syria, a new kingdom of a different and much more liberal character, that of the brave and clever Telal, sprung up, and has since maintained its independence. Nor have the often-repeated Wahhabee inroads on Mecca and the Hejaz been attended with their former success. Still, within its actual though narrowed limits, the ΛVahhabee government has remained we , l-organised and strong,—a constant menace to its neighbours, and a genuine specimen, nor a wholly unfavourable one, of Arab autoι omy. But in 1870, Feysul, already aged and blind, was assassinated, as his father had been before him, and the dissensions of his two sons, Abd-Allah and Sâood, the former of whom advanced the rights of first-bcm, the latter those of popularity to the throne, led to a civil war, and gave occasion to Ottoman interference. An armed force was sent, and advanced along the shore of the Persian Gulf into the province of Hasa, where it occupied the capital, Hofhoof. With this, however, its success terminated, and the difficulties of crossing the “Dahnà” desert strip seem likely to place an effectual barrier to any further progress. Aseer, however, a stronghold of Wahhabeeism, has been invaded by the Turks, who have gained there some temporary and superficial advantages, while the new kingdom of Shomer, weakened by the untimely death of its accomplished prince Telal, has also offered facilities for Turkish interference, though not of a military description.

To these varied changes the kingdom of Oman has for many generations remained in great measure a stranger. But its capital, Mascat, was occupied by the Portuguese in 1508, who retained it till the middle of the 17th century. It was then retaken by the Yâarebah princes, who had all along maintained their power in the interior, and now for a century more became the sole though not the undisputed rulers of Oman, which was at this time often harassed by Persian invasion. In 1737 the country was formally attacked by the armies of Nadir Shah; the principal towns were at last taken, the inhabitants massacred, and for four years Oman groaned under the Persian tyranny. A deliverer, however, appeared in the person of Ahmed Ebn-Sâood, of Yemenite drigin, but not of ths reigning family. By a series of daring deeds he succeeded in expelling or destroying the enemies of his country, and was in return elected Imam in the year 1741, since which time his family have occupied the throne of Oman. Under the Imam Sultan Sâood and his son the Seyyid Sâood, the 0manee kingdom attained its greatest splendour at the beginning of the present century. Its power then extended not only over Oman and a large tract of the Arabian mainland, but also over Bahreyn, Ormuz, Larej, Kishm, and the other islands of the Persian Gulf; besides the coast of Katar, with its celebrated pearl fisheries, on the Arab side, that of Barr-Faris, with the harbours of Linja and Bander Abbas, on the Persian, and a long strip of African sea-shore, south of Cape Guardefui, with the islands of Socotra and Zanzibar. Sultan Sâood was killed in 1804, but his son, of the same name, proved his not unworthy successor; and though unable to prevent considerable encroachments of the Nejdee Wahhabees on the north and west of his dominions, saved Oman itself from conquest and annexation. He consolidated the Arab power in Zanzibar and the east African coast; and when he died in 1856, after reigning fifty-two years, he left the kingdom of Oman the most flourishing state in the entire Arabian peninsula. Its proximity to India has often mvolved this government in relations, sometimes amicable, sometimes hostile, with ourselves; but a detail of them need not detain us here. Suffico it to say, that on the death of Sultan Sâood, Zanzibar was, partly by British influence, detached from the Arab empire; while the death of the late Imam, Thoweynee, son of Sâood, who. perished, assassinated by his own son, in 1866, inaugurated a period of civil wars, from which Oman is still suffering. Her Wahhabee neighbours, too, continue their restless attempts at encroachment on her western frontier, while Katar and Bahreyn, with their pearl fisheries, have been wholly lost to the Muscat sceptre.

Lastly, the Hejaz is at the present date absolutely under the Turkish government, while Aden has, ever since its first capture in [9:2:262] 1839 remained a British possession. Thus Nejd itself, vιth the inland districts immediately adjoining, and the desolate coast districts of Mahrah and Hadramaut, are now the only parts of the peninsula where Arab independence can be said fully to maintain itself· though with this difference, that in the last-named provinces it is merely the independence of barbarism and poverty, while in the former it is that of organisation and not contemptible resources. Nor can it be well doubted that the recent encroachments of the Ottoman government, or rather misgovernment, will prove equally ephemeral with those of Sultan Selim or Mehemet Ali, and that Arabia will in a short time,.probably within a few years, regain its previous autonomy. Arab institutions are far from perfect, yet they are better than Ottoman oppression, and the Wahhabee empire might easily, under a judicious head, relax from its intolerance and become a centre, not of strength only, but of order, prosperity, and even civilisation, for the whole Arab nation, restoring, not, indeed, for external conquests, the days of which have long gone by, but for internal wellbeing, the better times of the Ommiade dynasty.

Arabia proper is singularly destitute of antiquities, in the ordinary sense of the word, the northern or “Adscititious” Arabs having been, so long as they remained within their own territory, a remarkably unconstructive race, and the “pure” or southern Arabs not much better in this respect. Niebuhr, in his justly celebrated Travels through Yemen, mentions the ruins of Ghamdan, the ancient palace of the Himyarite kings, near Sanaâ, as well as the remains of several other fortresses in adjoining villages; but these ruins, like those subsequently visited by Palgrave in Jowf, bore no distinctive traces of architecture or date, beyond a barbaric coarseness of material and great thickness of wall. More remarkable, because better defined in history, are the remains of the great dyke of Mareb already mentioned: its vestiges, said to be colossal in their dimensions, extend across a ravine of about 2 furlongs in breadth; they are in part of hewn stone, and testify, if not to the skill, at least to the diligence of the Himyarite Arabs. A few Himyaritic inscriptions have been discovered, some in Yemen, more in the provinces of Hadramaut and Mahrah, but have been too carelessly copied to afford proper materials for philological investigation. When decipherable, they indicate a dialect resembling the Abyssinian or Amharic; but throw no real light on the history of the country or the condition of its inhabitants.

It is true that in addition to the non-constructive character of the early Arab race, account must be taken of the destructive policy, aggravated by iconoclastic zeal, pursued by the conquering Mahometan tribes of the north, who within their own territory, even more than in the acquired lands of Egypt, North Africa, and elsewhere, carried out the plan of establishing their own religion and system, not merely on the ruins, but, so far as possible, on the effacement of whatever had preceded it. Hence, of the old idol temples which once covered Arabia, nothing now remains except the megalithic vestiges of an enormous stone circle, resembling those found in some parts of Europe, and consisting of large boulders, each about 14 feet high, placed on end, and originally crowned by a similar horizontal series. This was visited by Palgrave when travelling in the province of Kaseem, near Bereydah; two others are reported to exist in the same district. Nor, the Meccan relics apart, had any of the numerous idols once worshipped throughout the peninsula been discovered till the Swiss Munzinger, three years since, found among the heaps of a deserted village near Aden a small bronze statue representing a naked hermaphrodite figure, over the head of which rises an ornament resembling the Egyptian pshent.

The black stone of the Meccan Kâabeh, said to be of volcanic formation, and perhaps an aerolite, had, however, been an object of popular adoration long before Mahomet preserved it from destruction by giving it a place in a new and more enduring superstition; and the Kâabeh itself, though ruined and rebuilt again and again, the last time in 1627, till not a vestige probably of the original structure now remains, has yet, it appears, certainly preserved the outline, and, in all essential respects, the dimensions of the original pagan shrine. It is an oblong massive structure, almost a trapezium, though the sides and angles are slightly unequal; its length 18 paces, its breadth 14, and its height from 35 to 40 feet. There are no windows, and the only entrance door is placed 7 feet above the ground; the entire building is of large, irregular, and unpolished blocks of ordinary stone. Its ornamentation is wholly modern.

Lastly, several wells, jotted with seeming capriciousness over the desert, are said to be, and probably are, of great antiquity; certainly they are works which much exceed the skill of the Arabs of our own day. One such, “Beer Shekeef” by name, in the north-west of the peninsula, presents a cylinder of about 5 feet in diameter at top, but gradually enlarging till it reaches the water at a depth of nearly 200 feet, and is lined with hewn stone throughout. The Arabs declare it to be a work of pre-Islamitic times. Less remarkable in its proportions, but not less ancient, is the holy well called of Zemzem, at Mecca. But this and the great mosque of that city, as also the famous mosque of Medinah, which encloses the tomb of the prophet, and other buildings of the same category, will find their proper place in other articles. So will also the celebrated excavations of Petra, which, besides their being beyond the limits of Arabia proper, are not in themselves Arab but Graeco-Roman in their character. With regard to the numerous mosques and other buildings, some of great beauty, erected by Arab architects in conquered countries, as in Syria, Egypt, Africa, or Spain, they are in fact nothing more than adaptations of the various local styles, and often of the very materials that the conquerors found ready to their hand.

But if poor in architectural, Arabia is superabundantly rich in literary monuments. Passing over as of more than doubtful authenticity the verses ascribed to kings and heroes of Yemen, especially at dates of a thousand years or more before the Christian era, we find undeniable specimens, at least two full centuries before Mahomet, of poems which in vigour and polish yield to few ever composed in the Arab or in any other language. To give at length the names and stories of the authors, many of them men, and even women, no less distinguished in their day by the sword than by the pen, would be, in a brief review like this, merely to note a dry and unmeaning catalogue. Suffice it that, even at this early date, we find the metrical and rhythmical laws, simple yet susceptible of the highest art, which have ever since regulated Arab poetry, already laid down in their completeness, and exemplified, the former by a scansion of almost Ξoratian elegance and variety, the latter by a severe nicety that Pope himself might have admired, but could hardly have imitated. Divided into sixteen classes, each class including several variations, the metres are based, like the Greek and Roman, on long and [9:2:263] i>lιort vowels, irrespective of accent, but admitting caesura, elision, and every prosodiacal delicacy. Some are adapted to gay, some to serious topics: love, war, description, moral precepts, philosophical speculation, elegy, satire—all find here their appropriate expression. The rhyme, which often involves not one but two syllables, is in every piece determined by that of the opening line. Alternate rhymes, choruses, and accentuated instead of quantitative metre, did not appear till later, and were imitated from extraArab models.

Yearly, at the festival of Okad, the best masters of the art used to meet for the purpose of reciting their compositions, and receiving the reward, not of applause only, but also of more tangible advantages. Eulogies of chiefs, rulers, and distinguished men, formed a considerable portion of the poetry of those days; and a single ode or “kaseedah,” as it was called, has been known to be rewarded, according to the means or liberality of the person eulogised, with a hundred valuable camels, or several thousand gold pieces. Love and war had also their inevitable share in the domain of verse, and descriptions of manner and scenery occur, though rarely in comparison. Lastly, elegies—some of them very touching in their deep and tender melancholy —and didactic pieces, chiefly ethical, take rank among the most carefully finished productions of the early Arab muse. Meanwhile, the greater number of poets had each his special patron, whose generosity took charge of the remuneration that in our days is looked for from the press; while a greater degree of publicity was given to a few chosen works of genius by the custom of suspending in some place of common resort (the Kâabeh, it is asserted) such pieces as in the yearly gatherings of Okad had obtained the highest palm of acknowledged excellence. Seven of these, known in Arab literature by the title of the Mιiallakat or “Suspended,” as being emphatically the best of their kind, and all of them belonging to the 6th century, have become for succeeding ages the accepted and classical standards of Arab poetical composition.

Written prose up to the date of Mahomet’s appearance there was absolutely none; and spoken eloquence, though always highly esteemed and diligently cultivated among the Arabs, had never been embodied in the permanence of writing. The irregular, half-rhythmical, half-rhyming sentences of the Koran were the first attempt in the direction of prose, which afterwards came into general use, and was applied to history, biography, philosophical treatises, romance, and every other description of subject. But prose never emancipated itself wholly from its original trammels of a misapplied cadence, to which was also too often added a redundant phraseology, the latter partly due to Persian literary influence; this florid style being, however, with many authors varied by breaks, as it were, of writing as excessive in its plainness as the other in its ornamentation.

But if unsuccessful in prose, the Arabs were not so in poetry. This, even before the era of the prophet, had, as we have seen, attained no ordinary degree of excellence; and it reached its highest point during the following century, under the Ommiade dynasty, when Omar Ebn Rabeeyah, of the tribe of Koreysh; Jameel, of the Benoo Adhrah; Jareer and Farazdak, both of Tameem; and Noseyyeb, a negro by birth—the first and second masters of erotic, the third and fourth of satirical, and the fifth of descriptive poetry—with a cloud of lesser celebrities, lived and sang in the sunshine of the Damascene court. The 8th and 9th centuries, agitated by civil dissensions or oppressed by the tyranny of the Abbasides, were less favourable to the Muses, till the reaction of the Greek and Persian minds, with which the Arab spirit was now yearly brought into more intimate contact, gave rise to a new and brilliant school, less true to the simplicity of nature or the purity of Arab diction, but richer in imagery and deeper in philosophic thought, illustrating, too, the transition from the objective to the subjective which has accompanied and half veiled decline in the literature of every nation, turn after turn. Abu-Teman, of the tribe of Tai, known not as a poet only, but also as a critic and the compiler of the celebrated anthology, the Hamasa, the “Golden Treasury” of the Arabs, first came forward in this field. His successor, the well-known Mutenebhe, is still esteemed by many the greatest of Arab poets; in range of thought and polish of diction he certainly excels all besides. Later still, in the 11th century, appeared Toghrai, who in his Lameyyalι, the title of his principal piece, entered the lists against Shanfarah, the most brilliant of pre-Islamitic poets, and, it seems, furnished our own Tennyson with the model of his “Locksley Hall while a little later, Ebn Faridh, in Egypt, composed the mystico-erotic volume that has never in its kind been surpassed, or even equalled, by the poets of any land.

With the decline of the Arab race, however, their muse 1 drooped also, and for many centuries maintained but a 1 languishing existence, which in our own time has been galvanised rather than invigorated into a kind of revival by the modern literary schools of Beyrout, Damascus, Baghdad, and the Hejaz. In Nejd, Yemen, and Oman, rough poems on the primitive Arab model, besides others modulated with alternate rhymes, and in which accent takes the place of prosody, a species commonly called “Nabtee” or Naba-thean verse, are yet in vogue. The Hispano-Arab poets, mostly mere imitators, and in bad taste too, need not detain us here. Epic and dramatic poetry were never even attempted by the Arabs.

Romance, analogous though not similar to the European novel, was always a favourite branch of Arab literature; and in the Thousand and One Nights it obtained a worldwide celebrity and success. The original of this entertaining work appears to have been composed in Baghdad about the IIth century; another less popular but very spirited version is probably of Tunisian authorship, and somewhat later in date. The stories of Antarah, of the Benoo Hilal, of Mohalhel, of Barakat, and countless others, belong to the same class of writings, though cast in more of a biographical form, not unlike that adopted by the great Defoe. Strictly objective in character, the Arab novel, though often a vivid portraiture of the outside of men and customs, has never portrayed, or attempted to portray, the inner workings of the human mind.

With memoirs, biographies, collections of anecdotes, and the Eke, Arab literature is stored in excess, the bulk of such works being, as might be supposed, of somewhat superficial interest; while not a few of them are, on the contrary, possessed of great merit, and value. Thus the Book of Songs, or “Kitab el Aghanee," composed in the latter part of the 10th century by Abu-Faraj, of Ispahan, and containing, in twenty successive volumes, short but entertaining notices of all the principal Arab poets or singers, with specimens of their compositions, is, in addition to its speciality, a perfect treasure of the most varied information regarding the men and the times; and the Life of Mahomet, by Abul-Feda, of Aleppo, displays considerable critical acumen as well as narrative power. Nor should we forget the judiciously-selected biographies of Mahometan celebrities by Ebn Khallikan, in the 12th century, or those of Koteybah of an earlier date; but of such compositions as these the Arab name is legion.

History, however, proved from first to last an effort 1 beyond Arab skill, which contented itself with the less intellectual task of multiplying chronicles to an almost unparalleled amount. In this the voluminous work of Ebn [9:2:264] Atheer, which, after commencing the Arab annals, along with those of the world from the creation itself, carries them down to the overthrow of the Abbaside caliphate in the 13th century; that of Musa’oodee, containing a pre-Islamitic summary of the geography and history of the world in general, till the birth of Mahomet, after which the chronicle confines itself exclusively to the fortunes of the Arab empire; and that of Abul-Feda, especially interesting by its curious notices of pagan Arabia, may be mentioned as favourable specimens in their line. In particular, Egypt was amply chronicled by Makreezee and Siyootee; Spain by Makkaree; Africa by Ebn Kateeb; Syria and Baghdad by writers out of number. A more voluminous, and, it must be added, a more childish collection of writings could scarcely be found in any language.

We may imagine (for it would be a waste of time to catalogue) the theological writings, glossaries, commentaries, discourses, and so forth, which, from the first century of Mahometanism to the extinction of Arab empire, have illustrated or obscured the great book on which that empire was founded—the Koran. Beydawee in the 10th, Jelal-ed-deen and Bokharee in the 11 th, and El Ghazalee in the 12th century of our era, each was in his day considered a master in Islam, and their treatises are still reverentially studied in its schools. Legal dissertations by Malek, Ebn Hanbal, Shafeyee, Hanefee, and their disciples, load the shelves of every Arab bookcase; but the authors themselves were mostly of extra-Arab origin, and often reflect the Persian, the Turkoman, and even the Byzantine, rather than the genuine Arab mind.

From the fancies of astrology, in which the early Arabs —not wiser than their neighbours, but favoured with clearer skies—seem to have indulged freely, and which, though discountenanced by the practical good sense of Mahomet himself, have never been wholly abandoned by their descendants, a not unnatural transition led to the more useful study of astronomy. Specially patronised by the Abbaside caliph Al-Mamun, the Augustus of his race (813-833 a.d.), this science made great and rapid progress. The obliquity of the ecliptic, the diameter of the earth, and even the precession of the equinoxes, were then calculated with commendable accuracy; and shortly after, Abul-Mezar ’ s Introduction to Astronomy and his Treatise on the Conjunction of the Planets, with the Elements of Al-Furjanee (though this last author was largely indebted to the Egyptian labours of Ptolemy), proved that the caliph’s liberality had been well bestowed. But Al-Batinee, a native of Syria (879-920 a.d.), surpassed all his predecessors in the nicety alike of his observations and computations. Geber, at Seville, constructed (1196 a.d.) the first astronomical observatory on record; and Ebn-Korrah in Egypt proved by his example that the Arabs could be even better astronomers than the Greeks had been before them. Yet although the doctrine of attraction seems to have been dimly surmised by some of them, none ever succeeded in emancipating themselves from the clumsy and erroneous Ptolemaic geocentric system.

In mathematics the Arabs based themselves on what they had acquired from the Greek and Indian originals; the former gave them geometry, the latter algebra. Satisfied at first with translations of Euclid, Apollonius, and others, they ultimately left their masters behind. They reached in the 10th century the limits of spherical trigonometry, and solved quadratic and even cubic equations. In these studies the astronomers Geber and Ebn-Moosa chiefly distinguished themselves. Optics, too, and hydrostatics were investigated by the professors of Baghdad; but no special progress or remarkable discoveries are recorded as having been made in these sciences. In mixed as well as in pure mathematics the leading-strings of the Greek became the fetters of the Arab mind. Their practical application, however, of hydraulics in the construction of wells, waterworks, reservoirs, sluices, canals, and the like, does them great credit; and of this peculiar skill ample traces, ill maintained by succeeding governments, remain in Spain, North Africa, Egypt, Syria, and Mesopotamia.

Debarred by religious scruples from the representation of animated forms in sculpture or painting, Arab decorators (for they are no more) found themselves restricted to vegetable or fantastic patterns and colour combinations, and in these, as the Spanish Alhambra and other buildings can testify, showed themselves no mean proficients. They made great use of glazed tiles and stucco, and possessed the art—one that they have lost long ago—of staining glass. Lastly, music, as the handmaid and enhancer of poetry, was a favourite and honoured pursuit among the Arabs, who, with comparatively rough instruments,—the rudiments of the flute, harp, tabor, and guitar, rather than the instruments themselves,—and with a scale, carefully and scientifically elaborated, but essentially differing from our own, produced results that real excellence alone could have merited or obtained. The voluminous “Book of Songs” already alluded to contained the history and points out the distinctive characteristics of a hundred airs, each esteemed a masterpiece by competent judges. For one alone its composer received from the Caliph Al-Nathik Billah (842 a.d. ) a sum equivalent to nearly £2300 sterling. It is noticeable that though the best voices were furnished by the Hejaz, the instrumental and scientific part was perfected by Persian instruction under the Abbaside caliphs of Baghdad.

More widely recognised, however, are the Arab claims to proficiency in medicine, an art which Mahomet himself appears to have dabbled in, showing himself, if tradition speaks true, by no means so good a physician as he was a preacher. Under the caliphs, however, regular schools of the therapeutic science were established in Damascus, Baghdad, and Cairo, where the works of Hippocrates and Galen, translated from their originals in Greek, were adopted as the basis of instruction. Hence the great medical treatise entitled El-Melekei, or “The Royal,” of Ali-Ebn-Abbas, which appeared in Aleppo towards the end of the tenth century, was essentially an enlargement of and appendix to the Galenic teaching. Shortly after Er-Razi, the Baghdad professor, published his writings on pathology, containing the first authentic description of exanthematous diseases. The Canon of Ebn-Sina, commonly known as Avicenna, born 980 a.d., with his Materia Medica, which preluded in some respects that of Paracelsus, ultimately, however, superseded every other work in the Arab schools. But the neglect of anatomical study, with a superstitious horror of the practice of dissection, rendered the surgery of the Arabs imperfect and their medicine empirical. The invention of the probang and some improvements in the lancet and the couching needle are due, nevertheless, to Arab surgeons.

Botany was chiefly studied as subsidiary to medicine; nor did chemistry ever attain the dignity of a separate science; as, however, an adjunct to the old herbal pharmacopoeia, it received close and not unsuccessful attention. The principal mercurial and arsenical preparations of the materia medica, the sulphates of several metals, the properties of acids and alkalies, the distillation of alcohol,—in fine, whatever resources chemistry availed itself of up to a very recent date—were, with their practical application, known to Er-Razi and Geber, already mentioned. In fact, the numerous terms borrowed from the Arabic language— alcohol, for instance, alkali, alembic, and others—with the signs of drugs and the like, still in use among modem apothecaries, have remained to show how deeply this science is indebted to Arab research.
[9:2:265]

Finally, and as though to counteract any foreign influence that the cultivation of these exotic sciences might correlatively introduce, Arab grammar and rhetoric were, from the days of the first Ommiade to those of the last Abbaside caliph, considered an indispensable item of respectable education. Every nicety of the language was investigated in the 8th, 9th, and 10th centuries by the rival schools of Cufa and Bosrah; and the Alfeeyah, a grammatical treatise of the celebrated Ebn-Maiek, a native of the latter city, who flourished in the 9th century, is even now the standard work in the hand of every professor. But for absolute mastership, joined with exquisite taste, in the use of the subtlest refinements both of rhetoric and grammar, the palm must be assigned to Hareeree, the author of the celebrated Makamat or Stations, a work esteemed by many as hardly less wonderful in the talent it displays than the Koran itself. It belongs to the 11th century, and though it has had many imitators, has never yet acknowledged a rival.

Industrious and enterprising, the Arabs led the way by their invention and skill to most of the more complicated manufactures of our own times. In metallurgy, their art in tempering and enamelling has become justly famous; nor did any sword-blades ever rank higher than those of Damascus, nor any coppersmiths excel those of Baghdad, or gold and silver workmanship that of Oman. Specimens of their skill in porcelain yet remain in Spain and Syria; while the popular words “morocco” and “cordovan” attest their cleverness in preparing and dyeing leather. The pendulum and the semaphoric telegraph, if not invented, as some think, by the Arabs, were certainly introduced by them into Europe, as was also the manufacture of silk and of cotton, and an invention of the highest value—the mariner’s compass. As early as 706 a.d. writing-paper was made at Mecca, whence it spread through all the Arabian dominions, and ultimately reached the Western world. In the discovery or use of gunpowder, so far back as the 11th century, the Arab claim to priority is contested by the Byzantines alone.

In a word, the literature, arts, and sciences of the Arabs: formed the connecting-link between the civilisations of 1 ancient and modern times; and the culture which they 1 introduced into the countries they conquered has in almost every instance outlasted the rule of the conquerors themselves. To them, directly and indirectly, we owe the revival of learning and philosophy in Western Europe, and the first awakening of the critical and inquiring spirit that has in great measure rescued Europe from the lethargy of monkish ignorance and ecclesiastical bigotry; to them also, at least indirectly and by deduction, are due most of the useful arts and practical inventions laboriously perfected by later nations. Wide-spread as was the empire of the Arab sword, it has been less extended and less durable than the empire of the Arab mind. (w. o. p.)
