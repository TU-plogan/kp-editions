LANNES, Jean (1769-1809), marshal of France, was born at Lectoure, 11th April 1769. He was the son of a livery stables keeper, and was himself in early life apprenticed to a dyer. He had had but little education, but notwithstanding this his great strength and proficiency in all manly sports caused him in 1792 to be elected sergeant-major of the battalion of volunteers of Gers, which he had joined on the breaking out of the war between Spain and the French republic. He served through the campaigns in the Pyrenees in 1793 and 1794, and in the latter year was elected chef de brigade. However, in 1795, on the reform of the army introduced by the Thermidorians, he was dismissed from his rank. Not discouraged by this check, he re-enlisted as a simple volunteer in the army of Italy. In the famous campaign of 1796 he again fought his way up to high rank, being eventually made once more chef de brigade by Bonaparte. He was distinguished in every battle, and was wounded at Arcola. He was chosen by Bonaparte to accompany him to Egypt as general of one of Kléber’s brigades, in which capacity he greatly distinguished himself, especially on the retreat from Syria. He went with Bonaparte to France, assisted at the 18th Brumaire, and was appointed general of division, and commandant of the consular guard. He commanded the advanced guard in the crossing of the Alps in 1800, was instrumental in winning the battle of Montebello, from which he afterwards took his title, and bore the brunt of the battle of Marengo. In 1801 Napoleon tried his favourite general as a diplomatist, and sent him as ambassador to Portugal. Opinions differ as to his merits in this capacity, but it may be presumed that Napoleon did not believe in them, as he never made such use of him again. On the establishment of the empire he was created a marshal of France, and commanded once more the advanced guard of a great French army in the campaign of Austerlitz. At Austerlitz he commanded the left, at Jena the centre, and at Friedland the centre of the French army, showing himself a general of division of the greatest merit, carrying out the orders given him to the letter, and never thinking them impossible. He was now to be tried as a commanderin-chief, for Napoleon took him to Spain in 1808, and gave him a corps d’armée, with which he won a victory over Castanos on November 22. In January 1809 he was sent to attempt the capture of Saragossa, and by February 21 was in possession of the place. Napoleon then created him Due de Montebello, and once more, for the last time, gave him the command of the advanced guard of an army of invasion. At Aspern he was ordered with two divisions to cut the Austrian army under the archduke Charles in half; he succeeded entirely, though under a heavy fire, but finding himself unsupported by Napoleon, who had been thrown into confusion by the news that his bridges over the Danube had been broken, he had to retreat. During the retreat he exposed himself as usual to the hottest fire, and received a mortal wound. As he was being carried from the field to die at Vienna, he is said to have met and reproached his old general for his ambition; but this, to say the least, is a contested statement. Napoleon said of him that “he had found him a pigmy, and made him a giant”; and there can be no doubt of his marvellous ability on the field, and his extraordinary courage. His eldest son was made a peer of France by Louis XVIII.

A Vie militaire de J. Lannes was published in 1809 by René Perin, but details can be found in all the military histories of the time.
