LINGARD, John (1771-1851), the Roman Catholic historian of England, was born of humble parentage at Winchester on February 5, 1771. His intellectual abilities began to manifest themselves at a very early age, and in 1782 he was sent to the English college at Douay, where he continued until shortly after the declaration of war by England (1793). For some time after his return to England he lived as tutor in the family of Lord Stourton, but in October 1794 he settled along with seven other former members of the old Douay college at Crook Hall near Durham, where on the completion of his theological course he became vice-president of the reorganized seminary. In 1795 he was ordained priest, and soon afterwards undertook the charge of the chairs of natural and moral philosophy. In 1808 he accompanied the community of Crook Hall to the new and more commodious buildings at Ushaw, Durham, but in 1811, after declining the presidency of the college at Maynooth, he withdrew to the secluded mission at Hornby in Lancashire, where for the rest of his life he found the leisure which his literary pursuits demanded. In 1817 he visited Rome, where he made some researches in the Vatican Library, and also negotiated some business connected with the English college. In 1821 Pope Pius VII. created him doctor of divinity and of canon and civil law; and in 1825 Leo XII. is said to have made him cardinal in petto. He died at Hornby on July 17, 1851.

Lingard was the author of a considerable number of occasional and ephemeral writings of an avowedly controversial character. He also wrote The Antiquities of the Anglo-Saxon Church (1806), of which a third and greatly enlarged addition appeared in 1845 under the title The History and Antiquities of the Anglo-Saxon Church; containing an account of its origin, government, doctrines, worship, revenues, and clerical and monastic institutions ; but the work with which his name is chiefly associated is A History of England·, from the first invasion by the Romans to the commencement of the reign of William III., which appeared originally in 8 vols, at intervals between 1819 and 1830. Three successive subsequent editions had the benefit of extensive revision by the author; a fifth edition in 10 vols. 8vo appeared in 1849, and a sixth, with life of the author by Tierney prefixed to vol. x., in 1854-55. Soon after its appearance it was translated into French, German, and Italian. It is a work of ability and research; and, though Cardinal Wiseman certainly claimed too much for its author when he called him “the only impartial historian of our country,” yet the candid and dispassionate student will always find it profitable to learn from the pages of Lingard the aspects which the events of English histoιy presented to the mind of an able and intense Roman Catholic in the earlier decades of the 19th century.
