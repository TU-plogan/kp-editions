LILY, Lilium, the typical genus of Liliaceee, embraces nearly fifty species, all confined to the northern hemisphere, about fifteen being natives of Japan and China, six of the mountains of India, eight of south Europe, five of the east and nine of the west coasts of North America. The earliest in cultivation were described in 1597 by Gerard (Herball, p. 146), who figures eight kinds of European (true) lilies, viz., L. album (L ∣ . candidum, L.), and a variety, L. bizantinum, two umbellate forms of the type L. bulbiferum, Park., named L. aureum and L. cruentum latifolium, and three with pendulous flowers, apparently forms of the martagon lily. Parkinson, in his Paradisus (1629), described five varieties of martagon, six of umbellate kinds—two white ones, and L. pomponium, L. chalcedonicum, L. carniolicum, and L. pyrenaicum— together with one American, L. canadense, which had been introduced in 1629. For the ancient and mediaeval history of the lily, see Μ. de Cannart d’Hamale’s Monographie historique et littéraire des Lis (Malines, 1870). Since that period many new species have been added. The latest authorities for description and classification of the genus are J. G. Baker (“Revision of the Genera and Species of Tulipeae,” Journ. of Linn. Soc., xiv. p. 211, 1874) and J. H. Elwes (Monograph of the Genus Lilium, 1877-78), who first tested all the species under cultivation, and has published every one beautifully figured by W. H. Fitch, and some hybrids. With respect to the production of these latter, the genus is remarkable for its power of resisting the influence of foreign pollen, for the seedlings of any species, when crossed, generally resemble that which bears them. For the hardier kinds in cultivation, reference may be had to Hemsley’s Handbook of Hardy Trees, <fcc∙, p. 501. The structure of a lily is of simple type, consisting of two whorls, of three free parts each, six free stamens, and a consolidated pistil of three carpels, ripening into a three valved capsule containing many winged seeds. In form, the flower assumes three types :—trumpet-shaped, with a more or less elongated tube, e.g., L. loηgiflorum and L. candidum ; an open form with spreading perianth leaves, e.g., L. αuratum∙ 3 or assuming a pendulous habit, with the lips strongly reflexed, e.g., the martagon type. All have scaly bulbs, which in three west American species, as L. Humboldti, are remarkable for being somewhat intermediate between a bulb and a creeping rhizome. L. bulbiferum and its allies produce aerial reproductive bulbils in the axils of the leaves. The bulbs of several species are eaten, such as of L. avenaceum in Kamchatka, of L. Martagon by the Cossacks, and of L. tigrinum, the “tiger lily,” in China and Japan. Medicinal uses were ascribed to the species, but none appear to have any marked properties in this respect. See Horticulture, vol. xii. p. 257.

The white lily, L. candidum, the ∖Aρwν of the Greeks, was one of the commonest garden flowers of antiquity, appearing in the poets from Homer downwards side by side with the rose and the violet. According to Hehn, roses and lilies entered Greece from the east by way of Phrygia, Thrace, and Macedonia (.Kulturpflanzen und Ηaus-thiere, 3d ed., p. 217). The word λdριοv itself, from which lilium is derived by assimilation of consonants, appears to be Eranian (Ibid., p. 527), and according to ancient etymologists (Lagarde, Ges. Abh., p. 227) the town of Susa was connected with the Persian name of the lily s-ûsan (Gr. <τουσοv, Heb. shôshari). Mythologically the white lily, RοsaJunοnis, was fabled to have sprung from the milk of Hera. As the plant of purity it was contrasted with the rose of Aphrodite. The word κρίνον, on the other hand, included red and purple lilies, Plim, II. N., xxi. 5 (11,12), the red lily being best known in Syria and Judaea (Phaselis). This perhaps is the “red lily of Constantinople” of Gerarde, B. chdlcedonicum, L. The lily of the Old Testament (shδshan) may be conjectured to be a red lily from the simile in Cant. v. 13, unless the allusion is to the fragrance rather than the colour of the lips, in which case the white lily must be thought of. The “lilies of the field,” Matt. vi. 28, are κρίνα, and the comparison of their beauty with royal robes suggests their identification with the red Syrian lily of Pliny. Lilies, however, are not a conspicuous feature in the flora of Palestine, and the red anemone (Anemone coronaria), with which all the hill-sides of Galilee are dotted in the spring, is perhaps more likely to have suggested the figure. For the lily in the pharmacopoeia of the ancients see Adams’s Paid. Aegineta, iii. 196. It was usedin unguents and against the bites of snakes, &c. In the Middle Ages the flower continued to be common, and was taken as the symbol of heavenly purity. The three golden lilies of France are said to have been originally three lance-heads.
