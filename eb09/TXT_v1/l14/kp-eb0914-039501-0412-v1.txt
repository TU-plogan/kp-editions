LEBANON, a manufacturing “borough” of the United States, capital of Lebanon county, Pennsylvania, is situated on the Union Canal, 24 miles east of Harrisburg by the Lebanon Valley branch of the Philadelphia and Reading Railway. It is substantially built in brick and stone, and is steadily increasing in importance. Its principal industrial establishments are blast furnaces, rolling mills, car-works, planing mills, foundries, and manufactories of organs, paper, cigars, carriages, and agricultural implements. About 7 miles distant are the Cornwall Ore Banks, three eminences—Grassy, Middle, and Big Hill— consisting almost entirely of iron-ore veined with copper. The town was laid out in 1750, and incorporated as a borough in 1813; gas was introduced in 1857, and in 1872 water was brought into the place by gravitation at an expense of $250,000. The population of Lebanon has increased from 2184 in 1850 to 6727 in 1870, and 8778 in 1880.
