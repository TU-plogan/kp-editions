LIQUIDAM BAR, Liquid Amber, or Sweet Gum, is a product of Liquidambar styraciflua, L., order Hamamelideae, a deciduous tree of from 30 to 50 feet high and attaining 15 feet in circumference in Mexico, of which country it is a native, as well as of the greater portion of the United States. It bears palmately-lobed leaves, somewhat resembling those of the maple, but larger. The male and female inflorescences are on different branches of the same tree, the globular heads of fruit resembling those of the plane. This species is nearly allied to L. orientalis, Miller, a native of a very restricted portion of the south-west coast of Asia Minor, where it forms forests. It is from the bark of this latter tree that the storax of the ancients (Herod., iii. 107; Diosc., i. 79), the medicinal styrax of to-day, is prepared (Bentley and Trimen, Med. Plants, No. 107). The earliest record of the tree appears to be in a Spanish work by F. Hernandez, published in 1651, in which he describes it as a large tree producing a fragrant gum resembling liquid amber, whence the name (Nov. Plant., &c., p. 56). In Ray’s Historia Plantarum (1686) it is called Styrax liquida. It was introduced into Europe in 1681 by Banister, the missionary collector sent out by Bishop Compton, who planted it in the palace gardens at Fulham.

The wood is very compact and fine-grained,—the heartwood being reddish, and, when cut into planks, marked transversely with blackish belts. It is employed for veneering in New York. Being readily dyed black, it is sometimes used instead of ebony for picture frames, balusters, &c.; but it is too liable to decay for out-door work. The principal product of the tree, however, is the resinous gum which issues from between the bark and wood. It is sometimes called white balsam of Peru, or liquid storax, though it is said by Michaux (Les Végétaux résineux, ii. p. 337) to differ materially from the latter. It is considered to be styptic and to possess healing and balsamic properties, being stimulant and aromatic. It possesses nearly the same properties as the balsam of Peru and of Tolu, for which it is often substituted, as well as for storax. Mixed with tobacco, the gum was used for smoking at the court of the Mexican emperors (Humb., iv. 10). It has been long used in France as a perfume for gloves, &c. It is mainly produced in Mexico, little being obtained from trees growing in higher latitudes of North America, or in England. For localities where it has been observed, see Pickering’s Chron. Hist, of Plants, p. 741.
