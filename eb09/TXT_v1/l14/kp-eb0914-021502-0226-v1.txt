LAIBACH, or Laybach (Slovenian, Ljubljana), capital of the duchy of Carniola, Austria, is situated on the Laibach near its influx into the Save, and on the Crown Prince Rudolph and Austrian Southern Railways, 45 miles north-east of Trieste, in 46° 3' N. lat., 14° 31' E. long. It consists of the town proper and eight suburbs, and possesses a cathedral in the Italian style, ten churches, the palaces of the prince and count of Auersperg, an ancient castle on the Schlossberg now used as a military depot and prison, besides the usual public buildings and educational establishments of a provincial capital and episcopal see. There are manufactories of earthenware, linen and woollen cloth, silk, fire-hose, and cigars; oil, paper, and chicory mills; a sugar refinery, and a bell-foundry. On the 31st December 1880 the civil population was 24,618 (11,185 males, 13,433 females); together with the military it was 26,284. The native language is Slovenian, but the educated classes speak German or Italian.

Laibach occupies the site of the ancient Emona or Aemona. In 388 A. D. Emona was visited by the emperor Theodosius; in 400 it was besieged by Alaric; and in 451 it was desolated by the Huns. In 900 Laibach suffered much from the Magyars, who were, however, defeated there in 914. In the 12th century the town passed into the hands of the dukes of Carinthia; in 1270 it was taken by Ottocarof Bohemia; and in 1277 it came under the sway of the Hapsburgs. In the early part of the 15th century the town was several times besieged by the Turks. The bishopric was founded in 1461. On the 17th March 1797 and again 3d June 1809 Laibach was taken by the French, and from 1809 to 1813 it became the seat of their general government of the Illyrian provinces. From 1816 to 1849 Laibach was the capital of the kingdom of Illyria. For the congress of Laibach (January to May 1821) see vol. xiii. p. 486.
