LAUNCESTON, the second town of Tasmania, is situated in the north of the island, at the point where the North and South Esk unite to form the river Tamar. It is the northern terminus of the railway from Hobart Town (120 miles distant), and has regular communication by steamer with Melbourne. Among the places of note are [9:14:348] the Government buildings, the town-hall, a theatre, two hospitals, a public library, and a convent of the Presentation Order. The population was 10,100 in 1847, 10,668 in 1870, and 12,753 in 1881. Launceston began to be an important settlement not long after the first colonization of Tasmania. St John’s Church (Episcopal) dates from 1824. The town was incorporated in 1858.
