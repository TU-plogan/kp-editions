+=====================================================================+


LENCLOS, Ninon de (1615-1705), was the daughter of a gentleman of good position in Touraine. Her long and eventful life divides into two periods, during the former of which she was the typical Frenchwoman of the gayest and most licentious society of the 17th century, during the latter the recognized leader of the fashion in Paris, and the friend of wits and poets. Of her earlier life the less said the better, and in her defence all that can be pleaded is that she had been educated by her father in the epicurean and sensual beliefs made popular by Montaigne, and that she retained throughout the frank demeanour, and disregard of money, which won from Saint Évremond the remark that she was an honnête homme. Against her, and the numerous specious defences set up for her by contemporaneous and subsequent French writers, must be mentioned her absolute want of maternal feeling and even of natural shame. The well-known visit of Queen Christina to her attests the extent of her renown, or infamy, and the inefficacy of the threats of Anne of Austria prove her power. Of a perfectly different character was her later life, when, though she had continued her career of debauchery for a preposterous length of time, she settled down to the social leadership of Paris. Then there were to be found in her salon all that was most witty and refinedin France,—“ladies as well as gentlemen of the highest birth,” remarks a correspondent to Madame de Sevigné, poets like Molière, abbés like Chateauneuf, Genevese preachers like Turretin, the protégé of Saint Évremond. It became the fashion for young men as well as old to throng round her, and the best of all introductions for a young man who wished to make a figure in society was an introduction to Mdlle. de Lenclos. The cause for this surpassing social success is to be found perhaps as much in her past notoriety, and past intimacy with the great names of the last generation, as in the wit and tact, to which Saint Évremond, and after him Sainte-Beuve, ascribe it. Her long friendship with Saint Évremond must be shortly noticed. They were of the same age, and had been intimate in their youth, and throughout his long exile the wit seems to have kept a kind remembrance of Ninon. The few really authentic letters of Ninon herself are those addressed to her old friend, and the letters of both in the last few years of their equally long lives are exceptionally touching, and unique in the polite compliments with which they try to keep off old age. If Ninon owes part of her posthumous fame to the old wit, she owes at least as much to the young Arouet, who was presented to her as a promising boy poet by the abbé de Chateauneuf, to whom she left 2000 francs to buy books, and who, as Voltaire, was to write a letter on her which was to be the chief authority of many subsequent biographers. Her personal appearance is, according to Sainte-Beuve, best described in a novel of Mdlle. de Scudéry, and the characteristic of it was neither beauty nor wit, but high spirits, and perfect evenness of temperament.

The letters of Ninon published after her death were, according to Voltaire, all spurious, and the only authentic ones are those to Saint Évremond, which can be best studied in DauxmesniΓs edition of Saint Évremond, and his notice on her. Sainte-Beuve has an interesting notice of these letters in the Causeries du Lundi, vol. iv. Most biographies of Ninon are full of unauthentic stories.
