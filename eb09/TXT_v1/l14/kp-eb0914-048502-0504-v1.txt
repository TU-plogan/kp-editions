+=====================================================================+


LEVEN, Alexander Leslie, Earl of, one of the most distinguished soldiers of his time, was born about the close of the 16th century. He was descended from a younger son of the ancient Scottish family of Balquhain. His father was George Leslie of Balgonie, commander of the castle of Blair, and his mother was Anne, daughter of Stewart of Ballechin. At his first outset in life he acted as a volunteer in Lord Vere’s regiment in Holland, fighting with the Dutch against the encroachments of Spain, where he rose to the rank of captain. He then entered the service of Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, and became field-marshal. In 1628, when the town of Stralsund was besieged by Wallenstein, and reduced almost to the last extremity, the king of Sweden sent Leslie to take the command of the garrison, and he acted with such resolution that he obliged the count to raise the siege. For this service medals were struck in his honour. In 1630 he drove the imperialists out of the island of Rügen, and continued to serve with great distinction in the Swedish armies till the troubles in Scotland brought him home. In 1639 he was invited by the Covenanters to take the command of their army. One of his first exploits was to take the castle of Edinburgh by surprise, without the loss of a man. He commanded the Scottish army at Dunse Law in May of that year, and in 1640 he invaded England, and defeated a party of the king’s troops at Newburn, which gave him possession of Newcastle and other towns. At the treaty with the king at Ripon, Leslie was one of the commissioners of the parliament, and Charles was so well pleased with his behaviour that he created him Lord Balgonie and Earl of Leven, by patent dated 1641.

After suppressing an insurrection in Ireland in 1642, he was in 1643 appointed to the command of the Scottish army sent to assist the parliamentary party against King Charles, but after the execution of that prince he warmly espoused the cause of his son, and served as a volunteer against Cromwell at the unfortunate battle of Dunbar in 1650. Next year, however, a gathering at Alyth of Angus loyalists, of whom Leslie was one, was surprised and captured by the troops of General Monk, who was then besieging Dundee. The earl with some others was sent to London and confined in the Tower, where he remained incarcerated for some time, till by the intercession of the queen of Sweden he obtained his liberty. After visiting the queen, and thanking her in person for this service, he retired to his seat at Balgonie in Fifeshire and died there at an advanced age in 1661. He is said to have been of a diminutive size, and deformed in person, but prudent, vigilant, and expert in war. He acquired considerable landed property, particularly Inchmartin in the Carse of Gowrie, which he called Inchleslie. His granddaughter married George, earl of Melville; their descendant, the present representative of the title (1882), is twelfth earl of Leven and ninth earl of Melville.
