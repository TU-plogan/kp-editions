LAC is a compound resinous and tinctorial incrustation formed on the twigs and young branches of various trees by an insect, Coccus lacca (Cartema lacca of Signoret), which infests them. The species of trees upon which it is principally obtained include Urostigma religiosa, U. indica, Croton laccifera, C. sanguifera, Aleumtes laccifera, Carissa spinarιιm, Mimosa cinerea, Erythmna indica, Inga dulcis, Butea frondosa, Zizyphus Jujuba, Vismia laccifera, Feronia elephantιιm, and Vatica laccifera. Lac is a product of the East Indies, coming especially from Bengal, Pegu, Siam, and Assam. The insect which yields it is closely allied to the cochineal insect, Coccus cacti, kermes, C. ilicis, and Polish grains, C. ρolonicus, all of which, like the lac insect, yield a red dye colour. The term lac (Laksha, Sanskrit; Lakh, Hindi) is the same as the numeral lakh—a hundred thousand—and is indicative of the countless hosts of insects which make their appearance with every successive generation. Two evolutions of the young of the lac coccus make their appearance annually, one about the beginning of July and the other early in December. As soon as the minute larval insects make their appearance they fasten in myriads on the young shoots, and, inserting their long proboscides into the bark, draw their nutriment from the sap of the plant. The insects begin at once to exude the resinous secretion over their entire bodies, which forms in effect a cocoon, and, the separate exudations coalescing, a continuous hard resinous layer regularly honeycombed with small cavities is deposited [9:14:182] over and around the twig. From this living tomb the female insects, which form the great bulk of the whole, never escape. After their impregnation, which takes place on the liberation of the males, about three months from their first appearance, the females develop into a singularly amorphous-like organism consisting in its main features of a large smooth shining crimson-coloured sac—the ovary— with a beak stuck into the bark, and a few papillary processes projected above the resinous surface. The red fluid in the ovary is the substance which forms the lac dye of commerce, and, when the young are allowed to hatch out, the greater part of this colouring matter is lost, and only a dead resinous substance remains on the twig. To obtain the largest amount of both resin and dye-stuff therefore it is necessary to gather the twigs with their living inhabitants in or near June and November. Lac encrusting the twigs as gathered is known in commerce as “stick lac the resin crushed to small fragments and washed free from colouring matter constitutes “seed lac”; when melted, strained through thick canvas, and spread out into thin layers, this is known as “shell lac,” and it is in this last form that the resin is usually brought to European markets. Shell lac, which varies in colour from a dark amber to an almost pure black appearance, may be bleached by dissolving in a boiling lye of caustic potash and passing chlorine through the solution till all the resin is precipitated. Bleached lac takes light delicate shades of colour, and dyed a golden yellow it is much used in the East Indies for working into chain ornaments for the head and for other personal adornments. Lac is a principal ingredient in sealing wax, and forms the basis of some of the most valuable varnishes, besides being useful in various cements, &c. (see Lacquer). Average stick lac contains about 68 per cent, of resin, 10 of lac dye, and 6 of a waxy substance. The resin of lac is a composite body, whose constituents behave differently in presence of chemical reagents.

Lac dye, which is separated by washing stick lac in hot or cold water or in a weak alkaline solution, and dried either by exposure over a fire or in the sun, comes into commerce in the form of small square cakes. It is in many respects similar to, although not identical with, cochineal, and will dye less brilliant shades than that colour. It contains about 50 per cent, of colouring matter, with 25 per cent, of resin and 22 per cent, of earthy admixture, <fcc. It is used for dyeing silk and wool, for which purposes it is dissolved in dilute sulphuric acid or somewhat stronger hydrochloric acid; and the substance to be dyed is prepared with a mordant of strong lac spirit, which consists of a solution of stannous chloride. Lac dye has been used from time immemorial in the East, but the knowledge of the substance in the West is comparatively recent. It was first brought to Europe by the East India Company as a substitute for cochineal. The best lac dye comes from Calcutta. Lac lake is an alumina lake containing about 50 per cent, of colouring matter, 40 per cent, of resin, and 9 or 10 per cent, of alumina.
