LONGUEVILLE, Anne Geneviève, Duchesse de (1619-1679), who played the greatest part in the troubles of the Fronde, and whose name has come down to posterity as the brilliant intriguer in polities in her early and the pious protectress of the nuns of Port Royal in her later years, was the only daughter of Henri de Bourbon, Prince de Condé, and his wife Charlotte Marguerite de Montmorency, and the only sister of Louis, the great Condé. She was born on August 28, 1619, in the prison of Vincennes, into which her father had been thrown for opposition to Marshal D’Ancre, the favourite of Marie de’ Medici, who was then regent in the minority of Louis XIII. She was educated in the convent of the Carmelites in the Rue St Jacques at Paris, which had been recently established under the influence of St Teresa’s reforms by nuns of the strictest piety, whose teaching she never entirely forgot. Her early years were clouded by the execution of the young and brilliant Due de Montmorency, her mother’s only brother, for intriguing against the great Richelieu in 1631, and that of her mother’s cousin the Comte de Montmorency Boutteville for duelling in 1635; but, in spite of their sorrow, her parents made their peace with Richelieu, and when she was introduced into society in 1635 she found plenty of court gaiety to enjoy. She soon became one of the bright particular stars of the Hôtel Rambouillet, where all that was learned, witty, and gay in France used to assemble, and which had not yet degenerated into the meeting place of those précieuses whom Molière was to laugh out of existence. It was first proposed to marry her to the young Prince de Joinville, and thus unite the Guises and Condés, but he died in 1639, and her parents could only find for her husband the Duc de Longueville, a prince of the blood indeed, and governor of Normandy, but a widower, and twice her age. The marriage could not be a happy one, but the young duchess long remained faithful to him, and bore him four children. After Richelieu’s death her father became chief of the council of regency during the minority of Louis XIV., her brother Louis won the great victory of Rocroy in 1643 (see Condé), and the duchess became of political importance. In 1647 she accompanied her husband to Münster, where he was sent by Mazarin as chief envoy, and where she charmed the German diplomatists who were making the treaty of Westphalia, and was addressed as the “goddess of peace and concord.” On her return she fell in love with the Due de la Rochefoucauld, the author of the Maxims, who made use of her love to obtain influence over her brother, and thus win titles and honours for himself. She was the guiding spirit of the first Fronde, when she brought over Armand, Prince de Conti, her second brother, and her husband to the malcontents, but she failed to attract Condé himself, whose loyalty to the court overthrew the first Fronde. However, La Rochefoucauld won the titles he desired. The second F ronde was again her work, owing to her lover’s disgust at losing his new honours, and in it she played the most prominent part in attracting to the rebels first Condé and later Turenne (see Condé). It is not necessary to give the whole history of the wars of the Fronde, which is detailed elsewhere, but it must be noticed that the duchess herself only-mingled in politics to please her lover, and gain his ends. In the last year of the war she was accompanied into Guienne by the young and handsome Due de Nemours, her intimacy with whom gave La Rochefoucauld an excuse for abandoning her, and who himself immediately returned to his old mistress the Duchesse de Chevreuse. Thus abandoned, and in disgrace at court, the duchess betook herself to religion. She accompanied her husband to his government at Rouen, and devoted herself to good works. She took for her director Μ. Singlin, so famous in the history of Port Royal, and from that time began her new religious life. Till 1663 she chiefly lived in Normandy, when her husband died, and she came to Paris. There she became more and more Jansenist in opinion, and her piety and the remembrance of her influence during the disastrous days of the Fronde, and above all the tender love her brother, the great Condé, bore her, made her a conspicuous figure. The king pardoned her, and in every way showed the respect he had for her. She became the great protectress of the Jansenists; it was in her house that Arnauld, Nicole, and De Lane were protected; and to her influence must be in great part attributed the release of De Sacy from the Bastille, the introduction of Pomponne into the ministry and of Arnauld to the king. Her famous letters to the pope are part of the history of Port Royal (<7∙t'.), and as long as she lived the nuns of Port Royal des Champs were left in safety. Through the latter years of her life she had, despite the honour in which she was held, much to bear. Her elder son resigned his title and estates, and became a Jesuit under the name of the Abbé d’Orleans, while the younger, after leading a very debauched life, was killed, bravely leading the attack in the passage of the Rhine in 1673. As her health failed she devoted herself more and more to religion, and hardly ever left the convent of the Carmelites in which she had been educated. On her death in 1679 she was buried with great splendour by her brother Condé, and her heart, as she had directed, was sent to the nuns of that Port Royal des Champs which she had so greatly protected and defended. Her life is noteworthy, both from the harm she did in the turbulent days of the Fronde, though she acted, hardly knowing what she did, from love rather than from selfish ambition, and also from the greatness of her penitence, when her protection of Port Royal more than redeemed her fame, and gave her a title to the grateful remembrance of all who reverence true piety and learning more than the artificial glitter of the reign of the “grand monarque.”

The chief authority for Madame de Longueville’s life is a little book in two volumes by Villefore the Jansenist, published in 1738.

Cousin has devoted four volumes to her, which, though immensely diffuse, give a vivid picture of her time. Her connexion with Port Royal should be studied in Arnauld’s Memoirs, and in the different histories of that institution.
