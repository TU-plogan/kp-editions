LONGFORD, an inland county of Leinster, Ireland, is bounded on the N.W. by Leitrim, N.E. by Cavan, E. by Westmeath, S. by Westmeath and Meath, and W. by Lough Ree aud Roscommon. With the exception of Carlow, Louth, and Dublin, it is the smallest county in Ireland, its greatest length being about 28 miles, its greatest breadth about 20, and the total area comprising 269,409 acres, or about 421 square miles.

The general level surface of the country is broken occasionally by low hills, which cover a considerable area at its northern angle. The principal rivers are the Camlin, which rises near Granard, and flows past Longford to the Shannon, and the Inny, which, entering the county from Westmeath, crosses its southern corner, and falls into Lough Ree. Lough Ree is partly included in Longford, and the other principal lakes are Lough Gownagh, Derry-lough, Lough Drum, and Lough Bannow. The Royal canal intersects the county. The southern division of the county, bounded partly by the Camlin, belongs to the great limestone plain of Ireland, and the northern division is occupied chiefly by clay-slate and greywacke. In the west of the county there is an interpolation, between the two divisions, of yellow sandstone and conglomerate. Isolated hills of sandstone occur at Slievegauldry and at Ballymahon, on both sides of the Inny. Marble of fine quality has been raised near Ledwithstown. In the north indications of iron are abundant, and there are also some traces of lead.

Agriculture.— The climate is somewhat moist and cold, partly owing to the large extent of marsh and bog. The soil in the southern districts resting on the limestone is a deep loam well adapted for pasture, but in the north it is often so thin and poor as to be incapable of reclamation.

In 1881 there were 74,876 acres under tillage, 125,838 pasture, 3697 plantation, and 51,333 waste. The total number of holdings in 1880 was 8682, of which 685 were less than 1 acre. More than one-half of the total number were included in those between 5 and 15, and 15 and 30 acres in extent, which numbered respectively 2482 aud 2658. The following table shows the areas under the principal crops in 1855 and in 1881 :—

The total number of horses in 1881 was 6856, of which 4253 were used for agricultural purposes; of cattle 51,547, of which 16,212 were milch cows; of sheep, 24,140; of pigs, 17,900; and of poultry, 232,324. There were 3066 asses and 670 mules. According to the latest return, the land was divided among 436 proprietors possessing[9:14:864] 256,668 acres, with an annual rateable value of £151,739, the average rateable value per acre being Ils. 10d. The average size was 588 acres, and 14 per cent, possessed less than 1 acre. The largest owners were Colonel King Harman, 28,779 acres; earl of Granard, 14,978; LordAnnaly, 12,160; George Maconchy, 10,319.

Manufactiires.— These are confined almost entirely to coarse woollen and linen cloth.

Railways.— One branch of the Midland Great Western Railway skirts the eastern boundary of the county, and another passes through its centre to Longford.

Administration and Population.— The county includes 6 baronies, with 26 parishes and 891 townlands. It is in the northwest circuit. Assizes are held at Longford, and quarter sessions at Ballymahon, Granard, and Longford. There is one poor-law union wholly within the county, with portions of other two. It is in the Dublin military district and Birr subdistrict. There are barracks for infantry and cavalry at Longford. The county returns two members to parliament.

The only town of any importance is the county town, Longford. From 25,142 in 1760 the population of the county gradually increased till in 1841 it was 115,491, but since then it has diminished to 82,348 in 1851, 64,501 in 1871, and 61,009 in 1881, of whom 30,770 were males and 30,239 females. From 1st May 1851 to 31st December 1881 the number of emigrants was 40,726. For the ten years 1871-81 the marriage-rate per 100 of the population was 4, the birth-rate 24 - 3, and the death-rate 16. In 1881 23 , 1 per cent, of the population above five years of age were illiterate, the percentage in 1871 being 32. The Roman Catholics formed 91 per cent, of the population in 1881, and the Episcopalians 8.

History and Antiquities.— The early name of Longford was Anale or Annaly, and it was a principality of the O’Farrels. Along with the province of Meath, in which it was then included, it was granted by Henry II. to Hugh de Lacy, who planted in it an English colony. On the division of Meath into two counties in 1543, Annaly was included in West Meath, but in the 11th of Elizabeth it tfas made shire ground under the name of Longford, and included in the province of Connaught, from which it was transferred to Leinster in the 27th of the same reign.

The principal antiquarian rain is the Danish rath called the Moat of Granard, at the end of the main street of the town, and occupying a position 593 feet above sea-level. There are monastic remains atArdagh, Longford, Moydow, Clone, Derg, Druimchei, and Killinmore, as well as on several of the islands of Lough Ree. The principal old castles are those of Rathcline near Lanesborough, and Ballymahon, Burnacor, and Castlecor on the Inny. The principal modern seats are those of Carrickglass on the Camlin, and Castle Forbes, the seat of the earl of Granard. Oliver Goldsmith was born at Pallas, à village near Ballymahon, in this county.

Longford, the chief town of the above county, is situated on the river Carnlin, and on a branch of the Midland Great Western Railway, 75 miles west-north-west of Dublin. The principal buildings are the parish church in the Grecian style, St Mell’s Roman Catholic cathedral (one of the finest Roman Catholic churches in Ireland), the courthouse, the market-house, and the county jail. Of the old castle and of the Dominican abbey there are slight remains. The town has a considerable trade in grain, butter, and bacon. There are corn-mills, a spool factory, and tanneries. The population in 1871 was 4375, and in 1881 it was 4380.

The ancient name of the town was Athfada, and it is said to occupy the site of a monastery founded by St Idus, a disciple of St Patrick. The town obtained a fair and market from James I., and a charter of incorporation from Charles II., as well as the right to return two members to parliament. It was disfranchised at the Union.
