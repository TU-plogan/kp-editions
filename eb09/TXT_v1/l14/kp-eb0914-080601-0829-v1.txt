LOHÁRDAGÁ, or Lohaedugga, a district in the lieutenant-governorship of Bengal, India, between 22° 20' and 24° 39' N. lat. and 83° 22' and 85° 56' E. long., is bounded on the N. by Hazâribâgh and Gayâ, on the N.W. and W. by Mirzâpur district and Sargùjâ and Jashpur states, and on the S.E. and E. by Sinhbhùm and Manbhùm districts. It comprises Chutiâ Nâgpur proper, and the Palâmau subdivision. Chutiâ Nâgpur is an elevated table-land, forming the central and south-eastern portion of Lohârdagâ district; its surface is undulating, and the slopes of the depressions lying between the ridges are cut into terraces covered with rice. Palâmau, which forms the north-western portion of the district, consists on the east and south of spurs thrown off from the plateaus of Hazâribâgh and Chutiâ Nâgpur, while the remainder of the tract is a tangled mass of isolated peaks and long irregular stretches of broken hills. The average elevation of Palâmau is about 1200 feet above sea-level, but some peaks rise to over 3000 feet. This part of the district contains no level areas of any extent, except the valleys of the North Koel and Amânat rivers, to which rice cultivation is confined. The principal rivers of Lohârdagâ are the Subarnarekhâ and the North and South Koel. The entire district was probably at one time overgrown with dense forest, but the forest area has been continually dwindling, owing to the spread of cultivation and the practice of girdling the sdl trees for resin.

The census of 1872 disclosed a total population of 1,237,123 (621,548 males and 615,575 females), spread over an area of 12,044 square miles; of these only 91 were returned as Europeans and 3 as of mixed race. The aboriginal element is very strongly represented—the Mundas numbering 163,051; Kols, 132,104; and Urdons, 151,810. The most numerous among the semi-aboriginal tribes are—the Bhuiyas, 45,008; Khaτwars, 33,573; Bhogtas, 33,452; and Dosâdhs, 25,223. The Hindus number 741,952, and Mohammedans 58,211. The Christian population is larger than in any other Bengal district, except the metropolitan one of the Twenty-four Parganâs. In 1872 the total Christian population numbered 12,781, of whom 12,687 were natives, nearly all belonging to the aboriginal tribes of Mundas and Uraons. Most of them are poor, but they possess considerable influence, and are rising in public esteem. The two missions are the German Lutheran and Church of England, which successfully work together side by side. The population is entirely rural, Ranchi town (12,086) being the only place with more than 5000 inhabitants. Rice forms the staple crop; other crops are wheat, barley, Indian corn, millets, peas, gram, oilseeds, pan, cotton, and tobacco. Opium cultivation was introduced in 1869, and in 1874-75 yielded 245 cwts. There are two small tea plantations. Mildew and blights occasionally attack the crops; droughts seldom affect any considerable area The principal trading place is Garwâ in Palâmau. Stick lac, resin, catechu, silk cocoons, hides, oil-seeds, ghi, cotton, and iron are here collected for exportation; while rice and other food grains, brass vessels, piece goods, blankets, broadcloth, silk, salt, tobacco, spices, drugs, and beads are brought to market for local consumption. The manufactures consist of shell-lac, inferior articles of brass and iron work, coarse cloth, blankets, mats, baskets,'rope, and rude pottery. Iron, lime, and soapstone are worked in small quantities; gold is washed by the poorer classes from the sands of the rivers. An important coal-bearing tract, known as the Daltonganj coalfield, covers an area of nearly 200 square miles, and lies partly in the valley of the Koel river, and partly in that of the Amânat. The net revenue of the district in 1870-71 was £29,900, and the expenditure £22,563. The schools in 1876-77 numbered 303, with 8088 pupils. The climate of the table-land of Chutiâ Nâgpur is said to be superior to that of any other part of India, except the lower ranges of the Himâlayas. The hot weather extends over almost six weeks, commencing about the 20th April, but is never really oppressive. The rainy season lasts from the middle of June to about the first week iu October. The principal diseases are malarious fever and rheumatism of a severe type.
