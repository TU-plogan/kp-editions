LISMORE, an island of 9600 acres, about 10 miles long and averaging 1∣ miles broad, with a population in 1881 of 630, lying south-west and north-east at the entrance of the Linnhe Loch in Argyllshire, Scotland. The name means the great enclosure (whether “garden,” as the Scotch, . or “fort,” as the Irish authorities suppose, is uncertain), and occurs in Ireland in the Waterford Lismore and ten other places. “Lis” is one of the most frequent words in compound Irish names, there being one thousand four hundred townlands or villages which begin with it. A Columban monastery was founded there by St Moluag about 592 (Reeves, Adam n a n , p. 34), whose bell is perhaps that found in 1814 at Kilmichael Glassary,^[1. Anderson, Scotland in Early Christian Times, lstser., p. 206, where it is figured.] and whose crozier or staff is in the possession of the duke of

Argyll.^[2. See Orig. Paroch. Scot., where it is figured.] About 1200 the see of Argyll was separated from Dunkeld by Bishop John “the Englishman,” and Lismore soon after became the seat of the bishop of Argyll, sometimes called “Episcopus Lismoriensis” (Skene, Celtic Scotland, ii. p. 408 sq.), quite distinct from the bishop of the Isles (Sudreys and Isle of Man), called “Episcopus Sodoriensis” or “Insularum,” whose see was divided into the English bishopric of Sodor and Man and the Scottish bishopric of the Isles in the 14th century (Keith’s Catalogue, p. 173). The monastic establishment of Lismore, at one time consisting of Culdees (Reeves, Cul∙ dees, p. 49), was converted into a chapter of canons regular and a dean, whose right to elect the bishop was recognized as early as 1249 (Baluze, Miscel., vii. p. 442; Orig. Paroch. Scot., ii. pt. 1, p. 161).

Lismore has an accidental celebrity from the Book of the Dean of Lismore, a MS. collection of poems, Gaelic and English, made by James M‘Gregor, vicar of Fortingall and dean of Lismore (1514-51). A selection of the Gaelic poems, with translations by Rev. T. M ‘Lauchlan, and introduction by Mr W. F. Skene, published 1862, is of value both for the language and the contents. The language is the Gaelic of the West Highlands, spelt phonetically, as spoken in the beginning of the 16th century, and its variations from ancient Irish on the one hand and modern Gaelic on the other are of much interest to Celtic scholars. Its contents are Ossianic fragments, some of Irish, others of Scotch origin, and a few more recent Gaelic verses. The publication of this work, and J. F. Campbell of Islay’s collection from oral sources of the existing traditional Gaelic poetry, have for the first time given a genuine historical solution of the Ossianic problem (see Ossian). There are remains of three castles on Lismore :—at Tireforr a fort of two concentric circles of dry stones, supposed to be Norse or Danish; at Achindown a square keep with walls 40 feet high, believed to be the palace of the bishop; and on the west side of the island Castle Corffin, mentioned in a grant to Campbell of Glenurqhay in 1470 (Orig. Par. Sc., ii. p. 109).
