LEON, one of the forty-nine provinces of Spain, is bounded on the N. by Oviedo, on the E. by Palencia, on the S. by Valladolid and Zamora, and on the W. by Orense and Lugo, and has an area of 6166 square miles, with a population (in 1877) of 350,210. Its boundaries on the north and west, formed respectively by the central ridge and southerly offshoots of the great Cantabrian chain, are strongly marked; towards the south-east it merges imperceptibly into the Castilian plateau, the line of demarcation being for the most part merely conventional. It belongs partly to the Mino and partly to the Duero river system, these being separated by the montaiias de Leon, which extend in a continuous wall (with passes at Manzanal and Poncebadon) from north to south-west. To the Mino flow the Sil, Boeza, Burbia, Cua, Valcarce; the principal tributaries of the Duero are the Esla (with its affluents the Tuerto, Orbigo, Beruesga, Torio, Cuereno, and Ceo) and the Valderaduey. To the north-west of the montanas de Leon is the district known as the Vierzo, a richly wooded pastoral and highland district, which in its lower valleys produces grain, fruit, and wine in abundance. The Tierra del Campo in the west of the province is fairly productive, but in need of irrigation. The hills of Leon were wrought for gold in the time of the Romans; iron is still obtained to some extent; and coal and antimony also occur. The commerce and industries of the province are unimportant. Besides Leon, the capital, the only towns of any note are Astorga and Ponferrada, respectively the Asturica Augusta and the Interamnium Flavium of the Romans. There is railway communication with Madrid; but the line from Leon to Gijon at present terminates, on the south side of the pass, at Busdongo, while that to Coruîïa does not extend further than Branuelas.

The province was anciently inhabited by the Vettones and Callaici; after the Roman conquest it formed part of Hispania Tarraconensis. Among the Christian kingdoms which arose in Spain as the Saracenic irruption of the 8th century receded, Leon was one of the oldest, after that of Asturias, the title of king of Leon having been first assumed by Ordono in 913. Ferdinand I. (the Great) of Castile united the crowns of Castile and Leon in the 11th century; the two were again separated in the 12th, until a final union took place (1230) in the person of St Ferdinand. The limits of the kingdom varied with the alternations of success and defeat in war, but roughly speaking it may be said to have embraced what are now the provinces of Leon, Palencia, Valladolid, Zamora, and Salamanca. The province of Leon prior to 1833 included Leon, Zamora, and Salamanca.

Leon, the capital of the above province, is pleasantly situated upon a rising ground in the angle formed by the Torio and Bernesga, which here unite to form the Leon, a tributary of the Esla; its distance north-west from Madrid is 258 miles. The town, which is surrounded by old and dilapidated walls, everywhere presents an aspect of ruin and decay. Many of the buildings are fine. Of these the most important is the cathedral, founded about 1195; it is built in the pointed Gothic style, of a warm cream-coloured stone, and is remarkable for its simplicity, lightness, and strength. The collegiate church of San Isidro was founded in 1063, and consecrated in 1149; it is Byzantine in character. The church belonging to the convent of San Marcos, ordered by Ferdinand V. in 1514, was begun by Charles V. in 1537, and consecrated in 1541. Other buildings of less architectural importance are the town house, the episcopal palace, and that of the Guzman family. As might be expected from the ecclesiastical character of Leon, there are a variety of religious and charitable institutions; the industries of the place are linen weaving, glove making, and the knitting of caps and [9:14:455] stockings, but the trade is insignificant. The population in 1877 was 11,515.

Leon (Arab., Liyun) owes its name to the Legio Septima Gemina of Galba, which, under the later emperors at least, had its headquarters there. The place is mentioned under this name in the Itin. Ant. About 540 it fell into the hands of the Gothic king Leovigildo, and in 717 it capitulated to the Saracens. Retaken about 742, it ultimately, in the beginning of the 10th century, became the capital of the kingdom of Leon. About 996 it was taken by Almansur, but on his death, which occurred soon aftenvards, it reverted to the Spaniards. It was the seat of several ecclesiastical councils, one of which was held under Alphonso V., a second in 1090, and others in 1106, 1114, 1134, 1228, and 1288.
