LEWIS and HARRIS form together an island of the Outer Hebrides, nearly separated into two parts by the inlets of Loch Reasort and Seaforth,—the northern part, Lewis or the Lews, being in Ross-shire, and the southern part, Harris, in Inverness. The island is situated about 30 miles from the mainland, between 57° 40' and 58° 32' N. lat., and 6’ and 7° W. long. Its length is 60 miles, the average breadth 15, and the extreme breadth 30. The area is 770 square miles, of which 575 are comprised in Lewis. The greater part of the surface is composed of gneiss rocks, which in Ben More attain a height of 1750 feet, but there is also a large breadth of peat and swamp, with remains of an ancient forest. The coast is much indented by bays. The climate is very moist and unsuitable for tillage. Agriculture is in a backward condition, but much has been done in draining, reclamation, and planting of trees by the late proprietor of Lewis, Sir James Matheson. Barley and potatoes are the principal crops, and a large number of black cattle are reared. Kelp making is also carried on, but one of the chief supports of the inhabitants is fishing, Stornoway being the largest station for the herring fishing in Scotland, and employing over 1000 boats with nearly 4000 men and boys. The town was made a burgh of barony by James VI. It has a commodious harbour with a patent slip suitable for vessels of 1000 tons. On a height overlooking the bay is the beautiful residence of the proprietor of the island. The most remarkable archaeological remains in Lewis are the druidical stones of the temple of Callernish. There are also a large number of old obelisks, and at Mealista in Uig the remains of an old monastery. Six miles from Stornoway there is a huge cave covered with stalactites. See Hebrides.
