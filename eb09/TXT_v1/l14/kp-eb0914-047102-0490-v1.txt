LEROL τ X, Pierre (1798-1871), a French writer on philosophy and politics, commonly recognized as the chief of the (so-called) Humanitarian school, was born at Paris in 1798. He was the son of an artisan. He received his early education at the Lycée Charlemagne, and continued his studies at Rennes. Having obtained an admission to the Polytechnic school, he renounced it in order to support by the labour of his hands his mother and family, who had been left destitute by the death of his father. He first worked as a mason, but soon became a compositor in the printing establishment of his cousin, and afterwards overseer in that of M. Panckoucke. In 1824 P. Dubois, a former schoolfellow, associated him with himself in the foundation of the Globe newspaper, in which he became a co-worker with De Broglie, Guizot, Duvergier de Hauranne, Jouffroy, and other distinguished persons. For some time he occupied the position of an advanced Liberal of the ordinary type; but in January 1831 he gave his adhesion to the Saint-Simonian community, of which he became a prominent member; and under his influence the Globe became the organ of its doctrines. In November of the same year, when Enfantin preached the enfranchisement of women and the functions of the couple-prêtre, Leroux took the part of Bazard, and, protesting iu the name of morality, separated himself from the sect. In 1838, in conjunction with J. Reynaud, who had seceded with him, he founded the Encyclopédie Nouvelle, in which he expounded his philosophical and social views. Amongst the articles which he inserted in it were one entitled De V Égalité, and a Réfutation de V Éclectisme, which afterwards appeared as separate works. In 1840 he published his treatise De V Humanité, which contains the fullest exposition of his system, and was regarded as the philosophical manifesto of the Humanitarians. In 1841, disgusted with the Revue des Deux Mondes on account of its desertion of the democratic cause, he established, with the aid of M. Viardot and Mme. George Saud, the Revue Indépendante. By his philosophic association with the latter eminent writer he obtained the advantage of an eloquent interpreter, capable of charming and impressing the masses. Mme. Sand’s Spiridion, which was dedicated to him, her Sept Cordes de la Lyre, her Consuelo, and its continuation La Comtesse de Rudolstadt, were written under the Humanitarian inspiration. From the year 1843 M. Leroux devoted himself tothe practical applications of his doctrines. He established at Boussac (Creuse) a printing association organized according to his systematic ideas, and founded the Revue Sociale, in which, as well as in separate publications, he continued to explain and develop his theoretic views and his suggestions for the renovation of society, professing, amongst other things, to supply “a pacific solution of the problem of the proletariat.” After the outbreak of the revolution of 1848 he was elected to the constituent assembly as representative of the department of the Seine, obtaining 90,000 votes, and afterwards, in 1849, to the legislative assembly. He spoke there on the organization of labour, on the colonization of Algeria, and other questions. His discourses from the tribune were sometimes of so abstract and mystical a character, and contained proposals so eccentric and impracticable that they rather created ridicule than influenced opinion. The coup (l’état οi 1851 made him an exile; he settled with his family in Jersey, where he pursued agricultural experiments. The general amnesty of 1860 permitted his return to France, but he lived at Lausanne till after the definitive amnesty of 1869, when he again fixed his residence at Paris. He died there in April 1871, during the reign of the Commune. That body deputed two of its members to attend his funeral, as a homage, “not to the partisan of the mystical idea, of which we now feel the evil, but to the politician who, after the days of June, courageously undertook the defence of the vanquished.”

The writings of Leroux, though they won a transitory éclat and gave him a position as head of a school, appear to have no permanent significance in the history of thought. His social theories do not rest on any scientific basis; he was rather the propagandist of sentiments and aspirations than the expounder of well-defined and distinctly appreciable ideas. He seems to have had a natural bent towards the mystic and the nebulous. He has, indeed, a system, but it is a singular medley of doctrines borrowed, not only from Saint-Simonian, but from Pythagorean and Buddhistic sources. In philosophy his fundamental principle is that of what he calls the “triad,”—a triplicity which he finds to pervade all things, which in God is “power, intelligence, and love” in man “sensation, [9:14:472] sentiment, and knowledge.” His religious doctrine is Pantheistic; and, rejecting the belief in a future life as commonly conceived, he substitutes for it a theory of metempsychosis. In social economy his views are very vague; he preserves the family, country, and property, but finds in all three, as they now are, a despotism which must be eliminated. He imagines certain combinations by which this triple tyranny can be abolished, so that the human being may be developed under the influence of those several institutions without being oppressed by them. But his solution seems to require the creation of families without heads, countries λvithout governments, and property without rights of possession. In politics he advocates absolute equality—a democracy pushed to anarchy. A full criticism of his system will be found in L. Bey baud’s Études sur les Réformateurs et Socialistes Modernes.

The full title of Leroux’s principal work is De THumanité, de son principe et de son avenir, où se trouve exposée la vraie définition de la religion, et où l’on explique le sens, la suite, et l'enchaînement du Mosaisme et du Christianisme. A second edition of this work appeared in 1845. Amongst his other publications, in addition to some already mentioned, are— Discours sur la situation actuelle de la Société et de l'esprit humain, 1841, new ed., 2 vols., 1847; D’une Religion nationale, ou du Culte, 1846; Discours sur la fixation des heures de travail, 1848; Projet d'une Constitution démocratique et sociale, 1848; Du Christianisme et de ses origines démocratiques, 1848; Le Carrosse de Μ. Aguado, ou si ce sont les riches qui payent les pauvres, 1848; De la Ploutocratie; ou du gouvernement des riches, 1848; Malthus et les Économistes, ou Y aura-t-il toujours tics pauvres? 1848; Quelques pages de Vérités, 1859; portions of a philosophical poem, entitled La Grève de Samarez, 1863-64; Job, drame en cinq actes, par le prophète Isaïe, traduit de l' hébreu, 1865. Μ. Leroux also produced, with the aid of an anonymous collaborator, a translation of Goethe’s Werther, which was published in 1843, with a preface by George Sand.
