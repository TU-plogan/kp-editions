LAODICEA (Greek Λαoδικ∈ια) is the name of at least eight cities, founded or renovated in the later Hellenic period. Most of them were founded by the Seleucid kings of Syria. Seleucus, founder of the dynasty, is said by Appian to have named five cities after his mother Laodice. Many other women of the family bore the same name, which also passed by marriage into the family of the Pontic kings. The victories of Alexander introduced Greek civilization over Asia; the organizing and city-building energy of his successors established and consolidated it. They either founded new cities in favourable situations or reorganized native cities after the Greek model: thus over the immense realm of the Seleucidae from the Aegean Sea to the borders of India we find numberless cities called Seleucia, Laodicea, &c. So long as Greek civilization held its ground, these were the great commercial and social centres of the country. We find a Laodicea ad Lyσum in the Maeander valley, on the borders of Phrygia, Caria, and Lydia; another surnamed Combusta on the borders of Phrygia, Lycaonia, and Pisidia; a third in Pontus; a fourth, αd mare, on the coast of Syria; a fifth, ad Libanum, beside the Lebanon mountains; and three others in the far east—Media, Persia, and the lower Tigris valley. In the latter countries Greek civilization was overwhelmed in Orientalism after a century or two, and the last three cities disappeared; the other five continued great throughout the Greek and Roman period, and the second, third, and fourth retain to the present day the ancient name under the pronunciation Ladik, Ladikiyeh, or Latakia (see Latakia).

Laodicea ad Lycum was founded probably by Antiochus II. Theos (261-46 b.c.), and named after his wife Laodice. Its site, called by the Turks Eski Hissar, “the old castle,” is now solitary and deserted; but it retains an undying interest as one of the oldest homes of Christianity and the seat of one of the seven churches of the Apocalypse. Pliny tells us (v. 29) that the town was called in older times Diospolis and Rhoas; but it is certain that at an early period Colossae, a few miles to the east, and Hierapolis, six miles to the north, were the great cities of the neighbourhood, and that Laodicea was a place of no importance till the Seleucid a foundation (Str., p. 578). A favourable site was found on some low’ hills of alluvial formation, about 2 miles south of the river Lycus (Churuk Su) and 9 miles east of the confluence of the Lycus and Maeander. Smaller rivers of the neighbourhood are the Asopus, Captus, and Cadmus, the last named after the lofty range of Mount Cadmus (Baba Dagh), which overhangs the Maeander valley on the south. The great trade route from the Euphrates and the interior passed through Apamea to Laodicea. There it forked, one branch going straight down the Maeander valley to Magnesia and thence north to Ephesus, a distance of about 90 miles, and the other branch crossing the mountains by an easy pass to Philadelphia and the Hermus valley, Sardis, Thyatira, and at last Pergamus. St Paul (Col. iv. 15) alludes to the situation of Laodicea beside Colossae and Hierapolis; and the order in which the last five churches of the Apocalypse are enumerated (Rev. i. 11) is explained by their position on the road just described. Placed in this important situation, in the centre of a very fertile district, Laodicea became a rich city. It was famous for its money transactions (Cic., Ad Fam., ii. 17; iii. 5), and for the beautiful soft wool grown by the sheep of the country (Str., 578). Both points are referred to in the message to the church (Rev. it 17, 18).

Little is known of the history of the town. It suffered greatly from a siege in the Mithridatic war, hut soon recovered its prosperity under the Roman empire. The Zeus of Laodicea, with the curious epithet Azeus or Azeis, is a frequent symbol on the city coins, and is one of the widest-known deities of western Asia Minor. He is represented standing, holding in the extended right hand an eagle, in the left a spear, the hαstα purα. Not far from the city was the temple of Men Karou, with a great medical school; while Laodicea itself produced some famous Sceptic philosophers, and gave origin to the royal family of Polemon and Zenon, whose curious history has been illustrated in recent times (Waddington, Mélanges de Humism., ser. ii.; Mommsen, Ephem. Epigraph., i. and ii.; Rayet, Milet et le Golfe Latmique, chap. v. ). The coinage of Laodicea continues in a rich unbroken series to the time of the emperor Diocletian. Under the Byzantine rule its greatness remained, but finally the city fell into decay in the frontier wars with the Turkish invaders. Its ruins are of wide extent, but not of great beauty or interest; there is no doubt, however, that much has been buried beneath the surface by the frequent earthquakes to which the district is exposed (Str., 580; Tac., Ann., xiv. 27). For an account of the ruins see the works of Leake, Hamilton, Arundel, Texier, &c., and especially the beautiful drawings of Cockerell in the Antiquities of Ionia, vol. iii. pl. 47-51.
