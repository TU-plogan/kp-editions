LÁRISTÁN, a province of Persia, bounded by Farsistân on the W. and N.W., by Kirmàn on the E. and N.E., by the Persian Gulf on the S. It lies between 26° 30' and 28° 25' N. lat., 52° 30' and 55° 30' E. long., and has an extreme length and breadth of 210 and 120 miles respectively, with an area of 20,000 square miles. Lâristân is one of the least productive provinces in Persia, consisting mainly of mountain ranges in the north and east, and of arid plains varied with rocky hills and salt or sandy valleys stretching thence to the coast. In the highlands there are some fertile upland tracts producing corn, dates, and other fruits; and there the climate is genial. But elsewhere it is extremely sultry, and on some low-lying coast lands subject to malaria. Good water is everywhere so scarce that but for the rain preserved in cisterns the country would be mostly uninhabitable. The coast is chiefly occupied by Arab tribes under their own chiefs, who are virtually independent, paying merely a nominal tribute to the shah’s Government. They reside in small towns and mud forts scattered along the coast, and were till recently addicted to piracy. The people of the interior are mostly of the old Iranian stock, intermediate between the Tajiks and Kurds, and speaking an archaic form of Persian. Here the chief tribes are the Mezaijan, about 1600, with numerous flocks and herds; the Bekoi, 2500; and the Tahuni, 200. Lâristân was subdued eight hundred years ago by a Turki khan, and remained an independent state till its last ruler was deposed and put to death by Shah 'Abbâs the Great. Population about 90,000.
