LEO, Johannes, usually called Leo Africanus, sometimes Eliberitanus (ι.e., of Granada), is best known as the author of a valuable Africae Descriptio, which long ranked as almost the only authority in regard more especially to the Sudan. Born probably at Granada, of a noble Moorish stock, Alhasan ibn Mohammed Abwazzan Alfasi (for this was his real designation) received an excellent education at Fez, where his family settled after the expulsion from Spain. He was still in his sixteenth year when he began a course of travel which extended, not only through the northern and central parts of Africa (where he had advanced to the south-east of Lake Chad), but also into Arabia, Syria, Persia, Armenia, Tartary, and portions of Europe. As he was returning from Egypt about 1517, he was captured by pirates near the island of Gerba, and he was ultimately presented as a slave to Leo X. The pope no sooner discovered what manner of man he was than he assigned him a pension; and having persuaded him to profess the Christian faith, he stood sponsor at his baptism, and bestowed on him his own names, Johannes and Leo. The new convert, having made himself acquainted with Latin and Italian, not only taught Arabic to Aegidius Antoninus, bishop of Viterbo, and others, but wrote books in both tongues. He appears to have returned to Africa, and to have put off his Christianity, before his death; but the later part of his career is involved in obscurity. He was still alive in 1526.

The Africae Descriptio was originally written in Arabic, but the MS. (at one time in the library of Vincenzo Pinelli, 1535-1601) is not known to be extant. The author’s own translation into passable Italian was first published by Ramusio, Navigationi e Viaggi. Versions of this or of the widely used Latin translation by F. Florianus have appeared in English, French, Dutch, &c. For notices of Leo’s other works see Lorsbach’s edition (Herborn, 1801).
