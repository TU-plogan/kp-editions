LAeSTRYGONES, a mythic race of giants, mentioned in the Odyssey. After leaving the island of Aeolus, Ulysses reached in six days the coast of the Laestrygonians and the city of Lamus, where the paths of day and night approach so close that a sleepless man might make double wages by herding continuously, watching one flock while the other rested. This feature of the tale obviously contains some hint of the long nightless summer in the Arctic regions, which perhaps penetrated to the Greeks with the merchants who fetched amber from the Baltic coasts. The Laestrygonians were cannibals; and, when three sailors sent as scouts incautiously entered the city, the king Antiphates ate one and the people pursued the others to the ships. As the vessels tried to escape from the harbour, the giants pelted them with masses of rock, and sunk all except the one in which Ulysses was. The Laestrygonians must be a mythic multiplication of the one ultimate demonic being who is called their king, just [9:14:201] as the kindred race of the Cyclopes is a multiplication of the single one-eyed sun god Polyphemus, the Cyclops par excellence. The name Antiphates is a fanciful one, but the other name Lamus takes us into a religious world where we can trace the origin of the legend, and observe the god of an older religion becoming the subject of fairy tales in a later period (see Lamia). Among the Greeks it was usual to place the country of the Laestrygones in Sicily, either beside Etna or towards the north-west promontory of the island; but, on the other hand, Horace and other Latin authors speak of them as living in southern Latium, near Formiae.
