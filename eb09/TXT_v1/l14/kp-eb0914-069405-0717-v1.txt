LISSA (in Polish, Lesznd), a manufacturing town in the circle of Fraustadt, district of Posen, Prussia, is situated on the Breslau and Posen Railway, near the frontier of Silesia. The most prominent buildings are the handsome château, the mediaeval town-house, the three churches, and the synagogue. Its manufactures consist chiefly of cloth, liqueurs, tobacco, and wax; it also [9:14:695] possesses several tanneries and a large steam flour-mill, and carries on a brisk trade in grain, cattle, spirits, wine, and furs. The population in 1880 was 11,758, including 3810 Roman Catholics and 1833 Jews.

Lissa owes its origin to a number of Moravian Brothers from Bohemia, who were banished by the emperor Ferdinand I. in the 16th century, and found a refuge on the estate of the Polish family of Leczynski. Their settlement received municipal rights in 1548. During the Thirty Years’ War the population was reinforced by other refugees, and Lissa became an important commercial town, and the chief seat of the Moravian Brothers in Poland. Comenius (q .v. ) was long rector of the celebrated Moravian school there. Lissa was twice burned down (in 1656 and 1707) during the Swedish and Polish wars.
