LELAND, Leyland, or Laylonde, John (c. 1506- 1552), a famous English antiquary, was born in London towards the close of the reign of Henry VII. From St Paul’s School, where he was brought up under Lily, the famous grammarian, he passed to Christ’s College, Cambridge, and thence to All Soul’s College, Oxford. After residing for some time in Paris, he returned to England, and became chaplain to Henry VIII., who appointed him, in 1530, to the rectory of Popeling, in the marches of Calais, made him his librarian, and in 1533 commissioned him as “king’s antiquary,” with power to search for records, manuscripts, and relics of antiquity, in all the cathedrals, colleges, abbeys, and priories of England. Accordingly he set out on a tour which lasted six years, and afforded him materials for study during the remainder of his life. On his return in 1542 he was rewarded by the king with the rectory of Haseley in Oxfordshire; in 1543 he became a canon of King’s College (now Christ Church), Oxford, and about the same time a prebendary of Salisbury. Leland now withdrew to his house in the parish of St Michael le Querne, London, and devoted himself exclusively to the digesting of his information. In 1547 he fell into a state of insanity, which continued until his death on the 18th April 1552.

Some of Leland’s papers, after passing through several hands, were deposited by Burton, the historian of Leicestershire, in the Bodleian Library at Oxford in 1632. Others came into the possession of Sir Robert Cotton, and are now, along with the rest of his books, in the British Museum. His principal works are The laboryeuse Journey and Serehe for Englandes Antiquitees; A New Yeares Gyfte to Kynge Henry the VIII. in the 37 yeare of his Regne, London, 1549; Commentarii de Scriptoribus Britannicis, edited by Anthony Hall, Oxford, 1709, 2 vols. 8vo; The Itinerary, published by Thomas Hearne, Oxford, 1710-12, 9 vols. 8vo, and reprinted in 1770; and De Rebus Britannicis Collectanea, edited by Hearne, Oxf., 1715, 6 vols. 8vo, and reprinted at London in 1770. See The Lives of those eminent antiquaries John Leland, Thomas Hearne, and Anthony à Wood, vol. i., Oxford, 1772.
