LONG, George, an English scholar (1800-1879), was born at Poulton in Lancashire, on the 4th of November 1800. From Macclesfield grammar school he went to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1818. He was elected Craven university scholar in 1821, together with Lord Macaulay and Professor Malden, took his degree in 1822 as wrangler and senior chancellor’s medallist, and tie next year gained a fellowship over the heads of his two distinguished rivals. In 1824 Long went out to be professor of ancient languages in the new university of Virginia. There he married his first wife, the widow of Colonel Selden. In 1828 he returned to England to accept the Greek professorship in the newly-founded university of London. His introductory lecture in 1828 was followed in 1830 by another entitled Observations on the Study of the Latin and Greek Languages. The etymological appendix to this lecture is of interest in the history of classical philology in England, as illustrating the scientific comparative method of teaching the Greek and Latin languages .first adopted in the London university by himself and his colleague, Professor Key. He published a Summary of Herodotus (1829), and editions of Herodotus (1830-33) and Xenophon’s Anabasis (1831). He was one of the founders of the Royal Geographical Society in 1830, and was for twenty years a member of the council, or officer of the society; in the same year he joined the committee of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, and was till 1846, when the society was dissolved, one of its most active workers. In 1831 he resigned his professorship and became editor of the society’s Quarterly Journal of Education (1831-35), for which he wrote many articles. He wrote for the society’s Library of Entertaining Knowledge the two volumes of The British Museum: Egyptian Antiquities (1832-36), and edited, improved, and wrote parts of the companion volumes Elgin and Phigaleian Marbles (1833) and Townley Marbles (1836). He planned and edited for the Library of Useful Knowledge a Geography of America and the West Indies (1841), of which he wrote a small part, and a Geography of Great Britain: Part I. England and Wales, part of which he also wrote himself. He contributed two maps of Egypt and Persia, ancient and modern, to the society’s Atlas (1831). From 1833 to 1846 he was engaged on the great labour of his life, the editing of the twenty-nine volumes of the Penny Cyclopaedia, to which he was also an extensive contributor of articles. The committee appointed Long and Charles Knight editors, but after the publication of a few numbers Knight took no part in the superintendence of the work, and all the editorial labour was done by Long.

A more colossal and the final venture of the society was its Biograf)hical Dictionary, of which Long was also appointed editor. He wrote numerous articles in the seven volumes which appeared (1842-44), but the great expense did not allow it to proceed beyond the letter A. Long was also a member of the committee of the Society for Central Education, instituted in London in 1837, and contributed two essays to its Second and Third Publications (1838-39). In 1837 he was called to the bar at the Inner Temple. He accepted in 1842 the professorship of Latin in University College, vacated by his friend Mr Key, which he resigned in 1846, on being appointed by the benchers of the Middle Temple their reader on jurisprudence and the civil law. Two Discourses delivered in the Middle Temple Hall, ινith an Outline of the Course, were published in 1847. He wrote all the articles on Roman law in the Dictionary of Greek and Roman Aηtiqzιities, edited by Dr William Smith (1842), and contributed also to the companion Dictionaries of Biography (1844-49) and Geography (1854- 57). His translation of thirteen of Plutarch’s Lives, with copious notes, first came out in five of Knight’s weeklyvolumes under the title of The Civil Wars of Rome (1844— 48). He planned and edited Knight’s Political Dictionary (1845-46), a revision of articles from the Penny Cyclopaedia. Knight published in parts his History of France and its Revolutions, 1789-1848 (1850).

In 1849 he left London and went to Brighton College, where he was classical lecturer until midsummer 1871. He was an excellent teacher, and was beloved by both masters and pupils. Whilst here he edited, at first jointly with the Rev. A. J. Macleane, and after that gentleman’s death by himself, the Bibliotheca Classica series, to which he himself contributed the edition of Cicero’s Orations (1851— 62), a task for which his legal knowledge eminently qualified him. He also revised, making many corrections and additions, Macleane’s editions of Juvenal and Persius (1867) and Horace (1869). He made for Bell’s Grammar School Classics editions, with introductions and notes, of Cicero’s De Senectute and De Amicitia, with a selection from his Epistolae (1850), Caesar’s Gallic War (1853), and Sallust’s Catilina and Jugurtha (1860). He also edited an Atlas of Classical Geography (1854). His translation (f the Thoughts of the Emperor Μ. Aurelius Antoninus was published in 1862. The same year appeared anonymously the amusing and instructive little volume called An Old Man’s Thoughts about Many Things. He was sixty-four when he issued the first of the five large octavo volumes of his Decline of the Roman Republic. In 1871 he resigned his post at Brighton College, and retired to Portfield, Chichester, to take a rest well-earned but from labours ill-rewarded. In 1873 the Queen, on the recommendation of Mr Gladstone, granted him a pension of £100 a year. At Portfield he completed his Roman History (1874), and translated The Discourses of Epictetus, with the Eηcheiridion and Fragments (1877). This was the last work of his laborious and useful life. He died after a long and painful illness on the 10th of August 1879.

In addition to the works already noticed, Long was the author of two papers in the Journal of the Royal Geographical Society, a few in the early numbers of the Penny Magazine, and several in the Classical Museum and English Journal of Education. He also wrote on “Grammar Schools,” in Knight’s Store of Knowledge.

Long has exercised by his writings, and indirectly through some of his London university pupils, a wide influence on the teaching of the Greek and Latin languages in England. The publication of the Bibliotheca Classica (begun in 1851) did important service, and set English scholars an excellent example, at a time when editions with English notes containing accurate learning and sound scholarship were, with very few exceptions, not to be found. Some of the volumes of this series still remain the standard [9:14:857] English editions. In the knowledge of Roman law Long stood by himself amongst English scholars, and his well-known articles on that subject were the first valuable contribution to the study from any English writer. He had also a profound knowledge of ancient geography. He was an excellent French, German, and Italian scholar, and also read Spanish. His extensive and accurate learning may be explained from the combination of a tenacious memory with a clear judicial intellect. His character was as elevated as his intellect. Its simplicity and manly independence may be seen partly in his writings. His faculty for discriminating evidence and his strong common sense appear in everything that he wrote. (H. J. Μ.)
