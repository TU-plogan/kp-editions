LIME, or Linden. The lime trees, species of Tilia, are familiar timber trees with mellifluous flowers, rarely if ever maturing their fruit in England, which are borne on a common peduncle proceeding from the middle of a long bract. T. europxa, L., is indigenous to Europe, excepting thé extreme north, and extends eastwards across Russian Asia to the Altai. The lime is much planted in Britain, and is probably wild in south and west England, and perhaps in Ireland. The truly indigenous form in north Europe is always a small-leaved one. The large leaved variety (T. grandifolia, Ehrh.) is of South-European origin (Bentham, Handbook of the British Flora, i. 157); T. parvifolia, L., is perhaps the English wild form of the Continental T. europaea, L.; while T. intermedia, D. C., probably a sub-species of T. europaea, L., is the so-called common lime (Hooker, Student's Flora of the British Isles, p. 76). For a full description of the European and American forms, see Loudon, Arboretum, i. p. 364, and De Candolle, Prod., i. 513. The lime sometimes acquires a great size: one is recorded in Norfolk as being 16 yards in circumference, and Ray mentions one of the same girth. The famous linden tree which gave the town of Neustadt in Würtemburg the name of “Neustadt an der grossen Linden” was 9 feet in diameter.

The economic value of the tree chiefly lies in the inner bark or liber, called bast, and the wood. The former was used for paper and mats and for tying garlands by the ancients (Ocl., i. 38; Pliny, xvi. 14, 25; xxiv. 8, 33). T. grandifolia and T. parvifolia have been found in the debris of lake dwellings in Switzerland. Bast mats are now made chiefly in Russia, the bark beiug cut in long strips, when the liber is easily separable from the corky superficial layer. It is then plaited into mats about 2 yards square; 14,000,000 come to Britain annually, chiefly from Archangel. The wood is used by carvers, being soft and light, and by architects in framing the models of buildings. Turners use it for light bowls, &c. The flowers, alone, are used for an infusion in Austria and elsewhere, with much success in vertigo and spasms, producing perspiration, and alleviating coughs; but the bracts and fruit are astringent.

The common lime was well known to the ancients. Theophrastus says the leaves are sιveet and used for fodder for most kinds of cattle. Pliny alludes to the use of the liber and wood, and describes the tree as growing in the mountain valleys of Italy (xvi. 30). See also Virg., Gcο., i. 173, &c.; Ov., Met., viii. 621, x. 92. The φtλυpα (Hdt., 4. 67) was the lime of the Greeks, perhaps Τ. αrgeηteα (see Pickering’s Chron. Hist, of Plants, pp. 214, 227, 418). Allusion to the lightness of the wood is made in Aristoph., Birds, 1378.

For the sweet lime (Citrus Limetta) and lime juice, see Lemon.
