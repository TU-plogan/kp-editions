LENFANT, Jacques (1661-1728), author of numerous works, chiefly in ecclesiastical history, was born at Bazoche (Eure-et-Loir) on April 13, 1661. His father, Paul Lenfant, was Protestant pastor at Bazoche and afterwards at Châtillon-sur-Loing until the revocation of the edict of Nantes, when he removed to Cassel. After studying at Saumur and Geneva, Lenfant completed his theological course at Heidelberg, where in 1684 he was ordained pastor of the French Protestant church, and appointed chaplain to the dowager electress palatine. The French invasion in 1688 compelled his withdrawal to Berlin, where in the following year he was again appointed by Frederick to be one of the ministers of the French Protestant church; this office he continued to hold until his death, ultimately adding to it that of chaplain to the king, with the dignity of consistorialrath. He visited Holland and England in 1707, and had the honour of preaching before Queen Anne, and, it is said, of being invited to become one of her chaplains. In search of materials for his histories he visited Helmstadt in 1712, and Leipsic in 1715 and 1725, but otherwise the course of his life was quite uneventful. He died at Berlin on August 7, 1728.

An exhaustive catalogue of his publications, thirty-two in all, will be found in Chauffepié’s Dictionnaire, where his personal excellencies are dwelt upon with some fulness and warmth. See also Haag’s France Protestante. He is now best known by his Histoire du Concile de Constance, tirée principalement d'Autezιrs qui ont assisté au Concile (Amsterdam, 1714; 2d ed., 1728; English translation, 1730). It is of course largely dependent upon the previous laborious work of Van der Hardt, but has indisputable literary merits peculiar to itself, and in particular has been praised on all sides for its fairness. It was followed by Histoire du. Concile de Pise, et de ce qui s’est passé de plus mémorable depuis ce Concile jusqu' au Concile de Constance (1724), and (posthumously) by [9:14:446] Histoire de la Guerre des Hussites et du Concile de Basle (Amst., 1731; German translation, Vienna, 1783-84). Lenfant was one of the chief promoters of the Bibliothèque Germanique, begun in 1720; and he was associated with Beausobre in the preparation of the new French translation of the New Testament with original notes, published at Amsterdam in 1718.
