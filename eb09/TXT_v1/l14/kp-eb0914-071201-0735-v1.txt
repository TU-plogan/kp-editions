LIUTPRAND (c. 922-972), Italian chronicler, was born towards the beginning of the 10th century, of a good Lombard family. The name is sometimes spelled Liudprand and even Luitprand. In 931 he entered the service of King Hugo of Italy as page; he afterwards rose to a high position at the court of Hugo’s successor Berengarius, having become chancellor, and having been sent (949) on an embassy to the Byzantine court. Falling into disgrace with Berengarius, he attached himself to the emperor Otto I., whom in 9G1 he accompanied into Italy, and by whom in 962 he was made bishop of Cremona. He was frequently employed in missions to the pope, and on two occasions (968, 971) to Byzantium, to negotiate on behalf of the younger Otto (afterwards Otto II.) for the hand of Theophano.

All are to be found in the Monum. Germ. Hist, of Pertz, and in the

Compare Wattenbach, Deutschlands Geschichtsquellen im Mittelalter (3d ed., 1873).
