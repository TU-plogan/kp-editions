LECCE, one of most important cities of Southern Italy, and the administrative centre of the province of Lecce (formerly Terra d’Otranto), is situated on the railway between Brindisi and Otranto, about 8 miles from the coast of the Adriatic. Down to the middle of the 18th century it was defended by regular fortifications constructed in the 16th century, and it still preserves some of the gateways, as well as a triumphal arch erected in honour of the entry of Charles V. Among its public buildings are the cathedral (dedicated to St Orontius, traditional first bishop of the city, whose statue, on a lofty column, adorns the principal square), the old convent of the Celestines now [9:14:397] occupied by the prefecture, the old convent of the Capuchins, and the marble church of St Nicholas. Benevolent institutions are specially numerous, and include a hospital dating from 1389, and a communal orphanage from 1608. A public library was founded in 1863. The name of Lecce has long been familiar throughout Italy in connexion with the great tobacco factory now located in the Dominican convent; and cotton and woollen goods, lace, artificial flowers, hats, &c., are among the products of the local industry. The population increased from 17,836 in 1861 to 18,460 in 1871.

Lecce is identified with Lupiae, a city of the Salentines, and, though remains of ancient edifices are no longer to be seen, there is evidence of the existence of extensive substructions as late as the 15th century. The name Lycëa, or Lycia, begins to appear in the 6th century. The city was for some time held by counts of Norman blood, among whom the most noteworthy is Bohemond, son of Robert Guiscard. It afterwards passed to the Orsini. The rank of provincial capital was bestowed by Ferdinand of Aragon in acknowledgment of the fidelity of Lecce to his cause. Scipione Ammirato (Florentine historian), Domenico de Angelis, and G. Baglivi the anatomist were natives of the city.
