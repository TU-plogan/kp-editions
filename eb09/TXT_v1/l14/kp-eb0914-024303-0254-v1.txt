LÄMMERGEYER (i.e., Lamb-Vulture), or Bearded Vulture, the Paleo barbatus of Linnaeus and the Gypaetus barbatus of modern ornithologists, one of the grandest birds-of-prey of the Palaearctic Region—inhabiting lofty mountain chains from Portugal to the borders of China, though within historic times, if not within living memory, it has been exterminated in several of its ancient haunts. Its northern range in Europe does not seem to have extended further than the southern frontier of Bavaria, or the neighbourhood of Salzburg;^[1. Dr Girtanner has a valuable paper on this bird in Switzerland (Verhandl. Si-Gall, naturw. Gesellschaft, 1869-70, pp. 147-244).] but in Asia it formerly reached a higher latitude, having been found even so lately as 1830 in Dauuria (see Birds, vol iii. p. 736, note 3), where according to Herr Radde (Beitr. Kenntn. Russ. Reichs, xxiii. p. 467) it has now left but its name. It is not uncommon on many parts of the Himalayas, where it breeds, and on the mountains of Kumaon and the Punjab, and is the “Golden Eagle” of most Anglo-Indians. Returning westward, it is found also in Persia, Palestine, Crete and Greece, the Italian Alps, Sicily, Sardinia, and Mauritania.

In some external characters the Lämmergeyer is obviously intermediate between the Families Vulturidse and Palconidse, and the opinion of systematists has from time to time varied as to its proper position; but as this ought to depend on the decision of anatomists, who have not yet delivered their verdict, it must be still left in doubt; and there would be little advantage in recounting how one author has referred it to the former group and another to the latter, since nobody seems to have applied the only sure test—that afforded by characters which are not superficial^[2. Professor Huxley’s labours have unfortunately not been directed to this particular point, and therefore throw little or no light on it. He puts the Vultwridae and Falconidae together under the name of Gyρ-aetidae, very properly separating from them the American Vultures as Cathartidae.] It will suffice to say that most writers have deemed its Vulturine affinity the strongest (relying apparently on the form of the beak, which can scarcely be said to be either Aquiline or Falconine), in spite of its well-feathered head and tarsi. The whole length of the bird is from 43 to 46 inches, of which, however, about 20 are due to the long cuneiform tail, while the pointed wings measure more than 30 inches from the carpal joint to the tip. The coloration of the plumage is very peculiar: the top of the head is white, bounded by black, which, beginning in stiff bristly feathers turned forwards over the base of the beak, proceeds on either side of the face in a well-defined band to the eye, where it bifurcates into two narrow stripes, of which the upper one passes above and beyond that feature till just in front of the scalp it suddenly turns upwards across the head and meets the corresponding stripe from the opposite side, enclosing the white forehead already mentioned, while the lower stripe extends beneath the eye about as far backwards and then suddenly stops. A tuft of black, bristly feathers projects beardlike from the base of the mandible, and gives the bird one of its commonest epithets in many languages, as well as an appearance almost unique among the whole Class Aves. The rest of the head, the neck, throat, and lower parts generally are clothed with lanceolate feathers of a pale tawny colour—sometimes so pale as to be nearly white beneath;^[3. Herr Meves (Ofoers. Vet. Akad. Förhandlingar, 1860, p. 487) asserts that in some cases, as proved by chemical tests, the red colouring is due to a superficial deposit of oxide of iron on the feathers, and that the colouring-matter on the eggs (to be presently described) also arises from the same cause. This opinion has, however, been denied by several other naturalists, though none of them seem to have tried the experiment; while Mr Hume, who has (Scrap Book, p. 46), confirms Herr Meves’s statement. In confinement, moreover, the bird has been observed always to lose or not to acquire its tawny tint.] while the scapulars, [9:14:244] back, and wing-coverts generally, are of a glossy greyish-black, most of the feathers having a white shaft and a median tawny line. The quill-feathers, both of the wings and tail, are of a dark blackish-grey. The irides are of a light orange, and the sclerotic tunics,—equivalent to the “white of the eye” in most animals,—which in few birds are visible, are in this very conspicuous and of a deep crimson, giving it an air of great ferocity. In the young of the year the whole head, neck, and throat are clothed in dull black, and most of the feathers of the mantle and wing-coverts are broadly tipped and mesially streaked with tawny or lightish grey.

The Lämmergeyer breeds early in the year. The nest is of large size, built of sticks, lined with soft material, and placed on a ledge of rock—a spot being chosen, and often occupied for many years, which is nearly always difficιilt of access, and not un frequently quite inaccessible, to man, from the precipitous or overhanging configuration of the cliffs. Here in the month of February a single egg is usually laid. This is more than 3 inches in length by nearly 2 J in breadth, of a pale but lively brownish-orange. The young when in the nest are clad in down of a dirty white, varied with grey on the head and neck, and with ochraceous in the iliac region. How long the eggs take in hatching, or how long the young remain nestlings, seems to be unknown. Equally unknown is the length of time that elapses before the latter assume the adult plumage, but it is probable that this period must at least exceed a twelvemonth.

There is much discrepancy as to the ordinary food of the Lämmergeyer, some observers maintaining that it lives almost entirely on carrion, offal, and the most disgusting garbage; but there is no question of its frequently taking living prey, and it is reasonable to suppose that this bird, like so many others, is not everywhere uniform in its habits. Its very name shews it to be the reputed enemy of shepherds, and it is in some measure owing to their hostility that it has been exterminated in so many parts of its European range. The usual mode of proceeding is said to be by suddenly rushing at the animal, especially if it be young, when in a somewhat dangerous position, so startling it as to make it lose its foothold and fall down the precipice.^[4. Stories are told of its attacking human beings under such circumstances, and the present writer is not disinclined to believe that some of such stories may be true, though he is unable to refer to any that rest on testimony sufficient to dispel all doubt.] But the Lämmergeyer has also a great partiality for bones, which when small enough it swallows and slowly digests. When they are too large, it is said to soar with them to a great height and drop them on a rock or stone that they may be broken into pieces of convenient size. Hence its name Ossifrage,^[5. Among other crimes attributed to the species is that, according to Pliny (Hist. Nat., x. cap. 3), of having caused the death of the poet Aeschylus, by dropping a tortoise on his bald head! In the Atlas range the food of this bird is said to consist chiefly of the Τestudo rnauritanica, which “it carries to some height in the air, and lets fall on a stone to break the shell” (Ibis, 1859, p. 177). It was the iριrη and φ∙f∣νη of Greek classical writers.] by which the Hebrew Peres is rightly translated in the Authorized Version of the Bible (Lev. xi. 13; Deut. xiv. 12)—a word corrupted into Osprey (⅛.u), and applied to a bird which has no habit of the kind.

The Lämmergeyer of north-eastern and south Africa is deemed by systematists to be specifically distinct, and is known as Gypaetus meridionalis or G. nudipes. In habits it seems closely to resemble the northern bird, from which it differs in little more than wanting the black stripe below the eye and having the lower part of the tarsus bare of feathers. It is the “Golden Eagle” of Bruce’s Travels, and has been beautifully figured by Mr Wolf in Dr Rüppell’s Syst. Uebers. der Vogel Nord-0 st- Afrika 1 s (Taf. 1). (a. N.)
