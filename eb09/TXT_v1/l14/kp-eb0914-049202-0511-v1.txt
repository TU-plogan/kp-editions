LEWIS, Sir George Cornewall, Bart. (1806-1863), statesman and man of letters, was born in London on 21st April 1806. l·Iis father, Thomas F. Lewis of Harpton Court, Radnorshire, after holding subordinate office in various administrations became a poor-law commissioner. He was made a baronet in 1846. Lewis was educated at Eton, and at Christ Church, Oxford, where in 1828 he took a first-class in classics and a second-class in mathematics. He then entered the Middle Temple, and was called to the bar in 1831. In the year before he had, with John Romilly and John Stuart Mill, attended the celebrated lectures on jurisprudence delivered by John Austin at London University. In 1832 he undertook his first public work as one of the commissioners to inquire into the condition of the poor Irish residents in the United Kingdom.^[1. See the Abstract of Final Report of Commissioners of Irish Poor Enquiry, &c., by G. C. Lewis and N. Seniσr, 1837.] Again, in 1834, Lord Althorp included him in the commission to inquire into the state of church property and church affairs generally in Ireland. To this fact we owe his work on Local Disturbances in Ireland, and the Irish Church Question (London, 1836), in which he condemned the existing connexion between church and state, proposed a state provision for the Catholic clergy, and maintained the necessity of an efficient workhouse organization. During this period of apprenticeship to politics Lewis’s mind was much occupied with the phenomena of language. Before leaving college he had published some observations on Whately’s doctrine of the predicables, and soon afterwards he assisted Thirlwall and Hare in starting the Philological Museum. Its successor, the Classical Museum, he also supported by occasional contributions. In 1835 he published an Essay on the Origin and Formation of the liomance Languages (re-edited in 1862), which, though anticipated by Schlegel, may be taken as the first effective criticism in England of Raynouard’s theory of a uniform romance tongue, represented by the poetry of the troubadours. He also set an excellent example to county gentlemen by compiling a glossary of provincial words used in Herefordshire and the adjoining counties. But the most important work of this earlier period was one to which his logical and philological tastes both contributed. The Remarks on the Use and Abuse of some Political Terms (London, 1832) may have been suggested by Bentham’s Look of Parliamentary Fallacies, but it shows all that power of clear sober original thinking which marks his larger and later political works. And yet this original mind did more than most scholars in the humbler walk of useful translation. He translated Boeckh’s Public Economy of Athens and Miiller’s History of Greek Literature, and he assisted Tufnell in the translation[9:14:493] of Miiller’s Dorians. Some time afterwards he edited a text of the Fables of Babrius. While his friend Hayward conducted the Law Magazine, he wrote in it frequently on such subjects as secondary punishments and the penitentiary system. In 1836, at the request of Lord Glenelg, he accompanied John Austin to Malta, where they spent nearly two years reporting on the condition of the island and framing a new code of laws. One leading object of both commissioners was to associate the Maltese in the responsible government of the dependency. On his return to England Lewis succeeded his father as one of the principal poor-law commissioners. But his literary activity did not cease. In 1841 appeared the Essay on the Government of Dependencies, a systematic statement and discussion of the various relations in which colonies may stand towards the mother country. In 1844 Lewis married Lady Maria Theresa Lister, sister of Lord Clarendon, and a lady of literary tastes. Much of their married life was spent in Kent House, Knightsbridge. They had no children. In 1847 Lewis resigned his office. He was then returned for the county of Hereford, and Lord John Russell appointed him secretary to the Board of Control, but a few months afterwards he became under secretary to the Home Office. In this capacity he introduced two important bills, one for the abolition of turnpike trusts and the management of highways by a mixed county board, the other for the purpose of defining and regulating the law of parochial assessment. On the latter subject his evidence before the select committee (Lords) of 1850 is the clearest statement of general results which we have. In that year he succeeded Hayter as financial secretary to the Treasury. About this time, also, appeared his Essay on the Influence of Authority in Matters of Opinion. Lewis seems to have thought that authority was too much divided to be of much use in theological matters, while in the world of science he found sufficient authority for declaring that homoeopathy, mesmerism, and phrenology were all impostures. On the dissolution of parliament which followed the resignation of Lord John Russell’s ministry in 1852, Lewis was defeated for Herefordshire and then for Peterborough. Excluded from parliament he accepted the editorship of the Edinburgh Review, which the death of Empson had left vacant. Lord Halifax offered him, in 1853, the governorship of Bombay, but he remained editor until 1855. During this period he did some public work on the Oxford commission, and on the commission to inquire into the government of London. But its chief fruits were the Treatise on the Methods of Observation and Reasoning in Politics, and the Enquiry into the Credibility of the Early Roman History, ^[2. Translated into German by Liebrecht, ∏anover, 1858.] in which he vigorously attacks the theory of epic lays and other theories on which Niebuhr’s reconstruction of that history had proceeded. In 1855 Lewis succeeded his father in the baronetcy. He was at once elected member for the Radnor boroughs, and Lord Palmerston made him chancellor of the exchequer. The position was difficult, for he had a war loan to contract and heavy additional taxation to impose. But his industry, method, and clear vision carried him safely through. His financial statement of 13th February 1857, and his speech on 12th February

1858 on the bill for the better government of India were most successful efforts. After the change of ministry in

1859 Sir George became home secretary under Lord Palmerston, and in 1861, much against his wish, he succeeded Sidney Herbert (Lord Herbert of Lea) at the War Office. The closing years of his life were marked by increasing intellectual vigour. In 1859 he published an able Essay on Foreign Jurisdiction and the Extradition of Criminals, a subject to which the attempt on Napoleon’s life, the discussions on the Conspiracy Bill, and the trial of Bernard, had drawn general attention. He advocated the extension of extradition treaties, and condemned the principal idea of Weltrechtsordnung which Mohl of Heidelberg had proposed. His two latest works were the Survey of the Astronomy of the Ancients, in which, without professing any knowledge of Oriental languages, he applies a sceptical analysis to the ambitious Egyptology of Bunsen; and the Dialogue on the Best Form of Government, in which, under the name of Crito, the author points out to the supporters of the various systems that there is no one abstract government which is the best possible for all times and places. An essay on the Characteristics of Federal, National, Provincial, and Municipal Government does not seem to have been published. Sir George died in April 1863. A marble bust by Weekes stands in Westminster Abbey. He has two other monuments—the reprint from the Edinburgh Review of his long series of papers on the Administrations of Great Britain (1864), and his Letters to various Friends (1870), edited by his brother, who succeeded him in the baronetcy.

Lewis was a man of mild and affectionate disposition, much beloved by a large circle of friends, among whom were Sir E. Head, the Grotes, the Austins, Lord Stanhope, J. S. Mill, Dean Milman, the Duff Gordons. In public life he was distinguished, says Lord Aberdeen, “for candour, moderation, love of truth.” He had a passion for the systematic acquirement of knowledge, and a keen and sound critical faculty. Nothing is more remarkable than the practical good sense of his speculative writings. Sometimes he betrayed a slight intellectual impatience: but this was merely the passing irritation of a healthy and modest judgment.
