LATREILLE, Pierre-André (1762-1833), French naturalist, was born in humble circumstances at Brives-la-Gaillarde, now in the department of Corrèze, France, on November 29, 1762. His abilities attracted the attention of the Baron d’Espagnac, who in 1778 placed him at the Collège Lemoine at Paris, where the Abbé Haiiy was at that time a teacher. Having chosen the ecclesiastical career, he was admitted to priestly orders in 1786, and in the same year retired to Brives, devoting all the leisure which the discharge of his professional duties allowed to the study of entomology. In 1788 he returned to Paris and found means of making himself known to the leading naturalists there,—Fabricius, Olivier, Bose, Lamarck; his first important contribution to his special science, a “Mémoire sur les Mutilles découvertes en France,” contributed to the Proceedings of the Society of Natural History in Paris, procured for him the honour of admission to that body, and of being made a corresponding member of the Linnean Society of London. At the Revolution he was compelled to quit Paris, and as a priest of conservative sympathies suffered considerable hardship; he lay for some time in prison at Bordeaux, and gained his liberty at last only through the intervention of the naturalists Bory de Saint-Vincent and Dargelas. His Precis des Caractères génériques des insectes, disposés dans un ordre naturel, appeared at Brives in 1796. In 1798 he became a corresponding member of the Institute, and at the same time was entrusted with the task of arranging the entomological collection at the recently organized “Muséum d’Histoire Naturelle” (Jardin des Plantes); in 1814 he succeeded Olivier as member of the Académie des Sciences, and in [9:14:346] 1821 he was made a chevalier of the Legion of Honour. For some time he acted as professor of zoology in the veterinary school at Alfort near Paris, and in 1830, when the chair of zoology of invertebrates at the Muséum was divided after the death of Lamarck, Latreille was appointed professor of zoology of crustaceans, arachnids, and insects, that of molluscs, worms, and zoophytes being assigned to De Blainville. “On me donne du pain quand je n’ai plus de dents,” said Latreille, who was then in his sixty-eighth year. He died on February 6, 1833.

In addition to the works already mentioned, the numerous works of Latreille include— Histoire naturelle générale et particulière des Crustacés et Insectes (14 vols., 1802-5), forming part of Sonnini’s edition of Buffon; Genera Crustaceorum et Insectorum, secundum ordinem naturalem in familias disposita, 4 vols., 1806-7; Considérations générales su/r l'ordre naturel des animaux composant les classes des Crustacés, des Arachnides, et des Insectes, 1810; Familles naturelles du règne animal, exposées succinctement et dans un ordre analytique, 1825; Cours d:Entomologie (of which only the first volume appeared, 1831); the whole of the section “Crustacés, Arachnides, Insectes,” in Cuvier’s Règne Animal ; besides many papers in the Annales du Muséum, the Encyclopédie Méthodique, the Dictionnaire Classique d’ Histoire Naturelle, and elsewhere.
