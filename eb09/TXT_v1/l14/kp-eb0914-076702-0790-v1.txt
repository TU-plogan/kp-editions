LODEVE, capital of an arrondissement of the department of Hérault, France, lies at an elevation of 674 feet, under a range of hills rising to 2790 feet, in a small valley where the Soulondré joins the Lergue, a tributary of the Hérault, 34 miles east-north-east from Montpellier. A bridge over the Lergue connects the town with the faubourg of Carmes on the left bank of the river, and two bridges over the Soulondré lead to the extensive ruins of the Chateau de Montbrun. There is railway communication with Agde by a line following the Hérault valley. The old cathedral of St Fulcran, founded by him in 950, was rebuilt in the 14th century and restored in the 16 th; the cloister, dating from the 15 th century, is ornate in style. In the picturesque environs of the town stands the well-preserved monastery of St Michel de Grammont, dating from the 12th century; it is now used as farm buildings. In the neighbourhood are three fine dolmens. Lodève is one of the most important industrial centres of the south of France, upwards of 7000 workmen being employed in the manufacture of woollens for army clothing; the aggregate horse-power of the factories is 1500. Wool is imported in large quantities from the neighbouring provinces, and from Morocco; the exports are cloth to Italy and the Levant, wine, brandy, chemicals, and wood. The population in 1876 was 10,528.

Luteva existed prior to the invasion of the Romans, who for some time called it Fοrurn Neronis. The inhabitants were converted to Christianity by St Flour, first bishop of the city, about 323. After passing successively into the hands of the Visigoths, the Franks, the Ostrogoths, the Arabs, and the Carlovingians, it became in the 9th century a separate countship, and afterwards the domain of the bishops of Lodeve. During the religious wars it suffered much, especially in 1573, when it was sacked. It ceased to be an episcopal see in 1789.
