LAZARITES, Lazarists, or Lazarians. The origin oι the “Congregation of Priests of the Mission” may in some sense be traced back to 1617, the year of the successful labours of St Vincent de Paul, assisted by five other priests, for the evangelization of the common people in the parish of Châtillon-sur-Chalaronne, near Bourg. More im mediately it dates from 1625, when the little community acquired a permanent settlement in the Collège des Bons Enfans in Paris. Archiépiscopal recognition was obtained in 1626; and by papal bull in January 1632 the society was constituted a congregation, with St Vincent de Paul at its head. Shortly afterwards the establishment was confirmed by letters patent from Louis XIII. About the same time the canons regular of St Victor handed over to the congregation the priory of St Lazarus in Paris, which henceforth became its chief house, and gave to the fathers of the mission the name by which they are best known. Within a few years they had acquired another house in Paris and set up other establishments throughout France; and in 1639, 1641, and 1651 they broke ground in Savoy, Italy, and Poland respectively. A fresh bull of Alexander VII. in April 1655 further confirmed the society; this was followed by a brief in September of the same year, regulating its constitution. The rules then adopted, which were framed on the model of those of the Jesuits, were published at Paris in 1658 under the title Begulae seu Constitutiones communes congregationis missionis. The special objects contemplated were the religious instruction of the lower classes, the training of the clergy, the relief or redemption of prisoners in Barbary, and foreign missions. In the pursuit of these objects the Lazarite priests have had a chequered history in the various quarters of the world where they have gained a footing. At the French Revolution they were dispersed, so far as France was concerned, but permitted to reappear under the empire, and rehabilitated at the Restoration. In Sardinia they had a similar history. Throughout Italy they have been affected by recent political changes just as the rest of the religious orders have been. The Lazarist province of Poland was singularly prosperous; at the date of suppression in 1796 it possessed thirty-five establishments. The order was permitted to return in 1816, but is now extinct there. In Madagascar it had a mission from 1648 till 1674. In 1783 Lazarists were appointed to take the place of the Jesuits in the Levantine and Chinese missions; they still have some footing in China, and in 1874 their establishments throughout the Turkish empire numbered sixteen. In the same year they had fourteen establishments in the United States of America. The total number of Lazarists throughout the world is computed at about 3000.
