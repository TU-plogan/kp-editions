SCHLÖZER, August Ludwig von (1735-1809), German historian, was born at Gaggstedt, in the county of Hohenlohe-Kirchberg, on the 5th July 1735. Having studied at the universities of Wittenberg and Göttingen, he went in 1755 as a tutor to Stockholm, and afterwards to Upsala; and while in Sweden he wrote in the Swedish language an Essay on the History of Trade (1758). In 1759 he returned to Göttingen, where he began the study of medicine. Afterwards he went to St Petersburg with Müller, the Russian historiographer, as Müller’s literary assistant and as tutor in his family. Here Schlözer learned the Russian language and devoted himself to the study of Russian history; and in 1762 he was made an adjunct of the Academy and a teacher at the Rasumovski educational institute. A quarrel with Miiller placed him in a position of some difficulty, from which he was happily delivered by a call to a professorship at the university of Göttingen. He began his career at Göttingen in 1767, and soon ranked among the foremost historical writers of his day. His most important works were his Allgemeine nordische Geschichte (1772) and his translation of the Russian chronicler Nestor to the year 980 (1802-9). He awoke much intelligent interest in universal history by his Weltgeschichte im Auszuge und Zusammenhange (1792-1801); and in several works he helped to lay the foundations of statistical science. He also produced a strong impression by his political writings, the Briefwechsel (10 vols., 1776-82) and the Staatsanzeigen (18 vols., 1782-93). In 1804 he was ennobled by the emperor of Russia. He withdrew from active life in 1805, and died on the 9th September 1809.

See Zermelo, August Ludwig Schlözer (1875), and Wesendonk, Die Begründung der neuern deutschen Geschiehtschreibung durch, Gatterer und Schlözer (1876). Schlözer’s daughter, Dorothea, born on the 10th August, 1770, was one of the most learned women of her time, and received in 1787 the degree of doctor. She was recognized as an authority on several subjects, especially on Russian coinage. After her marriage with Rodde, the burgomaster of Lübeck, she devoted herself to domestic duties. She died on the 12th July 1825. Schlözer’s sou Christian (born 1774, died 1831) was a professor at Bonn, and published Anfangsgründe der Staatswirthschaft (1804-6) and his father’s Oeffentliches und Prwat-Leben aus Originalurkunden (1828).
