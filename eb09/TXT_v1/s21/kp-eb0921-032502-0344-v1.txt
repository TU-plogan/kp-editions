SAVIGLIANO, a city of Italy, in the province of Cuneo, 31½ miles by rail south of Turin, lies in a plain between the Maira and the Mellea (head-streams of the Po) 1081 feet above the sea. It still retains some traces of its ancient walls, demolished in 1707, and has a fine collegiate church (Sant’ Andrea, dating at least from the 11th century, but in its present form comparatively modern), a triumphal arch erected in honour of the marriage of Victor Amadeus I. with Christine of France, and in the Taffini palace paintings by the 16th-century local artist Giovanni Mollineri (Mulinari, Il Caraccino). Savigliano has long been a place of considerable industrial activity; its modern manufactures comprise paper, silk, and beer. The population was 9932 in 1881 (commune 17,150).

First mentioned in 981 as Villa Savilliani, Savigliano appears in the 12th century as a member of the Lombard league. Its name perpetually crops up in the history of Piedmont and Savoy. It was besieged and taken by the duke of Savoy in 1347 and again in 1367; and in the 16th and 17th centuries it suffered severely from French garrisons. Charles Emmanuel I. died in 1630 at Savigliano, where the Piedmontese senate had met to escape the pestilence.[9:21:326]
