ST CHRISTOPHER, or St Kitts, one of the Leeward Islands, West Indies, situated in 17° 18' N. lat. and 62° 48' W. long. Its length is 23 miles, its greatest breadth 5 miles, and the total area 68 square miles. Mountains traverse the central part from south-east to north-west, the greatest height, Mount Misery, being about 4100 feet above sea-level. On the seaboard is Basseterre, the capital, the outlet of a fertile plain, which contains the cultivated land. The thermometer ranges from 78 to 84 Fahr. St Christopher is united with Nevis (q.v.) as one colony, with one executive and one legislative council (official and nominated) for the united presidency.
