SALEM, a British district of India, in Madras presidency, lying between 11° 1' and 12° 57' N. lat. and 77° 32' and 79° 5' E. long. It embraces an area of 7653 square miles, and is bounded on the N. by Mysore and North Arcot, on the S. by Coimbatore and Trichinopoly, on the E. by Trichinopoly and South and North Arcot, and on the W. by Coimbatore and Mysore. Except towards the south, the district is very hilly, with large plains lying between the several ranges. Salem is described as consisting of three distinct tracts of country, known as the Tálaghát, the Báramahál, and the Bálághát. The Talaghat is situated below the Eastern Ghats on the level of the Carnatic generally; the Báramahál includes the whole Salem face of the Ghats and a wide tract of country at their base; and the

Bálághát is situated above the Ghats on the tableland of Mysore. The western part of the district is very mountainous, some of the ranges attaining an elevation of between 5000 and 6000 feet. Amongst the chief ranges are the Shevaroys, the Karáyans, the Melagiris, the Kollimalais, the Pachamalais, and the Yelagiris. The chief rivers are the Cauvery with its numerous tributaries, and the Pennar and Palar; the last, however, only flows through a few miles of the Tirupatúr táluk, situated in the north-western corner of the district. The forests are of considerable value and their area is roughly estimated at 2251 square miles. The geological structure of the district is mostly gneissic, with a few irruptive rocks in the form of trap dykes and granite veins. Magnetic iron ore is common in the hill regions, and corundum and chromate of iron are also obtainable. The qualities of the soil differ very much; in the country immediately surrounding the town of Salem a thin layer of calcareous and red loam generally prevails, through which quartz rocks appear on the surface in many places. The climate, owing to the great difference of elevation, varies considerably; on the hills it is cool and bracing, and for a great part of the year very salubrious; the average rainfall is about 38 inches. Salem has about 1400 miles of road, and the length of railway line within the district is 134 miles.

In 1881 the population was 1,599,595 (males 778,483, females 821,112); Hindus numbered 1,531,855, Mohammedans 51,092, and Christians 16,567. Besides Salem (see below), the capital, the district contains three other towns with a population exceeding 10,000 each, viz., Daringambadi (15,426), Tirupatúr (14,278), and Shendamangalam (12,575). Of the total area of the district only 1,283,190 acres were under cultivation in 1883-84; but of these 137,403 acres were twice cropped. The staple crops are rice and ragi; other important crops arc pulses and seeds. The chief industry is weaving, which is carried on in almost every large town and village. Carpets of great beauty and superior workmanship are made in the Salem jail. Good iron and steel are made, but only on a small scale. The gross revenue of the district in 1883-84 was £260,364, the land-tax contributing £211,062 of the amount. Though Salem has no connected history, there are few parts of Southern India that contain more spots of interest for English students. As at present composed it was acquired by the treaty of peace with Tipu Sultan in 1792 and the partition treaty of Mysore in 1799. By the former the Talaghat and Baramahal were ceded, and by the latter the Bálághát, or what is now the Osúr táluk.
