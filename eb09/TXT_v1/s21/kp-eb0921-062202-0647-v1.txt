SEGOVIA, a province of Spain, formerly part of Old Castile, is bounded on the N. and N.E. by the provinces of Burgos and Soria, on the S.E. by those of Guadalajara and Madrid, on the S.W. by Avila, and on the N.W. by Valladolid. It has an area of 2670 square miles, and the population in 1877 was 149,961. The greater portion of the country consists of a dry arable tableland, lifted some[9:21:623] 2500 feet above the sea, monotonous enough in appearance, and burnt to a dull brown during summer, but yet producing some of the finest corn in the Peninsula. Along the whole south-eastern boundary the Guadarrama range of mountains rises up suddenly, like a huge barrier, separating Old from New Castile and the basin of the Douro from that of the Tagus,—affording, too, among its ravines and upon its slopes some remarkably fine scenery. There are two well-known passes or “puertos” over the sierra, those of the Nava Cerrada and of Somosiera. The former has been, until quite a recent date, the chief means of communication with the outer world, save when blocked by winter snows. It winds round the lower southern slope of the Peñalara (8500 feet). The Puerto de Somosiera lies north of the Peñalara. By it in 1808 Napoleon descended upon Madrid. Though to the eye of the stranger almost desert-like in appearance, the province of Segovia is well watered by the streams which rise in the Guadarrama range and flow northwards to the Douro, and by careful methods of irrigation. The Eresma, Cega, Duraton, and Riaza are the principal watercourses. With the exception of Segovia and Sepulveda, there is no town of any importance,—the inhabitants being for the most part employed in agricultural and pastoral pursuits and backward in civilization. Since the completion (1883) of the railway from Medina del Campo to the city of Segovia, however, the towns en route have begun to show signs of animation; and, as the province contains monuments of deepest interest to the historian and ecclesiologist, it bids fair to receive its due measure of attention and enlightenment. At the foot of the Nava Cerrada pass lies the royal demesne and summer residence of La Granja, or San Ildefonso, one of the great show places of the Peninsula. The chief trades and manufactures formerly carried on in the province—weaving, tanning, making of earthenware, &c.—have been drawn away to more commercial centres. Paper-making holds its own to some extent, owing to the excellence of the water; and for the same reason, together with the superior quality of the breed of sheep, the picturesque scenes attendant upon the preparation of the fleeces may still be witnessed. Such prosperity, however, as Segovia retains is dependent upon its agricultural produce—wheat, rye, barley, peas, hemp, flax, Ac.—together with the rearing of sheep, cattle, mules, and pigs. The sierras yield excellent granite, marble, and limestone; but hitherto the difficulty of transport has prevented any development of mineral wealth.
