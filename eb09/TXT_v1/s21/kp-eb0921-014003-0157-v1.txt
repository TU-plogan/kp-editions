SACY, Antoine Isaac, Baron Silvestre ^[1. His father’s name was Silvestre, the addition De Sacy he took as a younger son after a fashion then common with the Parisian bourgeoisie.] de (1758- 1838), the greatest of French Orientalists and the founder of the modern school of Arabic scholarship, was the second son of a Parisian notary, and was born at Paris on 21st September 1758. From the age of seven years, when he lost his father, he was educated in more than monastic seclusion in the house of his pious and tender mother. Designed for the civil service, he studied jurisprudence, and in 1781 got a place as counsellor in the cour des monnaies, inwhich he continued till, in 1791, he was advanced to be a commissary-general in the same department. De Sacy had a natural turn for business and liked variety of work, while he seems to have had little or no need of absolute repose. He had successively acquired all the Semitic languages while he was following the usual course of school and professional training, and while he was engaged in the civil service he found time to make himself a great name as an Orientalist by a series of publications which, beginning with those Biblical subjects to which his education and sympathies naturally directed his first Semitic studies, gradually extended in range, and already displayed the comprehensive scholar who had chosen the whole Semitic and Iranian East for his domain.^[2. A communication to Eichhorn on the Paris MS. of the Syro-Hexaplar version of IV. Kings formed the basis of a paper in the latter’s Repertorium, vol. vii. (1780). This was De Sacy’s literary debut. It was followed by text and translation of the letters of the Samaritans to Jos. Scaliger (ibid., vol. xiii., 1783) and by a series of essays on Arabian and Persian history in the Recueil of the Academy of Inscriptions and in the Notices et Extraits.] The works of these early years do not show the full maturity of his powers; his chief triumph was an effective commencement of the decipherment of the Pahlaví inscriptions of the Sasanian kings (1787-91). It was the French Revolution which gained De Sacy wholly for letters. As a good Catholic and a staunch royalist he felt constrained in 1792 to retire from the public service, and lived in close seclusion in a cottage near Paris till in 1795 he was called to be professor of Arabic in the newly founded school of living Eastern languages. The years of retirement had not been fruitless; they were in part devoted to the study of the religion of the Druses, which continued to occupy him throughout life and was the subject of his last and unfinished work, the Exposé de la Religion des Druzes (2 vols., 1838). Nevertheless, when called to be a[9:21:141] teacher, he felt that he had himself much to learn. Since the death of Reiske Arabic learning had been in a backward state, the standard of philological knowledge was low, and the books for students extremely defective. De Sacy set himself with characteristic thoroughness to complete his own knowledge and supply the lacking helps to others, and he accomplished this task on such a scale, with such width of range, precision of thought, and scrupulous attention to details, that he became the founder of a wholly new school and the father of all subsequent Arabists. His great text-books, the Grammaire Arabe (2 vols., 1st ed. 1810, 2d ed. 1831) and the Chrestomathie (3 vols., 1st ed. 1806, 2d ed. 1826-31), together with its supplement, the Anthologie Grammaticale (1829), are works that can never become obsolete; the luminous exposition of the grammar and the happy choice of the pieces in the chrestomathy—all inedita—with the admirable notes, drawn from an enormous reading in MS. sources, make them altogether different from ordinary text-books. The whole powers of a great teacher, the whole wealth of knowledge of an unrivalled scholar, are spent with absolute singleness of purpose for the benefit of the learner, and the result is that the books are equally delightful and instructive to the student and to the advanced scholar. A comparison of the first and second editions shows how much toil and research it cost the author to raise his own scholarship to the level which, thanks to his work, has become the starting-place for all subsequent ascents of the Arabian Parnassus.

De Sacy’s place as a teacher was threatened at the outset by his conscientious refusal to take an oath of hatred to royalty. He tendered his resignation both as professor and as member of the Institute; but he was allowed to continue to teach, and rejoined the Institute on its reorganization in 1803. In 1805 he made the only considerable journey of his life, being sent to Genoa on a vain search for Arabic documents supposed to lie in the archives of that city. In 1806 he added the duties of Persian professor to his old chair, and from this time onwards—as, in spite of his royalist opinions, he was ready to do public service under any stable government—his life, divided between his teaching, his literary work, and a variety of public duties, was one of increasing honour and success, broken only by a brief period of retreat during the Hundred Days. He found time for everything: while his pen was ever at work on subjects of abstruse research, he was one of the most active leaders in all the business which the French system throws on the savans of the capital, especially as perpetual secretary of the Academy of Inscriptions (from 1832); in 1808 he entered the corps legislatif·, and in 1832, when quite an old man, he became a peer of France and was regular in the duties of the chamber.^[3. The title of baron he received from Napoleon in 1813.] In 1815 he became rector of the university of Paris, and after the second restoration he was active on the commission of public instruction. Of the Société Asiatique he was one of the founders, and when he was inspector of Oriental types at the royal printing press he thought it his duty to read a proof of every book printed in Arabic and Persian. With this he maintained a vast correspondence and was accessible not only to every one who sought his advice on matters of learning and business but to all the poor of his quarter, who came to him as a member of the bureau of charity. Yet he was neither monk nor hermit: he enjoyed society and was happy in forty-eight years of married life and in the care of a large family. Though small and to appearance of delicate frame, De Sacy enjoyed unbroken health and worked on without sign of failing powers till two days before his death (21st February 1838), when he suddenly fell down in the street and never rallied.

De Sacy wrote so much that a list even of his larger essays, mostly communicated to the Academy or in the Notices et Extraits, is impossible in this place, while his lesser papers and reviews in the Allg. Bib. f. biblische Litteratur, the Mines de 1’Orient, the Magasin Encyclopédique, the Journal des Savants (of which he was an editor), and the Journal Asiatique are almost innumerable. Among the works which he designed mainly for students may be classed his edition of Hariri (1822, 2d edition by Reinaud, 1847, 1855), with a selected Arabic commentary, and of the Alfiya (1833), and his Calila et Dimna (1816),—the Arabic version of that famous collection of Buddhist animal tales which has been in various forms one of the most popular books of the world. De Sacy’s enquiry into the wonderful history of these tales forms one of his best services to letters and a good example of the way in which he always made his work for the benefit of learners go hand in hand with profound research. Of his continued interest in Biblical subjects he gave evidence in his memoir on the Samaritan Arabic version of the Pentateuch (Mem. Acad, des Inscr., vol. xlix.), and in the Arabic and Syriac New Testaments edited for the British and Foreign Bible Society; among works important for Eastern history, besides that on the Druses already named, may be cited his version of Abd-Allatíf, Relation Arabe sur l’Égypte, and his essays on the History of the Law of Property in Egypt since the Arab conquest (1805-18). And, in conclusion, it must not be forgotten that his oral teaching was not less influential than his writings, and that, except Ewald, almost all Arabists of chief note in the first half of this century, in Germany as well as in France, were his personal pupils. Of the brilliant series of teachers who went out from his lecture-room one or two veterans still survive, and Professor Fleischer’s elaborate notes and corrections to the Grammaire Arabe (Kleinere Sehriften, vol. i., 1885) may be regarded as the latest tribute to the memory of the great master by a disciple who is now the patriarch of living Arabists.
