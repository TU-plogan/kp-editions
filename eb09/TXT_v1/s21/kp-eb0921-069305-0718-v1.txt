SETTLE, Elkanah (1648-1723), a minor poet and playwright of the Restoration period, immortalized by the ridicule of Dryden and Pope, was born at Dunstable in 1648. He is the “Doeg” of the second part of Absalom and Achitophel, and is treated by the satirist with somewhat more good-humoured contempt than his companion in the pillory—Shadwell.

Doeg, though without knowing how or why,

Made still a blundering kind of melody;

Spurr’d boldly on, and dash’d through thick and thin, Through sense and nonsense, never out nor in.

Dryden treats him as a sort of harmless fool, who “rhymed and rattled” along in perfect satisfaction with himself. For some time also he was taken by the public at his own valuation. At college he seems to have been regarded as a prodigy, and his juvenile verse was preferred to Dryden’s. Coming to London, he began to produce tragedies. His Empress of Morocco (acted in 1673, when the author was twenty-five) was a signal success on the stage, and is said by Dennis to have been “the first play that was ever sold in England for two shillings, and the first that was ever printed with cuts.” Puffed up by this success, Settle made haughty allusions in his preface, which excited the ire of his contemporaries; and Dryden co-operated with Crowne and Shadwell in writing sarcastic notes on The Empress. Settle’s next collision with Dryden was also provoked by himself. He attempted a counterblast to Dryden’s great satire in Absalom Senior, and was contemptuously demolished in return. Settle was then comparatively a young man, his age being thirty-five, but he had touched the height of his fame, and the remaining forty years of his life were not so successful. Dryden mockingly said of him that his ambition was to be “the master of a puppet-show,” alluding to his duties in the office of city poet, in which he was one of the successors of Lodge, Middleton, Jonson, and Quarles; and to this he was literally reduced in his old age, keeping a booth at Bartholomew Fair, where he is said to have played the part of the dragon in green leather. He died in the Charterhouse in 1723.
