SCRANTON, a city of the United States, capital of Lackawanna county, Pennsylvania, on a plateau at the junction of the Roaring Brook and the Lackawanna river, 162 miles north of Philadelphia. It is the centre of the great coal-mining district in the country and the seat of a large number of iron and steel works, rolling-mills, blastfurnaces, &c., and extensive factories for the production of[9:21:552] rails, locomotives, mining machinery, steam-boilers, stoves, carriages, edge-tools, &c. A public library, a theatre, an academy of music, a hospital, a public hall, a driving park, a Roman Catholic cathedral, a home for the friendless, and a museum of Indian stone relics are among the more prominent features of the place. The population was 9223 in 1860, 35,092 in 1870, and 45,850 in 1880.

Slocum Farm, as the site was called subsequent to 1798, saw its first blast-furnace erected in 1840 by George and Selden Scranton, who soon added a rolling-mill and the manufacture of rails. The opening of the railway in 1856 gave a great stimulus to the new town (1854), which obtained a city charter in 1866. It is divided into twenty-one wards, of which the 4th, 5th, 6th, 14th, 15th, and 18th are known as Hyde Fark, the 1st, 2d, and 3d as Providence.
