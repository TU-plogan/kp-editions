SAN LUCAR DE BARRAMEDA, a town of Spain, in the province of Cadiz, and 27 miles by sea from that city, in a bare, sandy, and undulating country, on the left bank of the Guadalquivir, not far from its mouth. It stands partly on the flat bank of the river and partly on the rising ground behind, the summit of which is crowned by an old Moorish castle. There is an old parish church dating from the 14th century. The other buildings have no special interest, and the place as a whole is dull and lifeless, having lost much of the commercial importance it formerly possessed. It is now chiefly dependent on the trade in its wines, which is still considerable. Many of the inhabitants are employed in agriculture and fishing. The population within the municipal boundaries was 21,918 in 1877.
