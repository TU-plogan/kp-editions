SHARP, William (1749-1824), an eminent line-engraver, was born at London on the 29th of January 1749. He was originally apprenticed to what is called a bright engraver, and practised as a writing engraver, but, gradually becoming inspired by the higher branches of the engraver’s art, he exercised his gifts with surprising success on works of the old masters. Among his earlier plates are some illustrations, after Stothard, for the Novelists’ [9:21:781] Magazine. He engraved the Doctors Disputing on the Immaculateness of the Virgin and the Ecce Homo of Guido Reni, the St Cecilia of Domenichino, the Virgin and Child of Dolci, and the portrait of John Hunter of Sir Joshua Reynolds. His style of engraving is thoroughly masterly and original, excellent in its play of line and rendering of half-tints and of “colour.” He died at Chiswick on the 25th July 1824. In his youth Sharp was a violent republican, and, owing to his hotly expressed adherence to the politics of Paine and Horne Tooke, he was examined by the privy council on a charge of treason. He was also one of the greatest visionaries in matters pertaining to religion. No imposture was too gross for him to accept, no deception too glaring for his eyes to admire. The dreams of Mesmer and the rhapsodies of Brothers found in Sharp a staunch believer; and for long he maintained Joanna Southcott at his own expense. As an engraver he achieved a European reputation, and at the time of his death he enjoyed the honour of being a member of the Imperial Academy of Vienna and of the Royal Academy of Munich.
