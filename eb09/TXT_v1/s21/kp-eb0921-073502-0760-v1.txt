SHÁHJAHÁNPUR, the easternmost district of the Rohilkhand division in the lieutenant-governorship of the North-Western Provinces of British India, lying between 27° 36' and 28° 29' N. lat. and between 79° 23' and 80° 26' E. long. It has an area of 1746 square miles, and is bounded on the N. and N.W. by Pilibhit, on the E. by Hardoi and Kheri, on the S. by the Ganges, separating it from Farukhabad, and on the W. by Budaun and Bareilly. The district consists of a long and narrow tract running up from the Ganges towards the Himalayas, and is for the most part level and without any hills or considerable undulations. The principal rivers are the Gumti, Khanaut, Garái, and Rámganga. The last-named is the main waterway of the district, and is navigable as far as Kola Ghat near Jalálábád, whence grain is shipped for the Ganges ports. To the north-east beyond Gumti the country resembles the tarai in the preponderance of waste and forest over cultivated land, in the sparseness of population, and in general unhealthiness. Between the Gumti and the Khanaut the country varies from a rather wild and unhealthy northern region to a densely inhabited tract in the south, with a productive soil well cultivated with sugar-cane and other remunerative crops. The section between the Deoha and Garái comprises much marshy land; but south of the Garái, and between it and the Rámganga, the soil is mostly of a sandy nature. From Rámganga to the Ganges in the south is a continuous low country of marshy patches alternating with a hard clayey soil requiring much irrigation in parts. Sháh-jahânpur contains a number of jhils or lakes, which afford irrigation for the spring crops in their neighbourhood. The Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway traverses the district a distance of 39 miles. The climate of the district is very similar to that of most parts of Oudh and Rohilkhand, but moister than that of the Doab. Except in May and June, the country has a fresh and green appearance. Its average annual rainfall is about 38 inches.

In 1881 the population of Sháhjahánpur numbered 856,946 (males 460,064, females 396,882), of whom 735,244 were Hindus and 120,214 were Mohammedans. The district contains only two towns with a population exceeding 10,000, viz., Sháhjahánpur (q.v .) and Tilhar (15,351). Of the total area of 1746 square miles 1090 were under cultivation in 1883-84, and 464 were returned as cultivable. The chief agricultural products are wheat and gram in spring, and in the autumn sugar-cane, rice, joar, and bajra, and several kinds of pulses. Exports are chiefly sugar, grain of all kinds, pulses, indigo, cotton, and timber, and the imports are mainly European goods, metals, and salt. The gross revenue raised in the district in 1883-84 amounted to £186,162, of which the land contributed £118,638. The only manufactures of any importance under European supervision are those of sugar and rum and of indigo. Sháhjahánpur was ceded to the English by treaty in 1801. During the mutiny of 1857 it became the scene of open rebellion. The Europeans were attacked when in church; three were shot down, but the remainder, aided by a hundred faithful sepoys, escaped. The force under Lord Clyde put a stop to the anarchy in April 1858, and shortly afterwards peace and authority were restored.
