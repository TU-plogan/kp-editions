SEVEN SLEEPERS OF EPHESUS, The, according to the most common form of an old legend of Syrian origin, first referred to in Western literature by Gregory of Tours (De Glor. Mart., c. 95), were seven Christian youths of Ephesus, who, to escape the rage of Decius, lived for some time in concealment in a cave. The enemy at last, however, discovered their hiding place, and caused great stones to be rolled to its mouth that they might die of hunger. The martyrs fell asleep in a mutual embrace. The occurrence had long been forgotten, when it fell out, in the thirtieth year of Theodosius II., 196 years afterwards, that a certain inhabitant of Ephesus, seeking shelter for his cattle, rediscovered the cave on Mount Coelian, and, letting in the light, awoke the inmates, who sent one of their number down to buy food. Cautiously approaching the city, the lad was greatly astonished to find the cross displayed over the gates, and on entering to hear the name of Christ openly pronounced. By tendering coin of the time of Decius at a baker’s shop he roused suspicion, and in his confusion being unable to explain how he had come by the money he was taken before the authorities as a dishonest finder of hidden treasure. He was easily able to confirm the strange story he now had to tell by actually leading his accusers to the cavern where his six companions were found, youthful and rosy and beaming with a holy radiance. Theodosius, hearing what had happened, hastened to the spot in time to hear from their lips that God had wrought this wonder to confirm his faith in the resurrection of the dead. This message once delivered, they again fell asleep.[9:21:698] Gregory says he had the legend from the interpretation of “a certain Syrian”; in point of fact the story is very common in Syriac sources. It forms the subject of a homily of Jacob of Sarug (ob. 521 A.D.), which is given in the Acta Sanctorum. Another Syriac version is printed in Land’s Anecdota, iii. 87 sq. ; see also Barhebraeus, Chrom Eccles., i 142 sq., and compare Assemani, Bib. Or., i. 335 sq. Some forms of the legend give, eight sleepers,— e.g., an ancient MS. of the 6th century now in the British Museum (Cat. Syr. MSS., p. 1090). There are considerable variations as to their names. The legend rapidly attained a wide diffusion throughout Christendom; its currency in the East is testified by its acceptance by Mohammed (sur. xviii.), who calls them Ashāb al-Kalif, “the men of the cave.” According to Al-Binúní (Chronology, tr. by Sachau, p. 285) certain undecayed corpses of monks were shown in a cave as the sleepers of Ephesus in the 9th century. The seven sleepers are a favourite subject in early mediaeval art.
