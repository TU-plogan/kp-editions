SCHEMNITZ (Hung. Selmeczbánya), a mining town in the Cis-Danubian county of Hont, Hungary, lies about 65 miles north from Budapest, in 48° 27' N. lat., 18° 52' E. long., on an elevated site, 2300 feet above the level of the sea. Its institutions include a Roman Catholic and a Protestant gymnasium, a high school for girls, a court of justice, a hospital, and several benevolent and scientific societies. Schemnitz owes its chief importance to the fact of its being the mining centre of the kingdom. Connected with this local industry are important Government institutions, such as various mining superintendencies, a chemical analytical laboratory, and an excellent academy of mining and forestry (with a meteorological observatory and a remarkable collection of minerals), attended by pupils from all countries of Europe and also from America. The mines are chiefly the property of the state and the corporation; the average yield annually is— gold, 232 lb; silver, 45,000 lb; lead, 11,600 cwt.; copper, 180 cwt. Iron, arsenic, &c., to the value of about £150,000 are also produced. There are also flourishing potteries where well-known tobacco pipes are manufactured. With Schemnitz is conjoined the town of Bélabánya; their united population in 1884 was 15,265, chiefly Slovaks, of whom nearly 3000 were engaged in mining.

Schemnitz, which was already noted for its mines in the time of the Romans, has played considerable part in the history of Hungary. The archives of the town contain many interesting documents. After the Tartar invasion in the 12th century it was colonized by Germans, but had become quite Slavonized before the academy of mining was founded by Maria Theresa (1760). The school of forestry was added in 1809. The corporation is wealthy, having received special commercial privileges from the crown in consideration of pecuniary aid afforded in times of emergency.
