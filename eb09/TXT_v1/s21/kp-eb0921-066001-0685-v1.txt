SENEGAL, a river of western Africa, which falls into the Atlantic about 16° N. lat., 9 or 10 miles below St Louis. It is formed at Bafulabé^[1. Bafulabé is a native word for “confluence.”] (13° 50' N. lat. and 10° 50' W. long.) by the junction of the Ba-fing or Black River and the Ba-khoy or White River. The Ba-fing, which has a width at the confluence of 1475 feet, descends from the highlands of Futa-Jallon by a northward course of about 350 miles, during which it passes by a series of rapids from the altitude of 2460 feet, at which it takes its rise, to that of 360 feet, and receives from the right the Nunkolo and the Funkumah (with its tributary the Boki). The Ba-khoy, 800 feet wide at the confluence, has been previously flowing from east to west and gives that general direction to the Senegal, but its source is away in the south-east behind the country of Buré. That of its principal tributary, the Ba-ule (Red River), is more to the east and lies within a few miles of the course of the Niger in the Mandingo plateau. Below Bafulabé the Senegal, flowing north-west, passes a succession of falls—those of Guina (160 feet) and of Felu (50 or 60)—and arrives at Médine, after having accomplished 440 of its total course of 1000 miles. It receives only two important affluents,—from the right the “marigot” of Kulu, which comes from Kuniakhary, draining the slopes of the Kaarta plateau, and from the left the Falemé, which rises in the Futa-Jallon between Labé and Timbo and flows north-west in a permanent stream. Below Médine the Senegal presents a series of great reaches, which become more and more navigable as they approach the sea.

From the 1st of August to the 1st of October it is open as far as Médine to vessels not drawing more than 8 feet. Between Médine and Bakel (85 miles) there are twenty-seven “narrows,” of which several, such as that at Kayes, are difficult; it is on this account that a railway has been projected between Kayes and the Niger. At Bakel below the confluence of the Falemé the river is navigable till the 1st of December, from Bakel to Saldé between the 15th of July and the 15th of December, and lastly from Mafu to the sea for a distance of 215 miles it is navigable all the year round. Outside the limits indicated navigation between Mafu and Médine is often precarious even for barges drawing little over a foot, and above Médine, though some reaches are deep enough, troublesome transhipments are necessary between reach and reach. Between Mafu and Saldé the Senegal changes its direction from north-west to west, and shortly before reaching the sea to south-west. The bar at the mouth can usually be crossed by vessels not drawing more than 10 feet, or at high tides a little more. Below Bakel the river becomes tortuous and encloses the great island of Morfil, 110 miles long, and a series of other islands, of which one is occupied by St Louis. At this point the right branch of the river is only 500 feet from the sea, but the dunes along the coast turn it south for other 9 miles. The scantiness of its sources, the steepness of its upper course, and the rapid evaporation which takes place after the short rainy season would soon dry up the river-system of the Senegal, especially in the upper regions; but natural dams cross the channel at intervals and the water accumulates behind them in deep reaches, which thus act as reservoirs. In the rainy season the barriers are submerged in succession, beginning with the farthest up, the reaches are filled, and the plains of the lower Senegal are changed into immense marshes. Like Lake Moeris in antiquity on the Nile and the lake of Cambodia at the present time on the Me-kong, Lake Cayor on the right side of the lower Senegal and Lake Panieful on the left constitute reserve basins, receiving the surplus waters of the river during flood and restoring them in the dry season. For months together the latter forms the only drinking pond for the wild beasts of the surrounding country,—lions, elephants, leopards, panthers, ounces, cheetahs, hyaenas, lynxes, giraffes, antelopes, gazelles, monkeys, jackals visiting it in crowds. In the upper part of the river the reservoirs are successively emptied to the level of the dams and receive no more water except from the permanent springs; but they are partially protected by curtains of verdure from the effects of the evaporation which makes itself so severely felt on the treeless seaboard. Owing to these natural “locks,” similar to those of an artificial canal, the Senegal river never discharges less than 1700 or 1800 cubic feet per second. The lower Senegal forms the boundary between the dry and barren Sahara and the rich and productive region of the western Sudan; the line of its inundations is an ethnographic march between the nomadic Moor and the settled Negro.
