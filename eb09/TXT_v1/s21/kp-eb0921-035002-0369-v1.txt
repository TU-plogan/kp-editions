SAXO GRAMMATICUS, the celebrated Danish historian and poet, belonged to a family of warriors, his father and grandfather having served under king Valdemar I. (d. 1182). He himself was brought up for the clerical profession, entered about 1180 the service of Archbishop Absalon as one of his secretaries, and remained with him in that capacity until the death of Absalon in 1201. At the instigation of the latter he began, about 1185, to write the history of the Danish Christian kings from the time of Sven Estridsön, but later Absalon prevailed on him to write also the history of the earlier, heathen times, and to combine both into a great work, Gesta Danorum. The archbishop died before the work was finished, and therefore the preface, written about 1208, is dedicated to his successor Archbishop Andreas, and to King Valdemar II. Nothing else is known about Saxo’s life and person; a chronicle of 1265 calls him “mine et urbanae eloquentiai clericus;" and an epitome of his work from about 1340 describes him as “egregius grammaticus, origine Sialandus that he was a native of Zealand is probably correct, inasmuch as, whereas he often criticizes the Jutlanders and the Scanians, he frequently praises the Zealanders. The surname of “Grammaticus” is probably of later origin, scarcely earlier than 1500, apparently owing to a mistake. The title of “provost (dean) of Roskilde,” given him in the 16th century, is also probably incorrect, the historian being confounded with an older contemporary, the provost of the same name. Saxo, from his apprenticeship as the archbishop’s secretary, had acquired a brilliant but somewhat euphuistic Latin style, and wrote fine Latin verses, but otherwise does not seem to have had any very great learning or extensive reading. His models of style were Valerius Maximus, Justin, and Martianus Capella, especially the last. Occasionally he mentions Bede, Dudo, and Paulus Diaconus, but does not seem to have studied them or any other historical works thoroughly, and he neither understands nor is interested in scientific research, in general history, or even in chronology. He wrote because he[9:21:351] did not like his countrymen to be behind other nations through the want of an historian, and because he washed to perpetuate the record of the exploits of the Danes. His sources are partly Danish traditions and old songs, partly the statements of Archbishop Absalon, partly the accounts of Icelanders, and, lastly, some few earlier, but scanty, sources, being lists of Danish kings and short chronicles, which furnished him with some reliable chronological dates. He considered traditions as history, and therefore made it his chief business to recount and arrange these, by the help of the lists of the kings, into a connected whole. His work, therefore, is a loosely connected series of biographies of Danish kings and heroes; he dwells with predilection on those periods during which Danish kings were said to have made great conquests, and he represents these conquerors as the paragons of their times.

The first nine books comprise “Antiquity,” that is, traditions of kings and heroes of the half-mythical time up to about 950. Here we have traditions about Fredfrode, about Amleth (Hamlet) and Fenge, about Rolf Krake, Hadding, the giant Starkather, Harald Hildetann, and Ragnar Lodbrok. In this earlier history Saxo has also embodied myths of national gods who in tradition had become Danish kings, for instance, Balder and Hother, and of foreign heroes, likewise incorporated in Danish history, as the Gothic Jarmunrik (A. S. Eormenríc), the Anglian Vermund (A. S. Garmund) and Uffe (A. S. Offa), the German Hedin and Hild, &c. Frequently the narrative is interrupted by translations of poems, which Saxo has used as authentic sources, although they are often only a few generations older than himself. In the later books (x.-xvi.) of his work he follows to a greater extent historical accounts, and the more he approaches his own time the fuller and the more trustworthy his relation becomes; especially brilliant is his treatment of the history of King Valdemar and of Absalon. But his patriotism often makes him partial to his countrymen, and his want of critical sense often blinds him to the historical truth.

Saxo’s work was widely read during the Middle Ages, and several extracts of it were made for smaller chronicles. It was published for the first time, from a MS. afterwards lost, in Paris, 1514, by the Danish humanist Christiern Pedersen; this edition was reprinted at Basel, 1534, and at Frankfort, 1576. Of later editions may be mentioned that of Stephen Stephanius, Sorö, 1644, that of C. A. Klotz, Leipsic, 1771, and that of P. E. Müller and J. M. Velschow, Copenhagen, 1839. No complete MS. any longer exists; yet of late small fragments have been found of three MSS. The most remarkable of these is the fragment found at Angers, in France, written shortly after 1200, perhaps by Saxo himself or under his superintendence; here several corrections are found above the lines, showing how the author varied and polished his Latin style.
