SERPUKHOFF, a district town of Russia, in the government of Moscow, 61 miles south of the city of Moscow, with which it is connected by rail. Built on high cliffs on both banks of the river Nara, 3 miles above its junction with the Oka, Serpukhoff has of late become an important manufacturing and commercial town. The aggregate production of its manufactories (cotton and woollen stuffs, paper, leather), which employ about 4000 hands, in 1880 was valued at about £300,000. The surrounding district has several large cotton and woollen factories, with a yearly output worth about £1,000,000. Petty trades are also much developed in the neighbourhood,—textile fabrics, furniture, and earthenware and porcelain being produced by the peasantry. The manufactured goods of Serpukhoff are sent—mostly by rail—to the fairs of Nijni-Novgorod and the Ukraine, while large amounts of grain, hemp, and timber, brought from the east on the Oka, are discharged at Serpukhoff’ and sent on to Moscow and St Petersburg. The goods traffic by rail and river showed in 1880 an aggregate of 5,400,000 cwts. (exclusive of timber floated down the Oka). Notwithstanding its recent prosperity and the sums bequeathed to the municipality by wealthy merchants, Serpukhoff improves but slowly. The cathedral (1380) was rebuilt in the 18th century; of[9:21:684] the old fortress, situated on a promontory formed by a bend of the Nara, a few heaps of stones are the only remains. The population in 1884 was 22,420.

Serpukhoff is one of the oldest towns of the principality of Moscow; it is mentioned in the will of Ivan Daislovich (1328), at which time it was a nearly independent principality under the protectorate of Moscow. Its fortress, protecting Moscow on the south, was often attacked by the Tatars; Toktamish plundered it in 1382, and the Lithuanian prince Svidrigaito in 1410. In 1556 the town was strongly fortified, so that fifteen years later it was able to resist the Mongol invasion. Its commercial importance dates from the 18th century.
