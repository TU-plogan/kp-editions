SENEGAL,^[1. For the physical geography, &c., see Senegambia.] a French colony of western Africa, composed of lines of fortified posts and a loose agglomeration of states and territories in various degrees of subjugation. The forts extend (a ) from St Louis at the mouth of the Senegal to Bammako on the Niger,^[2. Along this line lie Richard Toll, Dagana (founded in 1821), Podor (1743 and 1854), Saldé (1859), Matam (1857), Bakel (1820), Kayes, Médine (1855), and Bafulabé (1879) on the Senegal, and between this river and the Niger the forts of Badumbé and Tukota on the Ba-khoy, Kita (1881), Kondu (1882), Niagassola (1884-85), and lastly Bammako (1883) or Bammaku, on the Niger.] (b ) along the coast of the Atlantic between St Louis and the mouth of the Salum to the south of Cape Verd, and (c ) along the so-called rivers of the south which fall into the ocean between the Gambia and Sierra Leone (q.v.). French influence is fully dominant along those lines either in the form of actual territorial possession or of a recognized protectorate.^[3. Arrondissement I.—On the circle of Bakel depend the post of Matam, the protected countries of Damga (1859), Guoy, Kamera, Guidimakha, Bondu, and Bambnk; on the circle of Médine, Khasso, Logo, and Natiaga; on the circle of Bafulabé, Barinta, Makadugu, Beteadugu, Farimbula, Bating; on the circle of Kita, the province of Kita and Fuladugu; on the circle of Bammako, Birgo and Little Beledugu. This arrondissement is under the command of a superior officer resident at Kayes. Arrondissements II, III.—These are formed by Lao and Toro (1863), protected countries attached to the circle of Saldé·, the circle of Podor, which comprises the French portion of Toro and a fragment of Dimar; the circle of Dagana, on which depend the other portion of Dimar and a portion of Walo; the suburban district of St Louis, including the other portion of Walo, Ross, Merinaghen, the cantons of Gandiole, M’pal, Khattet, Gondu, Diala-khar, N’diago, and Tubé; N'diambor and Merina N'guick, separated from Cayor and placed under French protection, as well as the kingdoms of Cayor and Baol; the suburb of Dakar with the island of Gorée, the cantons of Rufisque and the circles of M'bijem, Thia, Portudal, and Joal. Arrondissement IV.—The Rivers of the South district constitutes the fourth arrondissement under a lieutenant-governor, and comprises the circle of Kadlack or Salum ; those of Carabane and Sedhiu on the Cazamance, with the protected countries of Pakao, Balmadu, Suna, Yacine, Firdu; the circle of Rio Nuñez formed by the Nalus and Landuman tribes; the circle of the Rio Pongo with the country of the Susus; the circle of Mellacorée with the protected countries of Samo, Kaback, Kabita, Kalum, Tabussu, Maneah, Correra, and the island of Tombo.]

The colony is ruled by a governor, sends a deputy to the French legislature, and elects a general council of sixteen members, ten for the electoral district of St Louis, four for that of Gorée-Dakar, and two for that of Rufisque. The three communes just named have each its municipal council. The population of those French possessions was in 1884 197,644,—46,364 urban, 143,200 rural, 8080 “floating.” In the whole number there were only 1474 Europeans, of whom 1461 were French. The population of the protected countries cannot be ascertained. The most important places in the colony are St Louis (18,924 inhabitants in 1883), Dagana (5375), Rufisque (4244), Médine (3000), Joal (2372), Corée and Dakar (each 2000). The colony has only a single true port, that of Dakar to the east of the peninsula of Cape Verd, since 1885 connected with St Louis by a railroad, 163 miles long, and visited by Atlantic steamers on their way from France to South America. Rufisque and Gorée have open roadsteads, where vessels anchor at some distance from the shore. The port of St Louis in the Senegal is difficult of access owing to the bar, but it is the only place where vessels can repair serious damages. The principal commercial centres are St Louis (imports and exports), Gorée (exports), and Rufisque (exports). The upper Senegal sends ground-nuts (known as Galam nuts), gum, millet, leather, and receives in exchange blue calico (guinée) from India, England, and Belgium, various other cotton stuffs, cotton yarn, guns and ammunition, tobacco, crushed rice, sugar (raw and refined), molasses, biscuits, tinsmiths’ wares, &c. The colony also imports Swedish iron, which is manufactured by the native blacksmiths into agricultural implements, knives, daggers, and spearheads. Cayor sells its ground-nuts for money. The rivers of the south district export ground-nuts, palm kernels, india-rubber, leather, coffee, in return for English and Belgian blue calico, Hamburg brandy, English gunpowder, English and Belgian guns, and American tobacco. An English firm has twenty-three factories on the Rio Nunez, and others on the Rio Pongo and the Mellacorée. The total value of the exports and imports of the colony was £1,325,711 in 1879, £1,774,089 in 1880, and £1,888,657 in 1883, the imports slightly preponderating over· the exports. The value of the ground-nuts exported in 1883 was £700,000, that of the gums only £120,000; and the ground-nut trade is still rapidly developing. The imports comprise French[9:21:661] goods £360,000, goods passing as French £200,000, foreign goods £440,000, of which £240,000 represent English, £200,000 Belgian, £120,000 German, £80,000 American articles. In 1882 946 vessels entered and 960 cleared. The budget for the colony in 1884 was £100,320, for the communal expenses £14,560, and for the expenses of the capital £250,000.

History.— The navigators of Dieppe are said to have discovered the Senegal about 1360. The Portuguese had some establishments on its banks in the 15th century; and the first French settlements were probably formed in the latter part of the 16th or beginning of the 17th century. Between 1664, when these French settlements were assigned to Colbert’s West India Company, and 1758, when the colony was seized by the English, Senegal had passed under the administration of no fewer than seven different companies, none of which attained any great success, though from 1694 to 1724 affairs were conducted by a really able governor, André Brue. In 1677 the French captured from the Dutch Rufisque, Portudal, Joal, and Corée, and they were confirmed in possession of these places by the treaty of Nimeguen (1678). In 1717 they acquired Portendic and in 1724 Arguin on the coast of the Sahara, which still belong to the colony. Gorée and the district of Cape Verd were surrendered by the English to the French in 1763, and by the treaty of peace in 1783 the whole of the Senegal was also restored; but the English again captured the colony in the wars of the first empire (Gorée 1800, St Louis 1809), and, though the treaty of Paris authorized a complete restitution, the French authorities did not enter into possession till 1817. Between that date and 1854 little was effected by the thirty-seven governors who succeeded each other at St Louis; but in this year the appointment of General Faidherbe proved the turning-point in the history of Senegal. He at once set about subduing the Moorish (Berber) tribes of the Trarzas, Braknas, and Duaish, whose “kings,” especially the king of the Trarzas, had subjected the French settlers and traders to the most grievous and arbitrary exactions; and he bound them by treaty to confine their authority to the north bank of the Senegal. In 1855 he annexed the country of Walo and erected the fort of Médine in the country of Khasso. This last was a bold stroke for the purpose of stemming the advancing tide of Moslem invasion, which under Omar al-Hadji (Alegui) threatened the safety of the colony. In 1857 Médine was brilliantly defended by the mulatto Paul Holle against Omar, who with his army of 20,000 men had to retire before the advance of General Faidherbe and turn his attention to the conquest of the native states of the Sudan. By treaty of 1860 Omar recognized the French claim to half of Bambuk, half of Khasso, Bondu, Kamera, Guoy, Guidimakha, Damga, Futa-Toro, Dimar, &c. Since then annexations and protectorates have followed in rapid succession under the governorships of Jauréguiberry, Faidherbe, and Brière de l'Isle. It is sufficient to mention the treaties of 1881 and 1885 by which the confederation of Futa-Jallon and Buré respectively recognized a French protectorate.
