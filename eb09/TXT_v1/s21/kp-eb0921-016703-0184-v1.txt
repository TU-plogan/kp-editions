ST ÉTIENNE, an industrial and manufacturing town of France, chef-lieu of the department of Loire, 312 miles south-south-east of Paris and 36 miles south-south-west of Lyons by rail, with a branch line to Le Puy. The coal-field of St Étienne is the richest in France after that of Valenciennes and Pas de Calais, giving employment to 12,000 miners and 5000 workmen at the pit-heads. There are 64 concessions worked by 28 companies, extending over an area 20 miles long by 5 in width; the mineral is of two kinds,—smelting coal (said to be the best in France) and gas coal; the yearly output is between 3,000,000 and 4,000,000 tons, but with a tendency to decrease. In the metallurgic establishments of the arrondissement, which extend all the way along the railway from Firminy to Rive-de-Gier, 5540 workmen are employed, and in 1882 61,127 tons of cast metal, 58,445 tons of iron, 10,815 tons of sheet-iron, and 131,563 tons of steel of all kinds were manu factured. The last-

named industry, carried on accord ing to the Besse mer and Martin processes, yields nearly a third of the whole French production of steel.

Military and naval material, railway plant, and articles of general mer chandise are all madeat St Étienne, and its name is especially associ ated with large castings, bomb proof plates, ship-

armour, masts, and pieces of machin ery. The national gun-factory, under the direction of artillery officers and employing 4300 workmen, is almost exclusively devoted to the production of rifles and revolvers for the army. A certain number of gun-makers not engaged in the factory turn out from 80,000 to 90,000 firearms (hunting-pieces, revolvers, &c.) per annum. Hardware is manufactured by 60 firms, employing 7000 workmen (who are not, however, exclusively occupied with this department); leading articles are locks (known as Forez locks), common cutlery, files, nails, bolts, anvils, vices. Hemp cables for mines,[9:21:168] hats, pottery, and lime are among the miscellaneous manufactured products of the town, which is besides a great centre of the ribbon trade, with a testing-house (condition) for examining the silk. From 500 to 600 tons of silk, valued at £1,200,000 to £1,400,000, are used per annum, and the manufactured articles reach a value ranging from £2,800,000 to £3,200,000. The ribbons, laces, trimmings (in silk, cotton, and india-rubber) produced in the arrondissement of St Étienne are valued at £4,000,000, and form four-fifths of the total French production. With the exception of a few factories where machinery is employed, the whole manufacture is carried on by persons with small means. About 5000 looms (Jacquard’s permitting thirty-six pieces to be woven at once) and 40,000 workmen are employed. Besides the old abbey church of Valbenoîte (outside of the town) with its nave dating from the 13th century, the public buildings comprise a Protestant church, a synagogue, a town-house (finished under the second empire and decorated with statues of the ribbon trade and metallurgy), a school of mines (1816), with a mineralogical and geological collection, and a “palace of the arts,” with a museum and library rich in old MSS. and collections in connexion with artillery and natural history. Near Valbenoîte in the wooded gorge of the Furens is the reservoir of Gouffre d’Enfer, formed by a dam (1861-1866) 328 feet long, 131 high, and 131 wide at the base, and capable of storing about 70,000,000 cubic feet of water. The population of the town was 28,000 in 1764; by 1876 it was 126,019, but it had decreased to 114,962 (123,813 in the commune) in 1881.

At the close of the 12th century St Etienne was only a parish of the Pays de Gier belonging to the abbey of Valbenoîte. By the middle of the 14th century the coal trade had reached a certain development, and by the close of the century the town was surrounded with walls and had consuls. A hundred years later it had three growing suburbs. The Wars of Religion stimulated the manufacture of arms, and about the same period the ribbon trade sprang into existence. It was not till the 18th century, however, that the town entered on its era of prosperity. The royal manufactory of arms was established in 1764. In 1789 they were producing at the rate of 12,000 muskets per annum; between September 1794 and May 1796 they delivered 170,858; and 100,000 was the annual average throughout the whole period of the empire. The first railways opened in France were the line between St Étienne and Andrezieu on the Loire in 1828 and that between St Etienne and Lyons in 1831. In 1856 St Étienne became the administrative centre of the department instead of Montbrison. Among the local celebrities are Francis Garnier, who conquered Tongking in 1873, and several engravers who have given eminence to the St Étienne school of engraving.
