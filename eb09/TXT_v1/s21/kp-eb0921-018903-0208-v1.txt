ST PAUL’S ROCKS, not to be confounded with the island of St Paul in the Indian Ocean, are a number of small islands in the Atlantic, nearly 1° north of the equator and[9:21:190] 540 miles from South America, in 29° 15' W. long. Their outline is irregular, and as they are only separated by narrow but deep chasms they have the appearance of being one island. The whole space occupied does not exceed 1400 feet in length by about half as much in breadth. Besides sea-fowl—two species of noddy (Anous stolidus and Anous melanogenys) and a booby or gannet (Sula leucogaster)— the only terrestrial inhabitants are insects and spiders. Fish are abundant, seven species (one, Holocentrum, sancti pauli, peculiar to the locality) being collected by the “Challenger” during a brief stay. Darwin (On Volcanic Islands, p. 32) decided that St Paul’s Rocks were not of volcanic origin; more modern investigators—Renard, A. Geikie, and Wadsworth—maintain that they probably are eruptive. See Reports of the Voyage of H.M.S. Challenger: Narrative of the Cruise, vol. i.
