ST BARTHOLOMEW, or St Barthélemy, a French island of the West Indies, in the archipelago of the Antilles, is situated in 17° 55' 35" N. lat. and 63° 60' 15" W. long., 108 miles north-north-west of Guadaloupe, of which, politically, it is a dependency. In form it is very irregular and the surface is mountainous. The soil, in spite of a scarcity of moisture, is not unfertile; and in some of the valleys the growing of vegetables is an important industry. Bananas, cassia, tamarinds, and sassafras are exported. In modern times zinc and lead ores have been found in the island, but they are not worked. Rocks and shallows make St Bartholomew difficult of access, and its port (Le Carénage), though safe during the greater part of the year, is capable of receiving only the larger class of coasting vessels. The chief town is Gustavia, near the port. The population was 2942 in 1883.

St Bartholomew, occupied by the French in 1648, was ceded to Sweden in 1784; but it was restored to France by the treaty signed at Paris, August 1877, with the full approval of the inhabitants, who had remained French in language and manners. Universal suffrage was introduced in 1830 and slavery abolished in 1848.
