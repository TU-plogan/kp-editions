SHERLOCK, Thomas (1678-1761), bishop of London, the son of Dr William Sherlock, noticed below, was born at London in 1678. He was educated at Catherine Hall, Cambridge, and in 1704 succeeded his father as master of the Temple. He took a prominent part in the Bangorian controversy against Hoadly, whom he succeeded as bishop of Bangor in 1728; he was afterwards translated to Salisbury in 1734, and to London in 1738. He published against Collins’s Grounds and Reasons of the Christian Religion a volume of sermons entitled The Use and Intent of Prophecy in the Several Ages of the World (1725); and in reply to Woolston’s Discourses on the Miracles he wrote a volume entitled The Trial of the Witnesses of the Resurrection of Jesus (1729), which in a very short time ran through fourteen editions. His Pastoral Letter (1750) on “the late earthquakes” had a circulation of many thousands, and four volumes of Sermons which he published in his later years (1754-58) were also at one time highly esteemed. He died in 1761. A collected edition of his works in 5 vols. 8 vo, by Hughes, appeared in 1830.[9:21:802]
