SANAA (San'á), the capital of Yemen in Arabia, and seat of the Turkish governor of that province, is situated in 15° 22' N. lat. and 44° 31' E. long., in a well-watered upland valley, 4000 feet above the sea and six to nine miles broad, running north and south between two tablelands. The western table-land, over which lies the road to the port of Hodaida on the Red Sea, rises 1200 feet above the town, the eastern (J. Noḳom) is some 300 feet higher, and crowned by the ruins of the fortress Birásh, which local tradition connects with the name of Shem, son of Noah, to whom the foundation of the city is attributed by Hamdání, Jazírat, p. 55. Under Mount Noḳom in the valley is the hill Ghomdán with the citadel, which Halévy in 1870 found in ruins. The ancient fortress of Ghomdán, which is often referred to by poets, and is described in extravagant terms by later writers, is said to have been destroyed by the caliph 'Othmán. The city proper, which is walled, extends from the citadel on the east to the garden and ruined palace of the imám Motawakkil on the west. Beyond this is the quarter known as Bîr al-'Azab, where the imáms had their pleasure gardens, adjoining which, to the south, is the ancient Jewish settlement (Ḳá' al-Yáhúd). In Niebuhr’s time (1763) the two last were open suburbs, but they have since been walled in. Though Sanaa is a very old town, the earliest buildings now standing are perhaps those which date from the Turkish occupation (1570-1630)—some mosques, parts of the fortifications, the aqueduct. In last century, under the independent imáms of Yemen, as the capital of the coffee country and the most fertile region of Arabia, it was, with its palaces and gardens, its mosques, caravanserais, and good private houses, by much the first city of the peninsula. The Wahhabi movement and Turko-Egyptian intervention in the affairs of Yemen shook the power of[9:21:254] the imáms and diminished the prosperity of their capital, but Cruttenden in 1836 still estimated the population at 40,000, or, with the three neighbouring towns of Rauda, Jiráf, and Wady Dahr, at not less than 70,000. In 1870, when the imamate had been extinct for twenty years, and the town was governed by an elected sheikh and had lost its provinces, Halévy found it much decayed, with many of the palaces and public buildings demolished or used as quarries, but still presenting a comely aspect, with good streets, houses, and mosques. In 1872, having been hard pressed by the Bedouins for several years, Sanaa opened its gates to the Turks, who were then engaged in the reconquest of Yemen. In the following year Millingen estimated the population at only 20,000.

The climate is good, though the extreme dryness of the air is trying. Rain usually falls in January and June, and more copiously in the end of July; the markets are well supplied with grain and fruit; vineyards were formerly numerous, but were largely given up after an attack of vine disease some thirty years ago.

Arabic writers give many discordant and fabulous traditions about the oldest history of Sanaa and its connexion with the ancient kingdom of Himyar. But most agree that its oldest name was Azál, which seems to be the same word with Uzal in Gen. x. 27. A Himyarite nation of Auzalites occurs in a Syriac writer of the 6th century. The better-informed Arab writers knew also that the later name is due to the Abyssinian conquerors of Yemen, and that it meant in their language “fortified” (Bakrí, p. 606; Nöldeke, Gesch. d. Pers. u. Arab., p. 187). Sanaa became the capital of the Abyssinian Abraha (c . 530 a.d.) who built here the famous church (Ḳalís), of whose splendour the Arabs give exaggerated pictures, and which was destroyed two centuries later by order of the caliph Mansur (Azraḳí, p. 91).
