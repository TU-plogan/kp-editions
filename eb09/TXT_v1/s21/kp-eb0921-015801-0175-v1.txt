ST ASAPH, a city and parliamentary borough of North Wales, in the county of Flint, is situated on an eminence in the Vale of Clwyd, near the junction of the Clwyd and Elwy, about 6 miles south-south-east of Rhyl and 6 north-north-west of Denbigh. It is somewhat irregularly built and has an antique appearance. On the brow of the hill is an encampment, Bron-y-Wylva, supposed to have been occupied by the Roman forces under Suetonius Paulinus. According to tradition the cathedral occupies the site of a church and monastery founded by St Kenti-

gern about 560, when he fled from Strathclyde. It was originally called Llan-Elwy, the church on the Elwy. It is uncertain whether the first bishop was Kentigern or Asaph, to whom Kentigern committed the charge of the church and monastery when he returned to Scotland. The ancient wooden structure was burnt down by the English in 1245; and again in 1278 the same fate befell the building. A third edifice was in great part destroyed during the wars of Owen Glendower in 1402. The greater part of the present building was constructed by Bishop Redman about 1480; the choir and chancel underwent restoration from the designs of Sir Gilbert Scott in 1867-68, and the nave in 1875, when a new roof was added. It is one of the smallest cathedrals in Britain, its total length being 182 feet, while the breadth across the transepts is 108 feet. It is a plain cruciform structure, chiefly Decorated, but with some Early English portions, with an embattled tower, 97 feet in height, rising from the intersection of the nave and the transept. In the south transept there is a library of nearly 2000 volumes, including some rare and valuable books. The bishop’s palace is a comparatively modern structure. The town has a grammarschool (1882), county court offices, the union workhouse, and almshouses. The population of the borough (area, 1155 acres) in 1881 was 1901 and of the parish 3177.
