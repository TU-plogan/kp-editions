TIVERTON, a borough of Devonshire, England, is finely situated in the midst of beautiful scenery at the confluence of the Lowman and the Exe, 14½ miles north of Exeter and 184 west-south-west of London. A branch line connects it with the Great Western, and the Exe Valley Railway with Exeter and Dulverton. The greater part of the town is on the left bank of the Exe; the four principal streets are wide and regular. Since 1262, when Amicia, countess of Devon, caused a stream of water to be directed from Norwood to Tiverton, a distance of 5 miles, every street has had a constantly flowing supply. At points now spanned by bridges there were formerly two fords, one over the Exe and the other over the Lowman; hence Twofordton and Twyfordton the former names of the town. There still remain the principal gateway and an octagonal turret of the ancient castle (now a private residence), built in 1106 by Richard de Riparus or Redvers, first earl of Devon, and the chief residence of the Redvers till the execution of Henry Courtenay, marquis of Exeter, in 1539. The most ancient part of the church of St Peter is the Norman doorway; the embattled western tower is 120 feet in height. For Blundell’s free grammar-school (1604) new buildings have recently been erected in the Tudor style. Among other educational establishments are the school of science and art, the blue coat charity school (1714; reestablished as a middle boys’ and middle girls’ school in 1876), and the Chilcott free school (1611). The other principal public buildings are the market-house (1830-31), the infirmary (1852), the town-hall (1864), and several almshouses. Tiverton was formerly famed for its woollen manufacture, introduced in the 14th century; its annual returns in 1612 were estimated at £300,000, about 8000 persons being employed in the industry. It is now chiefly noted for its lace manufacture, established by John Heathcoat, the inventor of the bobbin net frame. The population of the municipal borough (area, 17,491 acres) in 1871 was 10,024, and in 1881 it was 10,462.

The town existed in Saxon times. In the reign of Edward the Confessor it was held by vassals or servants, and in Domesday it is entered as terra regis. In 1200 it had a market and three annual fairs. After the introduction of the woollen trade in 1353 it rapidly increased, and Camden states that the trade had brought it “much gain and glory.” The town and castle were taken by Fairfax in 1645. Tiverton suffered from the plague in 1591 (when it had 5000 inhabitants), and from fire in 1598, 1612, and 1731. It was incorporated by James I. in 1615; but in 1732 its charter was forfeited, and a second was not bestowed till 1737. The borough was deprived of parliamentary representation in 1885.
