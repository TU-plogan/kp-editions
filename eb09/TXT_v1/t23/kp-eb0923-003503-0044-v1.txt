TALMUD signifies—(1) “study of and instruction in anything (whether by any one else or by oneself)” j^[1. Compare Mishnah, Peak, i. 1, D⅛ m□ ΠΊ1Π T)θS∏1 (“and the studying of the Law balances them all”); Abοth, iv. 13, T ’ ∏T ΊΠ Ιl⅛2 (“be circumspect as regards instruction”).] (2) “learning acquired”;^[2. See Perek Rabbi Meir, 6, ΠflD t >Π3 12 t 7 DUÖ «Si (“whose heart is not arrogant on account of his learning”); cf. T. B., Pesahirn, leaf 49α; Ι3D0 ΠlθSr)Ι (“his learning becomes forgotten by him”).] (3) “style, system”:^[3. See T. B., Synhedrin, leaf 24α, Sz∏ ⅛ ΠT)θS∏ (“the mode of study prevalent in Babylonia”); comp. T. B., Pesahirn, 346, 'K⅛2 i□k>πoι ∣i∏"∣on κjnκn '□nπ ehbo wm (“foolish Babylonians, who, because ye dwell in a land of darkness, say sayings that are obscure”), and T. B., Baba Mem a, leaf 85a; Rabbi Zera fasted a hundred fasts on going up to Palestine, so that he might forget the style of Babylonico-Talmudic study (ΠK⅛2 X")0J or ∏K⅛3 XT∣E>^Γ∣), that it should not trouble him any further. Rashi takes the quotation from 2toδα Mesi 'a to signify the concrete Babylonian Talmud, which, however, is impossible.] as such it is synonymous with Mishτιah in its fifth signification, vol. xvi. p. 503; (4) “theory,” in contradistinction to “practice,”^[4. See T. B., Kiddushin, leaf 40δ: “Is theory (ΊΊΟ^Π) greater or practice (∏ti ’ yθ) greater? . . . They all answered, Theory (Ι1θS) is greater because it leads to practice.” Talmud, as will have been seen, is here given as synonymous with Limmud. .] —synonymous with Midrash in its fourth signification, vol. xvi. p. 285; (5) such interpretation of the Mosaic law as is apparent on the surface thereof and does not necessitate any further disquisition;^[5. See T. B., Baba Kamma, leaf 104δ, KDDKp ΠΙD7∏ B>' (“I say this is a plain [Mosaic] teaching ”). .] (6) Boroitlιo, or the non-canonical Mishnah ;^[6. See T.

B., Baba Mem a, leaf 33δ, and compare Rashi in loco.] f (8) the texts of Mishnah and Gemara combined,—the meaning which is the one most commonly attached to the term Talmud. Although the word Talmud is not to be found in the Bible, there can be little doubt that it is a classical Hebrew term, as may be seen by the analogy of Tahanuη, “supplication,” Tan-hûm, " consolation,” &c.

Recensions of the Talmud.— The Talmud exists in two recensions,—the Palestinian, commonly, but by mistake, called Talmud Yerushalmi (see below), and the Babylonian, correctly called Talmud Bal>li. The Talmud Yerushalmi embodies the discussions on the Mishnah (g ’.v.) of hundreds of doctors, living in Palestine, chiefly in Galilee from the end of the 2d till about the middle of the 5th century, whilst the Babylonian Talmud embodies chiefly the discussions on the same Mishnah of hundreds of doctors living in various places in Babylonia, such as Neharde'a,^[8. The rector of this academy was Shemuel, court physician of Shapur I., and astronomer. Whilst his friend and fellow-pupil Rab (q.v·; they both attended the lectures of the principal editor of the Mishnah) excelled in the other parts of the Jewish law, Shemuel was preeminent in the civil law. On account of this he is repeatedly called in the Talmud both “Shapur” (like his master) and “Aryokh” (lion, king, teacher). To him is due the legal principle that “the law of]

Kaphri,^[9. The rector of this school was Rab Hisda, the father-in-law of Raba (q.ν.).] Mahuza,^[10. The rector of this school was Raba (q.v.).] Shekhansib,^[11. The rector of this school was Rab Mahman b. Yishak (T. B., Gittiη, 31ά, Rashi, catchword K2X), husband of the learned and accomplished Yaltha, the daughter of the resh galutha (T. B., Hullin, leaf 1090), &c.] but notably at the two great academies of Sura and Pumbaditha, from about 190 to nearly the end of the 6th century. The doctors of both recensions, although they primarily discuss the correctness of the text and meaning of the Mishnah, and what should be the right legal decision according to it, do not confine themselves to this. They introduce, as occasion serves, not merely the whole of the oral tradition handed down to their time, and the necessary references to, and interpretations of, the various laws to be found in the Pentateuch and the other sacred writings, but exhibit also, though only in a fragmentary manner, an almost complete cycle of the profane sciences as current orally and known to them by books composed by Jews and Gentiles. The doctors of both these recensions were and are called Amoraim (D*KΙit3⅛), ⅛.e. j mere “discussers, speakers,”^[12. Amοra may also mean an interpreter. The great teachers of the first five centuries had generally a man (or several men) at their side, who to the learning requisite to translate the master’s teaching given in Hebrew, and dilate on it in Aramaic, added a Stentor’s voice, and could by fascinating speech command the attention of the audience. The first Babylonian A mor a, i.e., explainer of the Mishnah, who had an Amor a, i.e., a popular teacher, was Rabbi Shila. The first who is known to have acted as A mor a, i.e., popular teacher, to an Amor a, i.e., an explainer of the Mishnah, was the famous Rab (q.v.). See T. Y., Berakhoth, iv. 1, 2, &c.; T. B., Berakhoih, leaf 27ά; and T. B., Yoτπm, leaf 20ά (against Rapoport, 'Erekh Millin, s.v. “Amora”).] because, unlike the Mishnic doctors, who were and are called Tannaim (D'N2Π) j t>. j “learners, teachers,” they abstained from making new laws unless absolutely compelled by circumstances to do so.^[13. This certainly was not unfrequently the case, but even then they did so only in the spirit of the Tannaim.] These Amoraim stand, on the whole, in the same relation to their Mishnic predecessors as counsel giving a legal opinion, or judges deciding legal cases, stand to the legislature which frames the laws. In these points the doctors of both recensions agree. There are, however, also points of considerable difference between the two Talmuds. These are not merely geographical, and so necessarily linguistic,^[14. The Palestinian Amoraim, teaching people who understood Greek, had not to explain the Greek terms which frequently occur in the Mishnah and other works kindred to it. The Babylonian Amoraim, however, who in common with their hearers were ignorant of Greek, had a somewhat irregular though certainly effective way (received by them traditionally) of explaining the Greek terms in the Mishnah, &c., by Aramaic etymology. We will give two instances only of this practice: —(1) 'p*D1SN, which is evidently the Greek υποθήκη, is explained T. B., Baba Mesi'a, leaf 66ά, 1TÖ fc⅛X pJDD ηS «Π* “thou shalt get no payment except from this,”—evidently = 'Kp NΠΠ ΠDX = “upon this thou shalt stand,” i.e., “if I do not pay, this shall serve as my security”; compare Rashi on Baba Kamma, 11ά, catchword *p*ΠΙSK; (2) *ρ*ΓI*Ι is evidently the Greek bιaθηκη, and is explained as being a compound of (D ,, p) Op'öS NΠΠ ΚΊ, “this shall stand when I am no more,” i.e., “this is my last will and testament.” From T. B., Baba Bathra, leaf 135ά (evidently a Babylonian Boroithd), we see that in T. B., Baba Mesi'a, leaf 19«, three words (∏□ 31Π2B , S□) have fallen out.] but also material. Whilst the discussions in the Palestinian Talmud are simple, brief, and to the point, those in the Babylonian Talmud are subtle, long-winded, and, although always logical, sometimes even farfetched.^[15. Compare p. 35, footnote 3.] But there is another difference. The Palestinian Talmud, besides containing legal and religious discussions, is a storehouse of history, geography, and archaeology, whilst the Babylonian Talmud, taking into consideration that it is treble^[16. Bibliographers generally fall into a mistake in describing the size of the Babylonian as twelve times that of the Palestinian Talmud. They forget that two-thirds of the size of the former is simply owing to the commentaries by which it is invariably accompanied.] the size of its fellow Talmud, contains less of these. On the other hand, it bestows more care upon the legal and religious points, and, being the later and the more studied of the two, it is also the more trustworthy.

System of the Talmud.— Most people imagine not only that the Talmuds are a pathless wilderness, without so much as grammatical rules in their respective languages, but that the laws laid down in them rest on mere tradition. In reality their languages have strictly grammatical rules (see below under Aids, &c.), and their laws rest on a strictly logical system. The laws in both Talmuds are discussed and argued on philosophical rules, for which it is claimed that they have existed from time immemorial, and can be traced to the Pentateuch itself. These are—(1) the Seven Rules (n∏O y3B>), put forth by Hillel (fΓosephto Synhedrin, vii., last §; Siphro, towards the end of the Introduction; Aboth de-Rabbi Nathan, xxxvii.) but a great deal older than his time; (2) the Thirteen Rules (∏∏0 K ,i PB*), put forth by R. Yishma'el (Introduction to Siphro), which can, however, be traced in mice to the foregoing “Seven Rules”: both these are for the Halakhah ; and (3) there are also the Thirty-two Rules (n∏0 D'ΠBH D'E⅛B ’), put forth by R. Eli'ezer b. R. Yose Haggalili (vol i. of most editions of the Babylonian Talmud), which are for the Agadah. In addition, most of the points to which these rules apply are secured by early tradition. It is quite true that by idiosyncrasy digressions are very frequent both in Talmud and Midrash ; but in the Halakhah the digression, however long, invariably ends in coming back to the original cause of the logical combination, whilst in the Agadah the digression either comes back to the place from which it started, or else will be found, on examination, to have been introduced for its own sake, and have served its own purpose. As the doctors of Talmud and Midrash are mostly introduced in dialogues, this is the only practical, if somewhat uncommon, method.

Division of the Talmud.— The externa] division of both Talmuds is identical with the division, subdivision, and sub-subdivision of the Mishnah, although there is not always Gemara in the one when there is Gemara in the other.^[17. The only thing that ought to be mentioned here is, that to the Palestinian Talmud the Sheba Massekhtoth Ketannoth Yerushalmiyyoth (Frankfort, 1851, 8vo) must be added, whilst Gemara Shekalim and the Massekhtoth Ketannoth, which now form an integral part of the Babylonian Talmud, are fAboth de-Rabbi Nathan excepted) unjustifiably attached to it.] This, however, need not be further discussed here, as all on this head is minutely specified in Mishnah (q.v.). Concerning the internal division into Halakhah and Agadah, it ought to be said that the former is more largely represented in the Babylonian Talmud, whilst the latter is more largely and more interestingly given in the Palestinian Talmud. Whole collections of Midrashim now in our hands have constituted (if we may judge from the known to the unknown) part of the Palestinian Talmud,^[18. See Rashi on Gen. xlvii. 2.] and seem to have chiefly belonged to those portions of it which have been gradually lost.

Purpose.— The Talmud, unlike the Mishnah, contains not only individual decisions, but everything that is necessary for arriving at legal and religious decisions of whatever description these may be, whilst, like the Mishnah, it is not itself a handbook of decisions. This is only in accordance with the nature and spirit of an oral law which delegates the decisions to the Talmudico-speculative capacities of the teachers of every age. Even several of the comparatively few instances in which the words . . . ’ □ κn□S∏1 (“and the the civil government is the law,” t.e., that except in religious matters the Jew must submit to the laws of his country (T. B., Bαbα Βathra, 54b). Shemuel aud Rab (like Rabbi Yohanan and Resh Lakish, Abayye and Raba, and others), though intimate friends, nevertheless differ on nearly all imaginable points, so that when the Talmud wishes to give firmness to a certain decision or opinion, it uses the phrase; “Rab and Shemuel, &c., both agree.”
[9:23:37]

decision is according to so and so ”) occur in the Babylonian Talmud are a later addition. They belong to the Halakhoth Gedoloth^[19. E.g., T. B., Berakhoth, leaf 36α. See Rashi and Tosaphoth, catchword κn□Sm; Ibid., 36δ, and in other places.] f and are consequently, at the earliest, of the 8th century, but are probably of even much later date.

Editors.—The editorship of the Palestinian Talmud is generally, after Maimonides,^[20. In his Introduction to the commentary on the Mishnah (commonly, but by mistake, called Introduction to the Seder Ζerairn) and in his Introduction to the Mishneh Torah.] ascribed to Rabbi Yohanan (b. Napha). But this, if literally taken, is a gross mistake, as that teacher (ob. 279) died more than a hundred years before the latest Amorα (c. 450) mentioned in that Talmud. A similar error is made with respect to the editor or editors of the Babylonian Talmud, whose names are given as Rab Asshi (see Rab) (ob. 427) and Rabina (ob. 550), and who lived still much earlier than the last teachers mentioned in that Talmud (8th century). But it ought to be remembered that when the ancients speak of editors of books of such a mixed character as the Mishnah, the Zohar, both Talmuds, &c., they mean the person or persons who gave the first impulse to the collection or redaction of such books. In this sense, certainly, Rabbi Yohanan was the editor of the Palestinian and Rab Asshi and Rabina were the editors of the Babylonian Talmuds. For, whilst the first of the latter pair went more than once through the discussion of the whole Mishnah by the Amoraim from 190 to his time (c. 427), the latter supplemented the collection down to his own time (550). As regards the Babylonian Talmud, the Amoraim were succeeded by a new order of men called Saboraim (p3Ι 'X")13D), i∙e∙, “opiners,” who ventured only occasionally to revise and authenticate the sayings of their predecessors. The last of these Saboraim were Rab Tna (or Giza) and Rab Simona (c. 550-590). In any case neither the one Talmud nor the other was written down, slight private notes excepted (dηγ ∣ d JT)Sjo), before the close of the 6th century, if then. The apparently insurmountable difficulty of keeping such vast masses of literature in the head is removed when one takes into consideration that both teacher and student had means of help to their memory fully corresponding to the vastness of the literature. In the first place, they had the numbers already occurring in the Mishnah (e.g., five must not separate the heave-offering on account of the benediction to be recited in connexion with the act; Terumoth i. 1), &c. Secondly, they had names. Since to the sayings of the Talmud were generally attached the names of those who uttered them, saying and name became in the memory of the student identical. If somebody who had heard a certain saying from somebody, who in his turn had heard it from somebody else, was mentioned in the Talmud, all other sayings, however unlike these in nature, if they had only the same link of tradition, were recited on the same occasion: e.g., in the Palestinian Talmud, Megillah iv. 1, “says Rabbi Haggai, says Rabbi Shemuel b. Rab Yishak,” &c.; T. B., Berakhoth, leaf 3δ, Arc., “says Rabbi Zerika, says Rabbi Ammi, says Rabbi Yehoshua' b. Levi,” &c. Thirdly, other oral traditions, which went by the order of the Pentateuch, received in the written Pentateuch vast aids to memory. Fourthly, the Mishnah (although itself not written down), by its divisions, subdivisions, and sub-subdivisions, became, in its turn, a mighty aid to memory. Fifthly, as regards the Babylonian Talmud, there are additional means of aiding memory in existence, for every now and then one meets with a Mnemosynon (Siman), which strings together the order of subjects (e.g., T. B., Berakhoth, '3 c la, last line). Both in MSS. and printed editions these Simanim are given in brackets. Rapoport and his followers would have us believe that these mnemonic phrases are late inventions, but they have as yet failed to make good their assertions. See T. B., Shabbath 104α, and T. B., Hrubνn, 54ό, where these Simanim are positively mentioned early in the 4th century; cf. Rashi in loco.

Value.—The value of the Talmuds may be estimated by the fact that they contain the Mishnah in various recensions and a large portion of the contents of Midrashic collections, and in addition comprise a vast amount of Sopheric literature not to be found in the canonical Mishnah and Agadic matter not to be found in the known Midrashim, and have thousands of notices on secular knowledge of all kinds. Here, however, the reader ought to be again reminded that, whilst the Babylonian Talmud, the one of much larger extent, contains a great deal more Judaeo-religious matter, the Palestinian Talmud—of much smaller extent—is of much greater value for the historian, the geographer, the numismatist, and other students.

Vicissitudes of the Talmud.—Whilst the Babylonian Talmud commanded the attention of a hostile world, and was proscribed, mutilated,^[21. Raymundus Martin (Ramon Martinez), backed up by his teacher Pablo Cristiani (see Ramban), was one of the first five (or rather six) mutilators (called censors) of the Talmud and kindred books. See Touron, Histoire des Hommes Illustres de V Ordre de Saint Dominique, i. (Paris, 1743, 4to) p. 492; Jour. Philol., xvi. 134.] and condemned, and finally delivered over to the flames^[22. In the midsummer of 1244 twenty-four waggons full of Talmud copies were burned in France (see Journal of Philology, xvi. 133). A certain Donin (afterwards called Nicolaus), a converted Jew, by his accusations against the Talmud, managed that Rabbi Yehiel of Paris had to dispute with him publicly about its contents. The disputation took place in the midsummer of 1240; and R. Yehiel came out of it so victoriously that only after four years’ fuι∙ther machinations the Talmud was actually burned. The disputation is printed under the name of Disputatio cum Nicolao A. 1252 (!) habita cum Versione Latina in Wagenseil’s Tela Ignea Satanae (Altdorf, 1681, 4to); a less incorrect Hebrew edition came out in 1873, 8vo, at Thorn. This event of burning the Talmud called forth three .elegies—(1) by R. Binyamin b. Abraham De’ Mansi, beginning D71V IT)□X, and the refrain of which was ΠΊΚΒΕ ΠΌ2Π 'X, X1O21 ΠJBO ’ N (see MS. Add. 374, Camb. Univ. Lib., leaves 307a-308a); (2) by R. Meir of Rothenburg (see Rosh), the beginning of which is 2 ’ K2 ∏εi^∣ti ’ '7XIP (in the Ashkenazic ritual for the 9th of Ab); and (3) by R. Abraham b. Yishak (see Zunz, Zwr Gesch. u. Lit., pp. 463—4). This Abraham b. Yishak is the father of the famous En-bonet Abram Bederesi (not Bedarshi; see Schiller-Szinessy, Catal., i. correction 5), the author of the Behinath' 0lam.] by popes and kings, the Palestinian Talmud suffered still more from one single enemy—neglect.^[23. See Schiller-Szinessy in the Academy, 1878, p. 171, and extract from Excursus iii. (to the Catalogue) on the Palestinian Talmud in Occasional Notices, ke., i., Cambridge, 1878, 8vo.] Thousands of copies of the former recension were destroyed in the course of time, but, this Talmud being studied in all parts of the world, the few copies surviving became the means of an endless supply. Not so as regards the Palestinian Talmud, which found no students, or but few, after the closing (c. 450) of the Jewish academies in Palestine; and we have even to thank the enemies of traditional Judaism, the Karaites, who used it in controversy with their Rabbanite opponents, for the preservation of some copies of it. By degrees the neglect of the book became so great that whole chapters of treatises, whole treatises of orders, and almost two whole orders themselves, disappeared, and are lost to this day.^[24. See the before-mentioned Occasional Notices.]

Aids to the Study of the Talmuds.—(a) Lexicons.—The first rank is occupied by lexicons for both Talmuds and Midrashim, and of these that by R. Nathan b. Yehiel of Rome, compiled in the 11th and 12th centuries, claims the first place. All other lexicons, from Elias Levi ta, Philip Aquinas, Johannes Buxtorf, &c., down to Levy and Jastrow, are more or less based upon this grand work called 'Arukh.^[25. Rabbenu Nathan b. Yehiel b. Abraham was, on his father’s side an ’ Anav (121!)—and not an 'Akko (Ι3J2) as Rapoport, no doubt after Ibn Yahya, writes it in Bikkure Hàittim, x. 7—i.e., of the family 'Anavim (Dei Mansi, Dei Mansueti, Dei Piatelli, Dei Pietosi, Dei Umani, Dei Umili), and, on his mother’s side, of the Tappuhirn, i.e., De Pomis, to which the celebrated author of the Lexicon Sernah David belonged. Rabbenu Nathan’s father and grandfather, like Rabbenu Nathan himself and his brother’s descendants, were, no doubt, papal court Jews (and not linendrapers, as the latest editor of the'Arω⅛Λ, by misreading and misinterpreting the somewhat hard verses of his author, contrives to show). This lucrative position furnished them with ample means not only for their noble charities to congregational institutions (a synagogue, religious bath, &c.), but also with the leisure necessary for the pursuit of Talmudic studies. Rabbenu Nathan was resh kallo.h (rector of the Jewish university), and unquestionably the greatest Talmudist, even as he was the poorest Hebrew poet, in Italy in the 11th and 12th centuries. As regards his teachers we know four, three of whom he attended, whilst he studied and digested the works of the fourth so well that, though personally unknown to one another, they may be justly called master and disciple. His first teacher was his own father; his second teacher, from whom Rabbenu Nathan no doubt obtained his thorough knowledge of Babylonian habits, was R. Masliah of Sicily, who had been a hearer of the greatest “gaon” of Pumbaditha; his third teacher was R. Mosheh b. Ya'akobb. Mosheh b. Abbun of Narbonne (or Toulouse; better known under the name of R. Mosheh Haddarshan); and the fourth was Rabbenu Hananeel of Kairwan. He owed so much to this teacher that as soon as the 'Arukh had appeared most people took it for granted that Rabbenu Hananeel had lived at Rome, and accordingly called him “a man of Rome—'Ish Romi”; see MS. Brit. Mus. Add. 27,201, leaf 735, and Tosaphoth, passim. (That Rabbenu Gershom, Rabbenu Mosheh *D1DJ, and others were his teachers, as Rapoport, loc. rit., asserts, is a fiction.) Rabbenu Nathan, in his 'Amkh, does not merely explain the foreign lj.e., Aramaic, Persian, Greek, Latin, and Arabic) words occurring in the Targums, Talmuds, and Midrashim, but the subject-matter also, and thereby proves himself a doubly useful guide. In this, although he had been preceded by no less a personage than the Gaon Semah b. Paltoi (fl. 870), who also composed such an 'Arukh, Rabbenu Nathan was virtually the first, as the Gaon's work had been early lost. The assertion that the fourth of the four men captured by the Spanish admiral (see below, p. 39) was R. Nathan Habbabli, that he lived in Narbonne, and that he also composed a similar 'A rukh, rests on a misunderstanding, as the quotation in the Yohasin clearly shows. The passages there given under R. Nathan Habbabli are taken verbatim from the ' Λrukh of our author (compare the article &c.), That Rome has been at times called in Jewish writings “Babel,” and that consequently Habbabli may mean “the Roman,” is clear from the writings of the New Testament. We will only add here a few words concerning the bibliography of the book. Of the 'Arukh exist so far ten editions, the first of which came out undated, but before or about 1480. The seventh edition was enriched by the physician R. Binyamin Musaphia’s Musaph, he., Additamenta (Musaphia was a Greek and Latin scholar), and the latest edition by Dr Kohut is now in progress. As regards the MSS. of this remarkable lexicon the best copies are to be found partly in the University Library, Cambridge (Add. 376, which has all the verses of the author and additamenta by R. Shemuel Ibn POJ, and Add. 471-72), and partly at the Court Library, Vienna (Cod. cvi. 1 and 2). The latter were carried off by Napoleon I. to Paris in 1809, but in 1815 were returned to Vienna.] (b) Grammars.—A slight attempt at compiling a [9:23:38] grammar, and this only for the Babylonian Talmud, was made by the late learned S. D. Luzzatto. It exists in Italian (Padua, 1865), German by Krüger (Breslau, 1873), English by Goldammer (New York, 1876), and Hebrew by Lerner (St Petersburg, 1880). Of more value, however, is Noldeke’s Mandaitic Grammar, although it stands in connexion with the Babylonian Talmud only in an indirect way. (c) Commentaries.— Commentaries on the greater portion of the Babylonian Talmud are extant, by the famous Rabbenu Hananeel of Kairwan, the teacher of Riph ⅛.v.), by Rashi (q.vf, and by the descendants and disciples of this latter commentator, who composed the Tosaphoth. All these are included in the latest Talmud edition of Vilna. It is asserted by Rabäd II. {q.vf that the whole (B.) Talmud had been commented on in Arabic. As regards the commentaries on the Palestinian Talmud, it ought to be said that the Pene Mosheh, &c., by R. Mosheh Margaliyyoth, and the Korban II<xedah, &c., by R. David Fränkel (the teacher of Mendelssohn), make more than one commentary on the whole, and they are embodied in the Zhitomir edition (1860-67). (d) Methodology.— Among the many Introductions to the Babylonian Talmud that of R. Shemuel Hannagid must noλv be considered the first, not only in time but also in value. There was indeed an earlier, and perhaps a still more valuable one in existence (see Saadia), but it is now unfortunately lost. As regards the Palestinian Talmud, the only one in existence is that by the late Z. Frankel (Breslau, 1870, 8vo). The author was a most learned man, but somewhat confused in his diction, (e) Translations.— Renderings of isolated treatises of the Babylonian Talmud exist in Latin, Ugolini, Thesaurus, xix., Zebahim and Menahoth, and xxv., Synhedrin; ^[26. Various writers assert that there exist many books containing Latin translations of various treatises of the Babylonian Talmud. Upon examination these books turn out to contain either a translation only of Mishnic treatises with or without excerpta from, and with or without scholia on, Gernara, or disputations which introduce small pieces of Gernara. The utmost they contain is a chapter or two translated from Gernara itself (as, for example, “Edzard, AbodaSara,” &c., Hamburg, 1705-10, 4to, which contains Gernara of the first two Perdkim).] in French, e.g., Berakhoth, by Chiarini (Leipsic, 1831,

8vo); and in German, e.g., Berakhoth, by Rabe (Halle, 1777, 4to), regard being had also in both to the same treatise of the Palestinian recension, and again by Pinner (1842); Baba Mesi ’ a, by Sammter (1876), both at Berlin and in folio; 'Abodah Zarah, by Ewald (Nuremberg, 1856, 8vo); Tdanith, by Straschun (Halle, 1883); Megillah and Rosh Hasshanah, by Rawicz (Frankfort-on-the-Main, 1884 and 1886). The assertion that the whole of this Talmud has been translated into Spanish has yet to be proved. As regards the Palestinian Talmud, Ugolini’s Thesaurus contains the following treatises in Latin :— Pesahim (vol. xvii.); Shekalim, Yoma, Sukkah, Rosh Hasshanah, Tdanith, Megillah, Hagigah, Besah, Mded Katan (vol. xviii. ); Mdaseroth, Mdaser Sheni, Hallah, 'Orlah, Bikkurim (vol. xx. ); Synhedrin, Makkoth (vol. xxv. ); Kiddushin, Sotah, Kethuboth (vol. XXX. ). Μ. Schwab (of the Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris) has undertaken a French translation of the entire Palestinian Talmud, which is now in progress; from this Berakhoth has been translated into English (London, 1886, 4to).

Editions.— The editions of the Palestinian Talmud, in what was then called its entirety, are only four:—(a) Venice, 1523, without any commentary; (5) Cracow, 1609, with a short commentary, the text apparently from a different MS. from that used for the editio princeps; (c) Krotoschin, 1866, with a short commentary differing from that of Cracow: these three editions are each comprised in one volume; (cZ) the fourth edition came out at Zhitomir, with commentaries by different men (see Commentaries above). All these editions are in folio. Of the editions of isolated treatises, which are not a few, we will only mention those of Berakhoth (Vienna, 1874) and Peah and Demai (Breslau, 1875, both in 4to), with a new commentary by Z. Frankel. The editions of the Babylonian Talmud are so numerous that they would require several entire sheets for enumeration. There is in existence an approximately good treatise on them (see Variae Lectiones, vols. i. and viii.). We will only name three of the entire editions (1) the editio princeps, Venice, 1520-23,^[27. The paging of this has been followed in all subsequent editions.] —which, though disfigured by numerous misprints, was not mutilated by the censor; (2) the edition of Basel (1578-81), which omits 'Abodah Zarah altogether, and has a cheering (?) notice in Latin;^[28. Nunc ab omnibus iis quae contra religionem Christianam faciebant recognitum, et juxta mentem Sacri concilii Tridentini expurgatum et approbatum, ut non modo citra impietatem verum etiam cum fructu a nostris legi possit.] (3) the latest edition, now printing·at Vilna, with old commentaries hitherto unpublished. Of isolated treatises, which may be counted by more than hundreds, we will only mention one (the Portuguese of at least Berakhoth), the existence of which was asserted in the last century {Pahad Yishak, s.v. N∏Ι∏ΠDΠ K∏ll), then again called in question in our own times, but positively proved by the present writer from an early work composed at the time when but few editions of the Talmud existed. It is the Zerd Abraham (Camb. MS. Ti. 6. 50, leaf 595). Materials for the critical edition of the Babylonian Talmud from an ancient MS. formerly in the monastery of Pfersee, but now in the Royal Library of Munich, and other MSS. and early prints of isolated treatises in various public and private libraries of Europe, Asia, and Africa, have been collected and are being published by Rabbinovicz. Of this important work fifteen volumes, containing the following treatises, have already come out:—the whole SederZerdim (1867); Besah, Hagigah, Mded Katan (1869); Su,kkah, Tdanith (1870); Rosh Hasshanah, Foma (1871); 'Enιbin (1873); Pesahim (1874); Shabbath (1875); Megillah, Shekalim (1877); Synhedrin (1878); 'Abodah Zarah, Makkoth, Shebdoth, Horayoth, 'Eduyyoth (1879); Baba Bathra (1881); Baba Kamma (1882); Baba AÎesi'a (1883); Zebahim (1884); Menahoth (1886).^[29. The notes in the first fourteen volumes go under the name of CIÖID,'131, whilst those of the fifteenth volume have the title of DΠ"□N7 TDT, in memory of the late Abraham Merzbacher, who not merely proved the Maecenas of this publication during his lifetime, but left a considerable sum for its continuation and completion.] All these were printed in 8vo and at Munich, except vol. ix., which came out at Mainz.

Influence of the Talmud.— It must be admitted by every critical student of history that the Talmud has not merely been the means of keeping alive the religious idea among the Jews, but has formed their strongest bond of union. When, after the fall of the city of Jerusalem and its temple, and the expatriation of the Jews from Palestine, a goodly portion of the Mosaic law lost its application, the Talmud became the spirit which put fresh life into the letter which [9:23:39] had become to a great extent dead. Moreover, by the Talmud, the interpretation of which was chiefly in the hands of the academies of Sura and Pumbaditha, the Jews of all the world found, if not a new Jerusalem, at least a new Yabneh (Jamnia), i.e., a place where the old learning was not merely continued, but made to shine with a yet greater splendour. This fact will be the more readily acknowledged and appreciated when one casts a glance at the miserable religious condition of the Karaites, the so-called Scriptural Jews.

Transference of Talmudic Learning from the East to the West.— There naturally came a time when Talmudic learning, if it was to maintain its influence upon the Jews, could not be confined to one spot. We have seen under Rashi (q.vi} that the great emperor of the West (Charlemagne) had been the means, towards the close of the 8th century, of bringing learned Talmudists not only to Provence but to the north of France and the south of Germany.^[30. Italy, notably Sicily, was apparently the country which obtained her teachers direct from Trak.] But when nearly two hundred years later the academies of Babylonia were threatened with extinction (because of their lacking, from various causes, the means of subsistence), so that they had to send out members of their body to supplicate the support of their richer brethren in other countries, it providentially happened that the four men whom they sent were taken by a Spanish corsair admiral and sold in four different slave-markets. Rabbi Shemaryah was sold at Alexandria, and was redeemed by the Jews, and great was their astonishment when they recognized in him a most able Talmudist. He became the head of the Cairo community, and one of the most successful Jewish Talmud teachers Egypt ever had. Rabbi Husshiel was taken to Kairwan, in Africa. There the Jews redeemed him; and when his great learning was found out he was named the spiritual head of the Jews in that place. From the school which he founded sprang not merely his own son, the famous Rabbenu Hananeel, but also the great Rabbenu Nissim, both teachers of Riph {q.vf. Another learned captive, R. Mosheh, was brought to the slave-market of Cordova, the rabbi of which town, a noble and rare example of unselfishness, modesty, and love of truth, placed the ragged stranger who had only been ransomed for charity’s sake a day or so before at the head of the community instead of himself. The name of the fourth is unknown (see Rabad IL, and Yohasin, ed. Cracow, leaf 1256). Some assert that he was R. Nathan Habbabli, and that he became the teacher of the Jews in Narbonne, but this is a mere conjecture, the truth of which has yet to be proved (see page 37, footnote 7 ). Be this, however, as it may, four great Talmudists, who had come direct from the Babylonian academies, became the means of bringing Babylonico-Talmudic learning to places the Jews of which had been dependent on the religious and literary crumbs that fell from the richly-laden tables of Sura and Pumbaditha. Some years afterwards the former academy was closed, and a short time afterwards the same fate befell that of Pumbaditha, the sunset of which, if not the noonlight, in the persons of Rab Sherira Gaon and his son Rab Haï Gaon was even more glorious than that of the sister academy, the last “gaon” of which was Rab Shemuel b. Hophni, father-in-law of Rabbenu Haï. Meanwhile, however, Talmudic learning had not merely become naturalized, but eventually indigenous in various parts of Africa, and part of Europe (Spain, Italy, Provence, the south of Germany, and the north of France). Rabbenu Gershom b. Yehudah of Metz and his disciple Rabbenu Yishak of Troyes, Rabbenu Ya'akob b. Yakar of Worms, Rabbenu Eli'ezer Haggadol and his disciple and successor Rabbenu A ishak Segan Leviyyah, Rabbenu Yishak b. Yehudah of Mainz,

Rabbenu Elyakim of Spires, Rabbenu Nathan b. Yehiel of Rome, and last but not least Rashi himself, and his sons-in-law and other disciples, represented Talmudic learning in such perfection as had not been found before as regards the Babylonian Talmud, even in the land of its birth and growth. It was the disciples’ disciples of these men who studied and taught in various towns of England within a hundred years (1150) after the Conquest. When, towards the end of the 13th century and the commencement of the 14th, the Jews were driven out of England (1290) and France (1306), and flocked chiefly to Italy, Greece, Germany, and Poland, the last-named country appropriated the lion’s share of Talmudic learning, so that till within our own century the rabbis of the chief communities in Hungary, Moravia, Bohemia, and other Austrian states, and in Germany, Holland, England, &c., had to be fetched from Poland. Talmudic learning, since Mendelssohn and his school arose, threatened to die out not merely among the Jews in Germany, but also among those of the other countries where the Jews spoke the German tongue in some form or other. Within the last twenty-five years, however, fresh impulse has been given to these studies, not merely among Jews but also among Christians. (s. Μ. s.-s.)
