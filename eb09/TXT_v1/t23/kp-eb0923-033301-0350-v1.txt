THURSO, a seaport, police burgh, and burgh of barony of Caithness, Scotland, is situated at the mouth of the Thurso, on the beautifu! Thurso Bay, at the northern terminus of the Highland Railway, 21 miles north-west of Wick, and 367 north of Edinburgh by rail. The new town, regularly built with broad streets and good houses, is steadily increasing in population. In Macdonald Square, now laid out with ornamental walks, there is a statue of Sir John Sinclair (q.v.). Along the sands a promenade 300 yards in length was formed in 1882. The town-hall (1870) embraces a court-room and rooms for the free public library and the museum, which contains the geological and botanical specimens of Robert Dick, the “Thurso baker,” commemorated by Samuel Smiles, as well as a large collection of northern birds. In the neighbourhood are large quarries for Caithness flags, which are cut and dressed in the town. They constitute the principal export, but the trade of the port is hindered by the inconvenience of the harbour. There is, however, communication with the south and west, and with Orkney by steamer from Scrabster pier, 3 miles to the north. To the east is Thurso Castle, the residence of the Ulbster branch of the Sinclairs. The population in 1871 was 3622 and in 1881 it was 4026.

Thurso was the centre of the Norse power on the mainland when at its height under Thorfinn (1014), and afterwards till the battle of Largs. Count Moddan, nephew of King Duncan, quartered his army for a time at Thurso, which he terms “the town of Caithness,” and was plentifully supplied by spoil till surprised and slain by Thorkel in 1040. In the time of Malcolm II. Earl Erlend resided in the town. In 1633 it was created a burgh of barony, and was the seat of the sheriff courts of the county till they were removed to Wick in 1828.
