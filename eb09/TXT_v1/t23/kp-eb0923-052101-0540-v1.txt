TRANSYLVANIA (Germ. Siebenbürgen), a mountainous principality (Gross-Fürstenthum) forming the extreme eastern portion of Austria-Hungary, is bounded on the W. and N. by Hungary proper, on the E. by Bukowina and Moldavia, and on the S. by Walachia. The German name is usually derived from the seven principal fortified towns or “burgs” founded by the German colonists, though some authorities prefer to connect it with the Zibin Mountains on the south frontier. The Latin name appears first after the 12th century, and signifies “beyond the woods,” i.e., from Hungary; the Magyar and Roumanian names (Erdély and Ardealu) both mean “forest-land.” For all political and administrative ends, and in the official statistics and returns, Transylvania is now wholly incorporated with Hungary (q.v.), and to all intents and purposes is a part of that kingdom. The principality has the form of an irregular circle, with an area of about 21,000 square miles, and is on all sides surrounded by mountain chains, while the interior is barred and striped with lower ranges. On the west or Hungarian side there are various wide and comparatively easy passes into the interior, but on the east and south frontiers the lofty bounding mountains present steep and rugged faces outwards, giving to Transylvania the general aspect of a huge natural fortress. These mountains are a continuation of the Hungarian and Galician Carpathians; in fact, the mountains of Transylvania may be regarded together as forming the southeastern main group of the Carpathian system. The loftiest and most rugged peaks are on the north and south boundaries. On the north the highest summit is the Pietross (7534 feet), one of the Rodna Alps; on the south are the Butshetsh (8262 feet), the Königstein (7357 feet), and the Negoi (8340 feet). The east is bounded by several parallel chains, the highest peak in which is the Pietrossul (6910 feet); and on the west border the greatest height is attained towards the south, where several peaks reach 7200 feet. On the west are the Transylvanian Ore Mountains (Erzgebirge), with the curious Detunata (“thunder-smit ”), and the Bihar group, with its numerous caverns. There are numerous valleys, ravines, and canons in the network of mountains covering the interior of the country, but it is only along the courses of the principal rivers that plains of any size are found. The chief rivers are the Aluta or Alt, which flows south, pierces the southern boundary mountains at the Rother Thurm Pass, [9:23:522] and joins the Danube, and the Maros, to the west, and the Szamos, to the north, both tributaries of the Theiss, which also falls into the Danube. All these are navigable, and are fed by various tributaries. The largest lake is the Hodoser or Eseger See, 13 miles long. Transylvania abounds in mineral springs of all kinds, especially saline and chalybeate. The climate is tolerably severe: hot summers alternate with very cold winters; but the rainfall is not great.

The mineral wealth of Transylvania is very considerable. Gold is found in certain quantity in mines, and it is also “washed” in some of the streams, chiefly by Gipsies. The gold is often found in conjunction with tellurium (first discovered in Transylvania in 1782, and until the present century not found anywhere else, see Tellurium). Silver, copper, lead, and iron are also worked to some profit. Coal occurs in considerable abundance, and it is mined in the Schilthal, but the superabundance of timber has retarded its exploitation. Hills largely formed of pure salt are met with here and there, and there are also very rich subterranean deposits of salt, sometimes cropping up on the surface. Some of the saline springs also yield salt enough to render their evaporation profitable. The vegetation of Transylvania is luxuriant, except of course in the higher mountain zones. Fruits abound, as apples, pears, peaches, apricots, plums, cherries, chestnuts, and almonds; mulberries are also cultivated. The vine flourishes best in the valley of the Maros. Agriculture is one of the most important industries, though the available good land is by no means fully taken up. The chief crop is maize; but wheat, rye, and other grains, potatoes, saffron, hemp, flax, and tobacco are also grown. Extensive forests clothe much of the country, but are in a somewhat neglected condition. On the boundary mountains the trees are mainly coniferous; in the interior oaks, elms, beeches, and ashes are conspicuous.

The forests afford cover for many wild animals. Bears, wolves, foxes, boars, and various varieties of game are found, and on some of the mountains the chamois. There is abundant pasturage on which excellent cattle are reared; and in some districts buffaloes are bred for draught purposes. More important is the breeding of a sturdy race of horses, thousands of which are annually exported. The mountains maintain very large flocks of sheep, of which two kinds are distinguished—with a fine short-stapled and a coarse long-stapled wool respectively. Silkworms are bred, and some silk is spun; and the export of honey and wax, from both wild and domestic bees, is not inconsiderable. Neither the means of communication with the external world nor the manufacturing industry in Transylvania is developed to any important extent; the latter, indeed, has to a certain extent gone back. The most industrious and in general the most advanced of the population are the “Saxons”; and trade, the great bulk of which is with Roumania, is mainly in the hands of Armenians and Greeks. The chief commercial centres and principal towns are Herrmannstadt, Kronstadt, Bistritz, and Szamos-Ujvar.

Perhaps the most interesting point in connexion with Transylvania is the variety of its population, which in 1880 numbered 2,084,048 in all. Until 1848 the chief influence and privileges, as well as the only political rights, were divided among the three “privileged nations” of the Hungarians, Szeklers, and Saxons. The first are the descendants of the Magyar conquerors. The Szeklers, i.e., “guardians,” chiefly on the east borders, settled in eastern Transylvania to act as guardians of the frontiers. The Saxons are the posterity of the German immigrants brought by King Geisa II. (1141-1161) from Flanders and the lower Rhine to cultivate and repeople his desolated territories. At first these were known as Teutones, Teutonici Hospites, and Flandrenses, but since the beginning of the 13th century the general name of “Saxons,” as tantamount to “Germans,” has prevailed (cf. Saxony, vol. xxi. p. 351). The Hungarians and Szeklers together number 609,208, and the Saxons 204,713, but by far the most numerous element, though long excluded from power and political equality, is formed by the Walachians or Roumanians, 1,146,611 in number, a mixed race, not entitled to the descent which they claim from the early Roman colonists of Dacia. The Gipsies of Transylvania, who are heard of under a voivode or prince of their own in 1417, are estimated at 46,460; many of them have abandoned a nomadic life and have taken to agriculture or gold-washing. Jews, Armenians, Bulgarians, Ruthenians, and Greeks are also represented in the medley of peoples. About 70,000 (chiefly children) are returned, unclassed, as “not able to speak.” The Magyars are mostly Roman Catholics or Unitarians, the Germans Protestants, and the Roumanians adherents of the Greek Church.

Transylvania formed part of the Roman province of Dacia. After the withdrawal of the Romans the country became for centuries the prey of the various peoples who swept across it in their restless migrations. At the beginning of the 11th century (1004) Stephen I. of Hungary made himself master of the land, which was thenceforward governed as an Hungarian province by a voivode. In 1538 the voivode, John Zapolya, succeeded in rendering himself independent, and he and his successors, who were generally elected by the people, were supported by the Turks against the house of Austria, while the difficult nature of their country preserved them on the other hand from becoming too dependent on their powerful allies. After the defeat of the Turks at Vienna in 1683, their influence in Transylvania waned, and in 1699, by the peace of Carlowitz, the Porte acknowledged the suzerainty of Leopold I. of Austria over Transylvania. By the Leopoldine diploma of 1691 Leopold had guaranteed the ancient rights and laws of the land, and united it formally with the Hungarian crown. In 1765 Maria Theresa made it a grand principality (Gross-Fürstenthum). The efforts of the Roumanian inhabitants to secure recognition as a fourth “nation,” and the opposition of the non-Magyar population to a closer union with Hungary, led to troubles and disagreement early in the 19th century, culminating in bloody internecine struggles in 1848. In 1849 Transylvania was divided from Hungary by an imperial decree, and became an Austrian crown-land; but in 1860 the old order was renewed, and the complete incorporation with Hungary was perfected in 1868. Since that time the policy of the Hungarian party has on the whole prevailed, and the Magyarization of the principality is steadily being carried through, in spite of the bitter protests and discontent of both the Saxons and Roumanians. An Hungarian university was founded at Klausenburg in 1872; and Hungarian is recognized as the official language. (F. MU.)
