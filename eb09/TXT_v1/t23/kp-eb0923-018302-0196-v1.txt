TEPLITZ, or Töplitz, one of the most frequented watering-places in the north of Bohemia, is picturesquely situated about 30 miles south of Dresden, in the plain of the Biela, which separates the Erzgebirge from the Bohemian Mittelgebirge. The main interest of the little town centres in the bathing season, which reaches its height in August; and the arrangements for the convenience and amusement of visitors are very complete. There is a large curhaus, and numerous handsome bathhouses are situated both in Teplitz and in the immediately adjoining village of Schönau. The environs are laid out in pretty and shady gardens and promenades, the finest being in the park which surrounds the château of Prince Clary, the superior of the town. The other chief buildings are the Roman Catholic and Protestant churches, the Jewish synagogue with a conspicuous dome, and the theatre. The saline-alkaline springs of Teplitz, ten to twelve in number, ranging in temperature from 90° to 117° Fahr., are classed among what are called “indifferent” waters. Used until lately almost exclusively for bathing, they are prescribed for gout, rheumatism, and some scrofulous affections, and their reputed efficacy in alleviating the effects of gun-shot wounds had gained for Teplitz the sobriquet of “the warriors’ bath.” Military baths are maintained in the town by the Governments of Austria, Prussia, and Saxony, and there are also bath-houses for the poor. Teplitz is much visited for the after-cure, after Carlsbad and similar spas. The number of patients in 1883 was 6000 and the passing visitors were almost as numerous. The presence of a bed of lignite in the neighbourhood has encouraged the industrial development of Teplitz, which carries on manufactures of cotton and woollen goods, india-rubber, chemicals, hardware, &c. In 1880 the united population of Teplitz and Schönau was 16,750.

The thermal springs are fabled to have been discovered as early as 762, but the first authentic mention of the baths occurs in the 16th century. The town is mentioned in the 12th century, the name being derived from a Slavonic word meaning “warm bath.” Teplitz figures in the history of Wallenstein, and is also interesting as the spot where the monarchs of Austria, Russia, and Prussia first signed the triple alliance against Napoleon in 1813. It is a [9:23:184] curious fact that on the day of the earthquake at Lisbon (1st November 1775) the main spring at Teplitz ceased to flow for some minutes.
