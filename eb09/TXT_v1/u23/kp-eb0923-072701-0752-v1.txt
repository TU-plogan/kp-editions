The accompanying table gives the population of the counties according to the census of 1881, and their parliamentary representation as determined by the Redistribution Act of 1885. In the enumeration of the Scottish members of parliament, groups of burghs are included in the counties containing the burghs whence they are respectively named, while it is to be observed that Kinross county is united with Clackmannan, Nairn with Elgin, and Selkirk with Peebles. The addition of the nine university representatives (England, 5; Scotland, 2; Ireland, 2) brings the total membership of the House of Commons to 670.
