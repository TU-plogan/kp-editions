FRAMLINGHAM, a market town of England in the county of Suffolk, about 4 miles north-east of Ipswich. It is the terminus of a branch railway, and has a corn exchange, a people’s hall, and a newspaper office. The church is a fine old building mostly in the Perpendicular style, constructed of black flint stone, and surmounted by a tower 96 feet high. In the interior there are a number of interesting monuments, among which the most noticeable are those of Thomas Howard, third duke of Norfolk, and of Henry Howard, the famous earl of Surrey who was beheaded by Henry VIII. The castle forms a picturesque ruin, consisting of the outer walls 44 feet high and 8 feet thick, 13 towers about 58 feet high, a gateway, and some outworks. About half a mile from the town is the Albert Memorial Middle Class College, opened iu 1865, and capable of accommodating 300 boys. A bronze statue of the Prince Consort by Durham adorns the front terrace. The population of the parish in 1871 was 2569. Framlingham dates, according to tradition, from the time of Red w aid, king of the East Angles, but its history is of doubtful authenticity till the Norman period. The castle was successively held by the Bigods, the Mowbrays, and the Howards. On the attainder of Thomas Howard, it was seized by the king, and it thus became for a time the residence of Queen Mary of England. Though restored to the Howard family by James I., it was suffered to fall into decay, and in 1635 it was sold, along with the park and the advowson of the living, to Sir Robert Hitcham, who left the whole to the use of the masters and fellows of Pembroke Hall, Cambridge.
