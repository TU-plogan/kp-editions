FUENTERRABIA, an ancient town and frontier fortress of Spain, in the province of Guipúzcoa and bishopric of Pamplona, 11 miles E.N.E. of San Sebastian and 2 miles from Irun. It stands on the slope of a hill on the west bank of the Bidassoa, and near the point where its estuary begins. At one time it possessed considerable strategic importance, and it has frequently been taken and retaken in wars between France and Spain. The “dolorous rout” of Charlemagne, however, which has been associated by Milton with Fontarabia, is generally understood to have taken place not here but at Roncesvalles, which is nearly 40 miles distant. Unsuccessful attempts to seize Fuenterrabia were made by the French troops in 1476 and again in 1503. In a subsequent campaign (1521) these were more successful, but it was retaken in 1524. The prince of Condé sustained a severe repulse under its walls in 1638, and it was on this occasion that the town received from Philip ΓV. the rank of city (muy noble, muy leal, y muy valerosa ciudad). After a severe siege it surrendered to the duke of Berwick in the English war of 1719 (18th June); and in 794 it again fell into the hands of the French, who so dismantled it that it has never since been reckoned by the Spaniards among their fortified places. It was by the ford opposite Fuenterrabia that the duke of Wellington, on the 8th of October 1813, by “one of the most daring exploits of military genius,” successfully forced a passage into France in the face of an opposing army commanded by Soult. Severe fighting also took place here during the Carlist war in 1837. The town is now considerably dilapidated and decayed. Its inhabitants are employed chiefly in salmon and other fisheries. Population, 772. See Palafox, Sitio y Socorro de Fuente-rabia, Madrid, 1639.
