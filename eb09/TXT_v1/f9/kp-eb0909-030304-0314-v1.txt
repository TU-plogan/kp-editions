FLEMMING, or Flemmynge, Richard (died 1431), bishop of Lincoln, and founder of Lincoln College, Oxford, [9:9:304] was born at Crofton in Yorkshire. He was descended from a good family, and was educated at University College, Oxford. Having taken his degrees, he was made prebendary of York in 1406, and the next year was one of the proctors of the university. At this period of his life he embraced the doctrines of Wickliffe, and by his earnest advocacy won over many persons, some of high rank, to the side of the Reformer. But by some means a change was wrought in him, and he not only ceased to speak against the corruptions of the Roman system, but became one of Wickliffe’s most determined opponents. Before 1415 he was instituted to the rectory of Boston in Lincolnshire, and in 1420 he was consecrated bishop of Lincoln. In 1424 he attended the council of Siena, a continuation of the council of Constance, and in the presence of the pope, Martin V., made an eloquent speech in vindication of his native country. It was probably on this occasion that he was named chamberlain to the pope. To Bishop Flemming was intrusted the execution of the decree of the council for the exhumation and burning of Wickliffe’s remains. The see of York being vacant, the pope conferred it on Flemming; but in consequence of the vehement opposition of Henry V. to the project, it was given up, and Flemming remained bishop of Lincoln. In 1427 he obtained the royal licence empowering him to found a college at Oxford for the special purpose of training up disputants against Wickliffe’s heresy. While the work was in progress the founder died at his palace at Sleaford, January 26, 1431. Lincoln College was, however, completed by his trustees, and its endowments were afterwards augmented by various benefactors.
