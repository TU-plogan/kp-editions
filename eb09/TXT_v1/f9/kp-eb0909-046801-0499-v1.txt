FORTROSE, a royal and parliamentary burgh of Scotland, county of Ross, is situated on the N. side of the Moray Firth, nearly opposite Fort-George, from which it is 2j miles distant, and with which it has regular ferry communication. It was made an episcopal see in the 12th century by David I., but only a small portion of the cathedral now remains. It has a handsome Episcopal chapel and academy, and a good harbour, with a depth of 14 feet water at high tide. On account of the romantic scenery of the neighbourhood, the town possesses considerable attractions as a watering place. The parish church is at Rosemarkie, about a mile eastward. Sir James Mackintosh received his early education at Fortrose. This borough unites with Inverness, Forres, and Nairn in returning one member to parliament. The population of the parliamentary burgh (which includes Rosemarkie) was 1017 in 1871.
