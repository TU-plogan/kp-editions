FERRET (Mustela furo) i an albino variety of weasel, regarded by some as the descendant of a wild species originally brought from Africa, and now only known in the domesticated state, and by others, as a variety of the polecat (Mustela putorius), which it closely resembles in size, form, and habits, and with which it is said to interbreed freely. It differs, however, from the polecat in the colour of its fur, which is usually yellowish-white, and of its eyes which are pinky-red. A more important difference, as bearing on the question of its specific distinctness, lies in the fact that while the polecat thrives in the severe climate of northern Europe, the ferret is peculiarly intolerant of cold, and only survives the English winter by means of the artificial warmth to which, under domestication, it is accustomed. The ferret attains a length of about fourteen inches, exclusive of the tail, which measures about five inches. Although exhibiting considerable tameness, it seems incapable of attachment, and when not properly fed or when otherwise irritated is apt to give painful evidence of its native ferocity. Tempted by the opportunity of the mother’s absence it has been known to attack the child in the cradle, and having once tasted blood it seems to lose all its acquired shyness, and will then boldly attack any one interfering with the gratification of its bloodthirsty propensity. It is chiefly employed in destroying rats and other vermin, and in driving rabbits from their burrows into nets spread for their reception. For the latter purpose it is usually muzzled, to prevent it devouring its prey and thereafter going to sleep at the bottom of a burrow until roused by hunger to renewed exertion. The ferret is remarkably prolific, the female bringing forth two broods annually, each numbering from six to nine young. It is said to devour its young occasionally immediately after birth, and in this case it produces another brood soon after. The ferret was well known to the Romans, Strabo stating that it was brought from Africa into Spain, and Pliny that it was employed in his time in rabbit hunting, under the name Viverra, of which the English name is probably a corruption.
