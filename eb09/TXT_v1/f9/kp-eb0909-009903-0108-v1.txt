FERNANDEZ, Alvaro, one of the numerous band of Portuguese explorers who, in the earlier part of the 15th century, took part in the search for a sea-passage into the Indian Ocean, was born about the year 1420, and seems to have been brought up as page or esquire to Prince Enrique of Portugal. He was related to Joam Gonsalvez, discoverer of Madeira and governor of Funchal. While still a comparatively young man, he was commissioned to prosecute the exploration of the African coast. After visiting the mouth of the Senegal and landing on the island of Gorée, he succeeded in reaching Cape de Matos or Mastos, the most southerly point that had ever been attained (1446). Soon afterwards he took command of a second expedition, in which the utmost limit reached was Rio Tabite, a little to the south of Rio Grande. Ill health thereafter compelled his return to Portugal, where he was welcomed at court as a distinguished discoverer.
