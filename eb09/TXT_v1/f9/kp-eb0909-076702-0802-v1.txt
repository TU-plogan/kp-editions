FREIRE, Francisco Joze (1713-1773), a Portuguese historian and philologist, was born at Lisbon in 1713. He belonged to the monastic society of St Philip Neri, and was a zealous member of the literary association known as the Academy of Arcadians, in connexion with which he adopted the pseudonym of Candido Lusitano. He contributed much to the improvement of the style of the Portuguese prose literature, but his endeavour to effect a reformation in the national poetry by a translation of Horace’s Ars Poetica was less successful. The work in which he set forth his opinions regarding the vicious taste pervading the current Portuguese prose literature is entitled Maximas sobre a Arte Oratoria, and is preceded by a chronological table forming almost a social and physical history of Portugal· His best known work, however, is his Vida do Infant D. Henrique, which has given him a place in the first rank of Portuguese historians. He also wrote an account of the great earthquake of 1775, and his Réflexions sur la Langue Portugaise was published in 1842 by the Lisbon society for the promotion of useful knowledge. He died in 1773.
