FERDINAND I. (c⅛. 1000-1065), surnamed the Great, first sovereign of independent Castile, was the second son of Sancho III. (el Mayor) of Navarre, who about 1026 compelled Bermudo III. of Leon, the last direct descendant of Pelayo in the male line, to surrender his rights over Castile, and also to give his sister Sancha in marriage to Ferdinand, then regent of that province. Sancho, towards the close of his energetic life, divided his extensive dominions among his four sons, Castile being the portion allotted to the second (1035). Bermudo of Leon, shortly after Sancho’s death, sought to recover his lost possessions, but was defeated and slain in the attempt at Lantada near Rio Carrion (1038). Ferdinand, now king of Leon as well as of Castile, by a conciliatory yet firm policy, soon established his authority over his conquered subjects; and when in 1053 his dominions were invaded by his brother Garcia III. of Navarre, the attack issued in the death of the latter on the battlefield of Λtapuerca near Burgos, and the annexation of a large portion of his dominions. At an early period of his reign Ferdinand began to direct his arms against the Moors; and by a series of successful campaigns he extended the Christian frontier from the Douro to the Mondego, and reduced to vassalage the emirs of Toledo, Saragossa, and Seville. Even the Arab chronicles mention his victories from Badajoz in Estremadura to Albarracin in Aragon (Gayangos, Mohammedan Dynasties in Spain, vol. it). He had set out on an expedition against Valencia when he was seized with a mortal illness which compelled him to retire to his capital (Leon), where, after having divided his dominions among his three sons, he died on the 27th of December 1065. Ferdinand appears to have laid claim to the title of “emperor” of Spain; and Mariana alleges that at a council held at Florence in 1055 the emperor Henry III. lodged a formal complaint against this infringement of his rights of suzerainty, that this complaint was sustained by Pope Victor IL, but that at a conference afterwards held at Toulouse a decision favourable to Ferdinand’s imperial rights, so far as they related to the territories which had been conquered from the Moors, was given, chiefly in consequence of the representations made by the famous Cid, Ruy Diaz de Bi var. Though this statement can only be received with reserve, it is certain that both in virtue of the ascendency he won for himself in Christian Spain, and also in virtue of his very considerable successes over the Moors, Ferdinand I. is fully entitled to the rank which tradition has assigned to him among the greater Spanish sovereigns.
