FRÖHLICH, Abraham Emanuel (1796-1865), a German-Swiss poet, was born February 1, 1796, at Brugg, in the canton of Aargau, where his father was a teacher. At the age of fifteen he was sent to study theology in the academy of Zürich. In 1817 he was ordained, and returned as teacher to his native town, where he lived for ten years. He was then appointed professor of German language and literature in the canton-school at Aarau, which post he lost, however, in the political quarrels of 1830. He afterwards obtained the post of teacher and rector of the Bezirksschule, and was also appointed Hülfsprediger. He died December 1,1865. His works are—170 Fαδe⅛(1825)j Schweizerlieder (1827); Das Evangelium St Johannis, in Liedern (1830); Elegien an Wieg' und Sarg (1835); Die Epopöen; Ulrich Zwingli (1840); Ulrich von Hutten (1845); Auserlesene Psalmen und Geistliche Lieder für die Evangelisch-re-shrmirte Kirche des Cantons Aargau (1844); Ueber den Kirchengesang der Protestanten (1846); Trostlieder (1852); Der Junge Deutsch-Michel (1846); Reimsprüche aus Staat, Schtde, und Kirche (1820). An edition of his collected works, in 5 vols., was published in 1853. Fröhlich is best known for his two heroic poems, Ulrich Zwingli and Ulrich von Hutten, and especially for his fables, which have been ranked with those of Hagedorn, Lessing, and Gellert.
