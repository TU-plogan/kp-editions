FEJÉR, Gyorgy (1766-1851), one of the most indefatigable Hungarian authors of the last generation, was born on the 23d April 1766, at Keszthely, in the county of Zala. After finishing his scholastic course at the gymnasium he went to Pesth, where he attended the philosophical lectures at the university. From 1785 to 1790 he studied theology at Pressburg, after which he was engaged for some time as a private family tutor. From 1802 to 1804 he taught dogmatic theology at Stuhlweissenburg, where he for many years officiated as priest; and in 1808 he obtained a theological professorship at Pesth university. Ten years later (1818) he became chief director of the educational circle of Raab, and in 1824 was appointed librarian to the university of Pesth. Fejér was the most prolific of Hungarian authors,—his works, which are nearly all written either in Latin or Hungarian, exceeding 180 in number. They treat [9:9:65] of numerous subjects, and are of various sizes, from mere pamphlets to several volumes. His most important work, Codex diplomaticus Hungarioe ecclesiasticus ac civilis, published from 1829 to 1844, in eleven so-called tomes, really exceeds forty volumes. It consists of old documents and charters from 104 a.d. to the end of 1439, and forms an extraordinary monument of patient industry. This work and many others relating to Hungarian national history have placed Fejér in the foremost rank of Hungarian historians. He died on the 2d July 1851. His latest works were A Kuηok eredete {The Origin of the Huns), and A politikai forradalmak okai (The Causes of Political Revolutions), both published in 1850. The latter production, on account of its liberal tendencies, was suppressed by the Austrian Government.
