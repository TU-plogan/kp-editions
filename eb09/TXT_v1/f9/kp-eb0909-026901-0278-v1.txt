FISHING-FROG, also Frog-fish or Sea-devil (Lophius piscatorius), a fish well known off the coasts of Great Britain and Europe generally, the grotesque shape of its body and its singular habits having attracted the attention of naturalists of all ages. Its head is of enormous size, broad, flat, and depressed, the remainder of the body appearing merely like an appendage. The wide mouth extends all round the anterior circumference of the head; and both jaws are armed with bands of long pointed teeth, which are inclined inwards, and can be depressed so as to offer no impediment to an object gliding towards the stomach, but to prevent its escape from the mouth. The pectoral and ventral fins are so articulated as to perform the functions of feet, the fish being enabled to move, or rather to walk, on the bottom of the sea, where it generally hides itself in the sand or amongst sea-weed. All round its head and also along the body the skin bears fringed appendages resembling short fronds of sea-weed, a structure which, combined with the extraordinary faculty of assimilating the colour of the body to its surroundings, assists this fish greatly in concealing itself in places which it selects on account of the abundance of prey. To render the organization of this creature perfect in relation to its wants, it is provided with three long filaments inserted along the middle of the head, which are, in fact, the detached and modified three first spines of íhe anterior dorsal fin. The filament most important in the economy of the fishing-frog is the first, which is the longest, terminates in a lappet, and is movable in every direction. There is no doubt that the fishing-frog, like many other fish provided with similar appendages, plays with this filament as with a bait, attracting fishes, which when sufficiently near, are engulphed by the simple act of the fishing-frog opening its gape. Its stomach is distensible in an extraordinary degree, and not rarely fishes have been taken out quite as large and heavy as their destroyer. It grows to a length of more than 5 feet; specimens of 3 feet are common. Young individuals are somewhat dissimilar in shape to old ones, and arc provided with more numerous and longer appendages and filaments. The British species is found all round the coasts of Europe and western North America, but becomes scarce beyond 60° N. lat.; it occurs also on the coasts of the Cape of Good Hope. A second species (Lophius budegassd) inhabits the Mediterranean, and a third (Z. setigerus) the coasts of China and Japan.
