FAUCHER, Leon (1803-1854), a French statesman and political economist, was of Jewish extraction, and was born at Limoges 8th September 1803. His parents afterwards removed to Toulouse, and he found the means of supporting himself by the execution of designs for embroidery while attending the college of that place. From Toulouse he went to Paris, where for a short period he followed the profession of private tutor; but on the outbreak of the revolution of 1830 he became immersed in the political struggles of the time and a contributor to the political journals. In 1833 and 1834 he was editor of the Constitutionnel, after which he joined the staff of the Courier, and in 1839 became its editor. In politics he belonged to the party known as the dynastic left, and he was frequently consulted by the Thiers ministry of 1840. In 1842 the Courier changed hands, and on its new proprietors wishing slightly to modify its principles, Faucher resigned the editorship, and from that time devoted his attention almost exclusively to questions of political economy. In 1843 he visited England with the view of studying the social aspects of that country, and in October of the same year he began a series of articles in the Revue des Deux Mondes, recording the impressions made by his visit. These papers, though not altogether free from the defects incident to the imperfect knowledge of a foreigner, are characterized not less by shrewdness of observation than by able statement and illustration of economical principles, and form an important contribution towards the solution of the great social questions of the time. Shortly after this he became one of the editors of the Journal des économistes, to the pages of which he contributed several valuable papers, more especially on the tariff of customs. He also took a prominent part in the organization of the French association on the model of the free-trade league of England, but on account of the extreme opinions of the majority of its members he soon resigned his connexion with it. In 1846, chiefly on account of his advocacy of free-trade doctrines, he was elected member of the chamber of deputies for Rheims, and in the chamber he took a leading part in the discussion of all economical and financial questions. After the revolution of 1848 he became a member of the new assembly for the department of Marne, and in December of the same year he was named minister of public works, and a little later minister of the interior; but he was compelled through the opposition manifested to his measures by the extreme republicans to resign his office 14th May 1849. On 10th April 1851 he again accepted the same office from Louis Napoleon, then president of the republic, but when Napoleon resolved to appeal to universal suffrage Faucher again resigned; and after the coup d , etat he also refused to become a member of the constitutional commission instituted by the emperor. The occurrence of an affection of the throat which gradually assumed an alarming form induced him to pass the summer of 1854 in different parts of the Pyrenees. He had resolved to remain in Italy over the winter, but in November business affairs called him to Paris, and on his way back to Italy he was seized at Marseilles by typhoid fever, and died 14th December. During his whole political career Faucher maintained his probity unsullied, and in very difficult circumstances held with unswerving steadfastness to the path pointed out to him by convictions which were formed solely by a scientific study of political problems and an unprejudiced regard for the welfare of the human race. His economical writings are characterized by clearness of statement, fulness of information, incisiveness of reasoning, and firm grasp of principles. In relation to the cause of free trade in France he [9:9:52] occupies, more than any other Frenchman, a position analogous to that occupied by Cobden in relation to the same cause in England; and perhaps both by his writings and by his former relations with Napoleon he had no small share, though an indirect and posthumous one, in bringing about the commercial treaty which through the intervention of Cobden was effected between the two countries in 1860.

The principal writings of Faucher were contributed to the Revue des Deux Momies, ana were published posthumously in 2 vols, under the title Mélanges d’économie politique et de finance, 1856. Among his other writings the principal are Recherches sur l'or et sur l’argent, considérés comme étalons de la valeur, 1843, and Études sur l’Angleterre, 2 vois., 1845. The former work and a portion of the latter have been translated into English. A short biography of Faucher, by Léonce de Lavergne, is contained in the Revue des Deux Mondes for January 1855.
