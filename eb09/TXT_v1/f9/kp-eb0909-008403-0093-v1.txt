FERDINAND (1721-1792), duke of Brunswick, a famous Prussian general, the fourth son of Duke Ferdinand Albert of Brunswick, was born at Brunswick, 11th January 1721. He was educated for the military profession, and having entered the Prussian service, commanded a regiment in the first and second Silesian wars. On the outbreak of the Seven Years’ War he was appointed to the command of a division, and he greatly contributed to the victory of Prague in 1757. He shortly afterwards received from George II. of England the supreme command of the allied forces, and for five years, by his energy, rapidity of movement, and masterly strategy, succeeded, notwithstanding the fewness of his troops and their very mixed and heterogeneous composition, in holding at bay both the large imperial army and several French armies much better organized and officered than his own. On the 1st of August 1759 he gained a brilliant victory over Marshal Coutades at Minden. In 1766 an estrangement occurred between Ferdinand and Frederick the Great, in consequence of which he retired from the military profession, and passed the remainder of his life at his castle cf Veschelde, where he occupied himself in building and other improvements, and became a patron of learning and art, and a great benefactor of the poor. He died 3d July 1792.
