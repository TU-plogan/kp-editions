FLACCUS, Caius Valerius, a Roman poet of the first century of the empire, of whose personal history little or nothing is known, He has been identified, but on wholly insufficient grounds, with the Flaccus, a poet friend of Martial, to whom the 77th epigram of the 1st book is addressed, and hence described as a native of Padna, and in needy circumstances. In the subscription of the Vatican [9:9:275] MS. the names Setinus Balbus are appended, whence it is probable that he was born at Setia in Campania. The sole notice of him found in classical authors is a short sentence of Quintilian (Inst., x. 1, 90), “Multum in Valerio Flacco nuper amisimus,” whence we gather that he must have died before 90 A.D., though it does not follow, as is commonly stated, that he was cut off by an untimely death. If we turn for information to his only known work, the Argonautica, we learn from the dedication, which is addressed to Vespasian, that it was written during the siege or shortly after the fall of Jerusalem, 70 a.d. The Argonautica is an epic on the quest of the golden fleece The poem is unfinished, the eighth book terminating abruptly with the request of Medea to accompany Jason on his homeward voyage. It is a free imitation and in parts a translation of the work of Apollonius of Rhodes, which had already been made familiar to the Romans by the popular version of Varro Atacinus. Various estimates have been formed of the genius of Flaccus, and some competent critics, such as Scaliger, Heinsius,and Weichart, have ranked him above his original. His diction is pure, his style correct, his versification smooth though monotonous, and he has some descriptive power, as is shown in the storm of the eighth book, and the picture of the dragon lulled to sleep by Medea’s charms. On the other hand, he is wholly without originality, and his poetry reads as if made to order. It is free from glaring defects, but is rendered all but worthless by its monotony, artificiality, and elaborate dulness. He deserves, no less than Silius Italicus, to be called the ape of Virgil. One instance will suffice to show how he has vulgarized the great poet. The desertion of Hypsipyle by Jason in the second book is closely modelled on the desertion of Dido by AEneas, but instead of “Si quis mihi parvulus aula luderet Aeneas,” we have “Per hunc utero quem linquis Iasonanostro”; instead of “Quemsese ore gerens,” <fcc,, “Tales humeros ea terga relinquit.” The corruptions of the text, and the obscurity of the mythological and geographical allusions, have attracted commentators and critics, but few except professed scholars will care to read a second-rate copy of a second-rate poet.

Bibliography.— The Argonautica was unknown till the first three books and half of the fourth were discovered by Poggio at St Gall when attending the council of Constance. The editio princeps was published at Bologna, 1474, from the Vatican MS. 3277. Among other editions we may mention Burmann’s Variorum, Leyden, 1724; J. A. Wagner’s, Göttingen, 1805; G. Thilo’s, Halle, 1863 (the first careful collation of the Vatican MS.); C. SchenkΓs, Berlin, 1871; and the 8tlι book annotated by A. Weichert, Meissen, 1817. There are translations into French prose by J. J. A. Caussin de Perceval in the Bibliothèque Latine-Française ; into French verse by Dureau de la Malle, Paris, 1811; and into Spanish verse by D. J. de Leon Bendicho y Quilty, Madrid, 1868; into Italian by Pindemonte, Verona, 1776; into German by Wunderlich, Erfurt, 1805. Warton speaks doubtfully of an English version: “We seem to have had a version of Valerius Flaccus in 1565; for in that year, I know not if in verse or prose, was entered to Pursoote ‘ The story of Jason, how he gotte the golden flece, and how he did begyle Media, out of Latin into Englische, by Nycholas Whyte.’” The book is not recorded by Watt, nor is it in the British Museum.
