FOWLER, William (c. 1560-1614), one of the poets who frequented the court of James VI. before his accession to the throne of England, was born about the year 1560. After attending St Leonard’s College, St Andrews, between 1573-74 and 1578, he seems to have selected the legal profession, and in 1580, when about twenty years of age, he was at Paris studying the civil law. He subsequently became private secretary and master of requests to Anne of Denmark, wife of James VI. On the occasion of the baptism of Prince Henry on 30th August 1594, the preparation of the pageants exhibited “was by the king’s majesty committed to the lord of Lindores and Mr William Fowler”; and the description of these “rareshows and singular inventions” was published at the time. The sister of Fowler, Susannah, was married to Sir John Drummond, Knight, and gentleman usher of the black rod, and was mother of the celebrated poet Drummond of Hawthornden. On the title of some of his works Fowler styles himself P. of Hawick, thus indicating that he was parson or rector of Hawick. He is frequently styled Sir William Fowler, but there is no evidence that he was ever knighted. That Fowler was a man of very superior literary merit is evinced by his works, which are still preserved. The first of these is a collection of sonnets entitled The Tarantula of Love; the other is a translation from the Italian of the Triumphs of Petrarch. These two manuscripts were presented by his nephew, Drummond of Hawthornden, to the library of the university of Edinburgh in 1626, and it is understood both will shortly be published. Fowler was a great favourite at court. He prefixed a panegyrical sonnet to The Furies, a composition of James VI., while the king in return performed a similar office for his Triumphs of Petrarch, in a strain of versification which for vigour and fluency was vastly superior to his common style. Besides the above, two volumes of his manuscript notes, scrolls of poems, <fcc., are preserved among the Drummond MSS., in the library of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. Specimens of Fowler’s verses were published in 1823 by Leyden in his Scottish Descriptive Poems, and are also to be found in other collections illustrating the poetry of the period.
