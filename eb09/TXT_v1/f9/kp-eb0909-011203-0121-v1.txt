+=====================================================================+


FESCH, Joseph (1763-1839), cardinal, archbishop of Lyons, was born at Ajaccio, in Corsica, January 3, 1763, six years before the island was conquered by the French. His father, Francis Fesch, of Basel, was a Swiss officer in the service of Genoa, who had married as his second wife a young widow, the mother of Letizia Bonaparte. Joseph Fesch was thus half-brother to Letizia, and uncle to her son Napoleon Bonaparte. He was educated at the seminary of Aix in Provence, took holy orders, and became archdeacon and provost of the chapter of Ajaccio. When the French Revolution broke out, and the chapters were suppressed, Fesch protested against the civil constitution of the clergy, and laid aside his clerical dress. In 1793 he had to quit Corsica, followed the Bonapartes to Toulon, and obtained a post in the army administration. In 1795 he was named commissary of war in the army of Italy, of which his nephew Napoleon Bonaparte became commanderin-chief. After the 18th Brumaire (November 9, 1799) he resumed his ecclesiastical functions, and took part in the negotiations which led up to the concordat of 1801. In the following year he was consecrated archbishop of Lyons, and early in 1803 received a cardinal’s hat. · Napoleon having been proclaimed emperor, and desiring to be crowned at Paris by the pope, Cardinal Fesch was sent as ambassador to Rome to treat with Pius VII. respecting this project. He was received with much distinction, won the pope’s good opinion, and brought the negotiations to a successful issue. On this occasion the cardinal had for his secretary the viscount de Châteaubriand, who had just made himself famous by the publication of his Génie du Christianisme. The association, however, was not a happy one. Cardinal Fesch accompanied Pius VII. to Paris, and took part in all the ceremonies of the coronation of his uncle. In reward for his services at Rome he - was made grand-almoner of France, grand-cordon of the Legion of Honour, and senator. In 1806 he was chosen coadjutor and successor of Dalberg, prince-primate of the confederation of the Rhine, and arch-chancellor of the empire, and received a large annual subvention. The dissensions which continued between Napoleon and the holy see made the cardinal’s position a very difficult one; but he resisted the violent measures taken by the emperor against the pope; and when, in 1809, the emperor desired to have one of his kindred head of the French church, and offered to Fesch the archbishopric of Paris, he declined the offer. He refused even to accept the administration of the diocese. As president of the national ecclesiastical council held at Paris in 1810, he boldly put forward views which gave offence to the emperor and lost him his favour. He was sent back to his diocese, and in consequence of his letter to the pope, then at Fontainebleau, he was deprived of his subvention. In 1814 he withdrew to Rome, but returned to France and his see during the Hundred Days. He was created a peer, but never sat in the chamber. After Waterloo he returned to Rome, and there spent the remaining years of his life in the enjoyment of his vast wealth and his accumulated arttreasures. He died at Rome, May 13, 1839. His correspondence with Napoleon was published by Du Casse in 1855.
