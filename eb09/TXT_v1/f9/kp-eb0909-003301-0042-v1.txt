The râjâ’s military force consists of 200 cavalry, 600 infantry and police, and 3 field guns. During the Sikh wars in 1845 the chief exerted himelf in the English cause, and was rewarded with the title of Râjâ and an increase of territory. In the mutiny of 1857, too, he did good servies by guarding the Sutlej ferries, and in attacking a notorious rebel, whose stronghold he destroyed.
