FONTAINE, Pierre François Léonard (1762-1853), French architect, was born at Pontoise, September 20, 1762. He was of a family several of whose members had distinguished themselves as architects, and he early showed the taste and the ability which promised to revive in his person the family distinction. Leaving the college of Pontoise at the age of sixteen he was sent to L’Isle-Adam, to assist in hydraulic works undertaken by the architect André. To facilitate his improvement André allowed him to have access to his plans and to copy his designs. At this time he formed a friendship with another young student of his art, Thibaut, whose passion quickened his own. In October 1779 he was sent to Paris to study in the school of Peyre the younger, and there began his acquaintance with Percier, which ripened into a life-long friendship. After six years of study he competed for a prize at the Academy, and, winning the second, received a pension and was sent to Rome (1785). Percier accompanied him. The Revolution breaking out soon after his return to France, he took refuge in England; but after ths establishment of the consulate, [9:9:363] he was employed by Bonaparte to restore the palace of Malmaison, Henceforth he was fully engaged in the principal architectural works executed in Paris, as architect successively to Napoleon I., Louis XVIII., and Louis Philippe. In conjunction with Percier (till his death) he was employed on the Arch of the Carrousel, the restoration of the Palais-Royal, the grand staircase of the Louvre, and the works projected for the union of the Louvre and the Tuileries. In 1812 he was admitted a member of the Academy of Fine Arts, and in 1813 was named first architect to the emperor. With Percier he published the following works,— Palais, Maisons, et autres Édifices Modernes dessinés à Rome (1798); Description des Fêtes et Cérémonies du Mariage de Napoléon et de Marie Louise (1810); and Recueil de Décorations Intérieures (1812). Fontaine lost his friend and associate Percier in 1838, and died himself at Paris, October 10, 1853.
