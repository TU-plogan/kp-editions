FENNEL (Foeniculum), a genus of umbelliferous plants, having umbels compound, and without involucres; petals yellow, entire, roundish, and incurved at the tip; and fruit a laterally compressed cremocarp, with achene 5-ridged, a large, single vitta under each furrow, and albumen planoconvex. (See Botany, vol. iv. p. 150, fig. 292; and p. 151, fig. 299.) Common Fennel, F. vulgare, Gärtn. (Anethum Foeniculum, L.), to which the other forms of fennel are generally referred, is a perennial from 2 to 3 or, when cultivated, 4 feet in height, having leaves three or four times pinnate, with numerous linear or awl-shaped segments, and umbels glaucous, and of about 15 or 20 rays. The plant appears to be of South European origin, but is now met with in various parts of Britain and the rest of temperate Europe, and in the west of Asia. The fruits have an aromatic taste and odour, and are used for the preparation of oil of fennel and fennel water, valued for their stimulant and carminative properties. The fruits and edible shoots of fennel were eaten by the ancient Romans. The fennel seeds of commerce are of several sorts. Sweet or Roman Fennel seeds are the produce of a tall perennial plant, with umbels of 25-30 rays, which is cultivated near Nismes in the south of France; they are elliptical and arched in form, about f inch long and a quarter as broad, and are smooth externally, and of a colour approaching a pale green. Shorter and straighter fruits are obtained from the annual variety of F. vulgare known as F. Panmorium (Panmuhuη) or Indian Fennel, and are employed in India in curries, and for medicinal purposes. Other kinds are the German or Saxon fruits, brownish-green in colour, and between ⅜ and ⅛ inch in length, and the broader but smaller fruits of the Wild or Bitter Fennel of the south of France. A variety of fennel, F. dulce, having the stem compressed at the base, and the umbel 6-8 rayed, is grown in kitchen-gardens for the sake of its leaves. Giant Fennel is the name applied to the plant Ferula communis, common in Sicily, where the pith of the stem is used as tinder. Hog’s or Sow Fennel is the species Peucedanum officinale.
