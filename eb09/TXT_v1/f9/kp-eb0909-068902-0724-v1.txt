FRANCIS I. (1494-1547), king of France, son of Charles of Orleans, count of Angoulême, and Louisa of Savoy, was born at Cognac 12th September 1494. As heir-presumptive of the throne of France, he received special favours from Louis XII., who created him duke of Valois and in 1512 gave him the command of the army of Navarre. In this position, though achieving no important results, he conducted himself with such prudence and courage that in 1513 he was appointed to the command of the army in Picardy, where he successfully carried out the plan of defensive operations that was entrusted to him. He married Claude daughter of Louis XII. in 1514, and succeeded him on the throne 1st January 1515. After his accession the first and great object that occupied his ambition was the recovery of Milan, the inheritance of which he claimed through his great-grandmother Valentina Visconti. Accordingly, while, in order to render himself secure against external attacks, he negotiated an alliance with Charles of Austria, afterwards the emperor Charles V., and the renewal of a treaty concluded by Louis XII. with Henry VIII. of England, he also began to collect his forces for an Italian expedition. The politic negotiations which won him Genoa, the acquisition of which was all-important as commanding the connexion between Milan and the sea, placed the purpose of his preparations beyond all doubt, and caused Leo X. to unite in an alliauce against him with the Spaniards and the Swiss. The Swiss at once occupied all the mountain passes; but Francis, guided by a Piedmontese peasant, succeeded after great labour and difficulty in leading his army over the Alps by a pass deemed impracticable, and, descending into the friendly territories of the marquis of Saluzzo, surprised and routed at Villa Franca Colonna the general of the papal cavalry, and thus outflanking the Swiss caused them to fall back upon Milan. Completely disconcerted by the sudden movement, they at first actually entered into negotiations for a truce; but receiving shortly afterwards a reinforcement of troops and their arrears of pay, they endeavoured to surprise the French at Marignane. This battle, begun on the 13th September 1515, prolonged into the night, and renewed on the following morning, was fought on both sides with furious and stubborn courage; but on the arrival of Λlviano the Venetian commander to the succour of Francis, the Swiss [9:9:690] retreated unpursued to Milan. Shortly afterwards Milan surrendered, and in November a treaty was concluded between Francis and the Swiss, which subsequently took the form of a perpetual alliance. Such rapid and brilliant success at once gave Francis a position of commanding influence, and enabled him still further to strengthen himself by additional advantageous treaties. In 1516, he compromised the long dispute with the popes by superseding the Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges by a “Concordat,” an act which, while it recognized the superiority of the pope over the councils, and gave him the command of the annates and other rich sources of revenue, entrusted the French monarch with the power of nominating to vacant benefices. In 1517 he entered into an alliance with the emperor Maximilian and Charles I. of Spain against the Turks; and in 1518he made an arrangement with Henry VIII. of England, by which France bought back Tournay.

On the death of Maximilian in 1519, Francis became a .candidate for the imperial crown; but chiefly through the recommendation of Frederick the Wise of Saxony the choice fell on Charles I. of Spain, from that time known as Charles V. The success of Charles was prophetic of the relative positions which the two rivals were thenceforth to occupy, for the resolute and persevering ambition of the emperor, and his hitherto wholly unsuspected abilities both in war and in diplomacy, were to prove themselves more than a match for the headstrong valour and showy accomplishments of the French monarch. War between them could scarcely have been avoided, even if the materials for kindling it had not been already prepared; but inherited disputes in regard to Navarre, Milan, Burgundy, and Arles would in any case have sooner or later rendered an appeal to the decision of the sword almost inevitable. With a view to such possibilities, the great aim of both was to secure the alliance of Henry of England and the pope, and here fortune again ultimately smiled on Charles. Francis, elated by his previous achievements on the battlefield, and chagrined at the overthrow of his hopes of obtaining the imperial crown, was naturally eager to strike the first blow; and the request of Henry IT. of Navarre to aid him in regaining his kingdom came opportunely to second his wishes. Accordingly, in April 1521 he sent an army to the aid of Henry. Charles at once retaliated by an invasion of France, and in May concluded a treaty with Pope Leo X. for the expulsion of the French from Italy. Navarre after beingalmost won was again lost by Henry; and in Italy the French, chiefly through the blunders of Lautrec, the brother of the king’s mistress, lost Milan, Genoa, and all their conquests with the exception of the stronghold of Cremona; but the attempt of the imperialists to enter France was pushed back, and Francis, following in pursuit, only by unaccountable negligence missed the opportunity of inflicting a crushing defeat on Charles between Cambray and Valenciennes. After this, difficulties continued to thicken round the French king; on the 9th January 1522 the papal throne was mounted by Adrian VI., who had formerly been tutor to Charles V., and in May Henry VIII. declared war against France; in August 1523 a coalition was formed against her which included the pope, the emperor, the king of England, the archduke of Austria, the duke of Milan, and the principal Italian republics; and about the same time Charles Constable Bourbon, having been unjustly used by Louise of Savoy, withdrew from France, and offered his sword to Charles V. The Spanish troops crossed the French frontiers at Bayonne; the English entered Picardy, and advanced to within 11 leagues of Paris; and after the repulse of the French army despatched against Milan, the imperialists passed over into Provence and laid siege to Marseilles. Through cautious but stubbornly defensive tactics, however, both the Spanish and English incursions were foiled, and Francis was thus able to advance to the relief of Marseilles with a large army. The imperialists did not wait his approach; but, determined on retaliation, he crossed the Alps and laid siege to Pavia, where a strong Italian force had taken refuge. Here he was attacked, 24th February 1525, by a relieving army under Bourbon and Pescara. The attack was unsuccessful; but, flushed with the victory which he believed already in his grasp, he rashly left his impregnable position, and so blundered in his manoeuvres as to render his overwhelming defeat inevitable. His army was speedily either cut down or dispersed in flight, and he himself, after a desperate attempt to rally, was made prisoner and conveyed by Charles to Madrid. He only regained his liberty, 21st February 1526, by signing a treaty whereby he ceded to Charles both Burgundy and Milan. Its stipulations were guaranteed by the retention of his two sons in the emperor’s hands; but he nevertheless resolved to disregard it, and in this he was supported by Pope Clement VII. and also by Henry of England, whom jealousy and alarm at the emperor’s success had induced to change sides. Though formal war was not declared, a French army was despatched to Italy, but the supineness with which the campaign was prosecuted enabled the imperialists to have it all their own way; and an army of mercenaries under Bourbon, who perished in the assault, marching unopposed to Rome, captured and sacked the city, and took the pope prisoner. On this Francis and Henry at once declared war against the emperor; but the army sent into Italy under Lautrec almost melted away before the walls of Naples; and Genoa, by suddenly declaring for the emperor, completed the ruin of the French cause in Italy. The pope soon thereafter saw it to be his interest to be reconciled with Charles; and in August 1529, Charles andFrancis agreed to the treaty of Cambray,by which Francis retained Burgundy and obtained by a ransom the release of the French princes, but renounced his claims in Italy and ceded Artois and Flanders to his rival. He also agreed to fulfil the promise entered into at Madrid to marry Eleanor of Portugal, sister of Charles, ħis first wife having died in 1524. During the years of peace that followed this treaty, Francis, though he had encouraged the Smalkald League in Germany, persecuted with great vigour the adherents of Protestantism in his own kingdom; but when war was again declared, he issued an edict of toleration. The pretext for the renewal of the war was the murder of the French ambassador by Duke Sforza of Milan in 1533, but hostilities were delayed till 1535, when, emboldened by the weakened condition of the emperor after his war against the Turks, Francis overran Savoy and took possession of Turin. His advantages were, however, followed up with so little energy that Charles, after driving the French out of Italy, began an invasion of Provence; and his progress was only checked by the barbarous destruction of the country before him by Anne of Montmorency.- Meantime Francis attacked Flanders, and entered into an alliance with Sultan Soliman II., whose invasion of Hungary induced Charles in 1538 to consent to the ten years’ truce of Nice. In 1540 Charles, while the guest of the French monarch, held out to him the hope of a complete satisfaction of his wishes through the investiture of the duke of Orleans with the duchy of Milan; but the promise, if definitely made, was never fulfilled, and Francis, finding a favourable opportunity after the disastrous issue of the emperor’s expedition against Algiers, renewed on a flimsy pretext the war in 1542. An offensive alliance was formed with the Turks, the duke of Cleves, and Denmark and Sweden; separate armies attacked at various points the Spanish, Flemish, and Italian frontiers; and the united French and Turkish forces captured and burned Nice. The monotony of the indecisive conflict was relieved in April 1544 by a brilliant French victory at Ceresole, but the success came [9:9:691] too late to permit of its being followed up by an advance into Italy; for in the July following, the emperor from Champagne and the king of England from Picardy were marching to join their forces before the w alls of Paris. The siege of Boulogne by the English gave Francis, however, sufficient time to make a show of defence such as convinced Charles of the doubtful nature of the enterprise; and without consulting the king of England he sent to Francis from Crespy terms of peace, which were signed 17th September. By this treaty France retained Burgundy and resigned its claims on Flanders, Artois, and Naples, while the duchy of Milan was promised to the duke of Orleans on his marrying one of the imperial princesses—an arrangement, however, which his death in 1545 rendered nugatory. For some time afterwards the English king continued the war in Picardy, but a treaty of peace was signed in June 1546. As soon as peace was concluded with the emperor, the prosecution of the Protestants in France was renewed, and in 1545 an edict was passed for the expulsion of the Waldenses from Provence. The health of Francis had for several years been completely undermined, and he succumbed to an acute attack of disease, 31st May 1547.

In the reign of Francis were combined most of the faults and excellences which have been specially prominent in the subsequent history of his country. He was in a sense the creator of a new political and intellectual era. As regards government, he was virtually the founder of the “ancient régime,” whose final result and overthrow was the great Revolution; he gave its death blow to feudalism; he deprived the parlements of all independent power; under the auspices of the minister Du Prat he confirmed and extended the system of corruption in civil and ecclesiastical appointments; and he turned the efforts of statesmanship away from the paths of constitutional progress, and into those of military renown. His reign in its social and intellectual results was more beneficial, for if he sanctioned by his example licentiousness of manners, he at the same time gave a great impulse to refinement in taste and to intellectual progress by fostering in his country the offshoots of the Italian Renaissance. He founded in 1530 the college of France for the study of the three languages; he was himself a writer of verses, and a special friend and benefactor of artists and men of letters; and by the purchase of the great masterpieces of Italian painting and sculptur'^., and in the magnificent structures of Chamford, Azai-le-Redeau, Amboise, and Fontainebleau he left behind him a permanent influence on French art. Compared with his great rival Charles V., he was open, impulsive, and generous, but he was less actuated by consistent principles; he was hopelessly inferior in diplomacy, and in sagacity and comprehensiveness of purpose; he had perhaps equal abilities as a general, but his occasional victories were more than counterbalanced by the results of his own indolence and by the blunders of his subordinates; and while able to defend France against all external attacks, he was compelled to content himself with a place second to that of the emperor in the sphere of European politics.
