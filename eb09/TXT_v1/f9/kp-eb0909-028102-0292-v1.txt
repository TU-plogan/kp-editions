FLAHAUT DE LA BILLARDERIE, Auguste Charles Joseph, Comte de (1785-1870), a French general and diplomatist, was bom in Paris on the 21st of April 1785. His father, a field marshal in the royal army, succeeded Buffon as intendant of the royal gardens, and was guillotined at Arras in 1793. His mother, an ingenious and elegant novel-writer, known as Madame de Souza, from the name of her second husband, the Portuguese author J. Μ. de Souza-Botelho, emigrated with him to England, and, after he had spent some time in Germany for the sake of his education, brought him back to Paris in 1798. The following year, young Flahaut, being only fifteen years of age, enlisted in a troop of volunteer cavalry, who were to accompany General Bonaparte, then first consul, to Italy. He had a brilliant career, being successively aide-de-camp to Murat, Berthier, and Napoleon. In 1813 he was first gazetted general of brigade, and then general of division, and, although already a count by birth, received a second time this title from the great soldier of fortune who sought by his simple fiat to create a new empire to be propped up by a new nobility. He was a peer of France during the Hundred Days, and supported with all his influence the project of making Marie-Louise regent, and of thus securing the imperial throne for the young king of Rome under the title of Napoleon II. On the second return of the Bourbons he left France, and lived in exile from 1815 to 1830. In England, his usual place of retreat, he married (28th July 1817) the daughter of Admiral Keith, who became an Irish peeress as Baroness Keith in 1823, and succeeded to the Scottish barony of Nairn in 1838. By her he had no sons, but several daughters, the eldest of whom married the fourth marquis of Lansdowne. After the revolution of July 1830 he returned to France, was restored to his former rank in the army, and was made a peer by the Government of Louis-Philippe. He soon became a favourite with the duke of

Orleans, the king’s eldest son, who gave him a situation of trust in his household. He also received at the same time the dignity of the grand cross of the Legion of Honour, of which he had been a commander since 1814. His services as a diplomatist were made use of more than once: he was ambassador at Berlin in 1831, and at Vienna from 1842 until the revolution of 1848. When Louis Bonaparte became Napoleon III., Flahaut de la Billarderie, whoso mother had brought up the duke of Morny, did not consider his fidelity as any longer pledged to the Orleans family, and was appointed senator (31st December 1852). Nor was this the only imperial favour he could boast of. From 1860 until 1862 he was ambassador to London, and, on the 28th of January 1864 he was promoted to the high dignity of grand chancellor of the Legion of Honour. After that time Flahaut did not play any considerable part in the management of public business. He died on the 1st of September 1870.
