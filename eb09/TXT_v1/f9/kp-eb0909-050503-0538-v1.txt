FRANCAVILLA, a town of Italy, in the province of Lecce, about 21 miles W.S.W. of Brindisi, sometimes called Francavilla Fontana, to distinguish it from Francavilla in Sicily and other towns of the same name. It stands in a very beautiful situation, and is regularly built, with wide streets and handsome if somewhat heavy looking houses. There are a cathedral, a college, and several hospitals and conventual buildings. The town was founded in the 15th century and owes its name to the freedom from taxation which was granted for ten years to all who made it their place of residence. In 1734 it suffered considerably from an earthquake. The population of the town in 1871 was 16,997, and that of the commune 19,052.
