FELLOWS, Sir Charles (1799-1860), a distinguished traveller and antiquary, was born in 1799 at Nottingham, where the family had held an ancestral estate for a considerable time. While only fourteen he drew sketches to illustrate a trip to the ruins of Newstead Abbey, which afterwards appeared on the title page of Moore’s Life of Lord Byron. In early youth he travelled through a great part of Britain, and in 1820 settled in London, where he proved an active member of the British Association for the advancement of science. In 1827 he distinguished himself as a traveller in Switzerland, and discovered the modern route to the top of Mont Blanc. After the death of his mother in 1832, he gave full scope to his natural bent, and passed the greater portion of each of the next ten years in Italy or Greece, or on the shores of the Levant. The numerous sketches he executed were largely used by Mr Murray in illustrating Childe Harold. In 1838 Fellows, induced by his passion for natural beauty and his preference of a simple peasant life to an artificial civilization, started for Asia Minor, where Smyrna was the centre of his travels. His explorations of parts of the interior and south led him to districts practically unknown to Europeans, and he thus discovered ruins of a number of ancient cities which existed earlier than 300 b.c. He entered Lycia and explored the Xanthus from the mouth at Patara upwards. Nine miles from Patara, he discovered the ruins of Xanthus, the ancient capital of Lycia, finely situated on hills, and abounding in magnificent remains. About fifteen miles further up he came upon the ruins of Tlos. After taking sketches of the most interesting objects and copying a number of inscriptions, he returned to Smyrna through Caria and Lydia. Actuated by enlightened zeal, he soon brought his discoveries before European men of letters; and the publication of A Journal written during anExcursion in Asia Minor (London, 1839) roused such strong interest in England that Lord Palmerston, at the request of the British Museum authorities, asked the English consul at Constantinople to get leave from the sultan to ship a number of the Lycian works of art. Late in 1839 Fellows, under the auspices of the British Museum, again set out for Lycia, accompanied by George Scharf, who assisted him materially in sketching. This second visit issued in the discovery of thirteen ancient cities, all enriched by works of art; and in 1841 appeared An Account of Discoveries in Lycia, being a Journal kept during a Second Excursion in A sia Minor. A third visit was made late in 1841, after Fellows had obtained the “firman” by personal application at Constantinople; and he and his party had the pleasure of pitching their tents under the town of Xanthus on the 30th of December. They shipped a number of works of art for England, and in the fourth and most famous expedition (1844) twenty-seven cases of marbles were despatched for the British Museum, where they are now to be seen in the Lycian Saloon. The most noteworthy places on which the labours of Fellows cast a flood of light are Xanthus, Pinara, Patara, Tlos, Myra, and Olympus. The theatres in Lycian towns show the influence of the Greek drama among the so-called “barbarians”; and Lycian sculpture and architecture almost rival the Greek masterpieces. The arched tombs, one of which is in the British Museum, are compared by Fellows to Gothic architecture. These tombs are very common in Lycia. At [9:9:68] Pinara, he says, “rises a singular round rocky cliff literally specked all over with tombs.” For further information about Lycia compare with the works of Fellows Leake’s Asia Minor, the Travels in Lycia of Spratt and Forbes, and Description de l'Asie Mineure by Texier. Papers on the Lycian language by Mr Daniel Sharpe arc appended to the works of Fellows. In 1844 Fellows presented to the British Museum his portfolios, accounts of his expeditions, and specimens of natural history illustrative of Lycia. In 1845 he received the order of knighthood “as an acknowledgment of his services in the removal of the Xanthian antiquities to this country.” Fellows was twice married. He died in 1860.

In addition to the works above mentioned, Fellows published the following— The Xαηthiαη Marbles; their Acquisition and Trammission to England, 1843; An Account of the Ionic Trophy Monument excavated at Xanthus, 1848; a cheap edition of his two Journals, entitled Travels and Researches in Asia Minor, particularly in the Province of Lycia, 1852; and Coins of Ancient Lycia before the Reign of Alexander; with an Essay on the Relative Dates of the Lycian Monuments in the British Museum, 1855.
