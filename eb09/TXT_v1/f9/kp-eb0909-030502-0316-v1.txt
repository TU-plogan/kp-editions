FLETCHER, Phineas (1582-c. 1665), English poet, and brother of Giles Fletcher the younger, was the eldest son of Dr Giles Fletcher. He was born at Cranbrook, in Kent, in April 1582. He was admitted a scholar of Eton, and in 1600 entered King’s College, Cambridge. In 1603 he contributed verses to Sorrow's Joy. He was in priest’s orders in 1611. In 1614 his pastoral drama of Sicelides was acted before the university. He left Cambridge to become chaplain to Sir Henry" Willoughby in 1616; the same patron presented him in 1621 with the rectory of Hilgay in Norfolk; in the same year he married. He named his eldest son Edmund, in honour, no doubt, of Edmund Spenser, for whom he preserved an intense admiration. In 1627 he published his long poem, in Latin and English, of Locustae, or the Apollyonists, a furious invective against the Jesuits. Next year appeared a fine but sensuous poem, entitled Britain's Ida, which was attributed on the title-page to Spenser; but many critics, and particularly Dr A. B. Grosart, consider it to be the work of Phineas Fletcher. The drama of Sicelides was printed in 1631. In 1632 he brought out a theological treatise in prose, entitled Joy in Tribulation, and in 1633 his magnum opus, the famous poem of The Purple Island. His Piscatory Eclogues and Miscellaneous Poems appeared on the same occasion. It is believed that in 1650 he was ejected from his living, but nothing is known of the date or circumstances of his death. In the preface to his posthumous prose work, A Father's Testament, published in 1670, he is spoken of as having been some years dead. The Purple Island, or the Isle of Man, is a poem in twelve cantos, describing in cumbrous allegory the whole physiological and intellectual construction of the human body. The veins are spoken of as rivers, the bones as mountains, and the ingenuity as well as scientific knowledge displayed is very considerable. The manner of Spenser is preserved throughout, though not so closely as to destroy the distinct flavour of original genius. The allegory itself is found very tedious and prosaic at the present day; but some of the reflective passages, and the rich, jewelled descriptions of Arcadian scenery possess living charm. Five cantos are occupied with the phenomena of the body, and seven with those of the mind. The Piscatory Eclogues have nothing to do with fishing; they are simply pastorals in the usual style, the characters being supposed to be fisherboys reposing by the river Cam. The poetry of Phineas Fletcher never approaches the occasional sublimity of that of his brother Giles; it carries the Marini manner to a still more tasteless excess; but it is generally fluent, luxurious, and lacking neither colour nor music.

A very complete edition of the poetical works of Phineas Fletcher, in 4 vols., was privately printed by Dr Grosart in 1868. It is the only careful reprint that lias been issued.
