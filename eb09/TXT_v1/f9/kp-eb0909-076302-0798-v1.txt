FREIBURG, or Fribourg (the French form of the name), a canton of Switzerland, is situated in the district to the S.E. of the Lake of Neuchâtel and the N.E. of the Lake of Geneva. At no point do its boundaries actually touch on the Lake of Geneva, but in two places they come within two or three miles of its shores. Owing to the refusal of the cantonal authorities in 1802 to incorporate the Reformed districts of Payerne and Avenches, it has a very irregular outline towards the Lake of Neuchâtel, and indeed breaks up into enclaves which are completely surrounded by the territory of Vaud or Waadt. The only other canton with which it is conterminous is Bern, which lies to the north and east. With very slight exceptions in the south the whole canton belongs to the basin not of the Rhone but of the Rhine, being traversed throughout its entire length from south to north by the Sarine or Saane, which rises in the Sanetsch in Bern and ultimately joins the Aar below Giiminen. The surface of the country has considerable variety of relief, but can hardly, in such a region as Switzerland, be described as mountainous. The canton, however, is the very heart of pastoral Switzerland, and the home of tho “ranz des vaches.” The southern portion is occupied with offshoots of the Bernese Alps,presenting such heights as the Moléson, 6578 feet; the Dent de Vüdetze or De Lys, 6609 feet; the Vanil des Arzes, 6513; the Cape au Moine, 6376; the Dent de Broc, 5986; Brenleyre, 7724; Folliéran,7685; and the Vanil Noir, 7825. The last is the highest elevation in the canton, and is situated in the south on the Bernese frontier to the right of the valley of the Sarine. The western and north-western districts belong to the system of the Jorat or Jurten, the most important massif being Mount Gibloux, which attains an altitude of 3945 feet. Besides the Sarine there are two considerable streams which flow partly through Freiburg territory,—the Singine or Sense, which, deriving one of its head streams from Freiburg and the other from Bern, forms throughout the greater part of its course the boundary between the two cantons, and the Broye or Brux, which rises in the south-west near Semsales, and after traversing the outskirts of Freiburg and Vaud enters the Lake of Morat or Murten, and thus finds its way to the Lake of Neuchâtel. There are a few small lakes in the canton, the most noteworthy being that of Seedorf, which -was lowered about 11 feet by draining operations undertaken in 1871-73 for reclaiming the marshy land around it. Mineral waters occur at Lac Noir or Schwarzsee, at Wyler-vor-Bad, at Montbarry near Gruyère, and at Bonn not far from the town of Freiburg. Out of a total area of about 340,705 acres, about 9880 may be regarded as unproductive, 57,432 are occupied by forests, upwards of 84,100 furnish pasture, 91,876 are meadow land, 104,925 are arable fields, and 675 are vineyards. The forests are of great value to the canton, firewood and timber being among its principal exports. Though the cereals are pretty extensively cultivated, the production of grain is far under the consumption. Tobacco is an important article in the commerce of the canton, and the manufacture of Kirschwasser is widely distributed. The district of Gruyère, extending from the Singine to the Veveyse, is famous for its cheese, of which upwards of 49,000 cwts. is produced annually. With the exception of tanning and straw plaiting there are no industries that give employment to any great number of people; but there are glass works at Semsales, a paper mill at Marly, and kilns for hydraulic lime at Tour de Trème and Chatel, and watches are made at Morat and Montilier. The canton is divided into seven districts or prefectures, and there are 277 communes and 118 Catholic and 8 Protestant parishes. The district of the Sarine numbers 25,544 inhabitants, and includes the capital of the canton; the district of the Singine, lying towards the east, numbers 16,375, and has its administrative centre at Tavers or Tafels; the district of the Gruyère, to the south of those already named, has 19,337 inhabitants, and includes tho chief town Bulle, with the ancient palace of the bishops of Lausanne, Tour de Trème, Vuadens, with a model cheesedairy, Gruyère, with the old manor of its counts, Marsens, the seat of the cantonal lunatic asylum, the convent of Valsainte, the monastery of Pont-Dieu, and the castle and village of Corbières; the district of the Lake numbers 14,839 inhabitants, and its chief town is Morat, the scene of the famous battle of 1476; the district of the Glane has 13,176 inhabitants, and its chief town is Romont, with an ancient castle and ramparts and towers; the district of the Broye has 13,706 inhabitants, and its chief town is Estevayer, a busy little place on the Lake of Neuchâtel, to which it sometimes gives its name; and lastly, in the far south the district of Veveyse numbers 7855, and besides its chief town, Châtel-St-Denis, contains the village of Semsales. The canton is traversed from north-east to south-west by the railway from Bern to Lausanne; another line proceeds from the town of Freiburg westward by the Lake of Neuchâtel, and a third unites Romont and Bulle. Freiburg returns, according to its population, six representatives tó the national council of Switzerland. Its own administration consists of a great council, to which a member is furnished by every 1200 inhabitants, a state council of seven members, and a judicial council of nine. According to the census of 1870, out of a total population of 110,900, 94,000 were Catholics and 16,800 Protestants, the latter being most numerous in tho district of the Lake. The Catholics [9:9:764] are under the jurisdiction of the bishop of Lausanne, who has his residence at Freiburg. Though the official language is French, which is generally spoken in the towns, public documents are also published in German, which holds its ground in the district of the Singine, in part of the district of the Lake, and in the commune of Bellegarde in Gruyère. In the rest of Gruyère, as well as in the districts of the Veveyse, the Glane, the Sariue, and the Broye, a patois of the French stock is the prevailing speech.

History.— The history of Freiburg practically begins with the counts of Zahringen, who, under the emperors, held considerable possessions in this part of Switzerland. In 1179 Berthold IV. founded the town of Freiburg, as his uncle Berthold III. had already been the founder of Freiburg in the Breisgau, and as his son and successor was not long afterwards to be the founder of Bern. He not only bestowed on it all the territory which he held for three leagues round—a district afterwards known as the t ‘ old lands,” or the “twenty-four parishes,” but he also, by a charter or Handfeste, granted a number of privileges similar to those of Cologne, which in that unsettled period soon attracted what was then a considerable population of artisans, peasants, and traders from the neighbouring countries. On the death of Berthold V., the last duke of Záhringen, in 1218, his possessions passed to his sister Anne, wife of Ulrich of Kyburg; aud the Kyburgs were accordingly lords of Freiburg till 1264, when they also became extinct in the male line. Anne of Kyburg, who had married Eberhard of Hapsburg, sold Freiburg to Rudolph of Hapsburg for 3000 marks; and thus the town was subject to the house of Austria for 188 years. During that long period it had to fight many a battle for its existence, more especially against the neighbouring town of Bern and the counts of Savoy. At length abandoned by Austria, it was obliged in 1452 to swear fidelity to Louis of Savoy, to whom it had become indebted for vast sums of money. In spite of all the difficulties of its position, it was in this first part of tne 15th century that it maintained a considerable trade with France, Italy, and Venice in its leather and cloth. As many as 18,000 or 20,000 pieces of cloth were stamped with the town’s seal in the course of a year. The reign of the Savoy dynasty was of short duration, for when Yolande, widow of Amadeus, entered into alliance with Charles the Bold of Burgundy, Freiburg joined Bern against the Burgundians, and took part in the battles of Morat and Grandson. At length, in the diet of Stanz in 1481—thanks mainly to the advocacy of Brother Claus (Nicholas von der Fliιh)—it was admitted a member of the Swiss Confederation. Considerable additions of territory were effected in the 15th and 16th centuries. In 1475 Illens, Planfayon, and the castle of Chenaux were acquired, aud, along with the Bernese, the people of Freiburg wrested Morat from the house of Savoy. In 1478 the lordship of Montagny was purchased for 6700 florins, and in 1482 Farvagny and Pont. Bellegarde was added in 1502, Wallenbuch in 1504, Font in 1508, and in the course of 1536 Vuippens, Estevayer, Corserey, Bulle, Vuissens, Châtel St Denis, Bossonnens, Surpierre, Romont, Rue, La Molière, and St Aubin. Corbières was bought for 8000 florins in 1553; and in 1555 Bern and Freiburg forced Michel, the last count of Gruyère, to abdicate, and paid 80,500 crowns for his countship. The people of Freiburg had to endure very heavy taxation to raise their proportion of the sum. Meanwhile, in the 16th century, the original democratic government gave place to an exclusive oligarchy, which succeeded in maintaining its supremacy in spite of the pretensions of the papal power and the bishop of Lausanne on the one hand, and the dissatisfaction of the people on the other. The French occupation of 1798 brought its government to a close; but in 1814 it was partially restored, 108 of the 144 seats of the great council being assigned to members of the patrician families. On December 2, 1830, the people rose and demanded equality of rights for all the citizens of the canton; and in January 1831 a democratic constitution was drawn up, and a representative government established. In 1846 Freiburg joined the Sonderbund, and in the following year it was consequently invaded by the federal forces. In 1848 the.constitution was revised and rendered more liberal in regard to religious matters. Several attempts were made by the Catholic party to recover their supremacy; but their efforts were defeated, and Bishop Marilley and other of their leaders were exiled. In 1857, however, the great council decided for another revision of the constitution in a reactionary sense, and their proposal was adopted by the people. Since then there has been no alteration of the general tendency, and the Catholic clergy are in possession of unbounded influence.

Freiburg, the chief town of the above canton, with a station on the line between Bern and Geneva, occupies a highly picturesque situation in the valley of the Sarine, part of it lying in the bottom of the ravine and part of it climbing the irregular eminences on the left. It is divided into four districts—the Bourg or central town, the Quartier des Places or the upper town, and the districts of the Ange and the Neuveville, which, together with the Planche, constitute the lower town. The principal ecclesiastical building of Freiburg, the collegiate church of St Nicholas, commenced about 1283 and finished in the second half of the 15th century, is worthy of notice, not only for the noble belfry 245 feet in height, but also for the organ, which was constructed between 1824 and 1834 by Aloys Mooser, a native of the town, and is one of the most famous instruments of its kind. The various buildings belonging to the municipal and cantonal Governments, the conventual establishments of the Cordeliers, the Ursuline nuns, and other fraternities and sisterhoods, the college of St Michel and the lyceum, with the cantonal museum, and the civic hospital and other beneficent institutions are the most important of the public edifices. In front of the town-hall grows a linden tree which is said to have been planted by a soldier from the battle of Morat, 22d June 1476. The ravine of the Sarine is crossed by several bridges, of which the most notable is the suspension bridge constructed by Μ. Challey about 1834, which has a span of 871 feet, and consists mainly of four cables each composed of 1056 distinct wires, individually not more than a tenth of an inch in diameter. About 3 miles to the north of the town, the river valley is crossed by the great railway viaduct of Grandfey, which dates from 1862, is a girder structure 1095 feet in length and 260 feet high, contains about 3100 tons of metal, and cost 2,500,000 francs. Immediately above the town a vast dam was thrown across the river-bed by Ritter the engineer in 1871-3; and the fall thus obtained yields a water power of from 2600 to 4000 horse-power. A motive force of 600 horse-power secured by turbines in the stream is conveyed to the plateau of Pérolles by “telodynamic” cables more than 2295 feet in length, for whose passage a tunnel has been constructed in the rock of the ravine. The industrial establishments are still comparatively few and unimportant. Population in 1870, 10,904.
