FEU, in the law of Scotland, signifies, in its widest sense, any tenure of land by which the relation of superior (or overlord) and vassal is constituted. Of these tenures the feudal system in Scotland has recognized five,—ward (the original military tenure, abolished in 1747), feu, blench, mortification, and burgage. The term feu, however, is now in practice restricted to one of these, feu-holding or feu-farm, which is a grant of land, or property connected with land, in perpetuity, on condition of the grantee making to the granter a fixed annual payment of a substantial nature, with a liability for certain contingent payments termed casualties—the radical right to the whole remaining with the granter. It is opposed to blench-holding—the only other feudal tenure now made use of in Scotland—in which the payment to the superior is merely nominal in amount, e.g., a penny Scots. The feudal system embraces the whole of Scotland except Orkney and Shetland, where remains of the udal right are still to be found. It is a fundamental principle of the system as developed in Scotland to permit subinfeudation to an unlimited extent,— that is, every vassal, unless restrained by special agreement, may feu the whole or part of his land to another person, who thereby becomes his sub-vassal; and by the Act of 1874 conditions by superiors prohibiting subinfeudation cannot thereafter be lawfully made. The feu-duty is usually a payment either in money or in kind. Services, however, are still legal if they are not of a military nature; but they must be paid within the year, as is also the case with blench duties of whatever sort. The casualties now recognized are—relief, the fine payable by an heir on succeeding , composition, that payable by a stranger; and liferent escheat, the forfeiture to the superior of the annual profits of the land while the vassal is civilly dead for failing to answer for a crime. The vassal, also, if he is two years in arrears in payment of the feu-duty and allows decree of irritancy, as it is called, to pass against him, loses his right absolutely. Casualties were at one time more numerous and more irksome in their incidence than at present, for the law now regards with disfavour all feudal payments not of a fixed periodical nature. Indeed it may be said that casualties no longer exist, for the Conveyancing (Scotland) Act of 1874 has abolished all payments of a contingent nature in new feus, and provides for the commutation of those already existing. This Act, while it has preserved the name, has really destroyed the relation of superior and vassal, as that has been long understood in Scotland. A feu is the usual title upon which land is granted for building purposes in Scotland. Long building leases are not much known; and this has greatly contributed to the durable nature and value of Scotch house property.
