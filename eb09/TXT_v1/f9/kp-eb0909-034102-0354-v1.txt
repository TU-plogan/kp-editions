FLORIO, Giovanni (about 1552-1625), lexicographer and translator, was born in London about 1552. He was of Tuscan origin, his father and mother being Waldenses who had fled from persecution in the Valtelline and taken refuge in England. The family left England on the accession of Queen Mary, but returned after her death. The son resided for a time at Oxford, and was appointed, about 1576, preceptor to the son of Barnes, bishop of Durham, then studying at Magdalen College. In 1578 Florio published a work entitled First Fruits, which yield Familiar Speech, Merry Preverbs, Witty Sentences, and Golden Sayings (4to). This was accompanied by A Perfect Induction to tlbe Italian and English Tongues. The work was dedicated to the earl of Leicester. Three years later Florio was admitted a member of Magdalen College, and became a teacher of French and Italian in the university. In 1591 [9:9:342] appeared his Second Fruits, to be gathered of Twelve Trees, of divers but [delightsome Tastes to the Tongues of Italian and English men·, to which was annexed the Garden of Recreation, yielding six thousand Italian Proverbs (4to). His Italian and English dictionary, entitled A World of Words, was published in folio in 1598. After the accession of James I., Florio was named French and Italian tutor to Prince Henry, and afterwards became a gentleman of the privy chamber and clerk of the closet to the queen, whom ho also instructed in languages. His last work, and that by which he has been most known, was his translation of Montaigne’s Essays, published in folio in 1603, and dedicated to the queen. Special interest attaches to this translation from the circumstance that of the several copies of the first edition in the British Museum library one bears the autograph of Shakespeare and another that of Ben Jonson. It has been suggested that Florio is satirized by Shakespeare under the character of Holofernes, the pompous pedant of Love’s Labour’s Lost He is characterized by Wood, in Athenae Oxonienses, as a very useful man in his profession, zealous for his religion, and deeply attached to his adopted country. When the plague raged in London in 1625, Florio sought escape from it by retiring to Fulham; but he was there seized and carried off by it in the autumn of the same year.
