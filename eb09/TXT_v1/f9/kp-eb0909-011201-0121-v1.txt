FERSEN, Axel, Count (1755-1810), marshal of the kingdom of Sweden, was born at Stockholm, September 4, 1755. He belonged to an old Livonian family, several members of which had attained distinction during the reigns of Queen Christina, Charles X., and Charles XI. He was educated by his father Count Axel, a senator of Sweden under Gustavus III., and afterwards studied at the military academy of Turin. In 1775 he returned to Sweden and entered the army. Four years later he went to France, and was appointed colonel of the royal regiment of Swedes in the service of Louis XVI. At the head of this regiment he served with distinction in the later campaigns of the American war, and was aide-de-camp to Geueral Rochambeau at Yorktown. After visiting England and Italy he returned to France, and on the outbreak of the Revolution he showed himself the devoted friend of the royal family. When their flight from Paris was arranged, Count Fersen consented to play the part of coachman in disguise; and he conducted them to the post of Bondi, whence they were sent on under other care. After the failure of the scheme and the imprisonment of the royal family, he zealously exerted himself to minister in any way possible to their comfort and relief. Compelled to leave France after the execution of the king and queen, he visited Vienna, Dresden, and Berlin, and then returned to Sweden. He was named by the king grand-master of his household, chancellor of the university of Upsala, and marshal of the kingdom. He was soon after sent as plenipotentiary to the congress of Rastadt. But he was at the same time disliked and suspected by the people; and when the crown prince, Christian of Augustenburg, suddenly died, in June 1810, suspicions fastened on him and his sister the Countess Piper of having taken part with others in poisoning the prince. At the funeral they were assailed by the crowd; the marshal sought refuge in a house, but was slain by the mob, and his body exposed in the great square (June 20, 1810). His sister succeeded in making her escape. The complete innocence of Count Fersen and his family was established by a subsequent judicial investigation.
