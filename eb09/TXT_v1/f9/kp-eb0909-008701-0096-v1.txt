FERGUSON, James (1710-1776), an eminent mechanist and astronomer, was born near Keith in Banffshire in 1710, of parents in very humble circumstances. He first learned to read by overhearing his father teach his elder brother, and with the help of an old woman was “able,” he says in his autobiography, “to read tolerably well before his father thought of teaching him.” After receiving further instruction in reading from his father, who also taught him to write, he was sent for three months to the grammar-school at Keith. His taste for mechanics was about this time accidentally awakened on seeing his father making use of a lever to raise a part of the roof of his house—an exhibition of seeming strength which at first “excited his terror as well as wonder.” On discovering how the seeming wonder was effected, he began experiments with the view of improving on the simple lever his father had made use of; and although he soon learned that all his inventions had been anticipated, he was so well pleased to find his principles confirmed that his passion for the study of mechanics was increased rather than diminished. As soon as his age permitted he was sent to a neighbouring farm to keep sheep, where in the day time he amused himself by making models of mills and other machines, and at night in studying the stars. Afterwards, as a servant with a miller, and then with a doctor, he met with hardships which rendered his constitution feeble through life. Being compelled by his weak health to return home, he there amused himself with making a wooden clock. When slightly recovered he showed this and some other inventions to a neighbouring gentleman, who engaged him to clean his clocks, and also desired him to make his house his home. He there, at the suggestion of a lady visitor, commenced to draw patterns for needle work, and his success in this art led him to think of becoming a painter. Through the assistance of the same lady he was at length sent to Edinburgh, where, having obtained some instruction in drawing, he began to take portraits in miniature, by which means, while engaged in his scientific studies, he supported himself and his family for many years. On account of the success of his Astronomiccd Rotula, he determined, in 1743, to leave Edinburgh for London, where he published some curious astronomical tables and calculations, and afterwards gave public lectures on experimental philosophy. These he repeated in most of the principal towns in England. His deep interest in his subject, his clear explanations, his ingeniously constructed diagrams, and his mechanical apparatus rendered him one of the most successful of popular lecturers on scientific subjects. It is, however, as the inventor and improver of astronomical and other scientific apparatus, and as a striking instance of self-education, that he claims a place among the most remarkable men of science of his country. His manners were unaffected and courteous, and his life simple, studious, and irreproachable. In 1763 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1770 a member of the American Philosophical Society. During the latter years of his life he was in receipt of a pension of £50 from the privy purse. He died in London 17th November 1776.

Ferguson’s principal publications are Astronomical Tables, 1763; Lectures on Select Subjects (1st ed. 1761, edited by Sir David Brewster in 1805); Astronomy explained upon Sir Isaac Newton's Principles (1756, edited by Sir Dâvid Brewster in 1811); and Select Mechanical Exercises, with a Short Account of the Life of the Author, written by himself ∖ 1773). This autobiography is included in an Extended Life by E. Henderson, LL.D (1st ed. 1867, 2d 1870), which also contains a full description of Ferguson’s principal inventions, accompanied with illustrations. See also The Story of the Peasant-Boy Philosopher, by Henry Mayhew (1857).
