FOÜQUET, Nicolas (1615-1680), viscount of Melun and of Vaux, marquis of Belle-Isle, superintendent of finance under Louis XIV., was born at Paris in 1615. Destined to official life, he was carefully educated; and so evident was his superior ability that he was appointed master of requests at the age of twenty. He was only thirty-five when he obtained the important post of procureur-général to the parliament of Paris (1650). During the civil war Fouquet devoted himself to the interests of the queen-mother, Anne of Austria, and enjoyed in return her protection and patronage. At her instance he was called in 1652 to the office of superintendent of finance. The finances were then in a state of the utmost disorder, [9:9:488] from the long wars and the shameless greed of courtiers and officials; and it is stated that Fouquet for a time provided the means of meeting the expenses of the state out of his own fortune or by loans obtained on his own credit. He had long been in the confidence of the first minister, Cardinal Mazarin, and was his zealous instrument. But soon after the marriage of Louis XIV. a quarrel broke out between them, and thenceforth each was bent on injuring the other. The increasing deficit in the treasury alarmed the king; inquiries were addressed to Colbert, who was secretly ambitious of succeeding Fouquet as minister of finance, and he consequently made the worst of the case against Fouquet. The extravagant expenditure and personal display of the superintendent served to intensify the ill-will of the king. Fouquet had bought the port of Belle-Isle, and strengthened its fortifications, with a view to taking refuge there in case of disgrace. He had spent enormous sums in building a palace on his estate of Vaux, which in its extent, magnificence, and splendour of decoration, was almost a forecast of Versailles. He had cherished the hope of succeeding Mazarin as first minister, and had even made advances to Mademoiselle de la Vallière. In August 1661 he entertained the king at his palace of Vaux, giving him a fête unrivalled for magnificence, at which Les Fâcheux of Molière was for the first time produced. But the king could not be appeased. By crafty devices Fouquet had been induced to sell his office of procureur-général, thus losing the protection of its privileges, and he had paid the price of it into the treasury. The king, however, was only prevented from arresting him at the fête by the pleading of the queen mother. He dissembled for a short time, and the arrest was made about three weeks later at Nantes. Fouquet, after several removals from prison to prison, was sent to the Bastille. His trial extended over several years, and excited the deepest interest. In 1664 he was condemned and sentenced to perpetual exile and confiscation of his property. The sentence, however, was commuted into one of imprisonment for life in the fortress of Pignerol. He bore his fate with manly fortitude, and composed in prison several devotional works. He died at Pignerol, March 23, 1680. The report of his trial was published in Holland, in 15 vols., in 1665-1667, in spite of the remonstrances which Colbert addressed to the states-general. A second edition, under the title of Oeuvres de Μ. Fouquet, appeared in 1696.
