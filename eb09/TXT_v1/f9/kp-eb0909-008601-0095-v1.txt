+=====================================================================+


FERGUSON, Adam (1723-1816), a distinguished philosopher and historian, was born, June 20, 1723, at Logierait, Perthshire, of which parish his father was minister. He received the rudiments of his education at the village school of his native parish, after which he was removed to Perth grammar-school, where he made remarkable progress in classical literature. Towards the end of 1738 he entered the university of St Andrews, where he took the degree of M.A. on 4th May 1742. In November of the same year he entered the divinity hall, and in 1745, although he had studied divinity only one half of the usual period, he was allowed by the General Assembly to be ordained by the presbytery of Dunkeld, on the representation that he had been selected as the fittest person, from his knowledge of the Gaelic language, to fill the office of chaplain to the 42d regiment, under the command of Lord John Murray. When this regiment was at the battle of Fontenoy, Ferguson went into action at the head of the attacking column with a drawn broadsword in his hand, and could with difficulty be persuaded to retire to the rear. He continued attached to the regiment till 1754, after which he resolved to devote himself to literary pursuits. About the beginning of 1757, on the resignation of David Hume, he was elected librarian and clerk to the Faculty of Advocates, but these offices he relinquished in about a year on becoming tutor to Lord Bute. In 1757 he rendered himself conspicuous by the interest he took in the success of the tragedy of Douglas, written by his friend Home, and by a pamphlet, The Morality of Stage Plays seriously considered, which he published in its defence.

In 1759 Ferguson succeeded Dr John Stewart as professor of natural philosophy in the university of Edinburgh. In 1764 he was transferred to the chair of moral philosophy, and within little more than a year after he published his Essay on the History of Civil Society, which was received with much approbation, and wa≡ translated into several European languages. Soon afterwards he began to collect materials for a history of the Roman commonwealth. Whilst thus engaged, he was solicited by the guardians of Charles, earl of Chesterfield, to superintend that young nobleman’s education, which had been much neglected. He joined his young charge at Geneva in May 1774, and remained with him for about a year. In his absence he had very nearly been deprived of his office in the university, the town-council having, as patrons, proposed to declare the chair vacant. In 1776 Ferguson published a pamphlet on the American revolution in opposition to Dr Price’s “Observations on the nature of civil liberty,” in which he sympathized with the views of the British legislature. When the Government resolved to send out commissioners to quiet the disorders in the colonies, he was appointed secretary. They failed to accomplish the object of their [9:9:87] mission, but the Government obtained through them fuller information regarding the state and temper of the Americans than they had previously possessed.

In 1780 Ferguson had a paralytic attack, which was one of the most remarkable on record, for, by an abstemious diet, he continued to enjoy almost uninterrupted good health for more than thirty years, while his mental powers were not impaired. In 1783 his great work, the History of the Progress and Termination of the Roman Republic, appeared in 3 vols. 4to; it was very popular, and went through several editions. In it Ferguson gives, in a connected and elegant form, a narration of the great facts of Roman history for a period of five hundred years. He was led to undertake this work from a conviction that the history of that remarkable people during the period of their greatness was a practical illustration of those ethical and political doctrines which were the object of his peculiar study.

No longer able to undergo the fatigue of public teaching, Ferguson in 1785 resigned his chair in the university, in which he was succeeded by Dugald Stewart, then professor of mathematics. He now proceeded to revise his academic lectures, and in 1792 they were published under the title of Principles of Moral and Political Science.

In his ethical system Ferguson treats man throughout as a social being, and illustrates his doctrines by political examples. As a believer in the progression of the human race, he placed the principle of moral approbation in the attainment of perfection. His speculations have been carefully criticized by Cousin, who thus expresses himself with reference to this theory :—“We find in his method the wisdom and circumspection of the Scottish school, with something more masculine and decisive in the results. The principle of perfection is a new one, at once more rational and comprehensive than benevolence and sympathy, which in our view places Ferguson as a moralist above all his predecessors.” By this principle Ferguson endeavours to reconcile all moral systems. With Hobbe3 and Hume he admits the power of self-interest or utility, and makes it enter into morals as the law of self-preservation. Hutcheson's theory of universal benevolence and Smith’s idea of sympathy he combines under the law of society. But, as these laws are the means rather than the end of human destiny, they are subordinate to a supreme end, and this supreme end is perfection. In the political part of his system Ferguson follows Montesquieu, and pleads the cause of well-regulated liberty and free government.

When in his seventieth year, Ferguson, intending to prepare a new edition of his Roman history, resolved to visit Italy. He visited some of the principal cities of Europe, and passed part of the winter of 1793 at Rome. He was generally well received, and was elected a member of the Academy of Sciences of Berlin, of the Etruscan Society of Antiquaries at Cortona, and of the Arcadia at Rome. From 1795 he resided successively at the old castle of Neidpath near Peebles, at Hallyards on Manor water, and at St Andrews, where he died February 22, 1816.

Besides the works above mentioned, Ferguson is the author of Analysis of Pneumatics and Moral Philosophy, Edinburgh, 1766; Institutes of Moral Philosophy, 1769, 1773, 1785, translated and used as a text-book in several foreign universities; and a few minor publications.
