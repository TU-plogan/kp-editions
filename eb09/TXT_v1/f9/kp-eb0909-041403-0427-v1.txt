FORLÌ, the ancient Forum Livii, a city of Italy, at the head of a province which was formerly a legation of the Papal States. It is situated in a fertile plain between the Montone and the Ronco, a little to the right of the railway line between Rimini and Bologna, about 50 miles S.E. of the latter city. It is a well-built and flourishing town, with broad streets and a central piazza, which was reckoned one of the finest in Italy, but has been completely modernized in 1873. The cathedral is of special interest for the chapel of the Madonna del Fuoco, so called from the long-laboured masterpiece of Carlo Cignani; and the church of S. Girolamo contains frescoes said to be by Melozzo da Forlì, the Conception by Guido Reni, and a beautiful tomb erected for a Barbara Ordelaffi of the 15 th century. From most of the other churches the paintings have been removed to the ρinacoteca or picture-gallery in the convent of the Frati della Missione, where, besides' Melozzo and Cignani, Palmezzano, Guercino, Guido Reni, and Zanganelli are represented. The citadel, known as Rocca di Ravaldino, was founded in 1361 by Cardinal Albornoz; it is in great measure destroyed, and what still remains is utilized as a prison. Besides its administrative and ecclesiastical offices, the town possesses a chamber of commerce and arts, a public library, and several institutions for higher education. A considerable trade is carried on in the varied agricultural produce of the neighbourhood, and there are manufactures of silk ribands and twist, of oilcloth, nitre, wax, matches, and tiles. The population in 1872 was 15,324.

Forìi is said to have been founded either by Livius Salinator or by Lucius Arminius, after the defeat of Hasdrubal on the Metaurus in 207 B.O., but its ,name does not appear in Strabo or Ptolemy. After the fall of the Roman empire it became a republic, and had authority, it is said, over no fewer than 5 cities and 40 towns and villages. It stood a long siege from the French in 1287, and remained independent till 1315. During the troublous times of the 14th and 15th centuries the Ordelaffi, the Orgogliosi, and other powerful families were in possession of the lordship, which finally came to Pope Julius II. in 1503. In 1521 a battle was fought in the neighbourhood by the French and the Spaniards. On the occupation of the county by the republicans in 1797 the town was made the head of the department of the Rubicon. A considerable number of eminent men are natives of Forlì:—Cornelius Gallus, the Latin poet; Guido Bonate, the astrologer; Melozzo, the painter (see next article); and Morgagni, the founder of pathological anatomy, bom in 1682. Cignani and Torricelli are both buried in the cathedral.
