FERDINAND I. of Aragon aħd Sicily (1379-1416), surnamed the Just, the younger son of John I. of Castile and Leonora of Aragon, was born in 1379. On the death of his elder brother Henry III. in 1406, he refused the crown of Castile which the nobles had offered, but in accordance with his brother’s will undertook the office of regent during the minority of his nephew John II. In this capacity he distinguished himself by his prudent administration of home affairs, and by his victories over the Moors by land and sea. He took the title de Antequera on the surrender of that fortress after a siege of five months (1410). On the death of his maternal uncle, King Martin of Aragon and Sicily, his claims to the throne, though not derived from the usual laws of descent, were taken up and keenly pressed by a powerful party in the state. The question of the succession was ultimately referred to a committee of nine judges equally representing Catalonia, Valencia, and Aragon; and the result was his election by a majority (1412). After he had defeated, at Balaguer, Count Jayme of Urgel, the last and most formidable of his rivals, he was formally crowned at Saragossa in 1414.

From the year 1378 Europe had been scandalized by the spectacle of the papal schism; and since 1410 three rival popes had been claiming the obedience of the faithful. At the council of Constance in 1414, Ferdinand of Aragon was a prominent supporter of the Spaniard, Benedict XIII. (Peter de Luna), who had been deposed at Pisa in 1408. The deposition of John XXIII., and the abdication of Gregory XII. in 1415, having paved the way for peace, Ferdinand consented to be present at the meeting of Sigismund with the ambassadors of France, Castile, and Navarre in Perpignan; and after long temporizing he ultimately agreed, for the sake of the unity of the church, to withdraw his obedience from Luna. He died in the following year at Ygualada (2d April 1416), and was succeeded by his son Alphonso V., the conqueror of Naples.
