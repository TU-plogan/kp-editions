EVREUX (the ancient Mediolanum, and afterwards Eburovices), a town of Frauce, capital of the department of Eure, is situated on the Iton, an affluent of the Eure, 67 miles W.N.W. of Paris by railway. The town is generally well built, and still contains many antique timber-framed houses. It is the seat of a bishop, and its cathedral is one of the most ancient and curious in France. It dates from the 11th century, and is a very imposing cruciform structure, though not uniform in style. The north transept and the portal are in the flamboyant Gothic, elaborately ornamented; the west front is in the Italian style. The beautiful rose window in the south transept, and the wooden screens of the side chapels round the choir, showing the flamboyant Gothic style modified by the reviving Italian, also merit notice. The lady chapel is of elegant architecture, with painted glass equally remarkable for its fine execution and perfect preservation. At the intersection of the nave and transepts rises an octagonal tower supported on four pillars, and surmounted by a pyramidal spire of open stonework. The church of St Taurin also displays various styles of architecture, and contains the shrine of St Taurin, a work of the 13th century. The episcopal palace, which dates from the 15 th century, is a beautiful structure. Among the other objects of interest are the clock-tower built in the 15th century, the abbey of St Saviour, the ancient Séminaire des Eudistes now used as a prison and assize buildings, the museum of antiquities, the town-hall, the prefect’s residence, the theatre, the public library, the botanic garden, and the promenades. Evreux is famed for its manufacture of tools, and for stocking making; brewing, distilling, dyeing, taiming, and papermaking are its other principal industries. At Vieil Evreux the remains of a Roman theatre, a palace, baths, and an aqueduct have been discovered, and various relics which are now deposited in the Musée d’Antiquités.

Evreux existed at a very early period. About the end of the 10th century Richard I. of Normandy gave it to his son Robert; and early in the 12th century it came by inheritance into the house of Montfort, from whom it was bought by Philip Augustus of France. Philip II. gave it to his brother Prince Louis, who in 1316 was created Count of Evreux. Count Philip of Evreux acquired by marriage the kingdom of Navarre, and Charles III. of Navarre sold it to Charles VI. of France. Charles VII. gave it in 1426 to John Stuart, earl of Darnley, after whose death it again came into the possession of the crown. Charles IX. bestowed it, along with the title, on his brother the duke of Alençon, but on his death in 1584, it finally returned into the possession of the crown.
