EMMIUS, Ubbo (1547-1626), a celebrated Dutch historian and geographer, was born at Gretha in East Friesland. He was chosen rector of the college of Norden in 1579, but was ejected in 15S7 for refusing to subscribe the confession of Augsburg. He was subsequently rector of the colleges of Leer and Groningen, and when in 1614 the college in the latter city obtained a university charter, he was chosen as its principal and its professor of history and Greek, and by his wise guidance and his learning raised it speedily to a position of great eminence. He had correspondence with the principal learned men of his time, who all held him in high esteem. He died 9th December 1626.

His principal works are—Opus Chronologicum, Gronin., 1619, fol.; Vetus Graecia illustrata, Leyd., 1626, 8vo; Rerum Frisicarum Historia, Leyd., 1616, fol.; Historia Temporis Nostri, Gronin., 1732, 4to.
