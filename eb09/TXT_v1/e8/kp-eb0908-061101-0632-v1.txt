ETHIOPIA, or Aethiopia, in Greek At‰πια, the ancient classical designation of a country and kingdom of Northeastern Africa, lying immediately to the S. of Egypt, and extending eastward» to the Red Sea, but with no definitely marked boundaries in any other direction. According to the “folk’s etymology” of the Greeks, the name was equivalent to the “land of the scorched faces,” from α‰p, to burn, and ωψ, the countenance, and this supposed derivation doubtles3 reacted on the employment of the word, and increased the vagueness of its meaning; but in all probability it was really, like the name of Egypt itself, a corruption of some Egyptian original now unknown. The knowledge of this country possessed by the earlier Greeks was extremely slight, and greatly corrupted by mythical additions. To the generation among whom the Homeric poems took their rise the Ethiopians were the remotest inhabitants of the world, and received the gods themselves as familiar guests. They arc twice mentioned by Hesiod, who calls their king by the Egyptian name of Memnon. Herodotus acquired a considerable amount of information about their connexion with Egypt, and Democritus is said to have travelled as far south as Meroe, and to have written an account of its hieroglyphics; but it was not till the invasion of Ptolemy Philadelphus that the Greeks began to be familiar with the country. From Herodotus downwards we hear of a great many separate tribes, most of whom are designated by Greek epithets descriptive of some real or supposed peculiarity, as the Ichthyophagi or Fish-eaters, the Macrobii or Long-livers, the Troglodytes or Cave-dwellers. To only a few of them can their proper geographical position be assigned, and of none of them can we with certainty determine the ethnographical affinities. The name Ethiopian, indeed, must be regarded not as an ethnographical but as a politico-geographical designation. It has been applied, both in ancient and modern times, to peoples of different race who have occupied the country to the south of Egypt and the southwestern part of Arabia, much in the same way as the name Englishman is used by foreigners for any native of the British Islands, whether he be of Germanic or Celtic descent; and in this respect it probably differs from the quasi-synonymous Cushite of Hebrew ethnology and the An of the Egyptian inscriptions. The inhabitants of Meroe or Southern Ethiopia were a reddish-brown people, and are so represented on the monuments; but they were surrounded by, and perhaps intermingled with, a number of dark-skinned tribes, whose effigies indicate affinity with the negro. Modern research enables us to trace the main outlines of Ethiopian history, but with the same indefiniteness of chronology which attaches to so much of the history of Egypt. Of its earlier epochs we are profoundly ignorant. The Greeks had a tradition that the Egyptians were indebted to the Ethiopians for the first impulse of their civilization; but recent investigators maintain that the relation between the two peoples must have been exactly the reverse of this, and their view is supported by the fact that as we advance up the river the monuments are evidently of later date and poorer workmanship, as if the southern builders were only second-rate imitators of their northern predecessors (cf. Brugsch, Geschichte Aeyyp- ten's, 1877). The Pharaohs of the XII. Egyptian Dynasty —the Usurtesens or Osortasens and Amenemhats— repulsed the encroachments of the Ethiopians and invaded their country. By Usurtesen III. a frontier fortress was erected at Semneh; and he forbade the people to the south to enter Egypt except for the purpose of trading in cattle. During the XVIII. Dynasty we find the kings of Egypt partly in friendly and partly in hostile relations with their Ethiopian neighbours. Λahmes married an Ethiopian princess, and received the assistance of her family in the expulsion of the shepherd kings. Amenhotep (Amenophis) I. his son, and Thothmes (Tuthmosis) I. his grandson, both [9:8:612] extended the Egyptian dominion towards the south, and the supremacy of Tuthmosis III. seems to have been widely acknowledged throughout the Ethiopian region. When Amenhotep II., as we are informed by an inscription in the Nubian temple of Amadas, brought back from his conqueste the dead bodies of the kings he had slain, one of them was sent to adorn the walls of Napata, the Ethiopian city now identified with Jebel Barkal. Amenhotep III., Horemhebi, and the more warlike Rameses or Ramessu I. are all mentioned as in possession of the Ethiopian supremacy, but as engaged from time to time in wars within the region. Amenhotep III. founded at Napata a great fortress-temple for the god Amon-ra of Thebes. A general revolt took place against Ramses II. and the importance of the wars that followed is shown by the extensive sculptures and paintings in regard to them still preserved at Ipsambul (Abu-simbel) and Beit Walli. During the XXII. Egyptian Dynasty the independence and power of the principal Ethiopian potentate had increased so much that Azerch-Amen, of Napata, the Zerah of the Biblical narrative, conquered all the valley of the Nile, and advanced against Syria and Judah; the defeat, however, inflicted on him at Zeρhathah by King Asa was so complete that he withdrew again within his original frontiers. Piankhi Meriamen, the priest-king of Napata, whose family had an Egyptian origin, took advantage of the confusion into which Egypt had fallen during the XXIII. Dynasty, and succeeded in establishing his authority; and for several generations Ethiopian influence was predominant in Egypt. Tirhakah especially was a monarch of great power, as is attested by his monuments at Napata and elsewhere. The great Egyptian Psametik was enabled by foreign assistance to restore a native dynasty; but the excessive favour which he showed to those who had helped him to his throne so displeased the Egyptian military caste that they emigrated to Ethiopia to the number, according to Herodotus, of 240,000. At Ipsambul (Abu simbel) there is a Greek inscription on one of the great colossi of Ramses purporting to have been engraved by the Greek mercenaries who accompanied the expedition of Psametik against his runaway subjects. The Persian invader Cambyses, who brought the Egyptian independence to a close, failed in his attack on the Ethiopian kingdom; but the change in the condition of Egypt helped to open up Ethiopia to Greek enterprise and influence. Under the Ptolemies various Greek colonies—Dire-Berenices, Adulis, Arsinoe—were established on the Ethiopian coast of the Red Sea, and Greek learning was introduced into the Ethiopian court. Ptolemy Philadelphus invaded the country, but came to terms with the king, Ergamenes or Arkamen, who is reported to have relieved the royal power from the ecclesiastical bondage under which it had long suffered, by putting the priests to death and plundering their temples. Arkamen’s name occurs on the monuments at Debod or Tabet. In the reign of Augustus, C. Petronius had to defend the Egyptian frontiers against an invasion under Queen Candace: in the second campaign he extorted the submission of the country, which continued nominally Roman till the reign of Diocletian. A garrison was established at Primis or Ibrim, and a troop of German horse had its head-quarters at Pselchis. There is still a very perfect Roman camp at Mehendi, to the south of Hierasykaminos. About the 1st century of the Christian era a new kingdom seems to have grown up at Axume. The king Zoskales is mentioned by the author of the Periplus of the Erythrean Sea, who also tells us that he was acquainted with Greek; he may be identified with the Za Hagalé or Hekla of the Ethiopian list of kings. In the sixth century the Christians of Yemen, being oppressed by the dynasty of Jewish proselytes who at that time held the throne of the Himyarites, asked and obtained the assistance of the Axumite monarch; but the Ethiopian sovereignty thus established only lasted for about seventy years.

Compare Egypt, vol. vii. pp. 730-748; Abyssinia, vol. i., and the woιks of Salt, &c., there referred to; and in addition Lenormant, Manuel de l' histoire orientale ; Records of the Past, vol. iv.; Vivien de Saint Martin, “Éclaire, geogr. et hist, sur Γinscription d'Adulis,' ’ in Journal Asiatique, 1863, published separately in 1864, and his Le Nord de l'Afrique dans l’antiquité grecque et romaine, 1863.

Ethiopian, or Geez, is the name given in modern philology to a language of the Semitic family, which is still used in Abyssinia for literary and ecclesiastical purposes. It shows the closest affinity in grammatical structure with Arabic. The verb has ten conjugations, of which two are peculiar, and the remaining eight analogous to as many of the ten Arabic conjugations. The noun presents a greater similarity to the Hebrew noun, though at the same time it has decidedly Arabic characteristics. There is no dual form either in noun or verb. About a third of the vocables of the language have been traced to Arabic roots, while others find their counterparts and kindred in Aramaic and Hebrew. A considerable number of words have been imported from foreign tongues—some as mere exotics by translators and scholars, but many others through direct popular intercourse with foreign nations. Aramaic, Hebrew, and Greek have been chiefly laid under contribution, the last especially for words technical to Christianity. Of course it is often difficult to decide in the case of Aramaic and Arabic vocables whether they are real borrowings since the differentiation of the languages, or are part of the original common stock of the Semitic. There are at least two modern languages which have sprung from the ancient Geez, distinguished in modern philology by the conventional names of Tigrina and Tigré, both derived from the native Tigraj, which is applied to either indifferently. The Tigré, spoken by the half-nomadic races on the frontiers of Nubia and Sennaaris, at least among one tribe, the Habab, extremely like the parent speech; the Tigrina, on the other hand, is corrupt both in its sounds, its inflexions, and its vocabulary, and bears evidence more especially of Λmharic influence. Tigré has been very partially investigated: Merx published, in 1868, a vocabulary and grammatical sketch; Munziger’s vocabulary is printed in Dillmann’s Lexicon; and a Tigré translation of the gospel of Luke by Kugler and Isenberg exists in manuscript. The Tigrina, or rather the Adoan dialect of the Tigrina, was treated pretty fully by Dr Praetorius in hi3 Grammatik der Tigijüa Sprache, 1872, and he has since published, in the Ztschrft. d. Deut. Morg. Ges., 1874, a paper on the two dialects of Hamâsên and Tanben, which differ considerably in vocabulary as well as in pronunciation, but are mutually intelligible. Another dialect mainly of Ethiopie character is spoken by the people of Harrar, who form a small Semitic enclave in the Hamitic population to the east of southern Abyssinia. Its peculiarities have been investigated by Burton, First Footsteps in East Africa, 1856, and by Praetorius in Ztschr. d. Deut. Μorg. Ges., 1869. The affinity of the Geez alphabet has given rise to no small discussion: Ludolf brought it into comparison with the Samaritan, De Lacy with the Greek and Coptic, and Lepsius with the Devanâgari, but in the opinion of most Semitic investigators, its Semitic origin has been proved by the discovery of the cognate Himyaritic alphabet or musnad (cf. Renan, Hist, des Langues Sémitiques, p. 308).

The literature of the Ethiopian language, like that of Armenian, is almost exclusively Christian, and, indeed, with comparatively slight exceptions, theological or ecclesiastical. Only a few inscriptions have been preserved of the pre-Christian period, the most notable being those of Axum [9:8:613] and Adulis, but it is not improbable that light will be ob tained on the earlier times from the inscriptions of Southern Arabia, which are beginning to receive special attention. The language of the Axum inscriptions is the same as that of the Bible, and contains the Ambaric clement. The forms of the letters vary, and the older forms are liker the Himyaritic. Vowel signs are irregularly employed, and sometimes omitted, and the numeral notation is peculiar. The work which forms the standard of a classical style is the version of the Bible. According to native tradition it was made from the Arabic, either by the first bishop Frumentius (Abba Salama) or by the “Nine Saints” of the 5th century; but internal evidence goes to prove that it was really derived from the Greek version in use in the Alexandrian church. In the course of centuries it has undergone numberless alterations at the hands of copyists; but even its most corrupted condition leaves it clear that it must have been characterized by great fidelity to the Greek text. Among the MSS. of the Old Testament Professor Dillmann distinguishes three classes: the first, which seldom occurs, preserves in the main the original translation; the second, and most numerous, contains a text revised according to the Greek; and the third has been improved by comparison with the Hebrew. Besides the ordinary canonical books of the English Bible, and the ordinary apocryphal books, with the exception of the Maccabees, the Ethiopian canon includes a number of works of various interest and value, as the Kufale or Book of the Jubilees, the Book of Enoch, and the Ascension of Isaiah,—concerning which consult Apocalyptic Literature, vol. ii. The books of the Maccabees were either never translated or have been lost, but their place has been supplied by spurious productions of the same name. Several apocryphal books are also incorporated with the New Testament, which is usually reckoned to contain 35 altogether. It was printed in 2 vols, at Rome, 1548, in the London Polyglot, and in 1830 by the London Bible Society, under the editorship of Th. P. Platt. Dillmami published the Octateuch, Leipsic, 1853, the four books of the Kings, Leipsic, 1861-1871, Enoch, 1851, and the book of the Jubilees, 1859; and R. Lawrence published the Ascensio desa ice, 1819, and the Apocalypse of Ezra, 1820, at Oxford. (Cf. Dillmann’s article on the Aethiopische Bibelübersetzung in Herzog’s Real Encyclopädie, 2d edition, 1877.) Of the numerous works which rank as ecclesiastical authorities in the Ethiopian church, it is sufficient to mention the CyrUlns, which contains, not only several dogmatie treatises of Cyril of Alexandria, but also similar productions of several others of the fathers; the Synodus, which includes, inter alia, the constitutions and statutes of the apostles, the canons of the councils of Ancyra, Neocaesarea, Sardis, Antioch, and Nicaea, an exposition of the Nicene creed, and an exposition of the Decalogue; the Mafshafa kidân za egziena Iyasus, or the Testament of our Lord Jesus (usually quoted as the Kidân), which treats of various ecclesiastical, liturgical, and eschatological matters; the Genzai or Mafshafa Genzat, and the Mafshafa Kedr, containing respectively the burial service and other sections of the ritual; the Philexmιs, a monastic treatise, probably translated into Ethiopie in the 14th century, and deriving its name from Philoxenus of Manbig. Among the poetic works are a collection of hymns in honour of the saints of the Ethiopian calendar, entitled Erziabkhαη uagsa, or “May God reign,” and the Orgaηoηa Maryams eulogy of the Virgin in rhythmic prose. The MSS. of the Mavaséet or Antipkonαry sometimes contain an interesting musical notation, which, according to native tradition, was introduced by a saint who lived in the 6th or 7th century. Certain works called Savasev or guides are devoted to the illustration of the Ethiopian language, but they are very poor, and make no distinction between grammatical, lexicographical, andhistorico-scientific information, standing thus on the same level with such a work as Elyot’s Latin Dictionary. The historical works, as for example those concerning Alexander of Macedon, are of little moment; and the real value of the lists of early kings of Ethiopia is still a matter of dispute. According to Praetorius, one of the most recent investigators (Ztschr. d. Dent. Morg. Ges., 1870), all the statements made in Ethiopian literature about the earlier history of the country have been in the main derived from Arabic legends not earlier than the 14th century, and then reconstructed with the assistance of the king lists, which alone have some degree of historic credibility. The European libraries which possess the richest collections of Ethiopian MSS. are the British Museum, the Bodleian, the Royal Library at Vienna, and the National Library at Paris. Ruppell·s collections are preserved at Frankfort-on-the-Maine, and KrapfΓs at Tübingen and Würtemberg. The Bodleian catalogue was published by Dillmann, 1858; D’Abbadie’s Catalogue raisonné de manuscripts éthiopiens appeared in 1859; and a list of the Magdala collection in the British Museum, consisting of upwards of 300 MSS., was contributed to the Ztschr. d. Deut. Morg. Ges., 1870, by William Wright. Ewald gives a list of the Würtemberg MSS. in Ztschr. für die Kunde des Morgenlandes, 1843, and of the Tübingen MSS. in Ztschr. d. Deut. Morg. Ges., 1847. Dorn had already made known the few works possessed by the St Petersburg library, in the Bull, de l'Λcad., May and October 1837. The Vienna collection is dealt with by Fr. Midler in Ztschr. d. Deut. Mo) g. Ges., 1862. The first scholar who turned his attention to Ethiopian was Potken of Cologne about 1513. A grammar and dictionary were published by Jacob Wemmers, a Carmelite of Antwerp in 1638; and in 1661 appeared the first edition of the great lexicon by Job Ludolf, who, in the 1702 edition, prefixed a Dissertatio de harmonia liηgu<x cetk. cum. cel. orient., and was also the author of Comment, de Hist, ceth.

Modern works connected with the subject are Hupfeldt, Exercitationes Aethiopica, 1825; Dorn, De psalterio alhiopicο, 1825; Tuch, De Aethiop. lingua sonorum proprietatibus quibusdam, 1854, and De ath. lingua son. sibilantium usu, 1854; Ewald, Ueber des athiop. Buch's Ηenοkh Entstehung, 1854; D’Abbadie, Herma Pastor Ethiopice, 1860; Schrader, De Lingua Aethiopica indole, 1860; Ceriani, Monumenta sacra et profana e codicibus Βibl.
