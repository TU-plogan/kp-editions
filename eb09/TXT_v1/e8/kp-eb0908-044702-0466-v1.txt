ENNISKILLEN, a municipal and parliamentary borough and market town of Ireland, capital of the county of Fermanagh, province of Ulster, is situated on an island in the strait or river which connects the upper and lower lakes of Lough Erne, 102 miles N.W. from Dublin and 22 miles from Clones by railway. The town occupies the whole island, and is connected with two suburbs on the mainland on each side by two bridges. It has a brewery, two tanneries, and a small manufactory of cutlery, and a considerable trade in corn, pork, and flax. The chief public buildings are the parish church, the Roman Catholic chapel, the Presbyterian and Methodist meeting houses, the county court-house, the town-hall, the royal school founded by Charles I., and the infirmary. In 1689 Enniskillen defeated a superior force sent against it by James IL; and part of the defenders of the town were subsequently formed into a regiment of cavalry, which still retains the name of the Enniskillen Dragoons. The town returns a member to parliament. Population in 1871, 5836.
