ENGLISH LITERATURE

I. Anglo-Saxan Period, 596-1066.—The early history of literature in England might lend some countenance to the theory that the development of a nation’s literature is, at bottom, but a chapter of its religious history. While the religion of our fathers was in the main a rude awe-struck worship of the forces of nature, literature either had no existence for them, or was in a state not lese elementary, consisting of a few songe and oracles, and nothing more. With the advent of the religion of Christ—the only faith which at once recognizes the original dignity of human nature and repairs its fall—came an intellectual as well as a spiritual awakening to the Teutonic nations—for into such the original tribes or clans of the invaders had now grown—that were planted in the old provinces of Roman Britain. Fortified by gospel precept for the present life, and thrilled with the hope of the life to come, the Saxon mind, released from disquietude, felt free to range discursively through such regions of human knowledge as its teachers opened before it, and the Saxon heart was fain to pour out many a rude but vigorous song. Pope Gregory himself, who, according to the old phraseology, sent baptism to the English, is said indeed to have spoken disparagingly of human learning. Bat the missionaries could not fail to bring with them from Rome the intellectual culture of the countries bordering on the Mediterranean, so far as it had survived the fall of the Western empire and the irruption of the barbarians. The Roman alphabet, paper or parchment, and pen and ink, drove out the Northern runes, the beechen tablet, and the scratching implement. The necessity of the preservation, and at least partial translation, of the Scriptures, the varied exigences of the Catholic ritual, the demand for so much knowledge of astronomy as would enable the clergy to fix beforehand the date of Easter, all favoured, or rather compelled, the promotion of learning and education up to a certain point, and led to continual discussion and interchange of ideas. Gratefully and eagerly our forefathers drew in the warm and genial breath which came to them from the intenser life and higher enlightenment of the south. Beda dates his history by the indictions of the Eastern emperors; and while in practice he obeyed his native king descended from Woden, in theory he recognized the larger and more rational sway of the Caesar enthroned at Constantinople.

On a closer examination, we find that there were two principal centres, during the first two centuries after the conversion, where learning was honoured and literature flourished. These centres were Wessex and Northumbria. For although Christianity was first preached in Kent, and the great monastery at Canterbury was long a valuable school of theology and history (witness the liberal praise awarded by Beda to Abbot Albinus in the preface to his Ecclesiastical History), yet the limited size of the kingdom, and the ill fortune which befell it in its wars with Mercia and Wessex, seem to have chocked its intellectual growth. When we have named the oldest form of the Saxon Chronicle,—that represented by the Parker MS. A,—and the not very interesting works of Abbot Aelfric, there is little left in the shape of extant writings, dating before the Conquest, for which we have to thank the men of Kent. But in Wessex and Northumbria alike, the size of the territory, the presence of numerous monasteries, perhaps also the proximity of Celtic peoples or societies endowed with many literary gifts,—the Britons in the case of Wessex, the Culdees of Iona in the case of Northumbria,— co-operated to produce.a long period of literary activity, the monuments of which it must now be our endeavour briefly to review and characterize.

But before we consider the Anglo-Saxon literature which was founded on Christianity, the question whether any Anglo-Saxon literature exists of date prior to the conversion demands an answer. It was formerly thought that the important poem of Beowulf was in the main a pagan work, and must have been produced before the Angles and Saxons quitted their German homes; but closer investigation has shown that it is permeated almost everywhere by Christian ideas, and that it cannot be dated earlier than the first quarter of the 8th century. But two poems remain, presenting problems of great difficulty, many of which have not yet been satisfactorily solved, which so far as appears must have been composed in Germany while our forefathers were still in their German seats. These are The Travellers Song and Bear’s Complaint. In the first, Widsith, a poet of Myrging race (the Myrgings were a tribe dwelling near the Eider), re-counts the nations that he had visited as a travelling gleeman, names the kings who ruled over them, and singles out two or three whose open-handed generosity he had experienced, and to whom he accordingly awards the tribute of a poet’s praise. This poem may perhaps be dated from the second half of the 6th century. Though written in or near Anglen, after the migration of most of the Angles to Britain, the language of the poem seems to have been accommodated to the ordinary West-Saxon dialect, for in this respect it differs in no degree from the other poems which stand before and after it in the Exeter Codex. Dear’s Camplaint mentions Weland, the Teutonic demi-god corresponding to Vulcan, Theodric, Eormanric, &c.; it is the lament of a bard supplanted by a rival in his lord’s favour. In date it is probably not far distant from the Traveller's Sang. λ Nq may now return to the literary development in Wessex. Christianity was introduced into Wessex by Bishop Birinus in 634, and spread over the whole kingdom with marvellous celerity. The bishop’s see was fixed at first at Dorchester, near Oxford; thence it was moved to Winchester; before the end of the century it was necessary to carve out another bishopric farther to the west, and the see was fixed at Sherborne. Winchester, Malmesbury, and Glastonbury were great and famous monasteries early in the 8th century. The heroic Winfrid (better known as St Boniface), trained in a monastery at Exeter, could not rest contented that Wessex should have received the faith, but carried Christianity to the Germans. Great spiritual fervour, ardent zeal, great intellectual activity, seems to have prevailed in every part of the little kingdom. The interesting letters of St Boniface give us tantalizing glimpses of a busy life, social and monastic, in the west of England, no detailed picture of which it is now possible to reconstruct. The most distinguished known writer was St Aldhelm, a monk of Malmesbury, and, for a few years before his death in 709, bishop of Sherborne. His extant works in Latin are chiefly in praise of virginity, that form of self-mastery which, difficult as it was for a people teeming with undeveloped power and unexhausted passion, included, he might think, aud made possible every other kind of self-mastery. The Saxon writings of St Aidhelm are lost, unless we accept a conjecture of Grimm that he was the author of Andreas, one of the poems in the Vercelli Codex. Cynewulf, the author of Crist, Elene, and Juliana, though to us unhappily no more than a name, was a poet of no mean powers. Mr Kemble was disposed to identify him with an abbot of Peterborough who lived [9:8:404] in the 11th century; but it is far more probable,—whatever weight we may attach to Grimm’s hypothesis that he was a pupil of St Aldhelm,—that Cynewulf was a West-Saxon writer, and lived in the first half of the 8th century. Crût is a poem of nearly 1700 lines, incomplete at the beginning. When first edited by Mr Thorpe along with the other contents of the Exeter Codex, it was believed to be a string of disconnected poems. Dietrich was the first who pointed out the internal connection of these, and showed that they constituted one organic whole. Cynewulf seems to revel in the task of expressing in his mother tongue the new religious ideas which had come to his race. Beginning from the Annunciation, he expatiates on the various and inestimable benefits which Christ by his incarnation bestowed on men, concluding with a vivid picture of the last great day of account. The key-note of the poem seems to be found in the 15th canto, where the six “leaps,” or movements, of Christ are enumerated :—the first, when He became incarnate; the second, when He was born; the third, when He mounted on the cross, and so on. The name “Cynewulf” is given in runes in the 16th canto; it occurs in the same way in the other poems attributed to this writer. Elene is the legend of the discovery of the true cross at Jerusalem by the empress Helena, the mother of Constantine; Juliana is the story of the martyrdom of the saint so named, under Maximian. Guthlac, a free version of the Latin life of St Guthlac (who died in 714) by Felix, a monk of Croyland, is probably the work of a Mercian writer, whose language was altered by a West-Saxon transcriber into conformity with that of the poems already mentioned. Andreas, a poem of more than 1700 lines, ascribed by Grimm, as we have seen, to St Aidhelm, but at any rate a West-Saxon poem of the 8th century, is founded on an apocryphal Greek narrative of the “Acts of Andrew and Matthew.” The first-named apostle, after rescuing the second from confinement in a barbarous land named Mermedonia, and working numerous miracles of an amazing character, converts the entire nation, and departs after committing them to the charge of a pious bishop named Plato.

All the poems hitherto named, and indeed the great mass of Anglo-Saxon poetry, are written in that alliterative metre which was the favourite rhythm of the whole Teutonic north, and of which one variety may be seen in the famous poems of the Edda. Each line is in two sections, balanced the one against the other, and containing usually from four to eight syllables and two accents. The general rule of the metre is that the two accented words in the first section, and one of those in the second section, begin upon the same letter, if a consonant, but, if the accented words begin with vowels, then upon different letters.

The preponderance of opinion is now in favour of ascribing to Beowulf, the most important surviving monument of Anglo-Saxon poetry, a West-Saxon origin, and a date not later than the middle, nor earlier than the first decade, of the 8th century. Yet the difficulty of the problem may be estimated from the facts, that Thorkelin, the first editor, described Beowulf as a “Danish poem,” that Mr Kemble, wrongly identifying the Geatas with the Angles, believed it to have been composed in Anglen before the migration, and brought over to Wessex before the end of the 5th century, and that Mr Thorpe considered it to be merely a translation of a Swedish poem of the 11th century. Notwithstanding this discrepancy, the general view taken above is that of Grein, Müllenhoff, and other eminent scholars, and we are convinced that the further investigation is carried the more firmly will its soundness be established. Founded on a single MS., which, as originally written, was full of errors, and now is much defaced, the text of Beowulf can never, unless another MS. should be discovered, be placed on a thoroughly satisfactory footing; much, however, has been done for its improvement by the labours of German and Danish critics. The general drift of the poem is to celebrate the heroic deeds of Beowulf, who, originally of Swedish race, was adopted by the king of Gautlaud, or Gotland (as the southern portion of Sweden is still called), and brought up with his own sons. Hearing that the Danish king Hrothgar is harassed by the attacks of a man-eating monster called Grendel, he sails to Zealand to his aid, and after various adventures kills both Grendel and his mother. After this Beowulf is chosen king of Gotland, and reigns many years in great prosperity, till in his old age, undertaking to fight with a fiery dragon that has been making great ravages among his subjects, he succeeds in killing it, but receives a mortal injury in the struggle. The burning of his body, and the erection of a huge mound or cairn over his ashes, as a beacon “easy to be seen far off by seafaring men,” conclude the poem, and form a passage of remarkable beauty.

Towards the end of the 8th century the descents of the piratical heathens known by the general name of Danes, but probably born for the most part in Scandinavian countries lying to the north of Denmark, began to plague the English coasts. These destroying savages resembled the modern Turks in possessing fine military qualities, and above all indomitable courage; they were also like the Turks in this respect that, wherever they set their foot, progress of every kind was arrested, culture was blasted, and the hopes of civilization died away. Fortunately they were not, like the Turks, absolutely deaf to the voice of the Christian missionary, though their natural brutishness made them difficult to convert and prone to relapse. With incredible pains, and a charity that nothing could disgust or deter, the church gradually won over these Scandinavian Calibans to the Christian creed; and when once converted their immense natural energy and tenacity were turned into right and beneficial channels, at least in great measure. But for 230 years,—from the sack of Lindisfarne to the accession of Canute,—the so-called Danes were the curse of England, destroying monasteries and the schools maintained by them, burning churches and private houses, making life and property everywhere insecure, and depriving the land of that tranquillity without which literature and art are impossible. After a long prevalence of this state of things, society in Wessex having been, one would think, almost reduced to its first elements, Alfred arose, and after obtaining some successes in battle over the Danes, leading to a treaty and the conversion of part of them to Christianity, obtained a period of peace for his harassed and dejected countrymen. History tells us how well he wrought to build up in every way the fallen edifice of West-Saxon society. Among his labours not the least meritorious was his translation of Beda’s Historia Ecclesiastica, Pope Gregory’s work De Cura Pastorali, the famous treatise of Boethius De Consolatione, and the Universal History of Orosius. He also founded several schools, and made a beginning in the work of restoring monasteries. Yet in spite of his generous efforts, the evils caused by the Danes could not be repaired. A sort of blight seemed to have passed over the Anglo-Saxon genius; the claims of material existence suddenly seemed to engross their thoughts, perhaps because their sufferings had taught them that, however it may be with individuals, for nations all higher developments must have a basis of material prosperity to rest upon. Now and then a great man appeared, endowed with a reparative force, and with a courage which aimed at raising the fallen spirit of the people, and turning them back again into the old paths of nobleness.
[9:8:405]

Such a man was St Dunstan, who fought with a giant’s strength against corruption, sloth, and ignorance, and was ever faithful to the interests of learning. There is in the Bodleian Library a little volume, probably written in his own hand; it is a sort of common-place book; the frontispiece is a drawing of the saint prostrated at the feet of the throned Christ, executed by Dunstan himself; among the contents of the volume are—a grammatical treatise by Eutychius, w ith extremely curious Welsh glosses, part of Ovid De Arte Amandi with similar glosses, and lessons, in Latin and Greek, taken from the Pentateuch and the prophets. But his work was undone during the disastrous reign of Ethelred IL, at the end of which the Danish power established itself in England. Under Edward the Confessor, French influences began to be greatly felt. The two races of the Teutonic north had torn each other to pieces, and the culture which Saxon had been able to impart to Northman was uot sufficient to discipline him into a truly civilized man. England, though at a terrible cost, had to be knit on to the state-system of Southern Europe; her anarchy must give place to centralization; her schools, and her art, and her architecture be remodelled by Italians and Frenchmen; her poets turn their eyes, not towards Iceland, but towards Normandy or Provence.

Turning now to the other literary centre, the Northumbrian kingdom, we find that impulse and initiation were due to more than one source. In the main, the conversion of the Angles north of the Tees, and the implantation among them of the germs of culture, are traceable to Iona, and, indirectly, to the Iriβh Church and St Patrick. From Ireland, in the persons of St Columba and his followers, was wafted to the long low island surrounded by the mountains of the Hebrides, a ministry of light and civilization, which from the 6th to the 11th century diffused its blessings over northern Europe. Oswald, son of the Bernician king Ethelfrid, was driven out of Northumbria after his father’s death by Edwin of Deira, and took refuge among the northern Picts. He embraced Christianity through the teaching of the monks of Iona or some monastery dependent on it; and when he became king of Bernicia in 634, one of his first thoughts was to send to his old teachers, and ask that missionaries might be sent to instruct his people. Aidan accordingly came from Iona and founded a bishop’s see at Lindisfarne, or Holy Isle. Hence issued the fouuders of the monasteries of Hexham, Cυldingham, Whitby, and many other places. The actual representatives of the monks of Iona returned after some years to their own country, because they would not give way in the dispute concerning Easter; but the civilizing effects of their mission did not pass away. The school of piety and learning which produced an Aidan, an Adamnan, and a Cuthbert deserved well not of England only but of humanity. Adamnan, abbot of Iona about the year 690, has a peculiar interest for us, because a long extract from his work on the holy places is incorporated by Beda in his Ecclesiastical History. He also wrote a life of his founder, St Columba, printed by Canisius and in the FlorUegium Insuloe Sanctorum. To the encouragement of Bishop Aidan we owe it that Hilda, a lady of the royal house of Deira, established monasteries at Hartlepool and Streoneshalch (afterwards Whitby); and it was by the m0nk3 of Streoneshalch that the seed was sown, which, falling upon a good heart and a capacious brain, bore fruit in the poetry of Caedmon, the earliest English poet. We need not repeat the well-known story of the vision, in which the destined bard, then a humble menial employed about the stables and boat-service of the monastery, believed that an injunction of more than mortal authority was laid upon him, to “sing of the beginning of creation.” The impulse having been once communicated, Caedmon, as Beda informs us, continued for a long time to clothe in his native measures the principal religious facts recorded in the Pentateuch and in the New Testament. Is the work commonly known as Caedmon’s Paraphrase identical with the work described by Beda? Have we in this paraphrase a genuine utterance of the 7th century? The answers to these questions are still involved in doubt, and to enter upon the discussion which they presuppose would be foreign to our present purpose. We will merely say that the unique MS. of the Paraphrase, which is of the 10th century, contains no indication whatever of authorship, and that it opens in a manner different from the prologue made by the real Caedmon, of which we have a Latin version in Beda and an Anglo-Saxon version in Alfred’s translation of Beda. On the other hand, the portion of the MS. which is written in the first hand agrees tolerably well in its contents with the real work of Caedmon, as Beda describes it. The portion of the MS. which is written in the second hand is probably of much later date; some critics have not hesitated to designate its author as the “pseudo-Caedmon.” The opening cantos of the Para· phrase, which treat of the rebellion of the angels and the fall of man, are allowed by general consent to be those most vividly expressed, and most characterized by poetical power. It is here that bright strong phrases occur, which, as is believed, Milton himself did not disdain to utilize, and his known acquaintance with Francis Junius, the then possessor of the Caedmon MS., seems to lend some countenance to the belief.

Hitherto the influences in Northumbria tending to culture have been found to be ouly indirectly Roman; the immediate source of them was Iona. But when we come to the Venerable Beda, the great light of the Northumbrian church, the glory of letters in a rude and turbulent age, nay, even the teacher and the beacon light of all Europe for the period from the 7th to the 10th century, we find that the fountain whence he drew the streams of thought and knowledge came from no derivative source, but was supplied directly from the well-head of Christian culture. Benedict Biscop, a young Northumbrian thane, much employed and favoured in the court of Oswy, abandoned the world for the church, and travelling to Rome resided there several years, diligently studying the details of ecclesiastical life and training, and the institutes of liturgical order. Returning to England in 668, with Theodore, the new primate, and the abbot Hadriau, he brought into Northumbria a large number of books, relics, and other ecclesiastical objects, and, being warmly welcomed by King Egfrid, founded a monastery in honour of St Peter on land granted by the king at the mouth of the Wear. That the other great apostolic name venerated at Rome might not go λvithout due honour, he built a second monastery soon afterwards in honour of St Paul at Jarrow on the Tyne, seven miles from Wearmouth. After the founder’s time the two monasteries were usually governed by one abbot. When only seven years old, Beda, like Orderic in a later age, was brought by his father to Jarrow, and given up to the abbot to be trained to monastic life. The rest of his life, down to the year 731, was passed in the monastery, as we know from his own statement; in 735 he died. His works, which have several times been edited in a complete form abroad, but never yet in his own country, may be grouped under five heads—1, Educational; 2, Theological; 3, Historical; 4, Poetical; 5, Letters. To the first class belong the treatises De Orthographia and De Arte Metrica, the first being a short dictionary, giving the correct spelling and the idiomatic use of a considerable number of Latin words, with (in many cases) their Greek equivalents,—the second a prosody, describing the principal classical metres, with examples. De Natura Perum is a [9:8:406] cosmogony and cosmography, with numerous diagrams and maps. A number of treatises, of which the most important are De Ratione Temporum and De Ratione Computi, fall under the same head; their general object being to elucidate all questions connected with the ecclesiastical calendar and the right calculation of Easter. Under the second head, that of theological works, fall hie Expositiones on St Mark’s and St Luke’s Gospels, on the A cts, and other books of the New Testament, his homilies, forty-nine in number, and a book of Prayers, chiefly made up of verses taken from the Psalms. Under the head of “Historical lives of five abbots of Wearmouth and Jarrow, a life of St Cuthbert, another of St Felix, bishop of Nola, and a Martyrology, which has several times been printed. The Ecclesiastical History opens with a preface, in which, in that tone of calmness and mild dignity which go far to make a perfect prose style, Beda explains in detail the nature and the sources of the evidence on which he has relied in compiling the work. Λ short introduction then sketches the general history of Britain from the landing of Julius Caesar to the coming of Augustine, giving special details respecting the martyrdom of St Alban under Diocletian, and the missionary preaching of St Germanus of Auxerre in the 5th century. From the landing of Augustine in 596 to the year 731, the progress of Christianity, the successes and the reverses of the church in the arduous work of bringing within her pale the fiercely warring nations of the Heptarchy, are narrated, fully but unsystematically, for each kingdom of the Heptarchy in turn. A short sketch of “Universal History,” forming the latter portion of the De Ratiοne Temporum, has been treated by the editors of the Monumenta Hist. Brit, as if it were a separate work, and printed, with the title De Sex Aetatibus Mundi, in that useful but unwieldy volume. Among the poetical works are a life of St Cuthbert in Latin hexameters, a number of hymns, most of which are written in the lively iambic metre of which a familiar instance is the hymn beginning “Vexilla regis prodeunt,” a poem on Justin Martyr in a trochaic metre, and another in hexameters on the Day of Judgment. This last seems to have been much admired; Simeon of Durham copied it entire into his history. The versification of this remarkable poem has considerable merits; in that respect it is not more than three hundred years behind Claudian. But when we come to the spirit of the poem, and think of the moral atmosphere which it implies, and aims at extending, we see that ten thousand years would not adequately measure the chasm which divides the monastic poets from the last “vates” of heathen Rome. For the key-note of Beda’s poem is the sense of sin; whatever is expressed by the words compunction, penance, expiation, heart-crushing sorrow for having offended God, trust in the one Redeemer, pervades all his lines; and we need not say how alien is all this to the spirit of the poets, who, with little thought of individual and personal reformation, staked their all in the future upon the greatness and stability of Rome. “Tu regere imperio populos, Romane, memento.” The letters, most of which are merely the dedications and addresses prefixed to some of his works, refer little to contemporary events; two or three, however, are of great interest.

At the time when Beda died (735), the Angles of Northumbria were beginning to lay aside the use of arms, and zealously to frequent the monastery schools; among their princes, as among those of Wessex, some were found to exchange a crown for a cowl and a throne for a cell. But a reaction set in; perhaps some had tried asceticism who had no vocation for it; and after the middle of the century Northumbrian history is darkened by the frequent record of dissension among the members of the royal house, civil war, and assassination. On this state of things came the ravages of the Northmen, and made it incurable. Lindisfarne, with all its treasures and collections, was destroyed by them in 793. This is but a sample of the havoc wrought by those barbarians; yet for a long time many monasteries escaped; and, in particular, that of York was a centre of learning far on into the 9th century, probably till the disastrous battle occurred before York, described in the Saxon Chronicle under 867. At this monastery Alcuin was educated, and when grown up he had charge of its school and library. In 780 he was sent on a mission to Rome; on his return, at Parma, he fell in with the emperor Charlemagne, who invited him to settle at Aix-la-Chapelle, at that time the chief imperial residence, to teach his children, and aid in the organization of education throughout his dominions. Having obtained the permission of his superiors at York, Alcuin complied with the request; and from that time to his death, in 804, resided, with little intermission, either at the imperial court or at Tours. Alenin’s letters, though the good man was of a somewhat dry and pedantic turn, contain much matter of interest. His extant works are of considerable bulk; they are chiefly educational and theological treatises, which for lack of vigour or originality of treatment have fallen into complete oblivion. What is still of value in the works of Alcuin is, besides the letters, the lives of St Willibrord, the English apostle of Friesland, St Vedast, and St Richer.

After the death of Alcuin, the confusion in Northumbria became ever worse and worse, for the Danes forced their way into the land, and many years passed before the two nations could agree to live on friendly terms together side by side. But for the Durham Gospels, a version in the Angle dialect of the four gospels, and a few similar remains, the north of England presents a dead blank to the historian of literature from Alcuin to Simeon of Durham, a period of more than three hundred years. In the south, as we have seen, the resistance to the intrusion of the barbarian element was more successful, and the intellectual atmosphere far less dark. The works of Aelfric, who died archbishop of Canterbury in 1006, are the last subject of consideration in the present section. They are chiefly interesting because they show the growing importance of the native language. Aelfric’s Homilies are in Anglo-Saxon; his Colloquy is a conversation on common things, in Latin and Anglo-Saxon, between a master and his scholar; his Grammar, adapted from Priscian and Donatus, has for its object to teach Latin to Anglo-Saxons; its editorial and didactic part is therefore iu Anglo-Saxon. The annals of public events, to which, as collected and arranged by Archbishop Plegmund at the end of the 9th century, we give the name of the Saxon Chronicle, continued to be recorded at Canterbury in the native language till about the date of the Conquest; after that time the task passed into the hands of the monks of Peterborough, and was carried on by them for nearly a hundred years. A work of collecting and transcribing the remains of the national poetry began, of which the priceless volume known as the Exeter Codex, given by bishop Leofric to the library of Exeter cathedral in the reign of Edward the Çonfessor, is the monument and the fruit. The collection contained in the manuscript discovered about fifty years ago at Vercelli was probably made about the same time. Tn these two collections are contained the works of Cynewulf, the Traveller's Song, Guthlac, Andreas, the poem on the Phoenix, <fcc. Being thus made more widely known, the ancient poems would soon have found imitators, and a fresh development of Anglo-Saxon poetry would have been the result. Had there been no violent change, England would by slow degrees have got through with the task of [9:8:407] assimilating and taming the Northmen; and, in spite of physical isolation, would have participated, though probably lagging far behind the rest, in the general intellectual advance of the nations of Europe. The tissue of her civilization would have been, in preponderating measure, Teutonic, like that of Germany; but it would have lacked the golden thread of the “Holy Roman Empire,” which brought an element of idealism and beauty into the plain texture of German life. For good or for evil, the process of national and also of intellectual development was to be altered and quickened by the arrival of a knightly race of conquerors from across the channel.

II. Anglo-Norman Period, 1066-1215.—The 11tlι century is remarkably barren in great names and memories which captivate the imagination; it was, however, an advance upon the 10th, which Baronius has described as the central and worst period of intellectual darkness. In England, for about 150 years after the Conquest, there was no unity of intellectual life; in political life, however, the iron hand of the Conqueror compelled an external uniformity, by the universal exaction of homage to himself. The strength of the Norman monarchy, the absence of religious differences, and, after a time, the loss of Normandy, were causes working powerfully in aid of the conciliation and interfusion of the different elements of the population. But at first it was as if three separate nations were encamped confusedly on British soil,—the Normans, the English, and the Welsh. The clergy, as a fourth power, of all nationalities or of none, became,—by its use of Latin as a common tongue, by preaching a common faith and teaching a common philosophy, and as representing the equality and charity which are among the essential features of Christianity,—an ever present mediating influence tending to break down the partitions between the camps. The intellectual state and progress of each nation, down to and a little beyond the end of the 12th century, must now be briefly discussed.

1. Normans.— In less than two centuries after the Northmen under Rollo had settled in Normandy, they had not only exchanged their Teutonic speech for the language of France, but made,—with French as the medium of expression,—remarkable literary progress, In this progress the Normans settled in England participated to the full. It is probable that the Turoldus, who, availing himself of earlier Frankish lays and chronicles, composed towards the end of the 11th century the noble heroic poem called the Chanson de Poland, was an abbot of Peterborough, son of the clerk of the same name who was the Conqueror’s preceptor. From the reign of Henry I., though the names of several writers are known, little of importance has come down to us. The treatise on politeness called Urbanus, attributed to Henry himself, is in all probability the composition of a later age. The works of the hapless satirist, Luc de la Barre, are not extant, and Evrard’s translation (1130) of Cato’s Disticha into French verse is not a noteworthy performance. The reign of Stephen, though confusion and civil war prevailed over a great part of England, witnessed an extraordinary outburst of literary activity. Of the historians who shed a lustre on this reign we shall speak in a different connexion; but it was also memorable for its French poets. Guichard of Beaulieu, a cell of St Alban’s (1150), produced a poem in Alexandrines of some merit, on the vices of the age; Geoffrey Gaimar (1140) wrote his lively Estorie des Engles (a chronicle of the Anglo-Saxon kings); and Benoit de Ste More, either in this reign or early in that of Henry IL, produced a vast poem on the History of the War of Troy, which seems to have been the original exemplar on which the numerous “Troy-books” of later generations were modelled. The family of Benoit was of Norman extraction, but settled in England. Under Henry IL, whose ceaseless and enlightened energy stimulated production wherever it was exerted, French poetry took an ever bolder sweep. Robert Wace, a native of Jersey and a clerk of Caen, composed about 1155 his famous Brut T Angleterre, a history of the kings of Britain from Brutus to Cadwallader, founded on the Historia Britonum of Geoffrey of Monmouth. Again, when Henry had commissioned Benoit to write a metrical history of the dukes of Normandy, the quick-witted Wace anticipated his slower rival, and produced in 1160 the first part of the Roman de Pou, treating of the same subject.

Thus far we have considered the Anglo-Norman poets chiefly as chroniclers; we have now to regard them as romance writers. It is true that in their hands history slides into romance, and vice versa; thus the Brut (V Angleterre may be regarded as historical in so far as it treats of the series of British kings, mythical as that series itself may be, but as a romance in most of that portion of it which is devoted to the adventures of Arthur. We here enter upon a wide field; the stores of Arthurian, Carlovingian, and general chivalrous romance suggest themselves to the mind; a thousand interesting inquiries present themselves; but the limits traced for us prescribe a treatment little more than allusive; that is, French romance can only be described in virtue of the stimulating and suggestive effect which it had on English writers. This effect was produced in a measure by great poems like the Alexandreis (1200), by the original French romances on Charlemagne and his peers, and by that on the third crusade and the prowess of King Richard. But the romances relating to Arthur, doubtless on account of the extent to which they really sprang from British soil, were those which most profoundly stirred the English mind. It is not difficult to trace the steps by which the legend grew. Gildas, writing in the 6th century, knows of Arthur’s victory at Mount Badon, but does not name him. Nennius, whose date is uncertain, but who should probably be assigned to the 9th century, mentions the same victory as one of several which were gained by “the magnanimous Arthur” over the Saxon invader. Three centuries pass, and the story comes to us again, greatly amplified, in the British History of Geoffrey of Monmouth (1126). This history, Geoffrey assures us, was founded upon a book in the Breton language, brought over from Britanny by an archdeacon of Oxford. Ritson scouted the assertion as fictitious, yet it was probably true; and the supposition of a Breton origin for his history is exactly what would best account for .the great development which we find the Arthur legend to have now attained, in comparison with the age of Nennius. For Britanny was the fruitful parent of numberless forms of imaginative fiction,—a trait noticed by Chaucer:

“These olde gentil Bretons in their daies, Of divers aventures maden laies and what character would the Breton bards be more likely to embellish than that of the hero king, who, during and before the migration of their forefathers, had made such a gallant stand against the Saxon? Yet, though Geoffrey has so much to tell us of Arthur, he is silent about the Round Table. That splendid feature of the legend first appears in the Brut of Wace, and was probably derived from Breton poems or traditions to which Geoffrey had not access. Layamon reproduces it, with additional details, in his version of Wace. Other branches of Arthurian romance, especially those relating to Tristan and Perceval, became about this time widely popular; it is to this period also that the Chevalier du Lion of Chrétien de Troyes belongs. Suddenly there is a great change. A [9:8:408] cycle of romance, which till now had breathed only of revenge, slaughter, race-hatreds, unlawful love, magic, and witchcraft, becomes transformed in a few years into a series of mystical legends, symbolizing and teaching one of the profoundest dogmas of the Catholic creed. This strange effect was produced by the infusion into the Arthur legend of the conception of the Saint Craal, the holy vessel used by Christ at the Last Supper, and containing drops of his blood, which Joseph of Arimathea was said to have brought into Britain. This transformation seems to have been executed by Walter Map, the remarkable Welshman whose genius decisively colours the intellectual history of the last forty years of the 12 th century. Map is said to have written a Latin history of the Graal, which is not now extant; yet from it all the authors of the French prose romances on Arthur and the Saint Graal which appeared between 1170 and 1230—Robert de Borron, his kinsman Hélie, Luc de Gast, and Map himself—profess to have translated their compositions. The chief of these works are the Saint Graal, Merlin, the Quest of the Saint Graal, Lancelot, Tristan, and Mort Artur. In all, to “achieve the Saint Graal,” that is, to find or see the holy vessel which, on account of the sins of men, had long since vanished from Britain, is represented as the height of chivalrous ambition: but among all Arthur’s knights, only Sir Galahad, the son of Lancelot, is sufficiently pure in heart to be favoured with the sublime vision. English versions, more or less literal, of these romances, among which may be named the works of Lonelich and Sir Thomas Malory, and the alliterative poem of Joseph of Arimathie, attest the great and enduring popularity of the Graal form of Arthurian legend.

2. After a long period of silence, the bardic poetry of Wales broke out, just when the independence of the nation was about to be extinguished, into passionate and varied utterance. The princes who struggled successfully against the attacks of Henry II. found gifted bards—Gwalchmai, Elidir, Gwiυn, &c.—to celebrate in fiercely patriotic strains their imperfect triumphs. A translation of one of Gwalchmai’s odes may be found, under the title of the Triumph of Given, among Gray’s poems. Supposed “Prophecies of Merlin,” a sample of which may be seen in the strange work of Geoffrey of Monmouth, fed the popular belief that Arthur yet lived, and would return one day to Wales as a deliverer. Both the Triads and the Mabinogion refer in part to Arthur, but from different stand-points. In the Triads such mention as there is of him represents him as a British king, doing battle with the foes of his race, and full of a sententious wit and wisdom. In the Mabinogion the indigenous Welsh view is overpowered by that of the Norman trouvères; we have the Arthur, not of history or tradition, but of chivalry; the mysterious Saint Graal proves as attractive to the Celtic as to the Teutonic imagination. Three of the romances by Chrétien de Troyes appear in a Welsh dress among the tales of the Mabinogion. After the loss of independence under Edward I., the importance and originality of Welsh literature appear to have progressively declined.

3. The English-speaking portion—that is, the great mass—of the population, down to the reign of John, has left few literary traces of its existence. Whoever wished to move amongst the educated and cultured classes, and to associate with persons of rank, authority, or influence, found it necessary, though he might be descended from Alfred himself, to speak French in good society, and to write in French whatever he wished good society to read. From the Conquest to 1200, the industry of the most lynx-eyed antiquary has discovered—with the exception of the continuation of the Saxon Chronicle—no literary record in English beyond a few short fragments, such as the lines preserved as a part of Canute’s song by Thomas of Ely, the prophecy of Here, and the hymn of St Godric. The continuation beyond the Conquest of the Saxon Chronicle was made by the monks of Peterborough. It is not complete for the reign of Stephen, passing over several years sub silentio ; but it records the accession of Henry II. in 1154, and then ends abruptly. The writer or writers were perhaps unable to stand up any longer against the then universal fashion of employing Latin for any serious prose work. Moreover, as the Anglo-Saxon was no longer taught in schools nor spoken in the higher circles of society, it had lost much of its original harmony and precision of structure; and “when the annalist found himself using one inflexion for another, or dropping inflexions altogether, he may well have thought it high time to exchange a tongue which seemed to be crumbling and breaking up, for one whose forms were fixed and its grammar rational. Little did the down-hearted monk anticipate the future glories which, after a crisis of transformation and fusion, would surround his rude ancestral tongue.”^[1. Arnold’s Manual of English Literature.]

A few years after the beginning of the 13th century we have to note the appearance of an important and interesting work in English,—Layamon’e Brut. But it can scarcely be said to belong to English literature, unless Beoιvulf and Judith be similarly classified, for the language is almost as purely Teutonic as in these. In the older version of the Brut not more than fifty words of Latin or French origin have been found; and of these several were in common use in England before the Conquest. The Brut is strictly a monument of the age of transition. We need not, with some writers, call the language “semi-Saxon ;” it is certainly English, and, from a particular point of view, purer English than we speak now; but it is not that form of English which, from first to last, has been the instrument employed to build up English literature. That form, as we shall see in the next section, was determined and conditioned by the necessity of effecting a compromise between the speech of the governors and that of the governed, so that the new standard English should remain, as to its grammatical framework, comparatively intact, while admitting to its franchise, and enrolling among its vocables, an indefinite number of foreign recruits.

The work of Layamon is a translation, but with very considerable additions, of Wace’s Brut d ’ Angleterre. The most interesting of these additions (the sources of which have not been as yet pointed out) constitute an expansion of the legendary history of Arthur. Layamon was the parish priest of Ernley-on-Severn (now Areley Regis), a remote Worcestershire village, far from the capital or any large city. At such a place Norman influence would be at a minimum; the people would go on from one generation to another, living and speaking much as their fathers did before them; and we may suppose that, finding some indications of literary taste and poetic feeling among members of his flock, the good Layamon took this way of gratifying them. But it must be carefully observed that in the Brut, although the language is English, the poetical atmosphere, the intellectual horizon, and even the cast of diction, are Norman-French. The rich poetic vocabulary of the Anglo-Saxon poets, traceable as late as the reigu of Edgar, has vanished beyond recovery. Not one of the innumerable poetic compounds relating to battle and victory which are found in Beowulf, Andreas, &c., occurs in the duller pages of the Brut. Words expressive of jurisdiction and government, of which the Anglo-Saxon, while the native race was dominant, had a great variety, are in the Brιιt, if used at all, borrowed to a large extent from French.
[9:8:409]

The labours of the clergy and monks during all this period were applied with unwearying diligence and signal success to the building up of a Latin literature. In the list of chroniclers occur the well-known names of Florence of Worcester, William of Malmesbury, and Henry of Huntingdon. Many histories of particular monasteries were written, and have recently to a large extent been made accessible, through the labours of editors employed under the superintendence of the Master of the Rolls. St Anselm, archbishop of Canterbury in the reigns of William II. and Henry I., employed his great metaphysical and dialectical powers in the endeavour to establish a harmony between reason and faith. The scholastic philosophy, technically speaking, began with Peter Lombard and his Book of Sentences (1151); from the university of Paris it spread all over Europe; and in the next period it will be seen that several of the most eminent schoolmen were natives of the British Isles. The works of our countrymau, John of Salisbury, who studied and resided much at Paris about the middle of the century, throw a curious light on the tenets and mutual relations of the scholastic sects.

III. Amalgamation of Paces.—Commencements of English Literature, 1215-1350.—The course of events in this period, as bearing upon literature, may be thus described. The fortunate loss of Normandy in 1204 brought the ruling classes and the commonalty of England closer together, put an end to the transmarine nationality and domicile of the former, and gave a common political interest, in relation to the outside world, to all the dwellers on English soil. Thus two out of the four nations, which we spoke of in the last section as encamped side by side on British territory, were soon in a fair way of being fused into one. The third— the Welsh—losing in 1292 its political independence, lost also with it the pretension, and almost the desire, to maintain a separate literature. Still, however, in spite of common interests, and the ever-growing multiplicity of the ties of blood between the two, Norman and Englishman continued each to speak his own language. Layamon, about 1205, and Ormin, fifteen or twenty years later, write for the English-speaking majority which understands little or no French; from French their language is just as alien as the Flemish of the present day. The first great step towards that blending of tongues which was to crown the blending of families already commenced was taken when the English writers and translators of the 13th century (the terms are almost synonymous), began to admit freely into their writings an unlimited number of those generally intelligible French words of which the stock was, through closer intercourse between the governors and the governed, perpetually on the increase. Of this practice Robert of Gloucester and Robert Manning are conspicuous examples. In spite of this approximation, we shall find that strenuous efforts were made, by or on behalf of the upper classes, to retain French as the common literary language, and keep English in the position of a popular dialect, useful for the common purposes of life, but not vivified by genius or polished by contact with refined lips. Of this effort Robert Grosseteste, bishop of Lincoln, may be considered the centre. It broke down, however, against the force of circumstances. First, as fast as good French books were produced, Englishmen translated them, and the translations probably found ten readers for one who could enjoy the originals; secondly, the wars between England and France which broke out in 1338, and in which the English-speaking archers—the back-bone of the stout yeomanry, now, alas! no more, which then covered the land—won the chief share of glory, must have greatly tended to discredit among Englishmen of all classes the tongue of their enemies. Trevisa says that the popular rage for speaking French which had existed before the “grete deth” (the plague of 1348), was since then “somdele chaunged.” Though he naturally refers to a date still fresh in every one’s memory, the change could have had nothing to do with the plague; it was probably, as conjectured above, the effect of the French war. By the middle of the 14th century the industry of the translators had produced a great body of English compositions, coloured everywhere by French thought, and studded with French words, the preaching of the friars had for a hundred years been working in the same direction, i.e., to break down the partition not only between the races but between the tongues; the war suddeuly gave to English an enormous advantage over its rival in respect of popularity; it need not therefore surprise us to find, as we shall find in the next period, a great native writer choosing English for the instrument of his thought, and founding English literature upon an imperishable basis.

In the last section we saw that Latin, the language of the clerical community, was holding its ground vigorously and successfully against the different forms of vernacular speech current in England. While these last remained in a rude and unsettled condition, it was inevitable that Latin should enjoy this superiority. But the French language was ever growing in importance; its grammatical forms were by this time tolerably settled, and its modes of derivation fixed; it was a spoken tongue, and the Latin was not. Hence, about the date of Magna Charta (1215), French begins to appear in our public instruments, Latin having been the documentary language since the Conquest; about 1270 it begins to supersede Latin as the language of private correspondence. Latin thenceforward was less and less used as the language of poetry, the vehicle of satire, or the voice of piety; French took its place. The theologian, the philosopher, and the annalist alone remained faithful to Latin, the third more out of habit perhaps, and because he had inherited the great works of the past, the histories of Beda, Florence, &c., than because his work could not have been competently performed in French. To this period belong the important chronicle of Matthew Paris, who died in 1259, that of Nicholas Trivet, and the Polychronicoη (or at any rate the earlier portion of it) of Ranulf Higden. Great developments of the scholastic theology were made in this period, chiefly by the new orders of friars founded about its commencement, the children of St Francis and St Dominic. Two of the most celebrated of the Franciscan writers, Duns Scotus and William of Occam, were natives of the British isles; they were respectively the chiefs of the realists and nominalists, the parties representing among the schoolmen Platonic and Aristotelian theories. Robert Holcot, a distinguished Dominican writer and a nominalist, was carried off by the plague of 1348.

Philosophy now for the first time, in the person of Roger Bacon, devotes herself systematically to the study of nature and its laws. This great man, the chief part of whose long life was spent in the Franciscan friary at Oxford, died in 1292. The main plan of his principal work, the Opus Majus, was—in the words of Dr Whewell—“to urge the necessity of a reform in the mode of philosophizing, to set forth the reasons why knowledge had not made a greater progress, to draw back attention to sources of knowledge which had been unwisely neglected, to discover other sources which were yet wholly unknown, and to animate men to the undertaking by a prospect of the vast advantages which it offered.” But the subsidiary aids which physical science requires were wanting to him, and in that rude age could only be obtained with extreme difficulty. Mathematical instruments were terribly expensive; tables were scarcely to be hid; books were both [9:8:410] rare and costly. That he discovered so much as he did— chiefly in chemistry and optics—is a thing to wonder at. Vague reports of these discoveries circulating among the ignorant populace caused Roger Bacon to be deemed a conjuror or necromancer; the chap-books and low comedies of the reign of Elizabeth represent him exclusively in this light.

-, In the reign of Henry III. a strong effort was made to make French the exclusive literary language of the English people. It was a struggle between the tongue of the upper class and the tongue of the middle class. Robert Grosseteste, the admired and venerated bishop of a great see, was surrounded by ecclesiastics of rank, and in constant intercourse with earls and barons. All such persons would speak French; those that were laymen would stand in great need of spiritual and moral instruction, and this could not well be conveyed to them in any language but their own; it was quite natural, therefore, that the bishop should encourage the writing of French treatises; and it is probable that he sincerely thought the English tongue not to be worth cultivating for the purposes of literature. He may be excused for holding this opinion, if the only specimens of it which he had seen on paper were such as the Orrnulum, or even as Layamon’s Brut. A French work, the Manuel de Peche, treating of the decalogue and the seven deadly sins, which are illustrated with many legendary stories, was formerly ascribed to Grosseteste— it is now known to have been the work of William of Waddington; yet if the statement be true, that it is a version of a little known Latin treatise, there remains a probability that the bishop, in pursuance of a general plan of action, encouraged Waddington to make his version. To the Chastel TAmour, a work of devotion dwelling on the mode of the miraculous incarnation of the Redeemer, Grosseteste’s claim seems to be better founded; if he did not write it, he certainly caused it to be written. The same despair of making anything of English, or the same connexion with a circle of readers in the upper ranks of society, led Peter Langtoft, a canon of Bridlington, in spite of his unmistakably English name, to write in French a rhyming chronicle of English history, which he brings down to 1307. Other cases might be mentioned; in fact, as Warton says, “anonymous French pieces both in prose and verse, and written about this time, are innumerable in our manuscript repositories.” There were French originals of Guy of Warwick, Bevis of Hamtouη, and many other romances, although few of them are now extant

But if the attack was vigorous, the defence was sturdy and persistent, with a tenacity which spoke of final victory. Ormin’s rhythmic gospels (supposed to have been written about 1225), though the orthography proceeds upon a theory, and is so far interesting, presents, it must be admitted—owing to the strangeness of the spelling, the want of rhyme, and the paucity of words of Latin origin— a barbarous, almost repulsive, aspect to the reader. The war of the barons in Henry III.’s reign, in which the cause of Leicester and other French-speaking aristocrats was taken up by the mass of the people with unmeasured enthusiasm, certainly had the effect of introducing a number of French words into the popular speech. This may be gathered from the remarkable English ballad on the battle of Lewes (1264), written by a partisan of Leicester, the phraseology of which is marked by almost the same proportion of words of French origin as prevails in modern English. Moreover, the movement of the verse is vigorous and free, and such as befits a language that is fast rising into importance, and has a great destiny before it. In the reign of Edward I. appeared the English rhyming chronicle of Robert of Gloucester. The early portion of it is founded on Wace’s Brut, but the author continues the history down to 1272, the date of Edward’s accession. Robert is a plodding dull writer, but his work proves that he knew of a considerable class of persons who knew no French, yet were capable of deriving pleasure from literature; it is for this class that his somewhat ponderous poem was intended. The pretty poem describing a contest between an owl and a nightingale (date about 1270) is in the dialect of the south of England. It is no translation, but seems to have been suggested by passages in the Roman de la Rose. Many English romances, c.y., Havelok, King Horn, King Alexander, Richard I., Guy of Warwick, &c., date from the reign of Edward L, or, say, from the last twenty years of the 13th century. Most of these are translations from the French; in the case of Havelok, however, this remains to be proved, no French version (other than the sketch, much earlier in date, given in Gairnar’s Estorie) being now extant. There is a French version of King Horn, but it differs greatly from the English romance, and there is good reason for believing that the English poem is the earlier of the two. Both Havelok and King Horn are founded on Anglo-Danish traditione current in the east of England; on this account, and in consideration of the long intellectual blight which the Danish inroads produced in those parts of the country, they are extremely interesting and valuable. They abound in French words, and on reading them we feel that a language which has become so fluent, flexible, and accommodating cannot but make its way and attain to predominance.

Perhaps the works of no single writer contributed so much to this result as those of Robert Manning, or, as he is also called, Robert of Brunne. Robert was a monk of the order founded by St Gilbert of Sempringham; his monastery was in South Lincolnshire. He belongs to the reigns of Edward II. and Edward III.; the date of his death is unknown; but it was probably about 1340. He executed a new version of Wace’s Brut in octosyllabic rhyming verse, and added to it a translation of the French rhyming chronicle of Peter Langtoft, mentioned in a previous paragraph. He also translated Waddington’s Manuel des Peches, adding many characteristic and lively passages which make his version much more entertaining than the original work. To all these labours the good monk was impelled, not by the love of fame, w'hich would have been more easily gratified if he had written in French, but by the benevolent desire to give his lay friends and acquaintances something pleasant to read and talk about,— “For to haf solace and gamen,

In felauschip when tha sit samen [together].”

We have found that by degrees men of better, or at least equal, mark have taken to writing in English, as compared with those who preferred French; for instance, Robert Manning is at least equal as a versifier to Peter Langtoft. In the next section will be described the rise of Chaucer, Langlaud, and Gower, and the final victory of the native speech.

IV. Early English Literature, 1350-1477 —The period at which we have arrived comprises about 120 years, ending at the date of the introduction of printing into England. During all this time the scholastic philosophy reigned undisturbed at the universities. Wickliffe, so far as his methods of argument and reliance on logic were concerned, was as much a schoolman as the friars who contended with him. The time was not yet come when a churchman would be found, like Colet, to decry the scholastic methods, and rely on literature rather than on logic. Wickliffe’s first attacks upon the established order were directed, not against doctrine, but against the encroachments of the church upon the state, against the holding of temporal “lordship” or authority by ecclesiastical persons, and [9:8:411] against the claim asserted by the Pope to receive “Peter’s pence,” or an equivalent, from the English nation. These views he was said to have borrowed from Marsilius of Padua and John of Gaudun; but in truth such Ghibeline sentiments were so common in France and Germany, as well as Italy, that it is needless, in Wickliffe’s case, to attempt to trace them to particular authors. Afterwards he broached some singular opinions on several abstruse points of metaphysics, which led to “determinations” or treatises being published against him by John Kyningham, a Carmelite, and John Tyssington, a Franciscan. Lastly, he aroused a theological storm, about 1380, by reviving something like the condemned heresy of Berengarius on the mode of the presence of Christ in the sacrament. Replies were written by Wynterton, Wells, Berton, and others. A synod met in London and condemned Wickliffe’s doctrine; he died at Lutterworth soon afterwards. The whole complex controversy which he had stirred up was taken in hand, some years later, by a man of vast ability and learning, Thomas Walden the Carmelite, one of the English theologians who took part in the council of Constance. Walden’s Doctrinale Fidei has been more than once printed on the Continent.

All the writings hitherto described were in Latin. But Wickliffe, on the principle “Flectere si nequeo superos, Acheronta movebo,” resolved to carry the conflict into a more spacious arena, and to appeal to popular sympathy by writing in the language of the people. He preached and circulated many English sermons; he organized his “pore priestes” as a body of itinerant preachers; assisted by his followers he put into circulation an incredible number of English tracts, directed against abuses in discipline, and what he deemed errors in doctrine. Lastly, he caused to be made a complete English translation of the Vulgate Bible, and himself, in all probability, took a considerable share in the work. His efforts, seconded by those of his principal adherents, such as Herford, Repington, Purvey, Ac., gave rise to the sect of the Lollards, which must have rapidly grown into importance, since it received marked notice in the poetry (written probably between 1380 and 1390), of both Chaucer and Gower. The famous Act “De heretico comburendo” of 1401, and the rigid inquisitorial measures instituted by Archbishop Arundel, and carried on by Chichely, drove Lollardism beneath the surface of society and from the pages of avowed literature. Yet, though repressed, the spirit of discontent survived. Many Lollards were burnt so late as in the first year of Henry VIIT.; and the rain of pamphlets and ballads against the church and the clergy, which burst forth as soon as the king was ascertained to be hostile to them, was a sufficient indication of the pent-up hatred which filled the breasts of thousands.

The career of Pecock, bishop of Chichester, may be regarded as an incident of Lollardism. Feeling sore and uneasy under the attacks which men, many of whom were undeniably earnest and moral, were making on the clergy and their doings, Pecock wrote in English The Repressor of over-much wytinge ∖ blamiηg^ ∖ of the Clcrgie. He thought that the time for appealing to authority was gone by, and that the Lollards could only be reconciled to the church by proving that her precepts and her ritual were in themselves reasonable. In short·, he made the reason of the individual the judge of the goodness, or otherwise, of what the church did and commanded. On this ground his brother bishops could not follow him; his books were condemned at a synod held in 1457, and he was deposed from his bishopric.

English literature in the full and proper sense, of which we saw the beginnings in the cumbrous alexandrines of Robert of Gloucester, and the more pleasing and successful writings of Manning, asserts itself in this period as a growth of time, destined to have thenceforward an independent being and a powerful influence. It is interesting to note that two distinct and rival tendencies now make their appearance, which may be described as the Teutonic affinity and the Franco-Latin affinity. The sturdiness and self-reliance of the old Saxon blood led many Englishmen to undervalue the culture of the day, which came from the South, and to look lovingly towards the old Teutonic rock from which they were hewn, in the faith that true light and deliverance were to be found there. Of this tendency Langland is the chief representative in the 14th century. He employs the old rhythm of the Teutonic nations,— alliteration; he rejects French models, and studies not French poets; the homely kindly life of the English lower and lower-middle classes is what he loves to depict; the covetousness and ambition of the foreign ecclesiastics who absorb English prelacies he is never tired of denouncing. The whole body of alliterating poets,—and recent investigation has shown that their number was considerable even down to the 16th century, the last known alliterative piece is by Dunbar,—represent, with Langland, this Teutonic affinity. Chaucer, Gower, Lydgate, and the writers who formed themselves upon them, represent the Franco-Latin affinity. Endowed with a more receptive temper and finer perceptions than the men of the opposite school, Chaucer opened his large heart and capacious intelligence to all forms of excellence within his reach; and a man so minded could not fail to see that what had been written in French and Italian far outweighed what had hitherto been written in English or German. Neither could his more cultivated ear fail to prefer the rhyme of the South to the alliteration of the North. “I am a Southron man,” he says under the mask of the Persone—

“I cannot geste, rom, ram, ruf, by my letter;”

that is, I cannot write alliterative poems like Langland. Wherever good words were to be had, Chaucer appropriated them, whether their origin were Saxon or Romance; wherever he found a good poem, he imitated it, often bettering the instruction. This veracity of the intellect, this large-mi ndedness, were the cause that our early literature was laid on broad foundations, and contributed not a little to the many-sided and sympathetic character of our language.

The labours of Tyrwhitt and Warton, and in our own day of Sandras and Ten-Brink, have laid bare the sources whence the genius of Chaucer drew its materials and derived its kindling suggestions. The old notion that his earliest writings show the influence of the Provençal poetry has been abandoned on more accurate inquiry. The Complaynt of the Dethe of Rite, which is among the earliest, if not the earliest, of the extant compositions, is saturated with the French spirit. The great work of his early youth was the translation of the Roman de la Rose of Lorris and Meung,—a poem, be it remembered, not the growth of Normandy, but of France proper, not the work of trouvères, but of French poets. This transformation and sublimation of the romance of the earlier into the dream and allegory of the later Middle Ages, originated by the genius of Lorris, was eagerly adopted by Chaucer, most of whose pieces, prior to the great work of his life, the Canterbury Tales, were cast in the allegorical mould. This is the case with the Assembly of Foules, where the gentle “formel eagle” is believed to represent Isabel, daughter of Edward III., betrothed in 1364 to Engelram de Couci, as the formel is in the poem to the “royal tercel.” Again the Poke of the Duchesse, on the death of Blanche, duchess of Lancaster, in 1369, is, in form, a vision seen in a dream; it is also full of actual borrowings from the French poets Lorris, Meung, and Machault. The [9:8:412] mannerism of the French poets is also present in the Court of Love and the House of Fame, compositions which probably belong to Chaucer’s middle life. Even in the Legende of Goode Women, a work of his later years, many passages, particularly the beautiful lines rehearsing his annual worship of the daisy, are significant of the degree in which his mind was still imbued with the graceful and fanciful conceptions of the French poets.

But the sunny south produced in that age other poets beside the French, poets the force and melody of whose writings caused the glory of Lorris and Machault to wax pale in comparison. Chaucer must have become acquainted with Boccaccio at an early age, for in the Assembly of Foules, written when he was only twenty-four or twenty-five, several stanzas are translated from the description, in the Theseide of the Italian poet, of the garden of Queen Nature. With Petrarch he is believed on reasonable grounds to have become acquainted during his visit to Italy in 1373; the charming allusion to the “lauréat poete,” in the prologue to the “Clerke’s Tale,” is familiar to every reader. Dante, whom he calls “the grete poete of Itaille,” supplied him with a vision in the “House of Fame,” and with the materials of one of the tragedies in the “Monke’s Tale,” the story of Count Ugolino. But it was to Boccaccio that his obligations were the largest; from his 7 ’ 77o∙√rαfo he translated, though, with many additions and alterations, his Troylus and Cryseyde; the “Knighte’s Tale” is in the main a translation of the Theseide, and two or three other Canterbury Tales are more or less close renderings of stories in the Decameron. Italian was then in a far more advanced stage, one better suited for literary purposes, than English; and it must be set down as undoubtedly due to his Italian studies that in Chaucer’s hands our language,—which seventy years before had appeared as a barbarous dialect in the mouth of Robert of Gloucester, and, even as used by Langland, Chaucer's contemporary, is harsh and crabbed,— was proved to be rich in sweetness and harmony, no less than in force.

After all, had Chaucer done no more than has been already indicated, though he would have deserved credit for polishing and regularizing the language, and would have left models of style for later ages to imitate, he would not have earned the praise of a great and immortal poet. In this category, however, he is definitively placed, in virtue of the original portions of the Canterbury Tales. Not only is the Prologue the work of a great literary artist, drawing from nature with an incomparable force, sureness, and freedom of hand, but the whole series of linking passages, besides many of the tales, which, though the materials are old, are transfigured by the treatment they receive, attest the presence of a masterly intellect and an unfailing imagination. He “saw life thoroughly and saw it whole ;” his somewhat keen and caustic temper opened his eyes to the tricks of hypocrites and pretenders, which his manly straightforwardness made him expose without ceremony; on the other hand, the noble and really superior cast of his character placed him in full sympathy with those who in heroic self-denial were following under his eyes the counsels of perfection. Over against the portraits of Monk, Friar, and Pardoner in the Prologue, may be set the legend of Sainte Cecile, the “Alan of Lawe’s Tale,” and the exquisite opening stanzas of the “Prioress’s Tale.” In that peculiar combination of great force of handling with grace and versatility, on which the availability and effect of poetic genius so largely depend, Chaucer may be placed in a trio with Shakespeare and Pope, and no fourth name in English literature can, from this point of view, he raised to their level.

Coming to speak of Gower after Chaucer, we descend, as we now clearly see, through an enormous interval; but this distance was not so apparent to their contemporaries and immediate successors. “Ancient Gower” was a favourite with Richard IL, and was also prudent enough to pay his court betimes to the young Duke of Lancaster, soon to be Henry IV. His Confessio Amantis is coloured by all the profanity and much of the cynicism which belong to Jean de Meung’s portion of the Roman de la. Rose. It may be observed, in passing, that the Roman was the product of a kind of minor renaissance, or revival of ancient learning. The Somnium Scipionis of Macrobius gave the dream-form, and Ovid’s Ars Amandi supplied an abundant store of amatory details. From this last, and from others of his poems, the counsels and warnings to lovers, with which the Roman, the Confessio Amantis, and many another popular poem of that day was stocked, were, partly by suggestion, partly by direct translation, derived. That the Ars Amandi should come to spread so wide an influence was a fact of no good omen to the morals of Europe. Refinement, even when little more than external, seems to exercise an invincible attraction on the human mind. The wit and suppleness of the Greek intellect, the polished luxury of the Roman empire, dazzled more and more the semi-cultivated society of Europe, and created a paganizing fashion, of which the moral results were often deplorable. Numbers even of ecclesiastics were carried away; bishops prided themselves on their elegant symposia; abbots, “purple as their wines,” thumbed Anacreon instead of their breviaries; and in spite of Savonarola and other reformers from within, no effectual check appeared for these evils till it was supplied by the rude blasts of the Reformation.

Dan Lydgate, the monk of Bury, was a loyal admirer and follower of Chaucer; and if the practice of poetry could make a perfect poet, he should stand, in virtue of his innumerable compositions, among those of the highest rank. But the language,—already rich and various, but unsettled in form and deficient in precedents,—escaped out of his control; to bend and tame it effectually while in such a condition required the strength of an intellectual giant, such as Chaucer was, but Lydgate certainly was not. We know that Chaucer took the greatest pains with his metre—

“So praye I to God, that none miswrite thee, Ne thee mysmetre for defaut of tonge but Lydgate, though, to recommend his mediocre thoughts, he should have taken much greater pains, took in fact much less. Perhaps some crude theory of poetic inspiration misled him, as it misleads poets of our own day, whose roughness and obscurity yield as unsatisfactory results as Lydgate’s roughness and mediocrity. The materials for his more important productions were chiefly French and Latin works of his own day, or not much earlier in date. Thus his Falls of Princes is from a French metrical version of Boccaccio’s Latin prose work, De Casibus Illustrium Virorum, and his Troy-book is founded on the Historia Trojana of Guido di Colonna, a Sicilian jurist of the 13th century. Lydgate’s admiration for Chaucer was undoubtedly sincere, and he probably attempted to imitate the best points of Chaucer’s style. If yet to a great extent he failed, this was perhaps due, not merely to the carelessness to which we have before adverted, but also to the influence of the barbarous writers of alliterative verse, whose activity at this period we described in the early part of this section. Alliterative rhythm is accentual, heroic rhythm is syllabic. An alliterative verse may have a varying number of syllables, but must have four accents; an heroic verse may have a varying number of accents, but must contain ten, or at most eleven, syllables. Of course the variation in either case is confined within certain limits, and the rules themselves are not without exceptions; [9:8:413] but into these details we have not space to enter. Suffice it to say, that the reason why there is so much halting metre in Lydgate, Hawes, Barclay, Harding, Juliana Berners, and other versifiers of the 15th and 16th centuries, would seem to be that, unlike Chaucer, they indulged in much of the syllabic licence of the alliterators, while yet they were not goths enough to adopt their rhythm altogether. Between the Teutonic and Franco-Latin stools, so to speak, they fell to the ground.

A recent writer, to whose labours the history of English literature is much indebted,^[2. Prof. H. Morley.] desiring to mark picturesquely the appearance of an art which he thought was destined to give the death-blow to medi⅛val superstition, has said that “in the year of the condemnation of Reginald Pecock for declaring that all truth would bear the test of reason and inquiry, John Fust or Faust and Peter Schoeffer printed a magnificent edition of the Psalter.” This shows how easily an attractive antithesis may become a trap for the unwary. The statement made in the protasis of the above sentence is untrue, and that in the apodosis irrelevant. Pecock was not condemned for “declaring that all truth would bear the test of reason and inquiry” (which of course his opponents believed as well as he), but for maintaining, along with other novel opinions, that reason was a better guide than authority as to the matter of revealed religion. Doubtless many would agree with him, but this is a very different proposition from the other. Nor again was the appearance of Fust’s Psalter an epoch in the history of printing, as the coincidence of dates, to be worth noticing, would require, for it was both preceded and followed by the production of more important works.

Yet it would not be easy to overrate the effect produced by the invention of printing on the development of literature, and the diffusion of those complex influences and arrangements which we call civilization. Language and its devices, as Horne Tooke showed in his Diversions of Parley, exist but to promote the rapid interchange of ideas between man and man; and the device of printing is a further long step in the same march, and a part of the same endeavour. By means of it, books reached in five years countries which before they had not reached in twenty, and readers were multiplied a hundred fold. Through it the speculations of scholars and the theories of philosophers could be quickly brought before the whole body of learned men and philosophers in Europe , hence arose counter speculations and adverse theories, which again obtained publicity with the same rapidity as the first, and to this process there was no limit. · Poetry, as being one of the more spontaneous growths of the human mind,— the child of passion and imagination, not of controversy,— owed comparatively little to the new invention. The literary annals of Spain furnish us with the names of more than a hundred poets who adorned the long reign of John II. of Castile, ere printing came into being; while for a century after the discovery, the poetic art was in a feeble and inert condition, both in Spain and England. On the other hand, historical studies of all kinds, since they flourish in proportion to the facilities given of collecting facts and materials,—and printing greatly enhanced these facilities,—received a sudden and highly beneficial impulse.

The first book certainly known to have been printed in England is the Dictes and Sayings of the Philosophers, a translation from the French; this was printed by Caxton in 1477, within the precints of the abbey of Westminster. The monks of St Alban’s soon set up a printing-press in their great monastery; and Oxford and Cambridge quickly followed suit. For fifteen years more Caxton laboured diligently in his vocation, and at his death in 1492 left the art of printing firmly established in England. An examination of the list of works which he printed shows what branches of literature were most in esteem in the English society of his day. Professor Craik enumerates forty-five works, which comprise all Caxton’s more important typographical performances. Of these, thirteen are religious and devotional, twelve are works of romance and chivalry or other prose fiction, seven are historical or legal works, five are English versions of classical authors, five handbooks or didactic works, and three editions of English poets. To the first class belong the Golden Legend (a translation of the collection of lives of saints under that name compiled by Jacobus de Voragine), a Liber Festivalis, or guide to church festivals, a L,ife of Saint Wynefrid, and several pious books translated from the French. Under the second head fall Malory’s English version of the great French prose romances of Arthur, the Ryal Book, a “Troybook” translated from the French of Raoul Le Fevre, the Book of Feats of Arms, and the Historye of Reynard the Foxe, translated from the Flemish. To the historical section belong Trevisa’s version of Higden’s Polychronicon, the Chronicles of England by Fabyan, and the statutes passed in the first year of Richard III. Among the classics offered to the English public were versions of the Aeneid and of Cicero De Senectute and De Am icitia, translated from French versions, and Chaucer’s rendering of Boethius’s De Consolatione Philosophice. The handbooks contain the Moral Proverbs of Christine de Pisan, a Boke of Good Manners, a Boke for Travellers, &c. The English poets, editions of parts of whose works were printed by Caxton, were, as was to be expected, Chaucer, Gower, and Lydgate.

In the period ending with 1350, we saw that the plant of English literature, though putting out some vigorous offshoots, in the poems of Nicolas of Guildford and Robert Manning, was still struggling with great linguistic difficulties, so that it remained uncertain whether, like Flemish literature in Belgium, it would not have to content itself with appealing to the humbler classes of the people, and leave to France the office of ministering to the intellectual and imaginative wants of all cultivated persons. In 1470 this doubt remained no more; the question had bcen finally settled in favour of native genius. England had now a literature in her own speech of which she might be proud,—authors whose manner and phraseology supplied models to allied but less advanced nationalities. James I. of Scotland, who was killed in 1436, speaks in the King's Quhair of the trio of English poets in terms of reverence comparable to those which Chaucer himself, in Troylus and Cryseyde, had used of the great poets of antiquity. But this success had only been gained by the wise exercise of that talent for compromise which we English, even to this day, are said to possess almost to a fault. English literature was to employ a language which in its structure and grammar indeed was Teutonic, but was to admit without scruple into its vocabulary thousands of French words which the upper classes, the descendants of the Norman invaders, were in the habit of using. It seemed as if both language and people were destined to hold a position midway between the European nations of Teutonic and those of Latin origin, to be interpreters between the one and the other, and thus to facilitate, for the numerous communities which in due time the English race was to plant over the world, the comprehension of the thoughts and the appreciation of the ideals of both.

V. Period of the Renaissance and the Reformation, 1477-1579.—The decline of the scholastic philosophy in England in the 15th century, as indeed in every other [9:8:414] country of Europe, was noticed in the last section. A new interest seized upon all the more lively intelligences, —that of recovering what, having passed into oblivion, might still be recoverable of the works of the ancients, as well as of appropriating thoroughly what was already known. In Latin literature the chief works had long been known; Virgil, Ovid, and even many of the works of Cicero, had for ages been the delight of scholars and the food of poets. But even in respect of these, the greater publicity which the multiplication of copies by the printingpress gave to them led to innumerable questions being stirred, which till then had lain comparatively dormant. The problems of textual, philological, and literary criticism, which the careful study of an author suggested to an acute mind, were taken up with eagerness by a large and ever-increasing circle of students. But it was Greek learning, because of the comparative newness of the field, and the inconceivable value of the treasures which it hid, that awakened the most intense and passionate interest. The story of the revival of Greek studies in Italy, towards the end of the 14th century, is as exciting to a sensitive intellect asany romance. Gradually the contagion of the learned frenzy which created a hundred academies and literary societies in the Italian cities spread itself across the Alps. England was but a very little, if at all, behind France. The steps by which a change of so much importance to literature was effected seem to be worth tracing with some minuteness. Without lingering over the names of Ciray, Phrea, and Vitelli, by each of whom something was done towards promoting Greek study at Oxford, we will begin with Linacre’s master, William Selling. An Oxonian, and a monk of Christ Church, Canterbury, Selling conceived a fervent desire to partake of the intellectual banquet provided in the schools of Florence, where the great Lorenzo was then ruling the republic; and about the year in which Sir Thomas More was born (1480) he travelled into Italy, and attended for some time the lectures of that prodigy of learning and talent, Angelo Politiano. While in Italy he learnt to read and speak Greek, and collected a number of Greek MSS.; but unluckily, soon after his return with these to England, they were destroyed by an accidental fire. Thomas Linacre, a Derbyshire boy, had Selling for his master at the Canterbury school; his capacity and zeal for study were great, and when Selling was sent on a mission into Italy by Henry VII. in 1486 or 1487, he took Linacre with him, and left him studying Greek under Politiano at Bologna. In these studies William Grocyn, an older man than Linacre, is mentioned by contemporaries as his “sodalis.” Having been for many years a fellow of New College, he visited Italy between 1480 and 1490, and studied chiefly at Florence, under Demetrius Chaicondyles and Politiano. “Grocyn,” says George Lilye, “was the first who publicly lectured on Greek literature at the university of Oxford, to crowded audiences of young men.” Grocyn was a somewhat hard, dry man; an Aristotelian, not a Platonist. Plato he regarded as a man who multiplied words, but in Aristotle he saw the founder of real science. His lectures seem to have been delivered between 1491 and 1500. Grocyn left no works behind him; but Linacre, who probably began to lecture in Greek when Grocyn ceased to do so, was a voluminous author and editor. To him we owe editions of the principal works of some of the Greek medical writers, and a Latin grammar, which was superseded in a few years by the more symmetrical Breviarium of William Lilye, commonly called Lilly s Grammar. An anecdote related of Linacre illustrates the enthusiasm for letters, mingled with a dash of pedantic absurdity, which characterized the age. When about to leave Italy and return to his native country, he erected at Padua an altar, which he dedicated to the genius of Italy; he crowned it with flowers, and burned iucense upon it. More, born in 1480, learnt Greek under Linacre at Oxford, in about the years 1496 and 1497. His Progymnasmata and Epigrams (the latter written conjointly with William Lilye) are the work of a man deeply imbued and inflamed with the classical spirit. The celebrated Dean Colet, whose eminent services to literature and education have been of late years examined and recorded by Seebohm, Lupton, and others, studied Greek in Italy a few years later than Grocyn and Linacre. He lectured at Oxford after 1497 on the epistles of St Paul (in Greek), and at St Paul’s, London, of which he was dean, on the Hierarchies of Dionysius, The letters of Erasmus present in the clearest light the “perfervidum ingenium” of this remarkable man, who, as the founder of St Paul’s school, may be said still to live and work among us. This school he opened in 1510, appointing William Lilye its first headmaster. Lilye himself was no common man. In youth he had travelled to the Holy Land, and on his return took up his abode at Rhodes, and made himself master of the Greek language. Polydore Vergil even says that Lilye was the first Englishman who ever taught publicly “perfectas literas,” by which he appears to mean the Greek authors, but this is certainly a mistake. For the scholars of St Paul's school, Richard Pace, another Oxford man, wrote, at Colet’s request, a pleasant discursive treatise called De Fructu qui ex Doctrina percipitur (1518), in which are introduced some interesting details respecting the learned men of that day. William Latimer, a priest and an Oxford man, is continually mentioned in the letters of Erasmus and his contemporaries as a scholar of vast erudition and especially conversant with Greek. But he was diffident, and perhaps indolent, and declined the task of teaching Fisher Greek, which Erasmus urged him to undertake.

It is a lamentable fact that after this brilliant opening of the study of the humanities at Oxford, the dawn was overcast, and a dismal reaction set in. Erasmus tells us that, about 1518, a body of brutal obscurantists appeared in the university, who, calling themselves Trojans, attempted by ridicule and petty persecution to discourage the study of Greek. It was on this occasion that More wrote his Epistle to the University (1519), complaining that the party of the barbarians was not put down. The king was induced to interfere, and the nuisance was after a while suppressed. At Cambridge, though the study of Greek appears to have been introduced later than at Oxford, it was carried on without check or discouragement, and was supported by endowments at an earlier period than at the sister university. The excellent Fisher, bishop of Rochester, who was chancellor of the university of Cambridge from 1501 to 1517, and in that time founded, or helped to found, the colleges of Christ’s and St John’s, promoted Greek learning with all his energy. He invited Erasmus down to Cambridge in 1511, and procured for him, first, the Lady Margaret professorship of divinity, and afterwards the chair of Greek. He was succeeded by a scholar of some celebrity, Richard Croke, who, after being educated for twelve years at foreign universities, at the expense of Archbishop Warham, returned a most accomplished Grecian, and settled at Cambridge. The archbishop just named, the last before the change of religion, was a prelate of great enlightenment and unfailing generosity. Erasmus, who received from him an annual pension and frequent gifts, is never weary of extolling to his correspondents the “sanctissimi mores,” the love of letters, integrity, and piety of the English primate. Towards the middle of the century Sir John Cheke, as Milton says, “taught Cambridge and King Edward Greek ;” his friend Sir Thomas Smith was also a great promoter of learning.

From the suppression of the monasteries in 1536 to [9:8:415] the end of his reign, the violence and brutality of Henry VIH. exercised a baneful effect on the progress of learning. Instead of conferring together about the Greek particles, Oxford men were obliged to consider what they should think and say about the king’s divorce. The fate of More, the finest scholar at Oxford, and a writer of European reputation, of whom Charles V. said to the English ambassador, “We would rather have lost the best city of our dominions than such a worthy councillor,” dispirited and alarmed all English men of letters. In such dangerous times wariness, quietness, unobtrusiveness, must have seemed to be the one way of safety. When the tyrant died, men breathed indeed more freely; but the rapacity and indifference to letters of Protector Somerset’s government must have filled all university men with the feeling that the tenure of their endowments was anything but secure, and such a state of mind is not good for the pursuits of learning. Under Mary there was some revival of literary activity; a collection was mode and published of the English works of Sir Thomas More; and new editions of Gower and Lydgate were printed. Warton truly observes, that “when we turn our eyes from [this reign’s] political evils to the objects which its literary history presents, a fair and flourishing scene appears.” On the other hand, the compulsory revival of the scholastic philosophy at the universities, which involved, as we are told, the depreciation of the new learning, was an unpleasant feature of the times. There is a well-known passage in Ascham’s Schoolmaster, where, speaking of Cambridge in Mary’s time, he says, that “the love of good learning began suddenly to wax cold, the knowledge of the tongues was manifestly contemned; the truth being,” he goes on to say, “that plans were laid by the university authorities to bring back the works of Duns Scotus, and all the rabble of barbarous questionists,” into the academical course, in the place of Aristotle, Plato, Cicero, and Demosthenes. To throw contempt on the schoolmen,— though it was not confined to the Protestants, for More, Erasmus, Colet, Pace, and many other Catholics had expressed more or less of a similar aversion,—yet was characteristic of them, for their theologians without exception rejected the Schola. Therefore Gardiner and Bonner appear to have resolved to force scholasticism on the young men of their day, simply because they did not like it.

Yet at Oxford things cannot have been so bad, for it was in this reign that Trinity College was founded by Sir Thomas Pope, a zealous Catholic, “in the constitution of which the founder principally inculcates the use and necessity of classical literature, and recommends it as the most important and leading object in that system of academical study, which he prescribes to the youth of the new society. For, besides a lecturer in philosophy appointed for the ordinary purpose of teaching the scholastic sciences, he establishes in this seminary a teacher of humanity.”^[3. Wartou.] The accession of Elizabeth brought another change. The schoolmen were again ejected, and with contumely, from English seats of learning. By a singular irony of fate, the name of the owner of one of the brightest and most penetrating intellects ever given to man, Duns Scotus, came to be used, in Englaud, as a synonym for a blockhead. Polite literature was now so exclusively cultivated that it destroyed philosophy. The old systems were discredited, but no new system was adopted in their place. Nor has philosophical speculation ever recovered iu England that high place in the hierarchy of the sciences which is its due. In the first twenty years of the reign of Elizabeth though exact scholarship did not flourish much, there was a great and very beneficial activity in the work of making translations from the classics. The names of Golding, North, Phaier, Marlowe, and Stanihurst indicate the authors of the chief of these. Fairfax and Harringtou translated the master-pieces of Tasso and Ariosto. But for the ample store of fresh materials thus supplied, the genius of Shakespeare, who had not a university education, must have displayed itself under comparatively restricted forms.

Little need be said of those inferior descriptions of poetry which this peιiod produced. Stephen Hawes, in his Pastime of Pleasure, endeavoured, but with very imperfect success, to effect that blending of allegory with romance which was to be the brilliant achievement of Spenser. The mind of Alexander Barclay seems to have been swayed by that Teutonic affinity of which we spoke in a former section; he turned to Sebastian Brandt rather than to Petrarch, and preferred the grotesque humour of the Narrenschiffe to the sonnets on Zawra. In Skelton, almost the only poet of the first twenty years of Henry VIII.’s reign, the coarser fibres of the English nature are offensively prominent. His fondness for alliteration, and indifference to the syllabic regularity of his verse, show that he too belonged to the Teutonizing party among the English writers, and that he may be affiliated to Langland and the other alliterators of an earlier age. He occasionally wrote some pretty little lyrics,—witness {he musical lines To Maistress Margary Wentworth,— but buffoonery and a coarse kind of satire were what his nature prompted him to, and in these he excelled. His attacks on Wolsey’s pride, luxury, and sensuality are well known, nor can it be said that they were not deserved; still, as proceeding from an incontinent priest, they remind us unpleasantly of “Satan reproving sin.” The macaronic verse in which this poet delighted, a farrago of Latin words, classical and barbarous, French words, cant expressions, and English terms clipped or lengthened at pleasure, was called by our ancestors, for many years after his death, “Skeltonical ;” but Warton has shown that he did not invent it, but that it was in common use in his time both in Italy and in France. The end of the reign of Henry VIII. was illustrated by the poetry of Surrey and Wyatt. These two writers, having resided long in Italy, and learnt, like Chaucer, justly to appreciate the greatness of Italian literature, which none of their countrymen since Chaucer seemed able to do, “greatly polished,” as Puttenham says, “our rude and homely manner of vulgar poesie from that it had been before, and for that cause may justly be sayd the first reformers of our English metre and style.” To Chaucer’s heroic verse Surrey restored the syllabic regularity which it had lost in inferior hands, and stripping it of rhyme, he for the first time produced English blank verse. Into this rhythm he translated part of the Aeneid. He shares with Wyatt the credit of having naturalized the sonnet in English literature.

In Scotland there arose in this period several poets of considerable mark, all of whom, in respect of their turn of thought and the best features of their style, may be properly affiliated to Chaucer. Heuryson wrote in “rhyme royal ”—Chaucer’s favourite metre—the Testament of Faire Creseyde, a sort of supplement to Chaucer’s Troylus and Cryseyde. Iu the poetical remains of Gawain Douglas, bishop of Dunkeld, there is much melody and sweetness. In the poems of Dunbar the influence of Chaucer is especially noticeable. The Thistle and the Pose and the Golden Terge are poems of the same class as the Assembly of Foules and the Court of Love; the allegoric form, and the machinery of dream and vision, are employed in both. Sir David Lyndsay began by being a great admirer and 1 imitator of Chaucer, but the Teutonic affinities of his mind waxed ever stronger, and he ended by gaining great [9:8:416] temporary fame as the author of coarse and ribald satires, directed against the abuses of his day, especially those which deformed the church. His latest work, a Dialog concerning the Monarchen appeared in 1553.

Tn the article Drama it was described how the modern drama grew up under the shadow of the church, and an attempt was made to convey a clear notion of the - mode in which the ancient miracle plays were performed. As the people grew richer and more numerous, and the arts of life were improved, and experience suggested ways of correcting blemishes and adding fresh splendour to the spectacle, these plays were exhibited with ever increasing pomp. Yet, at the same time, the lay spirit getting hold of them more and more, and the religious laxity of the Renaissance attacking the clergy, we find those which date from the 15th century not only grotesque, but gross to the last degree. Their composition in many parts betrays a scandalous accommodation or condescension to the brutality or pruriency of the hearers. Take for instance, the scene called “The Bridal of Mary and Joseph” in the Coventry Mysteries. To interest masses of ignorant people it may have been necessary to be simple, broad, and outspoken; but it could not have been necessary to introduce a heap of filthy jokes, not found in their original, gathering round the mystery of the Incarnation, for the sake of raising a horse-laugh, and covering the cheeks of the country girls with blushes. It must be remembered that the entire system of language and allusions in these plays is contemporary. Mary’s kinsman, Abizachar, is a mediaeval bishop, with his court, his sumpnours, and his apparitors; the whole thing is racy of the soil, and redolent of the national humour; you are no more transported into Palestine than a travestie of “Medea” transports you into Greece. The moral effects upon juvenile spectators of so much loose talk, conveyed to them as it was with a sanction (for a religious aim was always professed, and indeed as a rule sincerely entertained in these exhibitions), cannot have been of an improving nature.

Besides the great serial plays, such as The Chester—The Coventry— and the Townley Mysteries, in the successive scenes of which all the principal truths and doctrines of religion, beginning with the creation, and ending with “Doomsday,” were represented, a demand arose for special plays, treating of the life, or the miracles, or the martyrdom of some favourite saint. Such were The Conversion of St Paul, St Mary Magdalen, and St Anne, which may be seen in a MS. in the Bodleian library. These were sometimes performed in the churches, on the festival of the saint celebrated in them, sometimes in the halls of royal palaces or colleges, sometimes again within the precincts of monasteries. Gradually something more refined, more in the fashion, than any -miracle play, was called for at courts and colleges. Then arose the moral plays, in which the allegorical treatment and metaphysical refinements which were of the taste of the age were applied to dramatic entertainments. Saints and angels were discarded; and virtues, vices, and abstract notions of various kinds took their place as the dramatis personae. The devil of the miracle plays, who had more and more become a grotesque and comic character, at least in many of them, appeared as the “vice” or “iniquity” of the moral plays, and introduced into them also a corresponding comic element; this “vice,” as is "well known, was gradually transformed into the clown of the modern stage. Skelton wrote two moral plays, one called The Nigramaηsir, which was performed before Henry VII. and his court at Woodstock, the other Magnyfycence. A more ambitious effort was the Satyre of Thrie Estaits, by Lindsay; this enormous moral play was acted before the Scottish court in 1535, and occupied nine hours in the representation. The dulness and tediousness of plays of this kind, owing to the want of human interest, prevented them from holding their ground against the more natural form of the drama which the imitation of the ancients soon introduced; yet Air Collier, in his History of Dramatic Poetry, has shown that moral plays continued to be written down to the very end of the reign of Elizabeth. Translations and imitations of the plays of Plautus and Terence paved the way for the reign of a purer taste. Sixteen years after it had witnessed The. Nigrarnansir, the English court was refreshed by “a goodie comédie of Plautus,” probably through the instrumentality of Sir Thomas More, who was then in high favour with Henry. The interludes of John Heywood, court-jester to the same king, were another step in advance. The personified qualities are here dropped, and persons take their place; these persons, however, are not yet individuals, but representatives of classes, “a pedlar,” “a palmer,” &c. The earliest proper comedy that has yet been discovered is the Ralph Roister Doister of Nicholas Udall, the head master of Eton College. In this play, written to be performed by his scholars, Udall imitates so far as he can the style and manner of Terence. It is divided into acts and scenes, and is written in hobbling alexandrine rhyming lines, which, as containing twelve syllables, i.e., six feet, he obviously thought were the nearest English reproduction of the iambic trimeter. He did not see that the movement of our heroic blank verse, in spite of its being shorter by two syllables, represents more faithfully than any other English metre the movement of the iambic trimeter; while such rough alexandrines as his only recall the Saturnian verse of Naevius. The recognition of the fact that for the English drama the proper metre is the blank verse of ten syllables was due to the finer perceptions of Sackville, who, with Norton, produced the tragedy of Ferrex and Porrex, or Gorbοdue, in 1561; this, the earliest regular tragedy that has been discovered, was played before Queen Elizabeth in the hall of the Inner Temple. For some years the drama continued to be beholden to the hospitality of the court, or some legal society, or educational institution (Gray’s Inn, Lincoln’s Inn, St Paul’s school, <fcc.), for the local habitation where it might display its illusions. But as the popular delight in such exhibitions increased at this time faster than the Puritanic aversion to them (although this also was gaining ground, as we shall see), it was in evitable that the stage should cease to be movable and migratory, and establish itself in a permanent home. The first public theatre was opened at Blackfriars in 1575; the histrionic art became a recognized profession; many other theatres sprang up before the end of the century; Italian plays were adapted, Latin plays translated, episodes of English history dramatized; and, on the whole, a kind of dramatic atmosphere was generated in the English metropolis, highly favourable to the career of a great artist, should such a one appear.

More’s philosophical fiction of Utopia, imitated from Plato’s Atlantis, appeared in Latin in 1516; it is the picture of an ideal commonwealth. The Goνernour, by Sir Thomas Elyot, was also intended to be a political treatise; but under the despotism of Henry « the subject was too dangerous, and the author confines himself almost entirely to questions connected with education. The earliest good English prose, in Mr Hallam’s opinion, is found in Sir Thomas More’s History of Henry V., which appeared in 1513. But the curious treatise by Sir John Fortescue, written more than thirty years before, the Difference between an A bsolute and a Limited Monarchy, is really very good English, and contains few words that are not now in use; if it were divested of its barbarous [9:8:417] orthography, this would be at once manifest. Our prose style was much improved by the various works of Roger Ascham, who taught Latin to Elizabeth, and held learned conversations with Lady Jane Grey.

The religious convulsions by which the country was shaken to its centre during this period are of little direct interest to the historian of literature; for the lines of literary development which the activity of preceding ages had marked out were not seriously deflected, nor did the theological controversy produce on either side works which, like Hooker’s Ecclesiastical Polity or Bossuet’s Variations, may claim, on account of perfection of style or power of treatment, a permanent place in literature. The Reformers of Henry the VIII.’s reign were the heirs and continuators of “Lollardy,” but joined to it, from the armoury of Luther and Calvin, new views on predestination, the futility of works, justification by faith alone, and the final assurance of the elect, which had indeed a practical bearing of the most important kind, but were not set forth by our native writers in particularly forcible terms or attractive forms. William Tyndale, who carried on a long and acrimonious controversy with Sir Thomas More, is perhaps the most important writer on that side. Cranmer’s writings show much learning, considerable grasp of intellect, and a certain beadth of style; they are deficient, however, in sincerity and manliness. The homely wit and rough satirical power of Latimer are well illustrated in many of his sermons. He, and most of the English Reformers, exemplify in a marked way the Teutonic affinity of which we have more than once spoken; the desire to be sturdily independent, coupled with a sense of teeming latent energy,—of a potentiality of great achievement on this side and on that,—indicate in them at once the strength and the blemish of the Teutonic genius. After the accession of Elizabeth, the leading men among the clergy, refusing to take the oath of supremacy, were for the most part driven into exile, and for many years waged war, in heavy treatise or light pamphlet, against the new settlement of religion. The names of Sander, Harpsfield, Harding, Stapleton, and many others occur in this connexion. But as they wrote for the most part in Latin, for the sake of Continental readers, their efforts produced little effect, and are now scarcely remembered. Jewel, the Protestant bishop of Salisbury, who had been in exile at Strasburg under Mary, and contracted a close friendship with Peter Martyr, wrote an Apology (1562) in reply to these disputants, from whom the work drew forth loud charges of inaccuracy and unfairness of quotation. The Apology was in Latin, but the Defence of the Apology, written in answer to Harding, was in English. The laborious exercise of thought on these topics, and the warfare with pen and tongue which was the result, could not fail to increase the elasticity and enlarge the adaptivity of the language, and so far tended to improve it as an organ of literature.

VI, The Old Civilization in conflict with Puritanism, 1579-1660.—Regarding the position of the Roman see in the Christian church as a “separable accident,” the acceptance or rejection of which made no essential difference, the literary men of the latter part of the reign of Elizabeth, while rejecting, chiefly on political grounds, the authority of that see, had no quarrel in other respects with the religion which had come down to them from their forefathers, nor with the forms of civilization and efforts towards a higher culture which that religion had encouraged. Both in Spenser and Shakespeare we notice a decided repugnance towards Rome, and a disposition to deny her claim to obedience (compare the description of Duessa in the Faerie Queens, and the denunciation of papal power put by Shakespeare in the mouth of King John); but with this exception they belong to the old school; they might have been Englishmen of fifty years before, instead of twenty or thirty years after, the Reformation. This has been pointed out in detail by Mr Thornbury and others in the case of Shakespeare; they have shown how alien the notions of Puritanism were to his heart and mind, except in the one point of opposition to'Rome. Spenser’s description of the house of Coelia, and his invective against the Blatant Beast, not to refer to many other passages, show that the same thing held good of him. But it is not our object to dwell on this; the point to which we would call attention is, that the poets and dramatists of this period, as well as a large body of the clergy, clave heartily to the civilization and culture which they had inherited from the past. To this form of civilization the Puritan or ultra-reforming party, which began to show its strength under the lax rule of Archbishop Grindal, was radically opposed. The culture which bad gathered treasures from every side, and welcomed all that was good and beautiful in paganism, was tainted and abominable in their eyes. To them it seemed that a Christian society should be exclusively formed and built up on models furnished by the Old and New Testaments. To come to the particular tendencies of Puritanism with which we have now to do,—it looked with sour displeasure on the English poetry and drama of the day, and, according as it possessed power, suppressed them. What meant these loose and profane sonneteers by writing about their mistresses in language that was little short of idolatrous, and celebrating Bacchus, Venus, and Apollo in terms which could hardly be acquitted of blasphemy? Why, if they must rhyme, could they not compose comfortable hymns of Zion, and if they must have music, sing the Psalms of David? Expression was given to these sentiments in a pamphlet breathing a spirit of comparative moderation,— the School of Abuse of Stephen Gosson (1579). Sir Philip Sidney in his able reply, the Defence of Poesy, vindicated; the legitimacy of the taste for literature and art which Englishmen had inherited from their forefathers. Again, innumerable allusions in the works of the dramatists of this and the next reign, including Shakespeare, prove the animosity which subsisted between them and the Puritans, whom they rightly regarded as the implacable enemies of their art. On the outbreak of civil war the Puritans, gaining the upper hand in London, immediately shut up the theatres. It is not, therefore, without reason that we have characterized the epoch which we are considering as that of the “conflict between Puritanism and the old civilization.”

Poetry, which does not, like the drama in its more developed stages, require any local establishment in order to produce its effects, pursued its flight in defiance of Puritan censure. It was not, however, unaffected by it. The disapproval of him and his works, entertained by a large section among the most virtuous of his countrymen, irritated the poet by its exaggeration, and often made him out of recklessness import an additional degree of licence into his language. Yet morality was in the end the gainer. For in spite of narrowness, and exaggeration, and occasional hypocrisy, there was real earnestness and virtuous intention in the great body of the Puritans; and to these qualities society eventually did homage by refusing to tolerate, in poetry at least, what was openly and scandalously immoral. In spite of one or two who leap over the line, poetry in the 18th century, and still more in the 19th, has not permitted her votaries to write as they please, but has prescribed to them measure and seemliness. This may indeed be attributed to the increasing refinement of European life, but that refinement itself, so far as it is moral, is to a large extent the work of the Puritan spirit.
[9:8:418]

Without further preface let us turn to the consideration of that amaziDg phenomenon, the literature of the Elizabethan age. Many circumstances, many slowly elaborated changes, had prepared the way. The cautious peace-policy of Elizabeth, her wise love of economy, and her care to surround herself with able counsellors, produced their natural fruits in a state of general prosperity never experienced before. Every adventurous and inquiring mind was stimulated by the reports continually arriving of the discovery of “islands far away,” of riches and beauty which the earth had hitherto veiled from her children revealed to wondering eyes in America and the East, of inventions which enlarged the power, and discoveries which widened the knowledge, of man. Again, the greatly augmented use of the language as a literary instrument, consequent upon the religious dissensions now temporarily, silenced, had, as already explained, made it a much fitter organ for thought than it had been in the reign of Henry VIIL Lastly, the powerful influences now pressing in from abroad must be duly weighed. The genius of Ariosto had clothed mediaeval romance in a splendid garb, which, for the first time since the 13th century, made the subject attractive to cultivated minds. Ta3so ’ s epic, with its sustained grace and sweetness, had shown how the shades and half-shades of sentiment in which refined spirits delight can be expressed by corresponding nuances of language. Certain eminent writers in France, especially Du Bellay and Ronsard, had consecrated considerable powers and incessant activity to the work of reforming the language and literature of their own country through the concentrated study and fearless imitation of ancient models. Considering all these various elements, we shall be better able to understand how, given a gorgeous imagination like that of Spenser, and a mind of universal range like that of Shakespeare, these writers were able to place that enormous difference between themselves and their predecessors which separates the Faerie Queene from the Pastime of Pleasure, and the comedies of Shakespeare from those of Still and Udall.

Without stopping to criticise, and reserving the drama for separate consideration, we must endeavour by a brief description to convey some notion of the poetical exuberance of the Elizabethan era. Spenser’s Faerie Queene, a colossal fragment of a still more colossal design, relates ostensibly the romantic adventures of brave knights and fair ladies; but every incident has an allegorical meaning, and the propagation of the several moral virtues is the professed object of the entire work. The well-known stanza which he invented, consisting of nine lines, the last an alexandrine, with three rhymes, is so skilfully constructed and so well adapted to our language, that it has been frequently employed since, with marked success, by eminent poets. Burns used it for the Cotter’s Saturday Night, and Byron for Childe Harold. The rhymes in it are better arranged than in the standard metre of Italy, the ottavα rima, because the distribution is such as to bind the whole structure better together, and to avoid that palpable break between the first six lines and the concluding couplet which is noticeable in the stanza of Tasso and Ariosto. Again, the extra syllables in the ninth line seem exactly to counterbalance the risk of monotony which the additional line would otherwise entail. The sonnets of Shakespeare, if we accept the acute interpretation of Mr Simpson, indicate the influence of some aristocratic friend of the poet, who, having travelled much in Italy and formed the acquaintance of members of the learned “academes” for which Italian cities, were then famous, had learned from them those Platonizing speculations about love and its kinds—the vulgar, the civil, the chivalrous, and the ideal love—which are partially reproduced in the sonnets. Among Shakespeare’s other poems the chief were Venus and Adonis and the Pape of Lucreece, pieces remarkable for their luscious melody and ornate elegance. The classical and mythological themes attest at once the receptivity of the intellect of Shakespeare, a country-bred youth who had studied at neither university, and the strength of the Renaissance movement, from which no mind, even the most powerful, could then hold itself aloof. Of the same class is Marlowe’s beautiful poem of Hero and Leander, translated from the Greek of the pseudo-Musaeus. George Chapman produced, about 1601, a complete translation of the Iliad in long fourteen syllable lines. It was the first time that this feat had been accomplished in any modern language; and the fact well typifies the intensity of force with which the English intellect was now working in every direction. Robert Southwell, the Jesuit, put to death by the Government in 1696, left behind him a few religious poems of great beauty. He is by some considered the first of the metaphysical school of poets; but the credit (or discredit) of that leadership rather belongs to Donne. Marston, Hall, and Gascoigne (the author of the Steel Glass) may be regarded as the founders of English satire. Sir Philip Sidney, the ornament of Elizabeth’s court, wrote sonnets and songs, which, though imitated from Italian and Spanish models, were freighted by his powerful mind with a burden of thought and passion not to be found in the originals. The attempts of Daniel and Drayton in the epic style (Wars of the Poses, Barons' lΓ<Z7∙s), were failures; but wherever we meet with many ventures, it cannot be but that some will fail. Of such poems as Warner’s Albion’s England, or Drayton’s Poly-Olbion, or Tusser’s Five Hundred Points of Husbandry, it is unnecessary to speak.

The class of poets to whom Johnson attached the name “metaphysical,” while Milton calls them “fantastics,” includes Donne their founder, Cowley, Crashaw, Cleveland, and several others. In date they belong rather to the reigns of James I. and Charles I. than to that of Elizabeth. They are distinguished by their fondness for “conceits,” or intellectual tours de force, the general aim of which was to gain credit for ingenuity, and a deep insight into the nature of things, by tracing resemblances or analogies between objects apparently remote and diverse. This poetry of conceit, which nearly corresponded to the estilo culto of Spain, is usually said to have been invented by the Neapolitan poet Marini, author of the Sospetto di Erode, and by him propagated in France, whence it came to England. It was merely another development of that tendency to the mystical in thought and the far-fetched in language, characteristic of the Gothic ages, which we have seen more fully exemplified in the countless allegories and moral plays of previous periods. In Donne the style is insufferable; “conceits” are strewn about his pages like puns about the conversation of a punster, and they are not half so amusing. Cowley, on the other hand, was a true poet; the daring flights of his fancy, the tenderness of his feelings, and the grace and profoundness of his musings, still rescue much that he wrote from oblivion. Composing, in imitation of Pindar (though he did not really understand the Pindaric metres), irregular passages of song which. he called “Pindariques,” he gave the first example of a class of poems which comprises performances so memorable as the Alexander's Feast of Dryden and the Barel of Gray. Crashaw, the translator of the Sospetto di Erode, is in the highest degree a worshipper of the far-fetched. He is the author of the celebrated line, describing the miracle of Cana in Galilee,—

Lympha pudica Deum vidit, et erubuit.

The conscious water saw her God, and blushed.

Edmund Waller, though his earliest writings betray an [9:8:419] affinity to the fantastic school, mixed too much in the world, and had too much good taste and good sense, to go very far with them. He is the English song-writer par excellence; his is the only name which we can think of, when Burns is cited for Scotland and Béranger for France. His manner was so good and his style so clear that Dryden calls him the “father of English numbers,” and declares that but for him “none of us could write.” Pope allows to Waller smoothness, but ascribes much more to the influence of Dryden himself:

“Waller was smooth, but Dryden taught to join The varying verse, the full resounding line, The long majestic march, and energy divine.”

In the last section we noticed the rise of true comedy and tragedy, and gave the date of the building of the first regular theatre at the Blackfriars. Returning to the subject, we propose to examine the commencements of the Elizabethan drama in somewhat more detail, treating (1) of the actors, (2) of the plays which they performed, (3) of the stages which they had at their disposal, including under this head their resources of scenery and stage effect.

1. From an early periol of the reign we find frequent mention of companies of players travelling from town to town, and performing in the town-halls, under the sanction of, and with remuneration from, the respective corporations, such of the plays which they had brought as might seem suitable to the audience expected. It is noteworthy that every such company announced itself as “the servants” of my lord this, or the earl of that, and indeed were really such; had they given themselves out for an independent body of· players, the stern laws against vagabondage then prevailing would have made ’ them at once amenable to the sharp jurisdiction of the local magistrates. Thus we read of the servants of the Lord Strange, those of the earls of Leicester, Warwick, Derby, &c. These noblemen enrolled the bands of players among their retainers, and probably maintained and gave them wages for a part of the year, but allowed them at other times, under the patronage of their high names and with licences under their hands, to make a living by entertaining the public. It was the servants of the earl of Leicester who in 1574 obtained from the queen a writ under the privy seal, authorizing them to perform “comedies, tragedies, interludes, stage-plays, and such other like as they have already used and studied, or hereafter shall use and study, as well in the city of London as throughout the realm of England.” But when the players prepared to avail themselves of their privilege, a conflict of authorities became apparent. The mayor and corporation of London asserted their right of control over all dramatic performances within the limits of the city, and issued orders providing, amongst other things, that the players whom they might license should contribute half their receipts to charitable purposes. Probably a portion of the corporation was, even at this early period, actuated by Puritan sentiments. The poor players, who under such regulations would have soon found their occupation gone, or at any rate unremunerative, turned their eye to the vacant spice between St Paul’s and the river, where stood the ruins of the great convent and church of the Black Friars (Dominicans). On this site, which was outside the jurisdiction of the city, they established the first theatre by converting to their purpose some of the dilapidated buildings. Years passed; the number of the players increased; and in 1589, as we learn from a curious memorial which they addressed in that year to the privy council, they were sixteen in number, “all of them sharers in the Blackfriars play-house.” The twelfth name subscribed to this list was that of William Shakespeare; the ninth that of the dramatist George Peele. These facts show that that “separation of powers,” which, in the drama as in politics, is the fruit of an advanced experience, did not then exist. The offices of lessee, stage-manager, actor, and play-writer were all combined in these early players. They owned the theatre in which they acted, furnished their own stage, chose their own plays, and, to a greater or less extent, wrote them. After having received the royal licence in 1574, this company ceased to bear the name of the earl of Leicester, but described themselves as “Her Majesty’s poor players.” The trace of this early connection with the court still remains in the appellation “Theatre Royal,” assumed by several of the older London theatres.

2. With regard to the nature of the dramatic performances, these included, besides those specified in the licence to the Blackfriars Company, moral plays and histories. Under the general description of moral play we may include those that were written with a controversial purpose, either for or against the Reformation, such as the plays by Bishop Bale, Lusty Juventus, Every Man, fyc. Quite a number of such pieces were put on the stage by the Catholics after the accession of Elizabeth, with the view of turning the new state services into ridicule; these drew down a special prohibition from the Government. Many dramas, called sometimes tragedies, sometimes histories, were on classical subjects, such as Catiline’s Conspiracies (by Stephen Gosson, who afterwards wrote vehemently against the stage), Cupid and Psyche, Ptolemy, and plays on the lives of Pompey and Caesar. The audience being limited, the companies of players numerous, and the expense of scenery and dresses trifling, novelty in the pieces represented became the predominant source ofattraction; hence the extraordinary variety of plays produced at this early period. Scriptural subjects were popular; thus among the earliest printed plays are Nash’s Christ's Tears over Jerusalem, and Peele’s David and Bethsabe. “Histories” dealt often with personages and events of the ancient world. But they also presented in dramatic forms passages from the story of England, many of which, by tradition and continual discussion, still lived in the memory, and vividly stirred the feelings of the people; and it was natural that dramas of this class, as they came to be planned with more art and composed with greater power, should transcend in interest the dramas with classical plots, and appropriate the name of “histories” to themselves. One of the earliest of these, The Famous Victories of Henry V., was acted about 1580; Shakespeare founded on it one of his historical plays. The history of Edward II. by Marlowe, Greene’s James IV., and Peele’s Edward I. all date somewhere about 1590; the older play of King John appeared in 1591; and the original plays which, refashioned or retouched by the hand of Shakespeare, come before us as the three parts of Henry VI., seem to have been produced between 1590 and 1595.

Before the time when Shakespeare began to write for the stage, it may be said that several respectable or even remarkable tragedies had appeared, that some good and flowing historical dramas had been written, and that a great variety of interludes, approaching in character to our farces, and not deficient in wit and drollery, had been produced. To prove the above assertion as to tragedy, it would be enough to adduce Marlowe’s powerful plays, Dr Faustus and Tamburlaine the Great,— the first strong to move the tragic passions, the second dazzling and astonishing us by its soaring rants and gorgeous rhetoric. The clever interludes of John Heywood would alone sustain what we have stated as to pieces of that description. In comedy, on the other hand, very little had been achieved. Of those that were in prose, like Gascoigne’s Supposes and Nash’s Pierce Penniless, the rough uncouth language was unrelieved by any wit that could pass muster in a later age. No comedies in verse superior to those of Greene can perhaps[9:8:420] be named; and these are disfigured by every kind of literary fault,

3. With regard to the stage itself, the building of the first theatre in London has been already described. But for many years previously temporary theatres had been made out of the court-yards, with their surrounding galleries, of London inns, e.g. y the Belle Savage in Ludgate Hill, the Red Bull in Bishopsgate Street, and the Cross Keys in Gracechurch Street. It is to the second of these that Gosson alludes in his School of Abuse (1579), when he speaks of “the Jew shown at the Bull,” and goes on to describe it so as to make it clear that this was an old play with a plot resembling that of the Merchant of Venice, If any one desires it, he may still help his imagination to picture the scene, by going into the court-yard of one of the few old city inns still left, the “Four Swans” in Bishopsgate Street for instance, and imagining a stage erected at one end, the galleries crowded with aristocratic spectators, seated or standing, and the open space below filled with play-goers of the common sort, admitted at the charge of one penny, and with the canopy of heaven above their heads. Five of these theatrical inns were turned into play-houses between 1570 and 1630. The company that owned the Blackfriars Theatre erected a new one called the Globe in 1594 on the Bank-side, a position corresponding to one on the present Thames embankment; this, being for summer use, was not roofed in. A play-house called “The Theatre” was built at Shoreditch, outside the city liberties, little, if at all, after the time at which the Blackfriars house was opened , near it stood the “Curtain.” Other theatres, the Swan, the Hope, the Rose, &c., rapidly sprang up; and it is estimated that not fewer than 200 licensed play-houses existed in different parts of London at the end of the reign of Elizabeth. All this time the players continued, to desiguate themselves, and to be, the servants either of the queen or of some nobleman; without such protection they could not have exercised their function either safely or profitably. In these primitive theatres no scenery was used; that was first introduced by Davenant after the Restoration. A curtain then, as now, met the spectator’s eye on entering; it was slowly drawn up, and he saw a stage strewn with rushes, the side walls hung with arras; a large board with a name painted on it, “Westminster,” “Corinth,” “Messina,” &c., informed him where the scene of the play to be performed was laid; imagination did all the rest. When a battle was to be fought, “two armies fly in represented with four swords and bucklers, aud then what hard heart will not receive it for a pitched field? "^[4. Sidney’s Defence of Poesie, quoted by Charles Knight in his Shαkspere, α Biography.]

Amidst such rude surroundings, and with such imperfect appliances, the mighty genius of Shakespeare was fain to live and act. It has been observed that English comedy was less advanced at the time of his coming up to London (about 1586) than the other dramatic forms; and it is in comedy accordingly that his early triumphs were won, and his extraordinary superiority to all his predecessors most signally demonstrated. Love's Labour's Lost and The Comedy of Errors were probably his first essays; they were followed by Midsummer Night's Dream, Two Gentlemen of Verona, <fcc. The versification of dramatic dialogue had been thoroughly reformed by Marlowe, whose sense of rhythm was exquisite; English blank verse had been wrought into a fine and fitting material, ready to receive whatever impression a gifted dramatist might stamp upon it. But Marlowe was no meditative observer of human life, no accurate discerner of human motives. The language, therefore, that he puts in the mouth of his different personages does not greatly vary; they are all apt to take to ranting on the least provocation. Shakespeare added to Marlowe’s skill of composition a power of characterization which no dramatist, ancient or modern, ever surpassed. To this power, as its fitting accompaniment, was joined a gift of modulation, by which the language assigned to each character was made suitable to it and to no other, and this with a truth and naturalness which the readers and spectators of every following age have recognized. Again, turning, like Chaucer, with eager longing to the refining influences which came from the south, he adjusted and polished his dialogue with the utmost care, till to the swiftness aud evenness of movement which he might have learnt from Marlowe he united much of the easy grace of Ariosto and of the sweetness of Tasso. He probably read an immense number of Italian novels, either in the original or in translations; many of his comedies are founded upon such tales. Thus prepared, he could with safety, as in Merry Jl⅛s of Windsor, deal with home scenes, and a plot of his own invention, without running any risk of falling into the coarseness and vulgarity of Gammer Gurion, George-a-Greene, and hundreds of other pieces, written by men in whom the Teutonic affinity of the race predominated unchecked. To these qualifications Shakespeare added a sound dramatic judgment, which, as was natural, improved with years and experience, teaching him what to seek and what to shun, so as to secure that popularity which is the test of dramatic excellence. As an acting play, The Temp>est, written near the end of his career, is far superior to Love’s Labour ’ s Lost. But to the last he did not attain to supreme excellence in this direction; the unity of action, necessarily sacrificed in the histories, is not always preserved in. dramas where its retention would have been easy; nor is that subordination of inferior parts to the central action, which dramatists of less power have often successfully managed, always duly atteuded to by Shakespeare.

Of neither the comedies nor the tragedies of Shakespeare can it be said that they are in a special sense “dramas of character.” The boasting soldier, the lying traveller, the religious hypocrite, the scheming matron, the ambitious tyrant, and many other clearly marked types, are not pourtrayed for us in the plays of Shakespeare with that sharpness of outline which they present in the works of Plautus, Molière, and Alfieri. The cause may perhaps be sought in the absence from Shakespeare’s mind of all exaggeration, and in the fact that without some slight exaggeration these striking dramatic types which take hold on the memory and the imagination cannot, be produced. Shakespeare saw men as they are, and so described them; and the consequence is that, although neither Macbeth nor Richard III. exhibits the stock character of the “ambitious tyrant,” each displays a special form of ambition, modified, as always happens in real life, by many concomitant qualities and aims, to trace the lineaments of which will reward in a high degree the pains of the literary analyst. It is this quality of essential truth of presentation which has gathered round our Shakespeare’s dramas the instructive and beautiful criticism of a Gervinus, the interpretations of a Goethe, and the historic faculty of a Guizot or a Villemain.

In the exhibition of tragic passions, and in the range of the appeal which they make to the moral sentiments of an audience, Shakespeare’s tragedies have never been surpassed. Considered as acting plays they are of varying excellence. In Othello and Romeo and Juliet, both founded on Italian novels, the incidents move on in a ’ swift and well-combined sequence,, which, from this point of view, leaves nothing to be desired. Hamlet, though from tradition and habit it always attracts large audiences, is better suited for the closet than the stage; the drag of the third and fourth acts is undeniable. In none of the tragedies is there any [9:8:421] attempt to preserve the unity of time except in Romeo and Juliet; here the action is powerfully and successfully concentrated. The Roman plays, based on Plutarch’s Lives, though they abound in passages of great power and beauty, are not so constructed as to produce the highest dramatic effect.

When we turn to the other dramatists, Shakespeare’s contemporaries and successors, the one point about them all that most strikes us is, their amazing exuberance. The English genius, as M. Taine in substance remarks, is naturally abundant and full of force; if left to itself, it attends more to quantity than to quality; it is daring and enterprising, and knows not when it is over matched, as English soldiers are said not to know when they are beaten. Of this national vigour a large proportion was in the Elizabethan times directed to literature, and particularly to the stage. The development of the drama had now gone on without any notable check for many generations. All the artistic faculty of the country which before the Reformation had applied itself to other arts, such as decorative architecture, painting, and sculpture, now, when the scope for the exercise of these was suddenly reduced to the narrowest limits, tended to seek and find a refuge in the Thespi an art. Space does not permit of our noticing these dramatists in any but the briefest manner. Ben Jonson, proud of his learning and his university education, invented most of his own plots, and plumed himself on his strict observance of the unities. In the plays of Beaumont and Fletcher the influence of the Spanish drama, the glory of which had been carried to a great height by Calderon and Lope de Vega, is noticeable. The intensity of Massinger and the pathos of Ford, amid much that is grotesque or repulsive, preserve their dramas from entire oblivion. Other names are those of Webster, Chapman, Heywood, Dekker, Marston, Middleton, and Rowley. The plays of Shirley were at the height of their popularity when, after the breaking out of the civil war, the theatres were closed by order of the parliament. This order is the overt act of Puritanism, by which, after having first complained of, then protested against, then furiously denounced, the abuses of the stage, it proceeds, now that it has got the handling of the civil sword, to remove both use and abuse by force. The violent language of Prynne in the book (1633) to which he gave the title of Histriοmastix (a barbarous compound signifying “the player’s scourge ”), though at the time cruelly punished by the Star Chamber, told of a great and increasing force of public opinion behind him, of which he wa3 but the mouth-piece. Puritanism, by the order of suppression, at once avenged the insults and ridicule with which the dramatists had assailed it, and cut down a vigorous scion which had grown up out of the root of the ancient civilization. The drama was restored before twenty years were over; but it was a new creation, and never won the people’s love as the old Elizabethan drama had done. It was an affair of courts and coteries, and was almost shaken down by the blunt reproaches of one honest, plain-spoken man, Jeremy Collier. Puritanism possessing itself more and more of the popular conscience, the revival of a national drama became impossible. Our theatres are supported by the miscellaneous urban population which is always to be found in great cities; but as a nation we have had no drama since the civil war.

In the department of Fiction we have to note a new transformation of the romance, by which it assumes the form of pastoral novel. The tale of chivalry, modified so as to recommend a religious ideal by Walter Map and his fellow workers, then passing into the love-story with allegorical embellishments in the hands of Lorris, was further changed by Sannazzaro, Montemayor, and other Spanish and Italian writers, into the love-story with pastoral and mythological embellishments. Here of course we trace the influence of the classical revival · allegory is dropped as too cumbrous; and a florid phraseology, culled from the idylls of Theocritus, the miscellaneous works of Lucian, and other classical or quaei-classical sources, takes its place. The Arcadia of Sir Philip Sidney was suggested by Sannazzaro’s pastoral romance of the same name, but can be read with more interest, because we see that it has been made the vehicle by means of which a powerful mind makes known its thoughts on many intricate and important questions, in metaphysics, political science, art, and social ethics. But the prolixity of the work, together with its confused arrangement, would always prevent it from attaining to anything like the popularity which it enjoyed when, and for some time after, it appeared. The Euphues of Lyly, a kind of philosophical novel, written in an affected and pedantic style, has, since the ascription to its influence by Sir Walter Scott of the magniloquent bombast which he puts in the mouth of Sir Piercie Shafton in the Monastery, and considers to be characteristic of the conversation of courtiers at that period, given rise to the term “euphuism.” Yet it must be allowed that Sir Piercie Shafton’s talk is quite a caricature of the language in Euphues; of the two, it more resembles the high-flown language that we meet with in Sidney’s Arcadia. The Mundus Alter et Idem of Hall (afterwards bishop of Norwich) is a satirical romance, written from the clerico-despotic point of view, in the aim of exhibiting the debasement which the principle of democracy, if carried out consistently and over a long period, would, according to the author’s theory, bring upon both social and individual man. One of the last and most pernicious delusions of the infatuated community described in the book consists in establishing “a perpetual parliament.” Such were the advisers, obeying whose fatal suggestions Charles I. reigned eleven years without a parliament, and brought things to a pass whence civil war was the only issue.

In the Ecclesiastical Polity of Richard Hooker, published near the close of the 16th century, a solid intellectual basis, illustrated by great learning and the attractions of a grave and majestic style, was for the first time given to the conception of the via media, in which Anglican churchmen believed they saw a secure shelter for moderate minds, midway between Rome and the extreme forms of Protestantism. The work is naturally directed rather against the Puritans, who were numerous both in church and state, and might eventually, as in fact they did, gain the upper hand, than against the Catholics, whom the laws already silenced and disarmed. The restiveness of the Puritans under the existing laws and church ordinances, which, as they thought, left religion insufficiently reformed, suggested to Hooker an inquiry into the nature of laws, and the grounds of their binding force; this is the subject of the celebrated disquisition in the first book. The Puritans were not convinced, and the struggle between them and the Anglicans went on increasing iu violence, until, after the outbreak of war, the ascendency of the Puritan element in the Lower House, and the secession of most of the peers to Oxford, enabled its enemies temporarily to suppress the established church. During the suppression, a work of great abi 1 ity, entitled A Discourse on the Liberty of Prophesying (1647), appeared from the pen of Jeremy Taylor. Fifty years have made a great difference; the champion of Anglicanism no longer insists on obedience, but pleads for toleration; if only the Church of England could be established again in certain districts, he would be willing to see the worship of many different sects, provided that they all agreed to accept the Apostles’ Creed as a common standard, carried on in other parts of the country. The lapse of a few years restored to the church its former status without [9:8:422] any damaging concessions, and the question of toleration was laid by till the Revolution.

The scholastic philosophy fell, as we have seen, at the change of religion; and for some time nothing took its place. When philosophical studies were revived, they took a new direction, and were pursued in a new spirit. The old philosophy, summing up the wisdom of Greece and that of the Christian schools, said to the student, “Know God, know thyself; from this twofold knowledge learn what is duty; that done, investigate at discretion either nature or the world of ideas.” In practice, however, a dry logic and metaphysic, encumbered with technicalities, formed the sole intellectual pabulum provided for most students of philosophy. The new doctrine, introduced by Bacon, said, “Know Nature, and for that purpose study thy own mind, and discover the criteria by which nature’s ways may be tested; the knowledge so gained will be power, which, well used, will enrich and adorn human life.” Mr Hallam, representing the general English opinion, calls Bacon “the father of modern science ;” but his claim to the title is disputed both by the French and by the Italians. However this may be, it is certain that he very early conceived the idea of working out a new and complete system of philosophy; and to a juvenile work unfolding his project in outline, which seems to have been written about 1584, he gave the title Temporis Partus Maximus, the greatest birth of Time. The phrase sounds arrogant, but was not really so; all that Bacon meant to say was, that the new doctrine was the inevitable outcome of a time now ripe for its reception,—the growth of the Zeit-geist, to use a modern phrase, —and that it was impossible to overstate its importance and potency. But his life was too much taken up with active labours at the bar, on the bench, and in the councilchamber, to permit of his carrying his vast plans into execution. All that we possess of his philosophy is contained in the Advancement of Learning (1605), the Instauratio Magna (1620), and the De Augmentis Scientiarum (1623). The Instauratio is a colossal programme of his philosophy in six divisions, of which only the second, the “Novum Organum,” is worked out, and that not completely. The “Novum Organum” was designed to be the new logic of induction, which Bacon regarded as the mind’s proper instrument in utilizing the fruits of experience. “Experience and observation are the guides through the Baconian philosophy, which is the hand-maid and interpreter of nature.”^[5. Hallam.] Nevertheless the particular instrument which he invented, the method of instances, is too cumbrous for practical use, and in fact never has been employed in physical inquiries. “If we have not tried it," says Mr Ellis, in one of his exceedingly able introductions to the works of Bacon, “it is because we feel confident that it would not answer. We regard it as a curious piece of machinery, very subtle, elaborate, and ingenious, but not worth constructing, because all the work it could do may be done more easily another way.” It is not in virtue of his method, which will not work, nor on account of special contributions to any branch of physical science, for none such exist, that so high a place among philosophers is assigned to Bacon by his countrymen. It is rather on account of the lofty enthusiasm which animates his writings, and makes him appear in them as the hierophant of Nature, eloquently pleading against the neglect of her worship.

The edifice of Christian philosophy lay in ruins, as we have seen, from the time of the Renaissance; Bacon offered a partial substitute, designed to endow man with power over nature; it was left for Hobbes, his assistant and disciple, to make an attempt to occupy the whole of the ancient field of thought. He desired to instruct mankind as to the origin, nature, and value of their conceptions respecting God and themselves, to investigate the moral nature of man, and to define the forms of guidance and of conduct best suited for a being so constituted in mind and heart. His principal work was published in 1651 under the title of Leviathan. The fundamental principle from which he starts is, that every thought which can arise in the mind of man is a “representation or appearance of some quality of a body without us, which is commonly called an object.” “There is no conception,” he proceeds, “in a man’s mind which hath not at first, totally, or by parts, been begotten upon the organs of sense. The rest are derived from that original.” The doctrine of innate ideas, and every suggestion that it is possible for man to obtain real knowledge otherwise than through the reports of the senses, are by this preliminary tenet rejected. He proceeds, with the utmost acuteness, and a power of close and sustained observation which is truly admirable, to analyse the more important conceptions concerning God, time, infinity, substance, &c., which find a harbour within the mind. His explanations and definitions on all these heads bear, as might be expected from his primary tenet, a strong materialistic impress. He is also a nominalist; all objects, according to him, exist singly and separately; the only universal is the name given to a number of objects which agree in certain given respects; the belief in the existence of universals as ideas he rejects, not as erroneous but as absurd; nothing exists for him between, or besides, the object, and the human faculties perceiving and naming it. Of the belief in a God he says that “by the visible things of this world and their admirable order a man may conceive there is a cause of bhem l which men call God, and yet not have an idea or image of Him in his mind.” “As God is incomprehensible, it follows that we can have no conception or image of the Deity; and consequently all His attributes signify our inability or defect of power to conceive anything concerning his nature, and not any conception of the same, excepting only this, that there is a God.” In spite of statements of this kind, which are obviously capable of being taken in a good sense, it has been customary to regard Hobbes as an atheist. The cause is found in the complete inadequacy of his system of morals to make good what might be wanting in his speculative tenets. It is not the omissions and one-sidedness of his metaphysics alone, but it is these, coupled with the perversions in his moral philosophy, which have affixed to his name a reputation for atheism. The doctrine of the existence of God, even attenuated to the form which we have seen above, might have been sufficiently integrated by a sound doctrine respecting the human conscience, the best witness for God, according to the general belief, that it is in man’s power to appeal to. But when we examine Hobbes’s teaching on moral matters, we find it full of paradox and absurdity. Every passion and feeling which can move the human heart is, according to him, the more or less disguised offspring of self-love. He scoffs at the very notion of free-will. The warnings of conscience are merely the fear of something disagreeable happening to ourselves, if we proceed in a particular line of conduct towards our neighbours. Justice and virtue are chimeras; that is just which is commanded by the laws, or which a man has covenanted to dp; that is virtuous which tends to the general well-being of the community in which w e move.

Hobbes’s views on civil society and government were first given to the world in his De Cive (1647); but this was afterwards incorporated in the Leviathan. The state of nature, he holds, is a state of war; each man has, until he is restrained^ a natural right to take everything around him for his own use; every other man has an equal right; war is therefore inevitable. But men find that in the long-run [9:8:423] peace conduces to their enjoyment more than war; they are willing, therefore, that the natural right which each possesses should be abridged, and with this end in view they enter into a covenant under which a government is set up over them, charged with maintaining peace, and attending to their welfare in other ways. After this has been done, the subjects cannot change their government without its consent. There are three possible forms of government, —monarchy, aristocracy, democracy,—in each of which the sovereign power cannot be limited or divided. He appears to have thought the limited monarchy of England a vicious form, which events had shown to be practically untenable, the division of power between sovereign and democratic assembly having led to civil war. Of the three forms he much prefers monarchy, that is, absolute monarchy. He thinks it even more important that the sovereign should not be hampered by any opposition on the part of the priesthood, than that he should not be disturbed by the democracy. Accordingly he insists that the state and the church should be the same body under different aspects, the sovereign of the one being also the supreme head and ruler of the other. The sovereign, if he be a Christian, is to determine what religious dogmas shall be taught by the clergy, and to be the judge in the last resort on questions affecting those dogmas. “This,” as Mr Hallam observes, “is not very far removed from the doctrine cf Hooker, and still less from the practice of Henry VIII.”

There is ample evidence that the philosophy of Hobbes exercised a baneful influence on the morality of a large number of educated men in the last half of the 17th century. But for his love of paradox, this influence would doubtless have been still greater. In an eloquent peroration, Mr Hallam thus sums up his examination of the political and ethical writings of the philosopher of Malmesbury :—“The political system of Hobbes, like his moral system, of which, in fact, it is only a portion, sears up the heart. It takes away the sense of wrong, that has consoled the wise and good in their dangers, the proud appeal of innocence under oppression, like that of Prometheus to the elements, uttered to the witnessing world, to the coming ages, to the just ear of heaven. It confounds the principles of moral approbation, the notions of good and ill desert, in a servile idolatry of the monstrous leviathan it creates, and after sacrificing all right at the altar of power, denies to the Omnipotent the prerogative of dictating the laws of His own worship.”^[6. Literature of Europe vol. iii.]

VII. Reaction and Counter-Action, 1G60-1700.—At the Restoration, the king and his personal friends, who had lived abroad during the Commonwealth and Protectorate, brought to England a sense of fitness in things literary, and an aversion to what was grotesque and exaggerated in style, which they had picked up in the polished society of the French salons. In poetry, perhaps, no reform was needed. The prevalence of good taste and good sense, assisted by the example of Milton, who in his juvenile poems scorned to use the “new-fangled toys” of the fantastic poets, had already condemned the school which delighted in “conceits.” There is a purity of form in the odes of Waller, in the works of Denham, and even in much that in his later years came from the pen of Cowley, which prevented exception being taken to them on the score of refinement. With regard to prose style and the drama the case was different. When men looked back for twenty years and more to the theatre as it was before the troubles, and remembered the plays of Jonson and Shirley, they felt that there was much need of a change. The gay young roué of Jonson’s plays is a coarse, brutal, and insupportable personage; his “clenches” and sallies are not wit, but the noisy outcome of a superficial cleverness, aided by a flow of animal spirits. The easy badinage and well-managed double entendre of the French comic stage were new phenomena, of which that of England had never had the least conception. Nor, in tragedy, was there any inclination to return to the piled up agony—“horror on horror’s head ”—of the plots of Ford and Fletcher. Corneille had shown that the sentiments of honour and levé in their chivalrous intensity, when exhibited as in conflict with the harsh demands of circumstance and the world, are capable of producing the finest tragic situations. Dryden’s heroic plays (7‰ Indian Emperor, The Conquest of Granada, <fcc.) were up to a certain point imitations of Corneille; the extent to which they are sensational and crowded with incident was a feature taken from the theatre of Spain. The verse is rhymed in imitation of his French models; and in more than one of his prefaces or essays Dryden ably urged the claims of “his long loved mistress, Rhyme,” as an indispensable decoration without which the requisite weight and dignity of the tragic style could not be attained. In the article on the Drama (vol. vii. p. 434), notice has been taken of the chief works, both in tragedy and comedy, produced by our dramatists between the Restoration and the end of the century. Dryden, whose power and insight grew with advancing age, recognized, after devoting himself to the heroic style for years, the superiority of Shakespeare, abandoned rhyme, and produced in 1690 his finest play Don Sebastian. But it was then too late to arrest the decay of the drama. The Dutch king who then sat on the Stuart throne, the Dutch army which had placed him there, the exultation of the Whigs and the dissenters, were all so many indications that the Teutonic element in the English mind was again in the ascendant. And the ascendency of the Teutonic element, then still more than in previous ages, on account of the gulf which had been established between the Teutonic and Latin races by the Reformation, implied the predominance of an energy which preferred strength to grace, the useful to the beautiful, industry to art. All these impulses were of course only confirmed by the religious and moral views which are grouped under the general name of Puritanism. The drama, therefore, being in opposition to the prevailing spirit, fell ever lower and lower; and though momentarily uplifted, in later times, by the genius of a Goldsmith or a Sheridan, it has never regained its hold upon the nation. A modern critic has compared our drama, commencing with the Elizabethan age and ending with the present day, to a huge pyramid which stands on a broad and magnificent base, dwindles continually, and ends in nothing. Even at this day, there is still too much of the Puritan temper in general society to admit of the success of any proposal in parliament tending to the encouragement and support of the drama by the state, as a department of national culture.

The prose style of the French writers was, at the time of the Restoration, much superior to ours. We had no one to oppose to Segrais, Fontenelle, Balzac, Voiture, Menage, and Bouhours, to select only the principal names among the French critics and beaux esprits. Nor was this superiority of our neighbours sensibly dimiuished till the next century, when Addison, Steele, and Swift redressed the balance. Yet it must be conceded to Dryden that the prose of his numerous essays, prefaces, and dedications, prefixed or subjoined to his published plays (especially the Essay on Dramatic Poesy}, is incomparably more polished and more effective than any of the rude attempts at criticism which our writers had hitherto attempted. There is, however, a certain wildness clinging to Dryden’s style, in spite of his efforts to improve it, and in spite of his wit and the promptitude of his vivacious intellect: one never feels quite secure against the occurrence of a solecism. Hobbes’s [9:8:424] style is more unexceptionable; he had resided much in France, and consorted with French literati, and thus learned the charm of a perfectly clear and simple way of writing. Among the divines of this age there was much eloquence, much richness and force, but little good style. Nothing can be more copious than Taylor, but it is a «toying manner; his facility of speech and coining imagination are masters of him, not he of them. Isaac Bar row, who died in his forty-seventh year iu 1677, seems to be the best of them; he has more self-command than Taylor, more earnestness than South, and more dignity than Baxter. Against Tillotson’s style no particular objection can be urged, except that it does not prevent his Sermons from being dull and dry.

In the Pilgrim's Progress of Jobu Bunyan (1684) the style, without being elevated or distinguished, is plain and manly. It is of course free from pedantry, which cannot be where there is no learning; but it is also free from affectations, and—almost always—from vulgarity. It is interesting to observe in this,—the most popular English work of the century,—the revival of Hie old allegorical way of writing which was so much relished in the age of Chaucer. Mr Hallam remarks that there is some inconsistency or defectiveness of plan; the persecution of the pilgrims iu the city of Vanity, and the adventure of the cave and the two giants, might with equal propriety, so far as the allegorical meaning is concerned, have been placed at any other stage of the pilgrimage. This is true; but it is only saying that in these passages the tale overpowers the allegory; considered as incidents iu the tale, they could not have been better placed than where they are.

In the heyday of reaction against the hypocrisy and violence of the Puritans, it may be imagined that neither they nor their principles found any quarter. A long satire in doggerel verse, the Hudibrαs of Samuel Butler, one of the best second-rate poets of the day, was especially devoted to their discomfiture. The general texture of this poem is loose and careless; ⅛he versification, as a rule, too unpolished to invite to a second reading; still there are epigrammatic couplets and sarcastic descriptions in it which will be remembered while English literature endures. Denham, best known as the author of the pretty descriptive poem of Coopers Hill, wrote many pieces in the spirit of the reaction, which in him, as in Davenant and others, went to the length of identifying Puritanism with Christianity, and rejecting both together. Such at least seems the natural conclusion to be drawn from a perusal of Denham’s strange poem entitled The Progress of Learning. In Dryden’s poetry the temper and policy of reaction are exhibited with great distinctness. At first, and for many years after the Restoration, his attacks are chiefly upon the political side of Puritanism; he rings the changes on “rebellion,” “faction,” “disobedience,” and “anarchy.” In Absalom and Achitofhel (1681) he argues, with that skill of ratiocination in metre which never forsakes him, against the tenets of democracy and the absolute right of a majority :—

“Nor is the people's judgment always true;

The most may err as grossly as the few.”

In Threnodia Augustalis he talks of “senates insolently loud;” and in the Hind and Panther (1687) cleverly presses home against the clergy, who were grumbling at the arbitrary acts of James IL, their own declared principles of “passive obedience” and “submission for conscience’ sake.” In middle life Dryden began to take a lively interest in the controversy on the grounds of religious belief; we see him in the Religio Laici (1681) perplexing himself with the endeavour to ascertain the limits of the province of authority and that of private judgment. Waiving the question as to the entire sincerity, or rather disinterestedness, of his conversion, we find him, after that event, ex emplifying the reaction against Puritanism in an extreme degree; as he had magnified the authority of the prince in the political sphere, so now he magnifies the authority of the church in the religious sphere. The Hind and Panther, as all the world knows, is a theologico-political dialogue, disguised under a thin, a very thin veil of allegory, on some of the questions debated between the churches of Rome and England, and also on some of the political theories then in vogue.

As for the drama, the mere fact of its revival was a part of the reaction against Puritanism. In the coarse play of The Roundheads, or the Good Old Cause, by Mrs Aphra Behn, which came out shortly after the Restoration, some of the great Commonwealthsmen are exhibited on the stage, of course in an odious light. Dryden kept clear, in his dramas, of scurrilities of this kind, probably because he himself had been brought up among Puritans. In the famous play of Sir Courtly Nice (1685) by Crowne, the character of the Whig-Puritan, Mr Testimony, is a compound of hypocrisy, knavery, and cowardice. Yet at the time when this play was represented, the party of the counter-action, represented now by the names of Whig and dissenter, was already so strong that Crowne could say of them in his dedication to the duke of Ormond,—“There were no living, if some great men, elevated not only in quality but understanding above the rest of the world, did not protect us [the dramatists] from those barbarians, because they know us.” After the Revolution there was a truce; the comedies of Congreve and Wycherley have no political bearing. The comic stage was hardly, if at all, employed for party purposes till the reign of Queen Anne, when the strong high-church temper which prevailed in the country caused the revival of Sir Courtly Nice (1711). A few years later Cibber, in his play of the Nonjuror, imitated from Molière’s Tartufe, attacked the nonjurors and the Catholics in the interest of the Hanoverian succession. As altered by Bickersteth, the same play appeared soon afterwards with the title of The Hypocrite; here dissentis attacked in the persons of Dr Cantwell and Mawworm.

In political philosophy the reactionary spirit was represented by Sir Robert Filmer, who, in his Patriarcha (1680), argued that legitimate kings inherited the absolute power over their subjects, which he assumed Adam and the patriarchs to have possessed and exercised over their families. This doctrine was opposed by the republican Algernon Sidney, and also by Locke, whose admirable Treatises on Government appeared in 1688. Though not indisposed to admit that the monarchical constitution of existing kingdoms was originally imitated from the patriarchal rule, which in the infancy of society is known to have existed, nay, which still exists in families and clans, Locke denied that this imitation implied any devolution of right or power; the origin of civil right he sought, like Hooker, in a contract, expressed or implied, between the governors and the governed, which bound the one to govern on certain prescribed terms, that is, according to law, and the other to obey the lawful commands of the government. It is well known that this doctrine of an original contract found its way into that celebrated state-paper, the Declaration of Rights, in which it is asserted that James II. had “endeavoured to subvert the constitution of this kingdom, by breaking the original contract between king and people."

In other departments of literature, as well as political philosophy, the counter-action strongly asserted itself. Milton, “on evil tongues though fallen, and evil times,” knew that he should “fit audience find, though few,” when at the close of life he gave his long-promised service to the epic muse, and sang “an elaborate song to generations.” [9:8:425] The Paradise Lost is indisputably the work of a great and lofty mind,—of a mind armed by nature with an astonishing moral energy, and equipped with powers of imagination and conception suitable to the charge of a vast enterprise. This is the more apparent, because the diction of tbe poem certainly falls below the standard of purity and evenness which the best writers of the day had reached, while the peculiar nature of his subject involved Milton in the greatest difficulties. A number of awkward and ill-sounding words, the use of which would fix the note of pedantry on any one else than Milton, were formed by him from the Latin, and freely employed in the Paradise Lost; how injudiciously, the mere fact that not one of them has held its ground and come into common use is sufficient to prove. The subject,—belonging neither to history nor legend, so that details could not be supplied by tradition, and could only be invented at the imminent risk of profaneness,—was baffling by its very grandeur and simplicity. It did not in itself present a sufficiency of changes and incidents to furnish out the material of a long epic composition; hence Milton was obliged to have recourse to episodes, with which nearly half the poem is taken up. It is noteworthy how weighty and dignified a rhythm blank verse becomes in his hands. Never, as used by him, does it even tend to be the dull, insignificant, tiresome metre which it was in the hands of later writers, e.g., Thomson, Young, and even Wordsworth, in their negligent hours. Milton, in whose eyes the Cavaliers of the Restoration were—

“The sons

Of Belial, flown with insolence and wine,”

neither wished nor expected to be read at court. Forty years later, when counter-action had accomplished the Revolution, and Whiggism had secured much of the ground from which its parent Puritanism had been contemptuously thrust back, Whig critics like Addison found no difficulty in gaining a hearing, when they pressed upon general society the consideration of the surpassing claims of the Paradise Lost to the admiration of Englishmen.

In the department of history, the reaction produced, in Clarendon’s History of the Rebellion, a masterly and enduring work. The writers of the counter-action were also busy in this field; and Burnet’s History of the Reformation (1679) was thought to lend so much support to Protestant and liberal principles that he received the thanks of the House of Commons for writing it.

The materialistic empiricism of Hobbes gave place in this period to what has been called the sensistic empiricism, or sensationalism, of Locke. Inasmuch as this philosopher struck two important blows at principles which the Whig-Puritans detested,—at the principle of authority, by deriving all human knowledge from experience, and at the doctrine which ascribes reality both to the accidents, or sensible qualities, of objects, and to the substances in which they are supposed to inhere, by (with Descartes) awarding mere subjectivity to accidents, and relegating substance to the region of the unknowable,—he may properly be regarded as the philosopher of the counter-action.

The first book of the Essay on the Human Understanding (1689) is devoted to the endeavour to disprove the doctrine of innate ideas. Yet, when we proceed to examine Locke’s own view of the origin of our knowledge, it would appear at first sight that he admits one source which is independent of the reports of sense. Our knowledge, he says, is made up partly of ideas of sensation, partly of ideas of reflection. These last are supplied to the mind by its own operations; we know that we think, believe, doubt, will, love, <fcc. Now, if these operations were assumed to have any other basis than sensible experience, ideas of reflection might be a source of knowledge independent of the senses. But as his argument proceeds, it is evident that Locke had no such meaning. All such mental operations, in his view, are dependent on the mind’s having previously been supplied with ideas by the senses. “In time the mind comes to reflect on its own operations about the ideas got by sensation, and thereby stores itself with a new set of ideas, which I call ideas of reflection.” This and many similar passages are decisive as to Locke’s belief, that there is but one original gate of ideas, viz., the senses. The mind at birth is a tabula rasa, or, to use his own illustration, a “sheet of white paper ;” whatever knowledge it afterwards acquires is written on it by the finger of experience. This denial of a priori knowledge w as not effectually confuted till the rise of Kant, near the close of the 18th century. It followed from Locke’s principles that belief in revealed religion (which in his case was perfectly sincere) was simply and entirely a question of external evidence. If the evidence for the truth of the alleged fact or doctrine appeared sufficient, the mind would accept it; if not, reject it; but no principle inherent in its own constitution could be appealed to in either case to aid its judgment; for on Locke’s system no such principles existed.

VIII. The Age of Queen Anne, 1700-1729.—Weary of life, Dryden had descended into the tomb; aud his mantle had fallen on no poet. Grateful for support manfully rendered when all the w orld was against him, he had, in some moving and musical lines, designated in Congreve the successor to his fame —

“Let not the insulting foe my fame pursue,

But shade those laurels which descend to you :”

but that cold man of fashion never rose above the point which he had reached in the Mourning Bride. A poet, however, appeared before long, but he was a Whig poet; that is, he represented respectability, common-sense, and the juste milieu; —the cause which fires the blood, the ideal which kindles the imagination, were strange to him. This was Addison, whose Campaign (1704), an heroic poem on the battle of Blenheim, is much in the style of that portion of Dryden’s Aηrnιs Mirabilis which describes the duke of York’s victory over the Dutch fleet, but is written with more care and more concentration. To the production of Cato, a tragedy which observes the rules, and aims at exhibiting the lofty grandeur and the devotion to principle of the Roman character, Addison seems to have been induced partly by his protracted stay in Italy (where his attention was engrossed by classical monuments, and turned with indifference from mediaeval), partly by the desire to win laurels in the field where Corneille and Racine bad shone with such distinction, and to show that an English dramatist could be as correct as they. No other poem of note, with the single exception to which we shall presently refer, was written in the reign of Anne. The innumerable verses composed by Swift w 7 ere written rather to give vent to his spleen, and exercise his misanthropic humour, than under the presence of any motive which ordinarily influences poets. Parnell wrote one or two didactic pieces, and Rowe some pastoral ballads, which are not w ithout merit. Defoe’s satirical poems, The True-Born Englishman and the Ode to the Pillory, possess the interest which the indomitable character and caustic humour of the man impart to them. As a dissenter, he felt properly grateful to the Dutch prince, one of the first acts of whose reign was to establish a legal toleration, and was equally indignant with the clergymen and gentlemen of England, who, though glad to be rid of James IL, felt sore at the thought that the Revolution was effected by foreign regiments. This feeling led to a temporary insistance in society on the fact that a man was an Englishman born; and it is this insistance w hich Defoe assails with homely but effective ridicule in the True-Born Englishman. The Ode to the Pillory was [9:8:426] written while its author lay in prison, awaiting his public exposure in that “state machine” for having written The Shortest Way with the Hissenters. This was an ironical pamphlet, occasioned by the disgust with which Defoe was inspired by the conduct of the wealthy dissenters in London, who occasionally conformed to the worship of the establishment in order to qualify themselves under the Test Act for holding office. Defoe recommends the passing of an Act by which a dissenter attending a conventicle shall be made punishable by death or imprisonment for life. Many of the clergy took the pamphlet seriously, and approved of it; when it was discovered that the advice was ironical, the exasperation against Defoe was so great that it resulted in his being condemned to pay a heavy fine and to stand in the pillory. The Ode has a nervous strength, almost dignity, of style, which cau seldom be asserted of the writings of Defoe. Referring to this incident, Pope, whose Catholic rearing made him detest the abettor of the Revolution and the champion of William of Orange, wrote in the Hunciad—

“Earless on high stands unabash'd Defoe”—

though he knew that the sentence to the pillory had long ceased to entail the loss of ears.

The exceptionally remarkable poem to which reference was made in the last paragraph was Pope’s Essay on Criticism, which appeared in 1711. Of all such poems the Ars Poetica of Horace is the original model—a model, it may be added, which has never been surpassed. The classical taste, and the desire to conform to the ancient rules, which had obtained a complete ascendency in the literary circles of France during the reign of Louis XIV., were now almost equally prevalent in England. Boileau’s Épître sur l’Art Poétique, and the critical writings of Bossu, Bouhours, Dacier, and Sarasin, led to the appearance in England of such works as Roscommon’s Essay on Translated Verse, Sheffield’s two Essays, on satire and on poetry, and the critical attempts, in prose, of Rymer and Dennis. The receptivity and power of Pope’s intellect were naturally employed at an early period of his career on a line of thought, in literature and art, which interested so many able minds, and was, so to speak, in the air. He lays down in the Essay rules for the guidance of critics in judging, which, he contends, they are as much bound to observe as poets are to follow the rules of art in writing. The acuteness of observation, the terseness of definition, the brilliance of wit, and the keenness of polished invective which distinguish the Essay, render it, though containing little that is absolutely new, a composition of which English literature may well be proud.

But the chief literary achievements of this period were expressed in prose. Prose is the medium which befits the seculum rationalisticum which is now opening, an age in which men do not trouble themselves about new ideas, but reason and debate upon those which have been already manifested. Ideas possess themselves of the whole man, and impel him to remodel his life in accordance with them. The idea of the theocratic republic, growing into distinct shape in the minds of Milton, Cromwell, and other Puritans, drove them to march through war, regicide, and revolution towards its accomplishment. The idea of hereditary monarchy, ruling by virtue of a right of which the origin is lost in the mists of a venerable antiquity, and is therefore assumed to be divine, animated the Jacobites of 1700, as it animates the French legitimists of our own day. But neither of these two ideas had, after turning England upside down, succeeded in establishing itself; the country had acquiesced perforce in a compromise. The partisans of the theocratic republic were forced to put up with king, constitution, law, and an Erastian church; nevertheless they were tolerated, and even allowed to write and preach what they pleased, so long as they did not openly advocate sedition. The partisans of hereditary monarchy were forced to accept a king, and then a queen, and then a whole dynasty, whose rights had no older or more sacred origin than the Acts of Settlement of 1689 and 1701; still some deference was paid to their cherished sentiments, inasmuch as the new stock of royalty was not sought from an alien tree, but was a scion, though not the legitimate scion, growing from the old Stuart trunk. With this makeshift English loyalty was fain to be content. Thus on both sides the consistent theorists, the men of an idea, were discountenanced; and the via media in politics and religion, since it seemed to be the only practicable path, was more and more frequented by men of sense. Then a host of reasoners and debaters arose, bent upon showing, not that the compromises were logically sound, which they could not do, but that the extremists were dangerous fools. Moreover, since the compromise might be held and viewed from opposite sides, endless debate was possible, and actually arose, as to the right way of viewing it, whether mainly as a concession to liberty and democracy, or mainly as the guarantee of order and conservatism. In contests of this kind the pens of many able writers were engaged in the reign of Anne; we may mention in particular Swift, Steele, Addison, and Arbuthnot. We will briefly examine their chief performances, first in general literature and then in theology and philosophy.

Swift, appointed to the deanery of St Patrick’s in 1713, was generally believed to have no faith in revealed religion, but to adhere to what we have called “the compromise” for the sake of what he could get by it. On the night before his installation, a copy of verses was affixed to the door of St Patrick’s cathedral, containing these amongst other lines :—

“This place he got by wit and rhyme,

And other ways most odd;

And might a bishop be,—in time,

Did he believe in God.”

“Look down, St Patrick, look, we pray, On this thy church and steeple;

Convert thy dean on this great day, Or else, God help the people.”

This reputation for unbelief was acquired through the publication of The Tale of a Tub (1704), in which Swift employed the unequalled resources of his scornful wit in satirizing the extreme parties, the consistent doctrines, which the Revolution had discomfited. In the celebrated apologue of Peter, Martin, and Jack (by whom we may either understand Catholicism, Lutheranism, and Calvinism, or the Church of Rome, that of England, and the Puritans), it is hard to say whether the assault on Peter’s knavery and mendacity, or on Jack’s fanatical folly, be the∣more unsparing. Of Martin, who represents rational religion, moderation, common-sense,—in a word, the compromise,—· Swift has only expressions of approval. But we know that what men feel to be a compromise, they cannot heartily love; and it is therefore only in conformity with what we should expect, to find that for every page given to the commendation of Martin, at least twenty are employed in reviling Peter or ridiculing Jack. Hence the general effect of the work as a whole is that of an attack on Christianity; and on this account its perusal was much recommended by Voltaire.

But there were other upholders of “the compromise” who had nothing of Swift’s cynical temper, nay, who were conspicuously warm-hearted, eager, and generous. Such a man was the Irishman Richard Steele. He seems to have ∣ been descended from one of those Cromwellian adventurers who were rewarded for their services to the Puritan [9:8:427] commonwealth by grants of land at the expense of the Irish. It was natural, therefore, that his political sympathies should be of an Orange hue, and that he should regard William III. as the greatest of deliverers, the most beneficent of conquerors. For, but for the battle of the Boyne, it cannot be doubted that the confiscations of previous reigns would have been in great measure reversed, and the native Irish resettled on their own soil; in which case families of English origin and of recent importation, like that of Steele, would have fared but badly. Hence in his Christian Hero (1701), written while he was in the array, and again in the Taller, Steele launches forth into glowing panegyrics on his Dutch hero, which would have satisfied Lord Macaulay himself. The foundations being secure, Steele, whose education was English (he was at the Charterhouse and at Oxford along with Addison), employed hi3 voluble argumentative tongue and his racy Hibernian humour to improve the superstructure. Mild reasoning, gentle ridicule, harmless banter, might, he thought, be used with effect to assuage the rancour of old animosities, soften the asperity of party spirit, expose the weak side of vanity, and introduce a temper of “sweet reasonableness” into all social relations. Availing himself of the advantages which his position as conductor of the Government Gazette gave him for obtaining early news, Steele started the Taller in 1709, with the view of entertaining with instructive and amusing gossip the readers whom the promise of news from the seat of war had already attracted. The imaginary editor, Isaac Bickerstaff (the name was borrowed from Swift, who had employed it in his ironical controversy with Partridge the almanac-maker), dates his communications from various coffee-houses according to their subject matter. Addison, who was at the time in Ireland, soon discovered the authorship of the Taller, and was enlisted with joy by Steele as a contributor. It was succeeded by the Spectator (1711-1713), planned by the two friends in concert, with the same general objects as the Taller , but with better machinery. Almost at the opening, in No. 3, Addison wrote a clever vindication of the revolution-compromise, which the Jacobite leanings of some among the ministry appeared at the time to place in jeopardy. With this exception, political questions are scarcely mentioned by the Spectator, who in his character of a mild censor of manners, “pietate gravis ac meritis,” affects to stand aloof from the strife of party, and by expostulation and advice, undertakes to reform society. “The Taller and Spectator were published,” says Dr Johnson, “at a time when two parties, loud, restless, and violent, each with plausible declarations, and each perhaps without any distinct termination of its views, were agitating the nation; to minds heated with political contest they supplied cooler and more inoffensive reflexions: and it is said by Addison that they had a perceptible influence upon the conversation of that time, and taught the frolic and the gay to unite merriment with decency.”

By turning to fresh intellectual fields the minds of the upper classes—the people in good society—to whom the theatre was now a forbidden or despised excitement, Addison and Steele did without doubt allay much restlessness, still or amuse many feverish longings. Its ideals discredited or found impracticable, the English mind, disenchanted and in heavy cheer, took up with languid interest these pleasant chatty discoursings about things in general, and allowed itself to be amused, and half forgot its spiritual perplexities. Nothing was settled by these papers, nothing really probed to the bottom; but they taught, with much light grace and humour, lessons of good sense and mutual tolerance; and their popularity proved that the lesson was relished. The characterization which we meet with in the Spectator has been justly admired. Sir Roger de Coverley is an excellent type of the English country gentleman of that day—unintelligent and full of prejudices, but manly, open-hearted, and conscientious. The mercantile classes are represented, less adequately, yet in a dignified and attractive manner, by Sir Andrew Freeport. Captain Sentry, as the representative of the army, is not so satisfactory; compare him with Uncle Toby and Corporal Trim in Sterne’s Tristram Shandy and the contrast between a dull, wooden figure, and personages who bring the life of the British army in Flanders exactly and vividly before our eyes, is immediately apparent.

The theological controversies of the period were carried on chiefly between deists and churchmen on the one hand, and non jurors and oath-takers on the other. There will always be able men to whom revealed religion will not commend itself, because demonstration of its truth is in the nature of things impossible, and the portal through which conviction must be reached is too lowly for many to enter. In this age of reasoning, the English writers who followed Hobbes in eliminating the supernatural from Christianity considered it tobe their duty to exhibit their proofs in the clearest and most systematic manner. Thus arose the school of English deists. Toland, the author of a good life of Milton, led the way with Christianity not Mysterious (1702). Tindal followed with Christianity as Old as the Creation, in which an attempt is made to identify Christ with Crishna, and to evaporate the Christian religion into a solar myth. Collins, in his Discourse on Free-Thinking, took the line of impugning the trustworthiness of the text of Scripture. He was answered by Dr Richard Bentley in a tract called Phileleutherus Lipsieηsis, in which it is maintained that the text of the Greek Testament is on the whole in a sounder state than that of any of the Greek classical authors. Berkeley combated free-thinking in the philosophical dialogue of Alciphron. Bishop Butler, and afterwards Warburton, contributed important works to the same controversy.

In philosophy the trains of thought which Hobbes and Leibnitz had pursued were either further developed, or led to opposing reactions. Hobbes’s selfish theory of morals, and his disposition to leave out the idea of God from his system of the universe, found resolute opponents, not only in Clarke and Berkeley, but also in Shaftesbury, the noble author of the Characteristics. The treatises composing this work were published at various times between 1708 and 1713. Shaftesbury maintains the disinterested theory of; morals, but rather in a rhetorical way than with much solidity of argument. he derives virtue, beneficence, and compassion, not, as Hobbes had in each case done, from a source tainted by self interest, but from the delight which the mind naturally takes in actions and feelings conformable to its own unperverted nature. In his general reasonings on the constitution of nature and of man, Shaftesbury is an optimist; but his optimism acquires its serenity at the cost of surrendering the distinction between good and evil, virtue and vice. Like Pope (who, indeed, in the Essay on Man, versified and condensed freely the glowing rhetoric of the Characteristics), Shaftesbury

“Accounts for moral as for natural things the Deity whom he celebrates in eloquent periods is not a being who hates moral evil while permitting it, but one from whose elevated point of view that which seems to us worthy of reprobation must appear as necessary to the working out of a vast scheme of paternal government. These views bear a considerable resemblance to the hypothesis more cautiously put forward by the late Professor Mansel,> and at once combated by Mr Mill and Professor Goldwin Smith, which suggested that man’s ideas of justice and injustice, right and wrong, were perhaps[9:8:428] entirely different in kind from those which existed in the mind of God. It is obvious that the Supreme Being of the Characteristics, in whose eyes the excesses of the Reign of Terror would be merely a hurricane purifying the moral atmosphere, and who would see “with equal eye”

“A heιo perish or a sparrow fall ”—

has little in common with the God of the New Testament, whose absolute rejection of iniquity is the very basis on which revealed religion is built, and in whose eyes the least of his reasonable creatures is “of more value than many sparrows.” This dissonance between Christianity and his own system was evident to Shaftesbury himself, and led him to speak disrespectfully of the former in various places of his writings. He is accordingly classed by Leland among deistical writers. Pope, less clearsighted, would not admit that the philosophy of the Essay on Man (which is precisely the same as that of Shaftesbury) was in any way repugnant to Christianity; and Warburton argued laboriously on the same side. Nevertheless, in his Universal Prayer, Pope implicitly retracted the main tenet of the longer poem; and posterity has held that Crousaz, the assailant of the Essay, understood its real bearing better than Warburton its defender

Disturbed at the thought of the predominance which the spread of Locke’s sensationalist philosophy might be expected to give to the material interests of man, yet not choosing to revert to any of the old systems which let in the principle of authority, Berkeley conceived the strange idea of denying the validity of the inferences made by every perceiving mind concerning the objects perceived. He denied the existence of matter, or material substance, which is merely the name given by philosophers to the “something” which underlies and supports the sensible qualities of an object. The objects themselves, he admitted, are real; the ideas which the mind forms concerning them are also real; moreover, these ideas constitute for man the sole road to the knowledge of the objects. Instead of holding with Locke that the objecte, by the impressions which they make on the senses, engender ideas, he held that the ideas implanted by the Creator in the human mind teach it all that it can possibly know about the objects. This ideal philosophy, having a merely subjective base—growing neither out of tradition nor experience—might obviously be twisted to the vindication of any system of opinions whatever. Hume, therefore, as we shall see in the next section, had not much difficulty in reducing it ad absurdum, by developing further the sceptical theory from which it started.

In France and Spain, Lesage and Lazarillo de Tonnes had already won laurels by writing humorous tales of fiction in prose. Defoe, with us, was the first of a series in which he has had so many brilliant successors, by composing Pobinson Crusoe (1719). Many other fictitious tales, in all which he aimed at the appearance of being a truthful narrator of facts, followed from the same facile pen. But in the texture of these, as in the mind that produced them, there was something coarse and homely; they could not supplant for refined rêaders the high flown romances of Franco. That was reserved for the sentimental novels of Richardson; similia similibus curantur.

IX. The Triumph of Compromise, 1729-1789.—In the early part of this period, Pope, who died in 1744, was still the great literary force; for most of the remainder of it, that honour belonged to Samuel Johnson. Nothing can more strongly demonstrate the vitality of the political principles which triumphed at the Revolution than the fact that both these great men, though in secret they abhorred the compromise, had no choice but to acquiesce in it. Pope, whose grounds of dislike were both religious and political, indemnified himself for his acquiescence by many a scornful gibe and bitter sarcasm levelled at the German family which had seated itself on the Stuart throne. Witness the mocking adulation of the opening lines of the epistle to Augustus (George IT ), or the scathing satire with which he pursued the memory of Queen Caroline both in the Dunciad and the Epilogue to the Satires, though he knew, and even admitted in a note, that that princess in her last moments “manifested the utmost courage and resolution.” Johnson, whose objection to the compromise was almost wholly political, was an arrant Jacobite in feeling to the end of his days. One of his earliest productions, the Marmor Norfolciense, is a clever and cutting Jacobite squib. Allusions in his satire of London (1738) show the same political colour, and probably had much to do with the sympathizing approval which Pope expressed for the unknown poet, who, he said, would soon be deterre. And although, after he had accepted a pension from George III., he could not decently, as he smilingly admitted to Boswell, “drink King James’s health in the wine that King George gave him the money to pay for,” yet the old feeling lurked in his mind, and found violent expression in a recorded conversation as late as 1777. “He had this evening a violent argument with Dr Taylor as to the inclinations of the people of England at this time towards the royal family of Stuart. He grew so outrageous as to say that, ‘ if England were fairly polled, the present king would be sent away to-night, and his adherents hanged to-morrow.'”

But, in general, the compromise met with inward no less than outward assent on the part of all the leading minds of the nation, literary men and divines equally with statesmen. For the first part of the period, the resolute common sense of Walpole, and the moderate churchmanship of Warburton, accurately represented the English mind. The defect of a compromise is, as was said in the last section, that it does not kindle enthusiasm; under it politics and politicians are apt to grow dull and vapid. Such a state of things prevailed at the time of the rising of 1745, when the young Pretender was not very far from succeeding, from sheer inertness on the part of those concerned in upholding the Revolution settlement. Soon afterwards there was a change. Young men grew up, before whose eyes floated visions of an expanding empire; the rapid advance of the American colonies, the success of Englishmen in India, on both which fields France was then our rival, stimulated the genius of the elder Pitt, and furnished themes for the eloquence of Burke. Then the value of those principles of political liberty which had been consolidated at the Revolution came to be understood. Through these Pitt achieved in the Seven Years’ War his memorable triumph over the absolute monarchies of France and Spain; and at the Peace of Paris (1763) England stood at the greatest height of national glory which is recorded in her history. Yet the brilliant scene was soon overcast. A Toryism without ideas, which was but in fact the portion of Revolution-Whiggism which refused to move with the times, aided by the personal influence of a narrow-minded, illiberal king, got possession of the administration, and immediately everything went wrong. The American war succeeded, and neither the authority of Chatham nor the enlightenment of Burke and Wyndham could prevent its ending in disaster. Soon after the Peace of Versailles the younger Pitt, then a sincere Whig, came into power. He applied himself with great skill and industry to the work of binding firmly together that inheritance of empire,—still sufficiently ample, —which the peace had left us, when in the middle of his task he was suddenly confronted by the portentous outbreak of the French revolution.

This period witnessed the foundation of the science of political economy by Adam Smith, whose memorable [9:8:429] Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations appeared in 1776. It also produced several eminent historians and philosophers, of whose works some notice will be taken presently. In other departments of literature, after the death of Pope, it was but poorly distinguished. Gray will be long remembered for the beauty and melody of some of his pieces,—the Elegy in a Country Churchyard, the Bard, and the Progress of Poesy. In the elegant poems of Goldsmith occur passages of sentiment, e.g., the famous lines “Ill fares the land,” <fcc., which read like anticipations of Rousseau. The satires of Churchill, though vigorous and pointed, are founded upon no intelligible principle; they have no universal character, like those of Pope, nor do they represent any definite political or religious view; rather they are dictated by mere national prejudice {e-g., the Prophecy of Famine, a tirade against the Scotch), or by vulgar partisanship,—the eternal animosity of the outs against the ins. The Rosciad was a satire upon a stage sunk so low as not to be worth satirizing. There is much sweetness and grace in the verses of Shenstone; they formed part of the intellectual food which nourished the strong soul of Burns. Collins’s Ode to the Passions, so much praised by our grandfathers, is gradually passing out of ken. The Night Thoughts of Young demand our notice, as the work of a man of large intellectual capacity, though of ignoble character. His meditations, though they never pass into the mystical or transcendental stage, are just and edifying; in applying them he displays a rich sermonizing vein; but a flavour of cant hangs about his most ambitious efforts. Beattie’s Minstrel, a poem in the Spenserian stanza, deserves a passing word of commendation; it unites manly dignity to refinement and delicacy of feeling. Cowper, ever on the brink of insanity, resorted to literature in order to prevent his mind from preying on itself. An amiable piety makes his Task, a long moralizing poem in blank verse, attractive to many minds; from the mere literary point of view, it must be allowed to be a feeble production. As he gained more confidence in himself, he developed a curious sort of mild feline humour, which appears in the delightful ballad of John Gilpin, and in several shorter pieces. The strength which had been wanting all his life came to him near its close, and inspired him to write those stanzas of wondrous majesty and beauty which have the title of The Castaway; —unhappily it was thestrength of spiritual despair.

Beyond the Tweed, as Johnson was sinking towards the grave, and when the voice of English poetry had almost ceased to sound, a man of genius was coming to maturity, whose direct and impassioned utterances, straight from the heart of nature, were to reduce the frigid imitators of Pope to their proper insignificance, to startle the dull worshippers of the conventional, and to prepare the English-speaking world for that general break-up of formulas which the tempest of the French Revolution was about to initiate. Robert Burns was a native force; no foreign literature moulded him, no influence of Continental thought either made or marred him. He had the education of a Scottish peasant, and his self-culture does not appear to have consisted in much more than reading Pope and Shenstone, the Spectator, Sterne’s novels, aud a few other popular books. His natural powers were of the finest and highest order. Truly writes his countryman, the late Professor Craik: “Burns’s head was as strong as his heart; his natural sagacity, logical faculty, and judgment were of the first order; no man, of poetical or prosaic temperament, ever had a more substantial intellectual character.” The man being such, and such the equipment with which education and circumstance had furnished him, we observe with interest that he came into serious collision, on becoming complete master of his powers, with the religious system,—that of the Presbyterian Kirk of Scotland,—in which he had been brought up. It neither awed, nor attracted, nor convinced him. He never wrote more powerfully, or with a more searching humour, than when employed in exposing the hypocrisy and fanaticism of certain of its ministers.^[7. “Holy Willies Prayer,” “The Holy Fair,” &c.] If he had friends among them, it was among the “Moderates,” a party corresponding to the Broad Church clergy of the present day, whom their colleagues in the Presbyterian ministry regarded with undisguised abhorrence. Religion, therefore, established no control over him; and unhappily this splendid nature found no resource in philosophy, nor moral strength within, which could avail to save him from the tyranny of his passions. “Vina, Venus,”— two out of the three banes spoken of by the Roman epigrammatist,—undermined too soon that stalwart frame, and silvered that glorious head. He died in his thirtyseventh year in 1796, leaving behind him, besides a few longer pieces, more than 200 songs, among which may be found gems of pathos, melody, and beauty, which any nation might be proud to wear in its intellectual coronet.

In the history of the drama during this period, the most noteworthy feature is the return of Shakespeare to the stage, brought about, soon after the middle of the century, by the reverent zeal of Garrick. When Drury Lane theatre was opened in 1747, chiefly for the performance of Shakespeare’s plays, Johnson wrote the celebrated Prologue which was delivered on the occasion, describing the great dramatist as “exhausting worlds and then imagining new,” as spurning the “bounded reign” of real existence, and forcing time to “pant after him in vain.” Comedy, no longer gross, had become commonplace. From this reproach the two admirable plays of Goldsmith, She Stoops to Conquer and 7'7/e Good-Natured Man, temporarily freed it; nor could it be justly imputed during the period of Sheridan’s connection with the stage, from 1775 to 1780. But the wit that blazes,—the fun that sparkles,—in the scenes of the Rivals and the Critic, are of no purely English growth. Sheridan’s Irish birth and Celtic temperament must be largely credited with the brightness and permanent attractiveness of his plays.

Prose fiction, which more and more came to supply that kind of intellectual distraction which had before been sought in the drama, and, aided by the printing press, to diffuse its blessings (if they are blessings) to strata of the population which the drama had never reached, was employed in this period by several writers of rare ability. Fielding’s Tom Jones and Amelia, Richardson’s Clarissa Harlowe and Sir Charles Grandison, made the same kind of stir in general society that had been caused by Dryden’s heroic plays some eighty years before. An ingenious French critic (Philarète Chasles) has attempted to trεce in the works of these writers the conflict, though much transformed, of the Puritans and Cavaliers of an earlier age. Lovelace, he thinks, represents the insolent temper and disregard for morality of the aristocratic Cavaliers; Clarissa, his victim, the daughter of a virtuous middle class family, exhibits the substantial rectitude of that “good old cause,” which licentious courts could persecute but could not subdue. Fielding, the aristocrat, recalls and continues the jovial recklessness of the men of the Restoration; Richardson, the plebeian, is in the line of Milton, Penn, Fox, Bunyan, and other witnesses. Yet these resemblances are after all superficial. It is true that Fielding cannot help writing like a gentleman, and a member of an ancient house; while Richardson, though he is fond of giving titles to his characters, betrays perhaps by his seriousness his breeding among the upper and most respectable classes of the proletariate. But when we_.look more closely, we find [9:8:430] that both Fielding and Richardson adhere firmly to the Revolution-compromise, both in religion and politics,—and the one quite as much as the other. Fielding is as zealous a Protestant as Bunyan or Baxter; and the doctrine of nonresistance was rejected by him as warmly as by the Whig prosecutors of Sacheverell. Richardson, again, is neither a republican nor a nonconformist. He finds no objection, on the score of tolerance and latitude, to the church of Burnet, Tillotson, and Hoadly; and the hereditary presidency which the Act of Settlement had vested in the Hanoverian family was too feeble and inoffensive to excite in the breast of the most zealous of Whigs fears of the preponderance of the regal power in the constitution. Both Richardson and Fielding are entirely satisfied with the political and religious constitution of the land they live in. Dismissing such fancies, let us consider what were the actual occasions which led to the production of Pamela and the novels which followed it, and in what relation they stand to preceding literary work. They were in the main at once the symptoms and the developing causes of a reaction against the sentimental romances with which ladie3 and gentlemen had stuffed their heads and beguiled their time in the 17th and in the early part of the 18th century. A list of the chief works of this kind of literature is to be found in Addison’s amusing paper on Leonora’s library (Spectator, No. 37); it includes Sidney’s Arcadia, the Grand Cyrus, Cassandra, Pharamond, Cleopatra, &c*, the works named being all translations from the French romances of Scudery and Calprenède. The excessive popularity of this kind of reading is intimated by Addison when he says (No. 92), adverting to letters which he has received in relation to his project of forming a perfect “lady’s library,” that he has been “advised to place Pharamond at the head of his catalogue, and, if he thinks proper, to give the second place to CassaηdraP In the character of Leonora herself, Addison mildly ridicules the sentimentality, affectation, and unreality which such reading, carried to excess, engenders. Richardson, whose father was a Derbyshire joiner, and who was brought up to the trade of a printer, in which he persevered all his life and prospered, had reached his fiftieth year when he was requested by two London booksellers to write for publication a series of Familiar Letters, for the instruction of persons who did not know how to express themselves properly in writing about the ordinary affairs of life. He consented, but proposed to give a moral and improving turn to the instruction to be communicated; to this the booksellers at once agreed. While he was writing model letters giving advice to young women going out to service, the incidents of a story which had come within his own experience occurred to his mind. It seemed to him that this story, if told by way of letters, “in an easy and natural manner, suitable to the simplicity of it, might possibly introduce a new species of writing that might turn young people into a course of reading different from the pomp and parade of romance writing, and, dismissing the improbable and marvellous, with which novels generally abound, might tend to promote the cause of religion and virtue.” The heroine of his tale was a simple country girl, without book learning, but strong in virtue and honesty of heart, to whom he gave the name Pamela (one of the two princesses in Sidney’s Arcadia), as if to show that, to quote from Emerson, “the life of man is the true romance, which, if it be valiantly conducted, will yield the imagination a higher charm than any fiction.” Pamela’s virtue is assailed by the young libertine in whose house she is living as a servant; she resists him, and her “virtue” is “rewarded ,l (this is the second title of the book) by the honour and glory of marriage with this reprobate, who, being a fine gentleman, and stooping to a union with a “lass of low degree,” atones for all past shortcomings by this amazing condescension. The book was well received; Pope, then declining towards the tomb, praised it as “likely to do more good than twenty volumes of sermons.” There was, however, a strain of vulgarity in the manner in which the catastrophe of this romance of real life was narrated; and this defect was noted by the eagle eye of Fielding. As a burlesque upon Pamela, he wrote (1742) the Adventures of Joseph Andrews. Joseph is a virtuous footman who resists the improper advances of the titled lady in whose service he is; this of course was mere jest and caricature; in the end Joseph, instead of, like Pamela, marrying out of his condition, is wedded, as common sense would dictate, to a pretty modest girl of his own rank. The bent of his own powers, and the suitableness of this new field for their employment, must have been revealed to Fielding while writing Joseph Andrews. Till now it had been his ambition to shine as a dramatist, and he had produced some plays of no inconsiderable merit; but soon after the appearance of his first novel he quitted the stage and gave up the remainder of his life, so far as it was not engrossed by the duties of a zealous police magistrate, partly to the production of essays on social topics, partly to novel-writing. Tom Jones (1749) is allowed to be his master-piece; it is one of the finest pieces of character-painting to be found in the whole range of literature. Yet it must be understood that Fielding’s characters belong to a social medium from which the ideal and the heroic are shut out by the conditions of its existence; the “compromise” which England had accepted repressed enthusiasm and a high strain of virtue in every direction; no creations, therefore, possessing the immortal interest of some of those in Don Quixote could be expected from him who has been sometimes called the “English Cervantes.” But taking them as they are, the characters of Tom Jones and Blifil, of Thwackum and Square, present us with inimitable types. Tom Jones, as the generous, manly youth, whom passion hurries into vice, but good feeling and innate rectitude never fail to rescue, is contrasted with the artful hypocrite Blifil, whose outward demeanour pays a homage to virtue which his secret practices and desires undo. Thwackum, the pedagogue, shows what comes of a pedantic learning which has nothing of the largeness of true culture; Square, the thinker, exhibits the moral decadence that results from a grovelling philosophy. In 1748 Richardson published Clarissa Harlowe, and in 1753 >S⅛'r Charles Grandison; both these novels are in the epistolary form. Clarissa soon obtained a European reputation, the sentimental metaphysics which constitute so large a portion of it being exactly to the taste of a large number of readers in France and Switzerland. Rousseau adopted the style, while corrupting the principles, of the English author, when he wrote t his Nouvelle Heloιse. The casuistry of love and seduction is interminable; so also is the novel of Clarissa, yet perhaps no reader who had launched fairly into it ever put the book down unfinished. It excites a deep tragic interest which no formal tragedy produced in England had awakened for several generations; the noble Clarissa, dying because she cannot brook a stain which yet touched not her will, nor came near her conscience, is a spectacle pathetic and touching in the extreme. The chivalrous, but provokingly perfect, Sir Charles Grandison was the character created by Richardson as a kind of contrast to, and compensation for, the aristocratic villain, Lovelace. His embarrassing situation between two lovely women who both adore him, and both of whom he loves, the English Harriet and the Italian Clementina,— though in the brief telling it seems absurd,—is managed in the novel with so much art and vraisemblance as to inspire the reader during seven volumes with a genuine perplexity and solicitude. His abrupt half-declaration to Harriet—
[9:8:431]

“Honour forbids me; yet honour bids me;—yet I cannot be unjust, ungenerous, selfish!”—is a delicious morceau which can never fail to captivate, and fill with attendrissement, souls of sensibility. After Richardson and Fielding came Smollett, with his Roderick Random and Humphrey Clinker, novels of coarser mould, and Sterne with Tristram Shandy and the Sentimental Journey. As works of humour, which contain also several admirable and minutely drawn pictures of character, the two last-named works, or at any rate Tristram Shandy, stand alone in our literature; but they are not in the proper sense of the term novels. It is interesting to note that Sheridan borrowed some of his most popular characters from the novelists; Charles and Joseph Surface are evident copies of Tom Jones and Blifil; while Tabitha Bramble and Sir Ulic Mackilligut are no less manifestly the originals of Mrs Malaprop and Sir Lucius O’Trigger. These are not the only resemblances; in fact Humphrey Clinker is the mine out of which Sheridan dug The Rivals. Nothing was more common, in the drama of the Elizabethan age, than for the play-wrights to take their plots from novels. But in the present case we note a difference in the mode of procedure, which is a marked testimony to the increased relative importance of the novel. The Elizabethan dramatists borrowed only names and incidents; they created their characters. The Georgian dramatists often borrowed their characters ready made from the pages of the novels, now glowing with a warmer life and richer colouring than their own. To the novels already mentioned Goldsmith’s Vicar of Wakefield (1766) must be added,—the book which first drew Goethe’s attention to English literature, and disclosed the hitherto unsuspected idyllic side of the existence of the good Protestant village pastor. To pass over inferior writers (Frances Burney, Henry Mackenzie, <fcc.), enough has been said to show that England, after the middle of the 18th century, obtained a school of novel-writers of her own, and shook herself free from the trammels alike of French classicism and French romanticism; nor have the able writers who then came into prominence ever wanted worthy successors down to the present day.

The luminous intellect of Voltaire had, in the Essai sur les Moeurs, cast a fresh light on history, which was soon reflected in the writings of English students in this field. In the preface to the Essai, Voltaire said that the question was no longer to inform the world “in what year a prince who did not deserve to be remembered succeeded another barbarian like himself, in the midst of a rude and coarse nation.” Henceforth it would be the business of a historian to seek out, amidst the throng of recorded events, “that which deserves to be known by us,—the spirit, the manners, the usages of the principal nations.” Not believing in Christianity, and looking to intellectual and literary culture as the great means of human progress, Voltaire naturally regarded the history of the first ten centuries of our era as “no more deserving of being known than the history of the wolves and the bears ;” feudalism and the Middle Ages filled him with disgust; it was only when he came to the Renaissance, with its revival of learning, its tolerance of theological differences, and its love of polish, that he seemed to find anything worth writing a history about. H ume, composing a History of England (1754) under the influence of ideas not very dissimilar to those of Voltaire, and commencing with the Stuart period, was not likely to write favourably of the Puritans, who were neither tolerant nor polished. His work accordingly gave much offence to the Whig party, which had inherited the political traditions of Puritanism. Robertson’s historical pictures,—of Scotland, of Charles V., and of the settlement of America, —did not, except incidentally, go back beyond the period of the Renaissance; the actions of men who lived before that age seemed to him scarcely on a par with the “dignity of history.” Gibbon’s great work, the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, is designed to trace the gradual political debilitation of the empire, and the extinction of letters and arts through the ravages of the barbarians; thence passing with a firm and vigorous step through the long night of barbarism he dilates with eloquence and delight on the story of the rekindling of the flame of learning, and the renewed appreciation of beauty and refinement, which characterized the Italian Renaissance of the 14th and 15th centuries. We see that the historians of the 18th century, our own among the number, regarded the early and middle ages of our era as the province of the antiquary and the annalist rather than the historian proper,—who, if he dealt with them at all, should despatch them in brief summaries, in which, assuming an air of great superiority, he should try the men of the 9th or any other early century by the prevalent ideas of the eighteenth. Obviously, in the age in which we live, we have “changed all that;” the age of the Renaissance no longer presents itself to our eyes with such an overpowering lustre; and research into the motives and cast of thought of a Charlemagne or a Henry II. seems to us no longer beneath the “dignity of history.”

In theology, one very remarkable work belongs to this period,— Butler’s Analogy of Religion to the Constitution and Course of Mature (1736). This is an apologetic work, and may perhaps be regarded as the last word in the deistical controversy. Butler, whose caution and fairness of mind are truly admirable, and who does not pretend that the inquiry which he institutes leads to more than probable conclusions, argues in this work that it is just as difficult to believe nature to have proceeded from and to be ruled by God, as to admit that Christianity has a divine origin. This line of reasoning, though cogent as against the deists, most of whom admitted a divine author of nature, is obviously insufficient to meet the scepticism of the present day, which, embracing the theory of evolution, either rejects the belief in a First Cause altogether, or declines to examine it, as lying beyond the scope of the human faculties. The Sermons of Bishop Butler, in which he established against Hobbes the fact of the existence in the human mind of disinterested affections and dispositions pointing to the good of others, belongs rather to the department of philosophy than that of theology.

The philosophical speculations of this period may be described as a series of oscillations round Locke’s Essay o∕ 1 the Human Understanding,— Hume taking Locke’s principles,and turning them into a theory of scepticism; Hutcheson starting the theory of a new “sense” never dreamed of before, the moral sense; Hartley and Priestley developing Locke’s sensationalism into materialism; while the Scotch school (Reid, Beattie, Dugald Stewart), recoiling from the consequences of Locke’s system, attempted to smuggle “innate ideas” back into philosophy under the names of “common sense,” “instinctive judgments,” “irresistible beliefs,” and so forth. Such brief examination of these writers as our limits allow will mako our meaning clearer.

Locke’s system, says Dugald Stewart,^[8. Outlines of Moral Philosophy, ed. by M'Cosh, p. 49.] in making sensation and reflection the sources of all our simple ideas, led him “to some dangerous opinions concerning the nature of moral distinctions, which he seems to have considered as the offspring of education and fashion.” How Berkeley combated the tendencies of Locke’s principles we have already seen. Hutcheson, an Irishman of great acuteness, who was appointed to a philosophical chair at Glasgow in 1729, unwilling to admit that our moral ideashad no other ultimate source than sensation, yet wishing to conform as much as possible to Locke’s terminology, referred the [9:8:432] “origin of our moral ideas to a particular power of perception, to which he gave the name of the moral sense.”^[9. Dugald Stewart.] But this was to use the word “sense” in a different meaning from what it had ever borne before; inasmuch as the objects of this so-called sense, being the qualities of moral actions, must be of necessity incorporeal, intangible, and imperceptible, and, as such, totally unlike the objects of the faculties commonly called senses, viz., sights, sounds, smells, tastes, &c. Nor was anything gained for the independence and immutability of morality; for it was argued by commentators on Hutcheson that, if the moral faculty were a “sense,” then the qualities perceived by it, like the secondary qualities of material objects perceived by sensation and reflection, must be understood as subjective not objective, as existing in and for the perceiving mind alone, aud not inherent in the actions themselves, which would thus become colourless and neutral, i.e., destitute of moral character.

A return upon scepticism was a frequent incident in the history of the Greek schools of thought, especially when the principles of opposing systems had been put forth with unusual warmth, and their supporters had found reconciliation and the explanation of differences out of the question. An example of this, in the history of English thought, is furnished by the case of Hume. Provoked by the extravagant paradoxes of Berkeley, who had ecclesiastical and professional reasons for trying to convince men that material objects had no reality,—mind was everything,— since the mystical and unnatural state of mind so engendered would favour the reception of any theology the philosopher might afterwards desire to implant,—Hume undertook to prove that mind had no real existence any more than matter, or that, if it had, such existence could not be proved. When I talk of “my mind,” he said, how do I know that there is anything really existent which corresponds to the words? By the impressions and sensations of which I am conscious? But these only prove themselves; no one of course denies them; I only deny, at least I say you cannot prove, the existence of au entity in which these impressions inhere, and to which you give the name of “mind.” If there was no flaw in such reasoning, philosophy was brought to a stand, and no certainty of any kind was attainable by the human faculties.

Before the Scotch school and the great Immanuel Kant appeared to challenge these conclusions, David Hartley, in his Observations on Man (1749), espoused the tenets of Locke, and applied all his ingenuity to explaining the origin of as much of our knowledge as he could with any plausibility so treat, by referring it to the physical principle of the “association of ideas.”

In the treatise already referred to, Hume declares that he does not wish to undermine or even to combat any man’s belief; his aim was only to demolish bad logic, to expose the emptiness of alleged proofs of the divine government which were no proofs at all, and to make men see that “belief is more properly an act of the sensitive than of the cogitative part of our nature.” The line of thought suggested by this and similar expressions appears to have been taken up and eagerly pursued by Reid, who, in his Inquiry into the Human Mind upon the Principles of Common Sense (1764), maintains that a large, and not the least important part of our knowledge is acquired, not, as Locke asserted, through sensation and reflection, but by means of immediate and instinctive judgments, in forming which the common sense of all mankind is at one. The moral faculty, according to Reid, judges of right and wrong in this instinctive way: it is a branch of common sense. Beattie, who was a better poet than he was a philosopher, pushed Reid’s theory to an extreme which bordered on the ridiculous, including among the “irresistible” and “necessary” beliefs of the human mind a number of notions which are really of a historic and derivative character. Dr Priestley, the discoverer of oxygen, adopting the system of Locke as a basis, wrote on Matter and Spirit, criticised the philosophy of Reid, and discussed the tenet of philosophical necessity; a strong materialistic bias pervades his writings. A greater thinker than any that Europe had witnessed since Descartes, now arose in Germany. This was Kant, whose ambition it was to put a period to the desolating prevalence of scepticism, and deliver philosophy from the instability and uncertainty by which it had been long beset. His Critique of the Pure Peason appeared about 1781. Against Locke, he showed that the mind can form neither conceptions nor judgments without the pre-existence in the thought of the absolute and universal ideas of time, space, unity, cause, being, &c.,— which ideas proceed from the intelligence itself, without any action being exerted on the organs of sensation. They are a priori, that is, prior to sensible experience; they belong to the pure reason, and may be regarded as the forms of our knowledge,—forms which the understanding applies to the material furnished by perceptions. He does not, however, allow that these ideas, though a priori, have any objective character; and for this metaphysical subjectivism he has been strenuously assailed by the Platonizing and orthodox schools of the present day. Against the materialists he maintains, in the Critique of the Practical Peason, that the “moral motive,” or principle, which the intelligence (called in this aspect the practical reason) furnishes us with for the direction of our will, is immutable,—absolute,— necessary,—given a priori by the reason, and presenting to us the supreme and universal good as the final end of our existence, our desires, and our efforts. This motive is duty, or the moral obligation imposed on the human will by a power above it, which, consequently, is not man himself. To the knowledge, therefore, derived from the practical reason, Kant ascribes an objective character, which, as we saw, he denied to the forms of the pure reason. This law of duty supposes liberty in man as the very condition of the obligation which it imposes on him. Here of course Kant is at variance with the necessitarians and materialists. There being a necessary connection between virtue, i.e., the obedience to duty, and the supreme good which it seeks, yet this connection being only partially realizable in this life, Kant infers the reality of a future life and the immortality of the soul. And, in view of our powerlessness to bring about this harmony between happiness and virtue, he infers the existence of a First Cause, infinitely powerful, just, and wise, which will establish it hereafter. The colossal system of Kant was known to Dugald Stewart (whose first work, Outlines of Moral Philosophy, appeared in 1793), but only through the medium of an imperfect Latin translation; from this cause, probably, he is thought to have failed to do full justice to it. Dugald Stewart, who was appointed to the chair of moral philosophy at Edinburgh in 1785, was the master of a clear and charming style, which made his lectures the delight of a large circle of pupils. Among these were numbered not a few, in the spheres both of thought and action, who have left their mark 0n the age and the society to which they belonged,—Brougham, Lord Palmerston, Lord Russell, Francis Horner,Lord Lansdowne, Jeffrey, Sir Walter Scott, Sydney Smith, James Mill, Alison the historian, and Dr Chalmers,—a varied and brilliant auditory for one pιofessor to have lectured to and influenced in his day. One of the most interesting of Stewart’s numerous works is his Dissertation concerning the Progress of Metaphysical, Ethical, and Political Philosophy since the Revival of Letters in Europe. In his Outlines [9:8:433] (the work above mentioned', he argued, keeping generally to the lines of Butler and Hutcheson, that there is a moral faculty in man, that it is guided by duty not by interest, and that these two are not in the present state of the world identical, nor are the feelings that are inspired by actions prompted by the one the same as those which are suggested by actions prompted by the other. Right and wrong, he thinks, must be held to be intrinsic qualities of actions, and not merely modes of the mind observing those actions. Everywhere he is firm and explicit on the immutability of moral distinctions. In fact, in its general outcome his ethical philosophy resembles pretty closely that of Kant; but it is not thought out with the same rigour of logic, nor founded on as searching a psychological analysis, nor expressed in as exact a terminology, as belong to the writings of the philosopher of Königsberg.

X. The French Revolution, 1789-1832.—Probably there was not a single gifted mind in any country of Europe upon which the tempest of the French Revolution did not come with a stimulating or disturbing influence. Young men— hasty counsellors ever, from the days of Rehoboam,—thrilled with hope and flushed with excitement, announced and believed that a golden age had opened for mankind. Wordsworth hastened from Cambridge in 1792 to France, where he lived more than a year, and formed some Girondist acquaintances; Coleridge invented a scheme for an ideal community which was to form a model settlement, to be conducted on principles of pantisocracy, on the banks of the Susquehanna; Southey nearly got himself into trouble by publishing JVat Tyler, a dramatic sketch of an inflammatory and seditious character. On the other hand, the young Walter Scott looked with shrewd, clear eyes on the tumultuous scene, and was not tempted to throw himself into the vortex; for him the treasures of Europe’s mighty past were real and precious, and not to be bartered for any quantity of visionary hopes and fairy gold. Soon the proceedings of the Revolutionists made it clear enough that human nature and human motives were not changed; and the rauks of reaction were rapidly filled. In England an immense effect was produced by the appearance of Burke’s Reflections on the French Revolution in 1791. The sympathizers with the French republicans dwindled in number so fast, that at the end of the century, as it was sportively said, the whole of the opposition to Pitt’s Government in the House of Lords went home from the debate in a single hack cab. Wordsworth, Southey, and Coleridge changed round to the Conservative side. The appearance in France of the Genie du Christianisme (1802) by Chateaubriand marked the commencement of the great continental reaction. The public policy of England became essentially conservative; she endeavoured to prop up all the old monarchies on the Continent, whether they deserved to live or not; she harboured thousands of French priests; she supported the temporal power of the pope. A remarkable dissonance hence arose.between the policy of the country and some of the finest notes in its literature, while the English aristocracy was putting forth its full strength to combat Jacobinism by land and sea, the spirit of revolution breathed from the pages of Shelley and Byron. The war with Napoleon waβ waged with the approval of the great majority of the nation; but the able critics and publicists who conducted the Edinburgh Review (started in 1802) were vehemently opposed toit, and would, if their influence had prevailed, have withdrawn the sword of England from the contest at least ten years before Waterloo.

The romantic poems of Scott (Lay of the Last Minstrel, Marmion, Lady of the Lake, &c.) were popular because they were in sympathy with the return (now strongly pronounced) of the European mind towards chivalry, feudalism, and the mediaeval spirit. The works of the Renaissance were no longer praised; its art was held to be imitative or debased, its refinement to be superficial, its enthusiasm factitious. Taking its cue from Rousseau, all the world was thirsting, or pretending to thirst, after nature and simplicity; the naivete and spontaneity, real or imagined, of the “ages of faith” seemed incalculably better than the finesse and self-consciousness of modern times. Working this vein somewhat too long, Scott was at last outshone in it by Byron, whose romantic tales (Bride of Abydos, The Corsair, The Giaour, &c.) were still more remote from the dulness and conventionality of ordinary life than those of Scott. In Childe Harold, a poem finely but unequally versified in the Spenserian stanza, the noble poet described himself,—for no one ever doubted that he was himself “the great sublime he drew,”—travelling through Spain, Italy, and Greece, a prey to melancholy discontent, brooding over the perishing relics of departed greatness, but unable to utter any formula potent for its re-creation other than vague cries for the bursting of all fetters which repress the spirit or the limbs of men The increasing moral disorder of Byron’s mind is marked by the appearance of Don Juan, a long rambling poem, written after his wife had left him, and he had gone to the Continent in 1816, never to return. In 1823 he joined the Greek insurgents who had taken arms to throw off the Turkish yoke. He landed at Missolonghi, spent large sums of money, but effected nothing of importance; and in April 1824 he was cut off by a fever.

Shelley is a striking illustration of the influence which the revolutionary literature of that age possessed in moulding or modifying human character. His own earliest recollections dated to a time when all ranks of English society were animated by feelings of horror and detestation at the French “Terror,” and in no mood to embrace any revolutionary sentiment, or even give a hearing to any novel opinion. Yet the mind of Shelley—nursed upon the sceptical suggestions of Hume, the utopian speculations of Godwin, and the antinomian dreams of Rousseau, and pushing to extremes, from the fervour of a nature in which prudence and diffidence found no place, all that he read— was in a state of high revolt, even in his college days, against all that was held sacred by other men. Sent away from Oxford, he fell in with the bright high-spirited Harriet Westbrook, and induced her to marry him. But all bonds, including those of matrimony, which fettered the free inclinations of the mind, Shelley had taught himself to regard as a tyranny to be withstood. He grew tired of Harriet, formed a connexion of free love with Mary Godwin, and deserted his hapless wife, who, two years afterwards, committed suicide. Whether Shelley would e-ver have brought his wild actions and wilder thoughts under any discipline it is impossible to tell, for he was cut off by a sudden and early death. His poems display the most perfect and wonderful mastery of the resources of the English language for the purposes of imaginative expression that has ever been attained to among our poets. As Pope and 'Dryden gave us logic in metre, so Byron and Shelley gave us rhetoric in metre. Splendid pieces of declamation may be found in the Childe Harold and “Isles of Greece” of the one poet, and in the Hellas and Revolt of Lslam of the other. The “Sky-lark,” and some other poems, considered as creations of the pure imagination, have surely never been surpassed.

An accidental circumstance,—the finding of an old unfinished MS. in a forgotten nook of a cabinet,—turned Sir Walter Scott into the path of prose fiction, in which his strong memory and inexhaustible imagination, joined with a gift for picturesque description, and the faculty, within certain limite, of creating and presenting living types of character, eminently qualified him to excel. Then [9:8:434] •was given to the world the long and splendid series of novels, commencing with Waverley and ending (when his mind had partially given way) with Castle Dangerous. We do not forget that a living French critic, whose admirable style makes even his paradoxes attractive, treats the Waverley Novels with little ceremony; they were taken, he says, for faithful copies of the antique world in Europe •at a time when people knew no better; now we go to the original sources of information, and find that he distorts everything. But, in the first place, so far as the Waverley Novels consist of the skilful evolution of plots invented by the author, and of the contrasted play of characters created by him,—and not of historical pictures,—this criticism does not touch them at all. In Peυeril of the Peak, for instance, where a peculiar zest attaches itself to the love of Julian Peveril for Alice Bridgenorth on account of the political and religious differences which divide their fathers, though Scott might be proved to have omitted some important features in his historic sketch of the Restoration, still the deep attraction of the story would not lose its charm. So again, in Ivanhoe, although the repulsion between Saxon and Norman—the concrete picture of which, presented in this novel, so deeply impressed the historian Thierry—be to some extent an exaggeration of the feelings which actually prevailed between the two races under Richard I., yet neither does this inaccuracy affect the substantial truthfulness and instructiveness of the historic tableau, nor, if it did, would the tragic passages which describe the siege of the castle of Front-de-Bceuf exercise an inferior fascination. But, secondly, the real meaning of M. Taine’s charge is, not that Scott has mis-read history, but that he has not read it from the special philosophical standpoint of M. Taine. He did not read it in the conviction of the relativity of all events, nor regard it simply as the evolution of the Welt-Geist, nor believe that human society, through the stages of theology and metaphysics, advances inevitably to the bourn of positive science. But it remains to be proved whether these views of history will not prove more ephemeral than the simpler conceptions which possessed the mind of Sir Walter Scott.

Reference was made above to the commencement of the Edinburgh Review in 1802. The tendencies of thought which distinguished its founders were of so remarkable a character,—exercised so marked an effect on the philosophy, the legislation, and even the literature of their times,—and are still so influential, that some attempt to analyse and describe them must be made. There were varieties of opinion among the writers for this celebrated review from the first; amongst them were mere Whigs and mere literary critics, but that which gave it a backbone was its being partially the organ of a party, known somo years later by the name of “Philosophical Radicals.” This school took its philosophy from Locke, Bentham, and Adam Smith. It held that the old systems which admitted the principle of authority were for ever ruined and discredited, that, as government was an affair of contract, so religion was an affair of evidence, and that, since the same evidence was estimated differently by different minds, the right course was, to confine religion within the domain of the individual conscience, tolerating all forms of it not antisocial, but giving political prominence to none. Coleridge, in an eloquent work published in 1829,^[10. Constitution of Church and State.] supported the theory of a national church, not as the channel for teaching religious truth, but as providing a machinery for diffusing culture and enlightenment, as well as teaching morality by example, through the length and breadth of the land. This view was too Platonic for the school we are now considering—which, however, did not attack the already existing established church, but contented itself with insisting that its clergy should be vigilantly controlled by the state, lest they should teach principles or practices inconsistent with the general good. Churches they regarded as decrepit and perishing institutions; it was the state which, in their eyes, flourished in immortal youth; and their hopes of future good were involved in the development of civilization under its auspices. They believed in the gradual advance and perfectibility of the race through the operation of wise institutions, furthering the free play of all the human faculties, while guaranteeing the order and stability of society. The happiness that would thence arise, consisting in the realization of “the greatest good of the greatest number,” they regarded as the satisfaction of enthusiasm and the goal of effort. To political economy, that eminently lay study, and to the development of physical science, they looked for the measures and the means requisite for the attainment of this happiness. Moreover, since, from their point of view, there was nothing absolute in moral sanctions, it was ridiculous fora nation to hamper itself by adherence to engagements contracted by a former generation, on the plea of national honour, if such adherence was prejudicial to the interests of the living. Views of this kind, beginning even then to be propounded, drew from Burke the exclamation that the “age of chivalry was past,” and that “that of sophists, economists, and calculators had succeeded.” The study of social grievances, and of the means of removing them, assumed a prominent place among their objects, and gave rise to much laudable and beneficial activity. On humanitarian grounds they supported the agitation against slavery which Christian philanthropists like Clarkson and Wilberforce had commenced from a religious motive. Senior occupied himself with the evils of the old poor-law; Francis Horner became a great authority on finance; Sir Samuel Romilly took up the reform of our criminal jurisprudence; Ricardo, J. S. Mill, and M'Culloch studied the laws of the creation and distribution of wealth, and demonstrated the impolicy of restrictions on trade. The benefits of national education began to be seen and enforced; and Lancaster and Bell entered upon useful labours connected with tffe organization of schools and the supply of teachers. Harriet Martineau wrote popular tales, and Elliott “Corn-law Rhymes,” in order to indoctrinate the multitude with sound views on economical questions. In short, all the good was done or attempted which men starting from the basis of empirical philosophy could do or attempt; whatever was outside the range of that philosophy was neglected.

There is something rather saddening in the contemplation of the careers of most of the eminent literary men of this epoch. Byron and Shelley were cut off in the flower of their days; Southey’s overtasked brain gave way some years before his death, and the same fate befell Ireland’s gifted singer, Thomas Moore. Scott, ruined through too much haste to be rich, literally worked himself to death to clear off the mountain of liability which his implication in Ballantyne’s failure had thrown upon him. Coleridge, though he lived to old age, had weakened a will originally irresolute, and shattered nerves originally over-sensitive by the fatal practice of opium-eating; in the time of grey hairs he subsided into a dreamy talker about “sum-in ject” and “om-in-ject.”^[11. Carlyle’s Life of Sterling.] Wordsworth alone preserved to the last an unimpaired sanity of mind and body, for which he might thank the simplicity and serenity of his life in Westmoreland, where he settled on his return from France. Rapt in profound meditation, he communed among the mountains with the spirit of the universe; and the beauty of the crag, the tarn, the flower, transmitted itself, through [9:8:435] the lips of nature’s poet-priest, into verse of wondrous melody. When the period of inspiration was past, he quietly conformed to the religion and politics of his neighbours, and wrote much in support of them; but these later works are pitched in a lower key.

Since the death of Scott, the power of literature, combined with journalism, has been continually on the rise. The novelists, while describing, have modified our social customs; the essayists have been instrumental in bringing about political reforms; the poets have stirred,—generally to thoughts and desires of change,—the impressible hearts of the young. The power of art over the human mind, and its influence in determining the aspects of life, have been, in all English-speaking countries, declining, while that of literature has been advancing. Whether this particular distribution of the master-influences that affect mankind will continue to prevail, or whether artis destined to regain among us a portion of its early power, and the sway of literature to be correspondingly restricted, is a question which the future must decide.
