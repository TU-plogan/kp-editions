EPISCO PIUS, Simon ( 1583-1643), a distinguished theologian (whose name in Dutch was Bisschop), was born at Amsterdam on the 1st January 1583. In 1600 he entered the university of Leyden, where he took his master of arts degree in 1606. He afterwards studied theology under Arminius, and Arminius’s opponent Gomar; but soon becoming a strong sympathizer with the Arminian doctrines, he, on the death of Arminius in 1609, left Leyden for the university of Franeker. In 1610, the year in which the Arminians presented the famous Remonstrance to the States of Holland, he was ordained minister at Bleyswich, a small village in the neighbourhood of Rotterdam; and in the following year he advocated the cause of the Remonstrants at the Hague conference. In 1612 he succeeded Gomar as professor of theology at Leyden, an appointment which awakened the bitter enmity of the Calvinists, and, on account of the influence lent by it to the spread of Arminian opinions, was doubtless an ultimate cause of the meeting of the Synod of Dort in 1618. Episcopius was chosen as the spokesman of the thirteen representatives of the Remonstrants before the synod; but he was refused a hearing, and the Remonstrant doctrines were condemned without any explanation or defence of them being permitted. At the end of the synod’s sittings in 1619, Episcopius and the other representatives were deprived of their offices and expelled from the country. Episcopius retired to Brabant, but ultimately went to France, and took up his residence at Rouen. He devoted the most of his time to the promotion by writings of the Arminian cause; but the attempt of Wadding to win him over to the Romish faith involved him also in a côntroversy with that famous Jesuit. After the death of the stadtholder Maurice, the violence of the Arminian controversy began to abate, and Episcopius was permitted in 1626 to resume his duties in the Remonstrant church of Rotterdam. He was after-wardsappointed rector of the Remonstrant college at Amsterdam, where he died in 1643. Episcopius maybe regarded as in great part the theological founder of Arminianism. Its principles were enunciated by Arminius, but in a fragmentary and somewhat tentative shape, and. it is to Episcopius that the merit is due of having developed them into a complete and distinctive form of belief, and of having given them a widely extended and permanent influence. Besides opposing at all points the peculiar doctrines of Calvinism, Episcopius protested against the tendency of Calvinists to lay so much stress on abstract dogma, and argued that Christianity was practical rather than theoretical,—not so much a system of intellectual belief as a moral power,— and that an orthodox faith did not necessarily imply the knowledge of and assent to a system of doctrine which included the whole range of Christian truth, but only the knowledge and acceptance of so much of Christianity as was necessary to effect a real change on the heart and life.

The principal works of Episcopius are his Confessio s. declaratio sententioe pastorum gui in foederato Belgio Rernonstrantes vocantur super praecipuis articulis religionis Christianae (1621), his Apologia pro Confessione (1629), and his uncompleted work Institutiones Theologicae. A life of Episcopius was written by Limborch, and one was also prefixed by his successor Curcelløeus to an edition of his collected works published in 2 vols. (1650-1665).
