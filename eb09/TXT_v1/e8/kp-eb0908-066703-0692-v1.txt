EUPATORIA, a seaport town of European Russia, at the head of a circle in the government of Taurida, ab∙>ut 50 [9:8:668] miles N.W. of Simpheropol, on a sandy promontory in the north of Kalamita Bay, in 45° 12' N. lat and 33 5 E. long. Of its numerous ecclesiastical buildings, which comprise 16 mosques, three synagogues, an Armenian, an Orthodox, and a Catholic church, only two are of special interest, the Karaite synagogue and one of the mosques, which has fourteen cupolas, and is built after the plan of St Sophia in Constantinople. The shipping accommodation is poor, the port or rather roadstead having a sandy bottom, and being exposed to violent storms from the N.E. Small vessels cast anchor near the town in a depth of 18 or lo feet. 4he trade is principally in grain, skins, cowhair, felt, tallow, and salt. In 1861, out of a population of 7081, 3422 were Mahometans, 1228 Karaite Jews, and 175 Talmudists. In 1871 the total was 8294.

It is believed that in the 5th century B.c. there was a town toronitis, in this part of the Chersonese, and according to some authorities it was near this spot that a military post called Eupatoriurn was established in the 1st century a.d. by Diophantes, the general of Mithradates Eupator. About the end of the 15th century the Tatars built the fortress of Gezlevé on the present site, and it became the centre of one of the principal towns of the Crimea. It was occupied for the first time by the Russians under Marshal Munich in 1736, and for the second time in 1771 by Prince DolgorιιkofΓ. Its annexation to Russia took place in 1783, and in the following year it was made the chief town of a circle. In 1854 the Anglo-trench troops were landed at Eupatoria, and in February 1855 the town was occupied by the Turkish forces under Omer Pasha.
