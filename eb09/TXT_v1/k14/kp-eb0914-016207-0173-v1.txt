KYOUK-HPYÚ, a district in British Burmah, lying between 18° 55' and 19° 22' N. lat., and 93° 25' and 94° E. long. It consists of, first, a strip of mainland along the Bay of Bengal, extending from the An Pass, across the main range, to the Ma-i river, and, secondly, the large islands of Ramri and Man-oung, with many others to the south, lying off the coast of Sandoway. The mainland in the north and east is highly mountainous and forest-clad, and the lower portion is cut up into numerous islands by a network of tidal creeks. Between the mainland and Ramri lies a group of islands separated by deep, narrow, salt-water inlets, forming the north-eastern shore of Kyouk-hpyù harbour, which extends for nearly 30 miles along Ramri in a south-easterly direction, and has an average breadth of 3 miles. The principal mountains are the Arakan Yomas, which send out spurs and sub-spurs almost to the sea-coast. The An Pass, an important trade route, rises to a height of 4664 feet above sea-level. The Dha-let and the An are navigable by large boats 25 and 45 miles respectively. Above these distances they are mere mountain torrents. Large forests of valuable timber cover an area of about 650 square miles. Kyouk-hpyιi contains numerous “mud volcanoes,” from which marsh gas is frequently discharged, with occasional issues of flame. The largest of these is situated in the centre of Cheduba Island. Earth-oil wells exist in several places in the district. The oil when brought to the surface has the appearance of a whitish-blue water, which gives out brilliant straw-coloured rays, and emits a strong pungent colour. Limestone, iron, and coal are also found.

In 1872 the population was 144,177 (males 73,056 and females 71,121):—Buddhists, 129,702: Mohammedans, 3920; Hindus, 185; Christians, 47; “others,” 10,323. The largest town is Ramri, with a population in 1877 of 4028. Kjouk-hpyu, the headquarters, situated on Ramri Island, has 2620. Out of a total area of 4309 square miles, no less than 3740 are returned as absolutely uncultivable, and in 1876-77 only 165 square miles were under tillage. The principal crops are rice, sugar-cane, dhan ’ ^ and tobacco. The manufactures consist of silk and cotton cloth, indigo, salt, pottery, coarse sugar, and sesamum oil. The total imperial and provincial revenue in 1876-77 was £43,454, besides a local revenue derived from port and municipal funds, &c.
