KNOWLES, James Sheridan (1784-1862), dramatic author, was born at Cork, 21st May 1784. His father was the lexicographer James Knowles, cousin-german of Richard Brinsley Sheridan. Not long after the removal of the family to London in 1793, young Knowles began his dramatic career by composing a play which was performed by himself and his juvenile companions. At the age of fourteen he published a ballad entitled The Welsh Harper, which was set to music and obtained great popularity; and about the same time his precocious talents secured him the friendship of Hazlitt, through whom he also formed an intimacy with Lamb and Coleridge. Of his early career little else is known except that for some time he served in the Wilts and afterwards in the Tower Hamlets militia, and that he left the latter corps to become pupil of Dr Willan the physician, through whom he was appointed vaccinator to the Jennerian Society. Although, however, he was generously offered by Dr Willan a share in his practice, he resolved to forsake medicine for the stage, making his debut at the Crow Theatre, Dublin. At Wexford he in October 1809 married Maria Charteris, an actress from the Edinburgh Theatre. About this time he wrote Leo, which was played at Waterford with great success by Edmund Kean; but, although another piece, Brian Boroihme, which he wrote for the Belfast Theatre also drew crowded houses, his labours as an actor and author secured him so little pecuniary return that he found it advisable to become assistant to his father at the Belfast Academical Institution. In 1817 he removed from Belfast to Glasgow, where, besides conducting a flourishing school, he continued his dramatic authorship. His first important dramatic success was Caius Gracchus, produced at Belfast in 1815; and by Virginius, written for Edmund Kean, and first performed in 1820, he obtained a very high place among the dramatic authors of the century. Besides William Tell, in which Macready performed one of his most successful parts, the other principal plays of Knowles are The Hunchback, Love, and The Wife. In some of his own pieces he acted with a just appreciation of the character and with considerable vigour and fire, but he failed in the power of personation. He achieved some success, however, as a lecturer on elocution. In his later years he forsook the stage for the pulpit, and as a Baptist preacher attracted large audiences at Exeter Hall and elsewhere, while he also entered the field of polemical theology, publishing two works,—the Pock of Pome, and the Idol Demolished by its own Priests,— in both of which he combated the special doctrines of the Romish Church. Knowles was for some years in the receipt of an annual [9:14:130] pension of £200, bestowed by Sir Robert PeeL He died at Torquay, November 30, 1862

A full list of the works of Knowles and of the various notices of him will be found in his Life, by his son Richard Brinsley Knowles, of which twenty-five copies were printed privately.
