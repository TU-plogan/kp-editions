KASHMÍR, or Cashmere, an elevated and enclosed valley in the Himalaya mountains, north of the Punjab. It is surrounded by lofty hills, with one opening on the west, by which flows out from the valley the river Jhelum. The enclosing hills on the north and east belong to the Bâra Lâcha chain, and on their outer side is the broad mountainous region which holds the valley of the upper Indus, and which, beyond the Indus, culminates in [9:14:10] the great parallel range of Karakorum or Mustâgh. On the west and south, the hill boundary, which joins the other half of the enclosure at the south-east end of the valley, is the Panjâl or Panchâl range, which on its outer side sends down its branches southward, through the Jamû territory, to the plains of the Punjab. The length of the Kashmir valley, including the inner slopes of its surrounding hills, is about 120 miles from north-west to south-east. Its greatest width is about 75 miles. The low and comparatively level floor of the basin is 84 miles long and 20 to 24 miles broad. Its lowest part is 5200 feet above the sea, and its mean height 6000 feet.

This valley is but a small portion, in area, of the dominions of the maharâjâ of Kashmir, which, in addition to the Jamû territory on the south (the previous possession of the present maharâjâ’s father, Ghulâb Singh, before he acquired Kashmir), include Baltistân and Gilgit on the north, and Kishtwâr and Lâdâk on the east. On the west Kashmir is separated from the valley of Khagân by a continuous range of high hills, and from the British district of Hazâra by the river Jhelum.

Jamù, to which Kashmir was annexed in 1846, occupies the southern slopes of the Panjâl range, with a strip of plain country at their foot, and extends about 220 miles from east to west, with a greatest direct breadth, north to south, of about 75 miles. All the rest of the maharâjâ’s dominions is hill country.

The hills forming the northern half-circuit of the Kashmir valley, and running beyond, include many lofty mountain masses and peaks, the most conspicuous of which, a little outside the confines of Kashmir, is Nanga Parbat, a grand hill (35° 15' N., 74° 35' E.), rising 26,629 feet above the sea, with an extensive area of glacier on its eastern face. The great ridge which is thrown off to the south-west by Nanga Parbat rises, at a distance of 12 miles, to another summit 20,740 feet in height, from which run south-west and south-east the ridges which are the northern watershed boundary of Kashmir. The former range, after running 70 miles south-west, between the valleys of the Kishanganga and the Kunhâr or Nain-sùkh, turns southward, closely pressing the river Jhelum, after it has received the Kishanganga, with a break a few miles further south which admits the Kunhâr. This range presents several prominent summits, the two highest 16,487 and 15,544 feet above the sea. The range which runs south-east from the junction peak above-mentioned divides the valley of the Kishanganga from that of the Astor and other tributaries of the Indus. The highest points on this range, where it skirts Kashmir, are 16,795, 16,930, and 17,202 feet above the sea. For a distance of more than 50 miles from Nanga Parbat there are no glaciers on this range; thence eastward they increase; one, near the Zéji-lâ Pass, is only 10,850 feet above the sea. The mountains at the east end of the valley, running nearly north and south, drain inwards to the Jhelum, and on the other side to the Ward wân, a tributary of the Chenâb. The highest part of this eastern boundary is 14,700 feet. There are no glaciers. The highest point on the Panjâl range, which forms the south and south-west boundary, is 15,523 feet above the sea.

The river Jhelum or Behat (Sanskrit Vitasta)- the Hydaspes of Greek historians and geographers—flows north-westward through the middle of the valley. After a slow and winding course it expands, about 25 miles below Srinagar, over a slight depression in the plain, and forms the Wιilar lake and marsh, which is of ill-defined extent, but may be called about 10 miles long and 6 broad. The hills which this lake touches at its north end give it a more defined margin on that side. Leaving the lake on the south-west side, near the town of S6pιir, the river pursues its sluggish course south-westward, about 18 miles, to the gorge at Baramûla. From this point the stream is more rapid through the narrow valley which conducts it westward 75 miles to Muzaffarâbâd, where it turns sharply south, joined by the Kishanganga. At Islâmâbâd, about 40 miles above Srinagar, the river is 5400 feet above sealevel, and at Srinagar 5235 feet. It has thus a fall of about 4 feet per mile in this part of its course. For the next 24 miles to the Wιilar lake, and thence to Baramûla, its fall is only about 2∣ feet in the mile. On the 80 miles of the river in the flat valley between Islâmâbâd and Baramûla there is much boat traffic; but none below Baramûla, till the river comes out into the plains.

On the north-east side of this low narrow plain of the Jhelum is a broad hilly tract between which and the higher boundary range runs the Kishanganga river. Near the east end of this interior hilly tract, and connected with the higher range, is one summit 17,839 feet. Around this peak and between the ridges which run from it are many small glaciers. These heights look down on one side into the beautiful valley of the Sind river, and on another into the valley of the Lidar, which join the Jhelum. Among the hills north of Srinagar rises one conspicuous mountain mass, 16,903 feet in height, from which on its north side descend tributaries of the Kishanganga, and on the south the Wangat river, which flows into the Sind. By these rivers and their numerous affluents the whole valley of Kashmir is watered abundantly.

Around the foot of many spurs of the hills which run down on the Kashmir plain are pieces of low table-land, which are called karéwa. These terraces vary in height at different parts of the valley from 100 to 300 feet above the alluvial plain. Those which are near each other are mostly about the same level, and separated by deep ravines.

The level plain in the middle of the Kashmir valley is fine clay and sand, with water-worn pebbles. The karéwas consist of horizontal beds of clay and sand, the lacustrine nature of which is shown by the shells which they contain. The hills surrounding the valley are chiefly gneiss and schists. In the Lidar valley are slate and sandstones of the Carboniferous period over green slate of a period corresponding to Silurian. The irregular ridges of the Panjâl range are granite and gneiss, with schists and slates. Limestone is found in parts of the east and west ends of the valley, and in the hills upon the Mânas Bal lake. In various places are marks of glacial action, down to a height of about 500 feet above the level part of the basin. From the plain rise isolated hills of trap; among these are the Hari Parbat and the Takht-i-Sulimân at Srinagar, on the former of which stands the fort, and on the latter a conspicuous and well known ancient Hindu temple. No fossils have been found in Kashmir below the rocks of the Carboniferous period. The chief mineral resources of the maharaja’s dominions are outside the Kashmir valley, specially in Lâdâk.

In the hills of the north boundary are two passes, the Burzil (13,500 feet) and the Kamri (13,200). By the former is the direct route between Srinagar and Iskardo. It is usually practicable only between 15th July and 15th September. The road from Srinagar to Lé in Lâdâk goes by the Zéji-lâ Pass (11,300 feet), near the north-east corner of the valley. Only a short piece of the road, where snow accumulates, prevents this pass being used all the year. At the south-east end of the valley are three passes, the Murgil (11,600 feet), the Hoksar (13,315), and the Murbul (11,550), all leading over to the valleys of the Chenâb and the Râvi. South of Islâmâbâd, on the direct route to Jamu and Siâlkét, is the Banihâl Pass (9200 feet). Further west on the Panjâl range is the Pir Panjâl or Panchâl Pass (11,400 feet), with a second pass, the Rattan Pir (8200 feet), across a second ridge about 15 miles southwest[9:14:11] of the other. Between the two passes is the beautifully situated fort of Bâramgali and a well-known resthouse for travellers. This place is in the domain of Raja Méti Singh of Pùnch, cousin and tributary of the maharaja of Kashmir. At Râjâori, south of these passes, the road divides: one line leads to Bhimbar and Gujrât, the other to Jamù and Siâlkôt by Aknùr. Next, south-west of Baramüla, is the Hajji Pir Pass (8500 feet), by which crosses the road to Pünch. From Pünch one road leads down to the plains at the town of Jhelum, another eastward through the hills to the Rattan Pir Pass and Râjâori. Lastly there is the river pass of the Jhelum, which is the easy route from the valley westward, having two ways down to the plains, one by Muzaffarâbâd and the Hazâra valley to Hassan Abdâl, the other by the British hill station of Marri (Murree) to Râwal Pindi

The valley of Kashmir, sheltered from the south-west monsoon by the Panjâl range, has not the periodical rains of India. Its rainfall is irregular, greatest in the spring months. Occasional heavy storms in the monsoon pass over the crests of the Panjâl and give heavy rain on the elevated plateaus on the Kashmir side. And again clouds pass over the valley and are arrested by the higher hills on the north-east side, on which they pour themselves. Snow falls on the surrounding hills at intervals from October to March, and sometimes in great quantity. In the valley the first snow generally falls about the end of December, and never to any great amount. The highest monthly average of temperature from May to October, at Srinagar, is 89° in the shade at noon. There has been no regular winter register; but the temperature is never very low.

For all crops except rice, which is irrigated, the rain is ordinarily sufficient. Barley, sown in November, ripens in June, wheat in July. Rice, sown in May and June, ripens in October. Millet, maize, and buckwheat, also turnips, pease, and mustard, are grown in considerable quantity.

There is no natural forest in the level parts of the valley. Of the cultivated trees the finest is the plane (chindr), which grows to a large size, and is of great beauty. The principal other trees of the valley are the poplar, willow, cypress, walnut, apple, pear, quince, apricot, cherry, mulberry. Vines are grown extensively, commonly trained up poplar trees. There are many kinds of grape. On the hills around are deodar, Pinus excelsa and Gerardiana, Piceα Webbiana, hazel, birch, viburnum, juniper, rose, <tc. The herbaceous plants and flowers are very numerous. The umbelliferous plant called prangos, growing on the drier hills, is much valued as winter food for sheep. In spring the bright orange-coloured colchicum shows itself in great quantity; and in autumn are seen many acres of saffron with its beautiful light purple flowers, grown in large fields divided into small square beds. Saffron was among the articles of annual tribute to the Mughal emperors. The Dal lake at Srinagar is full of reeds and water plants, Potamogetoη, Nymphaea, Helumbiτιm, <fcc. On this lake there are floating gardens: a shallow layer of soil on sheets of the great leaves of water lilies is made to grow quantities of vegetables. The curious singhara, or horned water nut (Trapa bispinosa), which grows in great quantity in all the lakes, is much used for food, prepared in various ways. Since 1874 hops have been grown experimentally for the Murree Brewery Company, with fair success, in five different parts of the valley.

Much has been said and written about the beauty of the vale of Kashmir. Spring encircles a fresh, green, smiling valley with a noble belt of glistening snow-capped ridges; autumn fills the eye with the wonderful richness of the many-coloured foliage. At all times flows on the quiet glassy river, showing back the groves and avenues upon its banks, the strange tall shadowy wooden houses, and the craggy hills. There is no place or season which has not something to show of real beauty. The rapturous praises of Mohammedan writers may be often extravagant; and it is with some of their materials, reproduced with more modern additions, that Moore has built up great part of his romance; still few will really think that here extravagance and fiction have left truth much too far behind.

Many Englishmen every year resort to Kashmir for shooting. The game is in consequence now only to be found within reduced areas of the more secluded little valleys and more difficult hill sides, and many sportsmen now cross over into Lâdâk. The animals chiefly sought in both countries are the Ovis ammon, Ovis poli, antelope, ibex, mar-klιor or wild goat, musk deer, Tibetan stag, brown and black bear, and leopard. In various parts of Kashmir are to be found the fox, lynx, weasel, marmot, and hare. The black and grey monkey (langur) is common on the Panjâl range. Kashmir has the snow pheasant, snow owl, wild goose, duck, and teal; and the eagle is also found.

The Kashmir valley has a large number of old buildings of the Hindu period, interesting from their style, which is peculiar to Kashmir, and from the traces which many of them bear of Greek art. Their ruinous condition is ascribed partly to Sikandar the idol-breaker, partly to earthquakes, which are frequent in Kashmir. The most ancient of these buildings (about 220 b.c.) is the temple of Shankar Acharya (or, as it was formerly called, of Jaiasht Iswar), on the hill at Srinagar, known as Takht-i-Sulimân, or Solomon’s Throne,—a designation thought to be a Mohammedan adaptation of the name of Râjâ Sandhaman, who repaired or rebuilt the temple. The other Hindu buildings mostly belong to the time from the 5th to the 10th century. The chief points which distinguish them from Hindu buildings in India are the trefoil-headed doorways and recesses, high pediments, high straight-lined pyramidal roofs, and fluted pillars.

The temple of the sun at Marttand or Matan has been one of the finest. It occupies a very striking position on a karéwa or natural terrace about 3 miles from Islâmâbâd, and commands a splendid view of the valley of the Jhelum. Of the others the most worthy of notice are the remains of two of the four temples at Avantipùr, 15 miles southeast of Srinagar; the temple of Bhûmzo near Marttand, built in a cave; Pâyach, on the karéwa of Naunagar near Avantipùr, a small temple, the whole superstructure built of six stones; Pandrétan, 3 miles south-east of Srinagar, standing with its floor below the water, in a tank; Bhâniâr (Bhawâniâr) and Kutnii, a few miles west of Baramüla, both backed by fine wooded cliffs crowned with deodars. A mound, with masonry in and about it, at the village of Ushkara near Baramüla, is supposed to be the remains of a Buddhist tope (stupa), the place taking its name from Hushka, one of the Tartar kings of Kashmir.

Srinagar, the capital (34° 4' 6" N., 74° 48' 5" E.), said to have been founded by Pravara Sén, in the beginning of the 6th century, is built on both banks of the Jheluιn. It is a somewhat confused mass of houses, many of them built of wood, with balconies and carved lattice windows, and projecting upper stories propped on poles, and overhanging the narrow streets or the little canals which in some parts are the streets. The city has seven bridges across the river, built of beams laid on stone and timber piers. In the fort on the south side of the river is the palace. There are several small Hindu temples in the town. The two chief mosques are the Jâmi* mosque and that of Shah Hamadân, the latter one of the most conspicuous buildings, with walls of stone and timber, low sloping wooden roof, and little wooden spire. On the shores of the Dal lake are the old pleasure-gardens of the Mughals.
[9:14:12]

The people of Kashmir are now mostly Mohammedan. Physically of fine form, a large proportion of the townpeople are enfeebled by poverty and sedentary occupati >n in close rooms. A few years ago the shawl weavers of Srinagar were reckoned to be about 22 per cent, of the inhabitants. The proportion is now less, owing to the reduced demand for Kashmir shawls, both loom-made and hand-sewn. The maharAjA has endeavoured to meet the depression of the shawl trade by extension of silk manufactures; silk is successfully worked, and well dyed. The chief demand for shawls has generally been from France, and French patterns have somewhat interfered with native art. At IslAmAbAd also many hands are employed in shawl and blanket weaving. A kind of coarse chintz is also made there. Embroidery on fine woollen cloths is the employment of many Kashmiris, both in their own country and in their Indian settlements, Amritsar, Niirpiir, and LudhiAna. The manufacture of a variety of articles in papier mâché and ornamental painted wood-work employs a number of people in Srinagar. The silversmiths do a good deal of business in ornamental vases, goblets, flowerholders, &c., silver and silver gilt. Engraved and embossed copper work employs a smaller number of people; also the manufacture of ornamental vessels of tinned copper, and some other minor kinds of work. A very good kind of paper is made in Kashmir. A museum of Kashmir products and manufactures was established at Srinagar in 1875. The people of the country, with more healthful occupations and surroundings than those of the towns, especially Srinagar, are robust and of active habits. The Kashmiris, both men and women, wear commonly a kind of loose gown with sleeves, called phéran (Pers., ραιrdhan, “a robe”). In cold weather they are in the habit of carrying, under this loose dress, a small portable brazier with heated charcoal. The country people and boatmen use a more close-fitting costume. The mountaineers, like those of neighbouring hill countries, bandage the legs from the knee to the foot for protection in walking.

According to a report prepared by order of the maharAjA in 1873, the population of the valley at that time was nearly 492,000. Of these about 64,000 were Hindus and the rest Moslems, about 4 per cent, of the latter being Shiites. The estimated population of Jamil was 861,000, of Punch 77,500, of LAdAk, Iskardo, and Gilgit, 104,500; total about 1,535,000 Hindus, 507,000; Moslems, 919,000; Buddhists, 20,000; and “miscellaneous,” 89,000. Of Srinagar the estimated population was about 132,000, of which number nearly 40,000 were Hindus. A great diminution, caused by deaths and emigration, has followed the famine of 1878. It was said that the towns of IslAmAbAd and Sopdr lost nearly two-thirds of their inhabitants. The rice crop of 1879 was abundant, and the rains of the next year seasonable and plentiful. The shawl-weaving and carpet-making trades revived in 1880, and numbers of people who had left the country during the famine returned.

The language of Kashmir (which is spoken only in the valley itself, and in the few outlying settlements of Kashmiris in the neighbouring hills and in northern India) is of the Aryan family. It is allied to the Hindi, Sindi, and Punjâbi, and also to the current Urdιi of India (Hindustani). It uses a form of the Sanskrit character like the NAgari of the Punjab. It may be said to possess no literature, though Kashmir has produced many literary men. The Urdιi is now very generally understood in Kashmir, among the better educated people and more intelligent artisans.

The chief articles of export from Kashmir are shawls and other woollen fabrics, rice, saffron, fruits. The chief imports are shawl wool, English piece goods, Indian cloths, metals, precious stones, skins, felts, dye-stuffs, tea, charas (hemp juice), groceries, and salt. The imports into Kashmir from British India are much below those into Jamù, except tea (of which the Kashmiris are extremely fond), indigo, and earthenware. Kashmir imports annually a very large amount of rock salt from the Punjab. The gross annual value of the imports is about £210,000, and of the exports about £172,000. This latter amount is less than formerly, owing chiefly to the reduced demand for shawls. The import duties, which used to be very heavy, were modified in 1864; the duty on piece goods was limited to 8 per cent, and on other imports to 12⅛ per cent. In April 1870 a commercial treaty was entered into with the British Government for developing trade with eastern Turkestan, in which, among other things, the maharAjA agreed to abolish all transit duties. Joint commissioners were appointed, on the part of the two Governments, to reside at Leh.

The gross annual revenue of Kashmir is believed to be about £550,000, and of the maharAjA’s whole territories a little over £800,000. The chief source of income is the land revenue. Of this there is now a cash settlement in place of the annual valuation of crops which was the practice till lately. The Government ordinarily takes one-half the gross produce. Grain is stored in public granaries, and sold at fixed rates to the army and the civil officials. Much grain is also purchased from the zamindArs, and stored by Hindu merchants in Srinagar.

The maharAjA’s military force numbers 25,600 infantry (including police), 1400 cavalry, and 1200 artillery, with 78 field guns and 80 other pieces.

At Srinagar and elsewhere the maharAjA has established dispensaries, with native medical men educated in India; and he has built at his own cost a large hospital for the medical mission at Srinagar.

The current rupee of Kashmir, called chilki (“glittering”), has varied in value at different times from one-half to five-eighths of the rupee of British India. The latest issued bears the latter value.

The admission of British visitors to Kashmir each season is limited. To military officers, up to a fixed number, permission is granted by the commander·in chief or by the Government of India. Others do not require previous permission, but must intimate their intention of going to Kashmir, and obtain a copy of the rules. In like manner, more than eight centuries ago, as we learn from the Arabic historian Al Birùni, the passes used to be watched, and few outsiders admitted. Connected with this long-cherished exclusiveness has been the general badness of the roads. A really improved road has been made by the present maharAjA from Kohala to Baramιila, the easiest and best entrance to the valley. The author just referred to mentions the covered litters, in which people in Kashmir used to be carried, raised on men’s shoulders. The same conveyances are in use now. To the present day there are no wheeled conveyances in Kashmir. For English visitors four routes are authorized by the Government of India, one by the Pir PanjAl Pass and three by Baramιila,—from Pιinch, from Murree, and from MuzaffarAbAd.

In the government of his own territories the “maharAjA of Jummoo and Kashmir” is independent. His relations with other states are subject to the supreme authority of the Government of India. The Government of India has no resident at either of the maharAjA’s capitals, but annually an “officer on special duty,” as he is officially termed, is sent to Kashmir during the season from March to November. A native news-writer, employed by the British Government, remains in Kashmir. The annual tribute of the maharAjA, presented in token of the supremacy of the British Government, in accordance with Act X. of the [9:14:13] treaty of March 1846, is “one horse, twelve perfect shawl goats of approved breed (six male and six female), and three pairs of Kashmir shawls.” The maharâjâ. receives in British territory a salute of nineteen guns.

History.— The metrical history of the kings of Kashmir, called RιijΛ Tarangini, was pronounced by Professor H. H. Wilson (1825) to be the only Sanskrit composition yet discovered to which the title of history can with any propriety be applied. It first became known to the Mohammedans when, on Akbar’s invasion of Kashmir in 1588, a copy was presented to the emperor. A translation into Persian was made by his order, and a summary of its contents, from this Persian translation, is given by Abu’l Fazl in the Â'in-i-Akbari. The Rιijd Tarangini is a series of four histories. The first of the series, by Pandit Kalhana, was written about the middle of the 12th century. His work, in six books, which bears the name afterwards given to the whole, makes use of earlier writings now lost. Commencing with traditional history of very early times, it comes down to the reign of Sangrama Déva, 1006; and two more books attributed to the same author bring the history to the reign of Singha Déva (called Jai Singh in Abu’l FazΓs summary) about 1156. The second work, called Raja Vali, by Jιina Raja, takes up the history in continuation of Kalhana’s, and, entering the Mohammedan period, gives an account of the reigns down to that of Zain-ul-âb-ad∙din, 1412. Then follows the Sri Jaina Rdjd Tarangini, by Pandit Sri Vara, to the accession of Fattah Shah, 1477. And the fourth work, called Rdjd Vali Pataka, by Prajnia Bhatta, com-] 4etes the history to the time of the incorporation of Kashmir in the dominions of the Mughal emperor, 1588.

In the earliest of the four histories it is stated that the valley of Kashmir was formerly a lake, and that it was drained by the great rishi or sage, Kasyapa, son of Marichi, son of Brahma, by cutting the gap in the hills at Baramûla (Varaha-mûla). When Kashmir had been drained, he brought in the Brahmans to occupy it. This is still the local tradition, and in the existing physical condition of the country we may see some ground for the story which has taken this form. Bernier suggested that earthquakes may have rent the gorge at Baramûla. Μ. Troyer considers it to have been the work of man, taking advantage of facilities pointed out by nature. It is possible that the river, having at one time flowed with more even fall than at present, may have been choked by land slips at the Baramûla gorge. The Jhelum, stopped at Baramûla, would spread over the low wide valley with very slow and quiet rise, till, overtopping the barrier, the water would escape with a great descent to its old channel, having meantime raised the bed of the lake, by slow accumulation of deposit, to a nearly uniform high level. The name of Kasyapa, however, is by history and tradition connected with the draining of the lake, and the chief town or collection of dwellings in the valley was called Kasyapa-pûr—a name which has been plausibly identified with the Kaσπdπυpof of Hecataeus (Steph. Byz,, s.v.) and Kaστraτυpos of Herodotus (iii. 102, iv. 44). Kashmir is the country meant also by Ptolemy’s Kaσπhpm. The ancient name Kasyapa-pûr was applied to the kingdom of Kashmir when it comprehended great part of the Punjab and extended beyond the Indus. In the 7th century Kashmir is said by the Chinese traveller Hwen Tsang to have included Cabul and the Punjab, and the hill region of Gandhara, the country of the Gandarae of classical geography. Then, under the Mughals, after the annexation of Kashmir to their empire in the end of the 16th century, the name of this newer possession was, for administrative purposes, extended over a much larger area in Afghanistan, to which again it became united; and at one time Ghazni, at another time Cabul, was made the capital of the province of Kashmir.

At an early date the Sanskrit name of the country became Kds-mir. The earliest inhabitants, according to the Rdjd Tarangini, were the people called Nâga, a word which signifies “snake.” The history shows the prevalence in early times of tree and serpent worship, of which some sculptured stones found in Kashmir still retain the memorials. The town of Islamabad is called also by its ancient name Anant-nag (eternal snake). The source of the Jhelum is at Vir-nag (the powerful snake), &c. The other races mentioned as inhabiting this country and the neighbouring hills are Gandhara, Khasa, and Darada. The Khasa people are supposed to have given the name Kasmir. I n the Mahâbhdrata the Kas-mira and Darada are named together among the Kshattriya races of northern India. The question whether, in the immigration of the Aryans into India, Kashmir was taken on the way, or entered afterwards by that people after they had reached the Punjab from the north-west, appears to require an answer in favour of the latter view (see vol. it of Dr J. Muir’s Sanskrit Texts). The Aryan races of Kashmir and surrounding hills, which have at the present time separate geographical distribution, are given by Mr Drew as Kashmiri (mostly Mohammedan), in the Kashmir basin and a few scattered places outside; Dard (mostly Mohammedan) in Gilgit and hills north of Kashmir; Dogra (Hindu) in Jamιi; Dogra (Mohammedan, called Chibdli) in Punch and hill country west of Kashmir; Pahàri or mountaineers (Hindu) in Kishtwar, east of Kashmir, and hills about the valley of the Chenab.

In the time of As6ka, about 245 B.c., one of the Indian Buddhist missions was sent to Kashmir and Gandhara. After -his death Brahmanism revived. Then in the time of the three Tartar princes, Hushka, Jushka, and Kanishka, who reigned in Kashmir immediately before, and in the beginning of, the Christian era, Buddhism was to a great extent restored. The kingdom of Kanishka (called also Kanerkes) included the Punjab and Cabul as well as Kashmir. Buddhism again declined, though for several centuries the two religions existed together in Kashmir, Hinduism predominating. Yet Kashmir, when Buddhism was gradually losing its hold, continued to send out its Buddhist teachers to other lands. In this Hindu-Buddhist period, and chiefly between the 5th and 10th centuries of our era, were erected the Hindu temples in Kashmir. In the 6th and 7th centuries Kashmir was visited by some of the Chinese Buddhist pilgrims to India. The country is called Shie-mi iu the narrative of To Yeng and Sung Van (578). One of the, Chinese travellers of the next century was for a time an elephant-tamer to the king of Kashmir. Hwen Tsang spent two years (631-633) in Kashmir (Kia-chi-mi·lo). He entered by Baramûla and left by the Pir Panjal Pass. He describes the hill-girt valley, and the abundance of flowers and fruits, and he mentions the tradition about the lake. He found in Kashmir many Buddhists as well as Hindus. In the following century the kings of Kashmir appear to have paid homage and tribute to China, though this is not alluded to in the Kashmir history. Hindu kings continued to reign till about 1294, when Udiâna Déva was put to death by his Mohammedan vizier, Amir Shah, who ascended the throne, taking the name of Shams-ud-din. Two Hindus who reigned afterwards for a short time were the last kings of that race in Kashmir. The notices of Kashmir by Marco Polo belong to a time near the close of the Hindu rule, when the people were mostly Hindus and Buddhists.

Of the Mohammedan rulers mentioned in the second of the Sanskrit histories, one, who reigned about the dose of the 14th century, has made his name prominent by his active opposition to the Hindu religion, and his destruction of the temples. This was Sikandar, known as But-shikan, or the “idol-breaker.” It iras in bis time that India was invaded by Timur, to whom Sikandar made submission and paid tribute. The country fell into the hands of the Mughals in 1588. In the time of Alamgir it fell to Ahmed Shah Abdâli, on his third invasion of India (1756); and from that time it remained in the hands of Afghans till it was wrested from them by Ranjit Singh, the Sikh monarch of the Punjab, in 1819. Eight Hindu and Sikh governors under Ranjit Singh and his successors were followed by two Mohammedans similarly appointed, the second of whom, Shékh Imam-ud-din, was in charge when the battles of the Sutlej, 1845-46, brought about new relations between the British Government and the Sikhs, involving a change in the government of Kashmir.

Ghulab Singh, a Dogra Ràjpût, had from a humble position been raised to high office by Ranjit Singh, who conferred on him the small principality of Jamû. On tlιe final defeat of the Sikhs at Sobrâon (February 1846), Ghulab Singh was called to take a leading part in arranging conditions of peace. The treaty of Lahore (March 9, 1846) sets forth that, the British Government having demanded, in addition to a certain assignment of territory, a payment of a crore anda half of rupees (1⅜ millions sterling), and the Sikh Government being unable to pay the whole, the maharaja (Dhalip Singh) cedes, as equivalent for oue crore, the hill country belonging to the Punjab between the Bias and the Indus, including Kashmir and Hazara. The governor-general, Sir Henry Hardinge, considered it expedient to make over Kashmir to the Jamû chief, securing his friendship while the British Government was administering the Punjab on behalf of the young maharaja. Ghulab Singh was well prepared to make up the payment in defect of which Kashmir was ceded to the British; and so,"in consideration of his sendees in restoring peace, his independent sovereignty of the country made over to him was recognized, and he was admitted to a separate treaty. Ghulab Singh had already, after several extensions of territory cast and west of Jamû, conquered Lâdak (a Buddhist country, and till then subject to Lassa), and had then annexed Iskardo, which was under independent Mohammedan rulers. He had thus by degrees half encircled Kashmir, and by this last addition his possessions attained nearly their present form and extent. Ghulab Singh died in 1857, and was succeeded by his son, Ranbir Singh.
