KAPURTHÁLA, or Kopurthella, a native state in the Punjab, India, lying between 31° 9' and 31° 39' 30" N. lat., and between 73° 3' 15" and 75° 38' 30" E. long. Area, 800 square miles; estimated population, 250,000. The Kapurthâla family at one time held possessions on both sides of the Sutlej, and also in the Bari Doâb. The cis-Sutlej estates and scattered possessions in the Bari Doâb were escheated owing to the hostility of the chief in the first Sikh war, but the latter possessions were afterwards restored to the family in recognition of the loyalty of Ràjâ Randhir Sinh during the mutiny of 1857, when he led a contingent to Oudh which did good service. He also received a grant of estates in Oudh, 850 square miles in extent, and with an estimated population of 220,000. In these tracts, however, he exercises no sovereign powers, occupying the status only of a large landholder. His total revenue is estimated at £170,000, subject to a charge of £13,000 payable to the British Government in commutation of military service.
