KÁVERI, or Cauveky, a great river of southern India, famous for its traditional sanctity, its picturesque scenery, and its utility for irrigation. Rising in Coorg, high up amid the Western Ghâts, in 12° 25' N. lat. and 75° 34' E. long., it flows with a generally south-eastern direction across the plateau of Mysore, and finally pours itself into the Bay of Bengal through two principal mouths in Tanjore district. Its total length is about 475 miles; the estimated area of its basin, 28,000 square miles. It is known to devout Hindus as Dakshini Ganga, or the Ganges of the South, and the whole of its course is holy ground. According to the legend there was once born upon earth a girl named Vishnumâyâ or Lopâmudrâ, the daughter of Brahma; but her divine father permitted her to be regarded as the child of a mortal, called Kâvera-muni. In order to obtain beatitude for her adoptive father, she resolved to become a river whose waters should purify from all sin. Hence it is that even the holy Ganges resorts underground once in the year to the source of the Kâveri, to purge herself from the pollution contracted from the crowd of sinners who have bathed in her waters. The course of the Kâveri in Coorg is very tortuous. Its bed is generally rocky; its banks are high and covered with luxuriant vegetation. On entering Mysore it passes through a narrow gorge, but presently widens to an average breadth of from 300 to 400 yards. Its bed continues rocky, so as to forbid all navigation; but its banks are here bordered with a rich strip of cultivation. In its course through Mysore, the channel is interrupted by twelve anicuts or dams for the purpose of irrigation. From the most important of these, known as the Madadkatte, an artificial channel is led to a distance of 72 miles, irrigating an area of 10,000 acres, yielding a revenue of £7000, and ultimately bringing a water-supply into the town of Mysore. In Mysore state the Kâveri forms the two islands of Seringapatam and Sivasamudram, which vie in sanctity with the island of Srirangam lower down in Trichinopoli district. Around the island of Sivasamudram are the celebrated falls of the Kâveri, unrivalled for romantic beauty. The river here branches into two channels, each of which makes a descent of about 200 miles in a succession of rapids and broken cascades. After entering the Madras presidency, the Kâveri forms the boundary between the Coimbatore and Salem districts, until it strikes into Trichinopoli district. Sweeping past the historic rock of Trichinopoli, it breaks at the island of Srirangam into two channels, which enclose between them the delta of Tanjore, the garden of southern India. The northern channel is called the Coleroon (Kolidam); the other preserves the name of Kâveri. On the seaward face of its delta are the open roadsteads of Negapatam and French Kârikal. The only navigation on any portion of its course is carried on in boats of basket-work. It is in the delta that the real value of the river for irrigation becomes conspicuous. The most ancient irrigation work is a massive dam of unhewn stone, 1080 feet long, and from 40 to 60 feet broad, across the stream of the Kâveri proper, which is supposed to date back to the 4th century, is still in excellent repair, and has supplied a model to British engineers. The chief modern work is the anicut across the Coleroon, 2250 feet long, constructed by Sir Arthur Cotton between 1836 and 1838.
