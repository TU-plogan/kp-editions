KERNER, Justinus Andreas (1786-1862), a German poet and medical writer, was born in Ludwigsburg, Wurtemberg, on the 18th of September 1786. He received his early education in the Latin school of Ludwigsburg and in the cloister school of Maulbronn. After the death of his father, who was an upper bailiff and government councillor in Ludwigsburg, Kerner was obliged to accept a position in a cloth manufactory; but in 1804, aided by Pastor Conz, who had some reputation as a poet, he was able to enter the university of Tübingen, where he studied medicine. At Tübingen he made the acquaintance of Uhland, who was about his own age; and the two young men encouraged each other in their first efforts in poetry. Having completed his studies in 1809, Kerner spent some time in travel. In 1815 he received a medical appointment in Gaildorf, and in 1819 was transferred to Weinsberg, where he spent the rest of his life. Weinsberg is a pretty little town in Würtemberg, and was formerly a free imperial city. Here the emperor Conrad III. is said tc have besieged the castle of Count Welf; and, according to the well-known legend, the women, having obtained permission to retire with their most valuable possessions, stumbled out, each with her husband on her back. Kerner built a house under the shadow of the castle (“Weibertreue”); and through his exertions measures were taken for the preservation of the ruins and the laying out of the surrounding grounds in public gardens. He also occupied himself with the history of the town, and published a work in two volumes describing The Storming of Weinsberg Tn 1525. He was troubled with an affection of the eyes, and becoming almost blind he resigned his office and medical practice in 1851. He died on the 21st of February 1862. Kerner takes rank as one of the best of the Swabian school of poets, who had in some respects a close affinity to the Romantic school, but aimed at greater simplicity and clearness.

He attracted attention by his Reiseschatten von dem Schattenspieler 7λ∞(1811), and co-operated with Uhland, Schwab, and other writers in producing the Poetischer Almanach (1812) and the Deutscher Dichterwald (1813). In 1826 he issued a collection of his poems, to which he added many new lyrics in subsequent editions. He also published two other volumes of poetry, Der letzte Blütenstrauss (1852) and Winterblüten (1859). His lyrics are remarkable for the intermingling of quaint humour and delicate pathos, while in his ballads, which are written with great spirit and in a thoroughly popular tone, he prefers to represent such scenes of horror and mystery as the romantic school delighted in. He devoted much study to abnormal conditions of the brain, and wrote several popular works on animal magnetism and kindred subjects. Of more importance than these labours were his investigations on the influence of sebacic acid on animal organisms, and his work Das Wildbad im Königreich Wurtemberg. In his Bilderbuch aus meiner Kndbenzeit he gave a vivid and interesting description of the circumstances of his youth. See K. Mayer in Oac Album Schwäbischer Dichter, and D. Strauss, Kleine Schriften.
