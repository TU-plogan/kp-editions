KHERI, a district of Oudh, India, lying between 27’ 41' and 28’ 42' N. lat., and 80’ 4' 30" and 81’ 23' E. long., bounded on the N. by the river Mohan, separating it from Nepâl, E. by the Kauriâla river, separating it from Bharâich district, S. by Sitâpur district, and W. by Shâhjahânpur district in the North-Western Provinces, with an area of 2963 square miles.

Kheri district consists of a series of fairly elevated plateaus, separated by rivers flowing from the north-west, each of which is bordered by a belt of alluvial land. The rivers are, commencing from the east, the Kauriâla, Suheli, Dahâwar, Chauka, Ul, Jamwâri, Kathna, Gumti, and Sukheta. North of the Ul, the country is considered very unhealthy. This tract probably formed in ancient times the bed of a lake, through which flow two rivers, the Kauriâla and Chauka, changing their courses constantly, so that the whole surface is seamed with deserted river beds much below the level of the surrounding country. The vegetation is very dense, and the stagnant waters are the cause of endemic fevers. The people reside in the neighbourhood of the low ground, as the soil is more fertile and less expensive to cultivate than the forest-covered uplands. South of the Ul, the scene changes. Between every two rivers or tributaries stretches a plain, considerably less elevated than the tract to the north. There is very little slope in any of these plains for many miles, and marshes are formed, from which emerge the head-waters of many secondary streams, which in the rains become dangerous torrents, and frequently cause devastating floods. The general drainage of the country is from north-west to south-east. Several large lakes exist, some formed by the ancient channels of the northern rivers being fine sheets of water, from 10 to 20 feet deep and from 3 to 4 miles long; in places they are fringed with magnificent groves. In the south there are some other large natural lakes. The whole north of the district is covered with vast forests—occupying an area of 650 square miles, of which 423 square miles are now Government reserves. Säl occupies about two-thirds of the whole forest area. Kankar (nodular limestone) of good quality is met with, and saltpetre is manufactured in large quantities. The wild animals include tigers, leopards, black buck, spotted deer, hogdeer, and nilgdi.

At the census of 1869 the population was returned at 746,350 (males 403,837, females 342,513)—Hindus, 671,686; Mohammedans, 74,307; Christians, 96; “others,” 261. Allowing for recent transfers, the latest return (based on the above census) gives the population at 739,283. All the towns now existing are of recent foundation, none dating earlier than the 16th century. Of their origin, one common tale is told. The Musalmân or Bajput founder came through the λvoods and marshes, and seized upon the slight hills or hummocks upon which some Pasi or Ahir patriarch ruled over a few mud huts. The rightful owner fled deeper into the forest, and the intruder built a block house or a brick fort to guard against his return. Only three towns in 1869 contained upwards of 5000 inhabitants, namely, Kheri, Muhamdi, and Oel, with an aggregate population of 19,087. Lakhimpur, the civil station, is the only municipality in the district. The area under the chief agricultural products is returned as follows:—rice, 166,811 acres; wheat, 135,081; other food grains, 851,133; oil-seeds, 29,380; sugar-cane, 41,065; cotton, 6739; tobacco, 8265; vegetables, 6644; fibres, 419 acres. Poppy and indigo are also cultivated. District manufactures are confined to weaving and cotton printing for local requirements. Grain of all kinds is exported, as also are turmeric, tobacco, timber, sugar, syrup, hides, bullocks, and ghi. Catechu is made in large quantities throughout the north of the district, from the khαir tree (Acacia Catechu), the heart-wood of which is chopped out and boiled down by a caste called Khairis. Khaskhas (Andropogon muricatum), the roots of which are used for matting tatti screens, is exported in large quantities to Benares and Patna. Two great annual religious trading fairs are held at Gola Gokarannath—one in January attended by about 50,000 people, and the other in February, lasting about fifteen days, at which 150,000 persons are said to assemble. This great fair is increasing rapidly in importance, goods to the value of about £15,000 being sold annually by traders from all parts of India. The imports, which consist mainly of cotton, salt, country cloth, and English piece goods, considerably exceed the exports in value. The district revenue in 1870 amounted to £74,132, of which £62,471 was derived from the land-tax. In respect of education, Kheri is the most backward district in Oudlι. The mean annual temperature is about 79° Fahr.; the mean rainfall during the eleven years ending 1874 was 47 ’ 3 inches.

The present district only dates its history as an administrative unit from 1858. At the time of the mutiny of 1857 it was divided between the districts of Muhamdi and Mallâpur, and was not constituted a separate district till the reorganization of the province on the pacification of the country.
