KOHÁT, a district in the lieutenant-governorship of the Punjab, India, is situated between 32° 47' and 33° 53' N. lat., and between 70’ 34' and 72° 17' E. long., and is bounded on the N. by Peshâwar, on the E. by the Indus river, on the S. by Bannu district, and on the W. by the Kurarn river and the Waziri hills. It consists chiefly of a bare and intricate mountain region, deeply scored with river valleys and ravines, but enclosing a few scattered patches of cultivated lowland. The eastern or Khatak country especially comprises a perfect labyrinth of ranges, which fall, however, into two principal groups, to the north and south of the Teri Toi river. The Miranzâi valley, in the extreme west, appears by comparison a rich and fertile tract. In its small but carefully tilled glens, the plane, palm, fig, and many orchard trees flourish luxuriantly; while a brushwood of wild olive, mimosa, and other thorny bushes clothes the rugged ravines upon the upper slopes. Occasional grassy glades upon their sides form favourite pasture grounds for the Waziri tribes. The Teri Toi, rising on the eastern limit of Upper Miranzâi, runs due eastward to the Indus, which it joins 12 miles north of Makhad, dividing the district into two main portions. The drainage from the northern half flows southward into the Teri Toi itself, and northward into the parallel stream of the Kohât Toi. That of the southern tract falls northwards also into the Teri Toi, and southwards towards the Kuram and the Indus. The frontier mountains, continuations of the Safed Koh system, attain in places a considerable elevation, the two principal peaks, Dupa Sir and Mazeo Garh, just beyond the British frontier, being 8260 and 7940 feet above the sea respectively. The Waziri hills, on the south, extend like a wedge between the boundaries of Bannu and Kohât, with a general elevation of less than 4000 feet. The salt mines are situated in the low line of hills crossing the valley of the Teri Toi, and extending along both banks of that river. The deposit has a width of a quarter of a mile, with a thickness of 1000 feet; it sometimes forms hills 200 feet in height, almost entirely composed of solid rock-salt, and may probably rank as one of the largest veins of its kind in the world. The most extensive exposure occurs at Bahâdur Khel, on the south bank of the Teri Toi. Petroleum springs exude from a rock at Panoba, 23 miles east of Kohât; and sulphur abounds in the northern range.

The census of 1868 extended over an area of 2838 square miles, and disclosed a total population of 145,419 (males, 79,323; females, 66,096). The Mohammedans numbered 136,565, as against 6544 Hindus, 1837 Sikhs, and 473 “others.” The Hindus chiefly belong to the trading castes. Among the Mohammedans, 6313 rank as Sayyids; but the Pathâns form by far the largest division. Only one town, Kohat, contains a population exceeding 5000 inhabitants. Since the annexation of the Punjab, cultivation has extended from 64,772 acres in 1848 to 163,015 acres in 1873-74. The agricultural staples include wheat and barley for the spring harvest, with rice, millet, Indian corn, and pulses for the autumn crops. Tobacco, mustard, and oil-seeds also cover small areas, and cotton of inferior quality is grown in favourable years. The area under wheat in 1873-74 was returned as 36,600 acres; barley, 17,070; millets, 23,705; Indian corn, 12,050; rice, 4710 acres. Cultivation has now nearly reached its utmost limit. The principal industry of the district is centred in the salt mines. Of these five are now open, from which 294,680 cwts. of salt were quarried in 1870-71. Gun barrels manufactured near Kohât town have a considerable reputation along the north-western frontier. Coloured scaτfs, woollen carpets, country cloth, and pottery are also turned out at Kohât, Hangu, and Teri. The frontier military road forms the chief channel of communication, practicable throughout for wheeled conveyances and artillery. The district has altogether 249 miles of road, all unmetalled, and in many cases mere tracks, passable at best by camels, and sometimes only by bullocks or ponies. The total imperial revenue raised in the district in 1851-52 amounted to £9824, which in 1872-73 had risen to £19,443; of which the land-tax contributed £8951, and salt £8556. Education remains in a very backward stage. Four Government or aided schools and forty-three indigenous schools had a total roll of only 745 pupils in 1872-73. From its proximity to the hills, the temperature of the district is comparatively cool, except during the summer months.

long., near the north bank of the Kohât Toi river, and

2 miles from the southern base of the Afridi Hills. The population in 1868, including the cantonment, was 11,274. The town is built on undulating ground, within an amphitheatre of hills, and is surrounded by a slight wall, 12 feet in height. Its principal manufacture is that of gun barrels. The cantonment and civil station lie to the east and north-east of the native city. The cantonment has accommodation for about 3000 troops.
