KISTNA, or Krishna, a large river of southern India, stretching almost across the entire peninsula from west to east. It rises near the Bombay sanatarium of Mahâbaleshwar in the Western Ghats, only about 40 miles from the Arabian Sea. Its source is held sacred, and is frequented by pilgrims in large numbers. From Mahâbaleshwar the Kistna runs southwards in a rapid course into the Nizâm’s Dominions, then turns to the east, and ultimately falls into the sea by two principal mouths. Along this part of the coast runs an extensive strip of land, which has been entirely formed by the detritus washed down by the Kistna and Godâvari. The river channel is throughout too rocky and the stream too rapid to allow even of small native craft In utility for irrigation the Kistna is also inferior to its two sister streams, the Godàvari and Kàveri (Cauvery). By far the greatest of its irrigation works is the Bezwâra anicut, commenced in 1852. Bezwàra is a small town at the entrance of the gorge by which the Kistna bursts through the Eastern Ghâts, and immediately spreads over the alluvial plain. The channel there is 1300 yards wide. During the dry season the depth of water is barely 6 feet, but sometimes it rises to as much as 36 feet, the maximum flood discharge being calculated at 1,188,000 cubic feet per second. Of the two main canals connected with the dam, that on the left bank breaks into two branches, the one running 39 miles to Ellore, the other 49 miles to Masulipatam. The canal on the right bank proceeds nearly parallel to the river, and also sends off two principal branches, to Nizâmpatam and Comamur. The total length of the main channel is 254 miles, and the total irrigated area 226,000 acres, yielding a revenue of £89,000.
