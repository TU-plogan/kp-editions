KERGUELEN’S LAND, Kerguelen Island, or Desolation Island, an island in the Southern Ocean, to the south-east of the Cape of Good Hope and south-west of Australia, and nearly half-way between them. To the south is Heard Island, and west-north-west the Crozets and the Marion Group. Kerguelen lies between 48° 39' and 49° 44' S. lat., and 68° 42' and 70° 35' E. long. Its extreme length is about 85 miles, and its extreme breadth 79, but the area is only about 2050 square miles. The island is throughout mountainous, presenting from the sea in some directions the appearance of a series of jagged peaks. The various ridges and mountain masses are separated by steepsided valleys, which run down to the sea, forming deep fjords, so that no part of the interior is more than 12 miles from the sea. The chief mountain peaks are Mount Ross (6120 feet), Mount Richards (4000), Mount Crozier, (3258), Mount Wyville Thomson (3160), Mount Hooker (2600), Mount Moseley (2400). The coast-line is extremely irregular, many of the fjords being bounded by long, steep rocky promontories. These, at least on the north, east, and south, form a series of well-sheltered harbours; as the prevailing winds are westerly, the safest anchoring ground is on the north-east. Christmas Harbour on the north and Royal Sound on the south are noble harbours, the latter with a labyrinth of islets interspersed over upwards of 20 miles of landlocked waters. The scenery is generally magnificent, and often singularly picturesque. A district of considerable extent in the centre of the island is occupied by snowfields, whence glaciers descend east and west to the sea. The whole island, exclusive of the snowfields, abounds in freshwater lakes and pools in the hills and lower ground. Hidden deep mudholes are frequent.

Kerguelen’s Land is of undoubted volcanic origin, the prevailing rock being basalt, sometimes intersected by trap, and indeed an active volcano and hot springs are said to exist on the south-west of the island. Judging from the abundant fossil remains of trees, the island must at one time have been thickly clothed with woods and other vegetation, of which it has no doubt been denuded by volcanic action and submergence, and possibly by change of climate. It presents evidences of having at one time been subjected to powerful glaciation, and to subsequent immersion and immense denudation. The soundings made by the “Challenger” and “Gazelle,” and the affinities which in certain respects exist between the islands, seem to point to the existence at one time of an extensive land in this quarter, of which Kerguelen, Prince Edward’s Islands, the Crozets, St Paul, and Amsterdam are the remains. The Kerguelen plateau rises in many parts to within 1500 fathoms of the surface of the sea. Beds of coal and of red earth are found at some places. The summits of the flat-topped hills about Betsy Cove, in the south-east of the island,’are formed of caps of basalt. Sir J. D. Hooker points out that the vegetation of Kerguelen’s Land must be of great antiquity, and may have originally reached it from the American continent; it has no affinities with Africa. The present climate is not favoural le [9:14:49] to permanent vegetation: the island lies within the belt of rain of all seasons of the year, and is reached by no drying winds; its temperature is kept down by the surrounding vast expanse of sea; and it lies within the line of the cold Antarctic drift. The temperature is, however, very equable. During the transit expedition, the lowest winter temperature was seldom less than 32°, while the summer temperature occasionally approached 70°. Tempests and squalls are frequent, and the weather is rarely calm. On the lower slopes of the mountains a rank vegetation exists, which, from the conditions just mentioned, is constantly saturated with moisture. A rank grass, Festuca Cookii, grows thickly in places up to 300 feet, with Azorella, Cotula plumosa, kc. Sir J. D. Hooker enumerates twenty-one speciesof flowering plants, and seven of ferns, lycopods, and Char- aceae; at least seventy-four species of mosses,twenty-five of Hepaticae, and sixty-one of lichens are known, and there are probably many more. Several of the marine and many species of freshwater algae are peculiar to the island. The characteristic feature of the vegetation, however, is the Kerguelen cabbage {Pτinglea antiscorbutiea), a perennial cruciferous plant, in appearance somewhat like the garden cabbage. This cabbage and Azorella are found growing at a height of 1000 feet, while on the higher rocks a very handsome conspicuous lichen {Neuropogon Taylori), of a mingled bright sulphur-yellow and black colour, is found abundantly. Fur seals are still found in Kerguelen, though their numbers have been greatly reduced by reckless slaughter. One of the most characteristic animals of the island is the sea elephant (Macrorhinus leoninus), which is found in considerable abundance even far up the streams that flow into the fjords. The sea-leopard {Ogmorrhinus teρtonyx) is pretty abundant on the coasts. All parts of the coast and even the lower slopes are covered with penguins of various species, mainly the Johnny penguin {Pygoscelis taeuiata), rock-hopper {Eudyptes saltator), and king penguin {Aptenodytes longirostris). A teal {Querquedula Eatoni) peculiar to Kerguelen and the Crozets is also found in considerable numbers, and crowds of petrels, especially the giant petrel {Ossifraga gigantea), Halobaena coerulea, and Prion desolatus frequent the island, as also skuas, gulls, sheathbills {Ghionis minor), albatross, terns {Sterna virgata '!), cormorants {Phalacrocorax verrucosus), and Cape pigeons. The island shelters a considerable variety of insects, many of them with remarkable peculiarities of structure, and with a predominance of forms incapable of flying. The island is frequented by sealers and whalers, but has no permanent inhabitants. Kerguelen’s Land was discovered by the French navigator Kerguelen Tremarec (born 1745, died 1797), on February 13, 1772, and partly surveyed by him in the following year. It was subsequently visited by Captain Cook, andalsoby Sir James C. Ross inl840inthe “Erebus” and “Terror.” It has occasionally formed a refuge for shipwrecked sailors. The “Challenger” spent some time at the island, and its staff visited and surveyed various parts of it in January 1874. Later in the same year it was occupied for several months (October 1874 to February 1875) by the expeditions sent from England, Germany, and the United States to observe the transit of Venus. Still the interior is all but unexplored, and we have only vague notions of a considerable part of the coast. The Admiralty chart is based chiefly on mining surveys and information obtained from whalers.
