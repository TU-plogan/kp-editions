KOTZEBUE, August Friedrich Ferdinand von (1761-1819), German dramatist, was born on the 3d of May 1761, at Weimar, where his father was a councillor of legation. Having attended the gymnasium of Weimar, he went in his sixteenth year to the university of Jena, and afterwards studied about a year in Duisburg. In 1780 he completed his legal studies, and was admitted an advocate. Through the influence of Count Görtz, Prussian ambassador at the Russian court, he became secretary at St Petersburg to the governor-general Von Baur, by whom he was recommended to the empress. In 1783 he received the appointment of assessor to the high court of appeal in Revel, where he married a daughter of lieutenant-general Von Essen. He was ennobled in 1785, and became president of the magistracy of the province of Esthonia. Before leaving Germany he had published some unimportant writings; in Revel he acquired a considerable reputation by his Leiden der Orteηbergischeη Familie (1785), his Kleine Gesammelte Schriften (1787-91), and his two plays, Menschenhass und Reue and Die Indianer in England (1789). The good impression produced by these works was almost effaced by a cynical book, Doctor Bahrdt mit der eisernen Stirn, which appeared with the name of Knigge on the title page. After the death of his first wife Kotzebue retired from the Russian service, and resided for some time in a country house which he had built near Narva. At this time he manifested extraordinary literary activity, publishing within a few years, besides Die jüngste Kinder meiner Laune (in 5 volumes), upwards of twenty plays. In 1798 he accepted the office of dramatist to the court theatre of Vienna, resigning it in about two years with a pension of 1000 florins. On his way to St Petersburg, where his sons were being educated, he was arrested in April 1800, and sent to Siberia. Fortunately he had written a comedy which flattered the vanity of Paul I.; and a translation of this play so delighted the emperor that Kotzebue was brought back, received an estate from the crown lands in Livonia, and was made director of the German theatre in St Petersburg. He returned to Germany when the emperor Paul died, and in 1802 was admitted into the Academy of Sciences at Berlin. Here, in association with Merkel, he edited Der Freimuthige, and began his Almanach dramatischer Spiele, which he continued to issue until his death. He also wrote several plays in Berlin, and made some enemies by the bitterness with which he attacked Goethe. Towards the end of 1806 he was again settled in Russia, and in the security of his estate in Esthonia wrote many satirical articles against Napoleon in Die Biene and Die Grille. As councillor of state he was attached in 1816 to the department for foreign affairs in St Petersburg, and in 1817 he went to Germany as a sort of spy in the service of Russia, with a salary of 15,000 roubles. In his weekly journal (the Literarisches Wochenblatt') he scoffed at the pretensions of those Germans [9:14:145] who demanded free institutions, and became an object of such general dislike that he was obliged to leave Weimar for Mannheim. He was especially detested by young enthusiasts for liberty; and one of them, Karl Ludwig Sand, a theological student, formed a deliberate resolution to kill him. On the 23d of March 1819 Sand called at Kotzebue’s house in Mannheim, and stabbed him to the heart, crying, “Here, thou betrayer of the Fatherland!” The assassin was executed, and the Government of Germany made his crime an excuse for placing the universities under strict supervision. Besides his plays and the other works already mentioned, Kotzebue wrote a history of the German empire and a book on the ancient history of Prussia, neither of which has solid merit. He was also the author of Erinnerungen aus Paris (1804), and Erinnerungen von einer Heise aus Livland nach Pom und Neapel (1805). He wrote more than one hundred plays, the majority of which are now forgotten. Although destitute of poetic insight, he had remarkable facility in the invention of effective situations; and a respectable place in German literature is secured for some of his comedies by the liveliness with which their characters are portrayed, and by the sprightliness of their dialogue. There is a complete edition of his dramatic works in 28 volumes (1797-1823), another in 44 volumes (1827-29), and a third in 40 volumes (1840-41).
