KIRCHER, Athanasius (1602-1680), a learned scholar and accomplished mathematician, was born May 2, 1602, at Geisa near Fulda, was educated at the Jesuit college of Fulda, and entered upon his noviciate in that order at Mainz in 1618. After continuing his studies at Paderborn, Münster, Cologne, Coblenz, and Mainz, he became professor of philosophy, mathematics, and Oriental languages at Würzburg, whence he was driven (1631) by the troubles of the Thirty Years’ War to Avignon. Through the influence of Cardinal Barberini he next (1635) settled in Rome, where for eight years he taught mathematics in the Collegio Romano, but ultimately resigned this appointment in order that he might devote the closing years of his life entirely to the study of hieroglyphics and other archaeological subjects. He died November 28, 1680.

Kircher was a man of wide and varied learning, but singularly devoid of judgment and critical discernment. His voluminous writings in philology, natural history, physics, and mathematics often accordingly have a good deal of the historical interest which attaches to pioneering work, however imperfectly performed; otherwise they now take rank as curiosities of literature merely. They include Ars Magnesia, 1631; Magnes, sive de arte magnetica opus tripartitum, 1640; and Magneticum naturae regnum, 1667; Prodromus Coptus, 1636; Lingua Aegyptiaca restituta, 1643; Obeliscus [9:14:94] Pamphilius, 1650; and Oedipus Aegyptiacus, hoc est universalis doctrinae hieroglyphicae instauratio, 1652-55,—works which may claim the merit of having first called the attention of the learned to the Egyptian hieroglyphics; Ars magna lucis et umbrae in mundo, 1645-46; Musurgia universalis, sive ars magna consoni et dissoni, 1650; Polygraphia, seu artificium linguarum quo cum omnibus mundi populis poterit quis respondere, 1663; Mundus subterraneus, quo siibterrestris mundi opificium, universae denique naturae divitiae, abditorum effectuum causae demonstrantur, 1665-78; China illustrata, 1667; Ars magna sciendi, 1669; and Latium, 1669, a work which may still be consulted with advantage. The Specula Melitensis Encyclica (1638) gives an account of what may be described as a kind of calculating machine of his invention. The valuable collection of antiquities which he bequeathed to the Collegio Romano has been described by Buonanni (fiiusaeum Kir-cherianum, 1709; republished by Battara in 1773).
