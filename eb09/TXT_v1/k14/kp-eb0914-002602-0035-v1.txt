KEELING ISLANDS, or Cocos Islands, also called by Horsburgh the Borneo Coral Islands, a group in the Indian Ocean, about 600 miles south of the coast of Sumatra, in 12° 5' S. lat. and 90° 55' E. Ion»., well known [9:14:27] as having furnished Mr Darwin with the typical example of an atoll or lagoon island.^[1. Geological Observations on Coral Reefs, London, 1851; new ed., 1874.] There are altogether twenty-three small islands, 9∣ miles being the greatest width of the whole atoll.^[2. 'The names of the more important are as follows :—Horsburgh or North Island (the most northern of the group); Direction Island or in Malay Pulu Tikus (Mouse Island); Prison Island; Rice (Rijst) or Water Island, in Malay Pulu Tuwan; South Island (Selima or Fairlee); Long, West, or Ross Island.] The lagoon is very shallow, and the passages between many of the islands of such trifling depth that it is possible to “walk at low tide with some slight wading all the way from Direction island to West island.” An opening on the northern side of the reef permits the entrance of vessels into the northern part of the lagoon, which forms a good harbour known as Port Refuge or Port Albion. Since Mr Darwin’s visit some of the minor passages have become completely filled up.

The cocoa-nut (as the name Cocos Islands indicates) is the characteristic production, and is cultivated on all the islands. There are a few other trees (Sir E. Owen described seven kinds in 1830) and lesser plants; but the whole flora, exclusive of recent introductions, comprises less than thirty species. Of the twenty species, however, represented in Mr Darwin’s collection, “nineteen belonged to different genera, and these again to no less than sixteen families.” With the exception of man and the domestic pig, the rat appears to be the only mammal in the islands; and there are no true land birds, except domestic poultry. One of the commonest living creatures is a monstrous crab which lives on the cocoa-nuts; and in some places also there are great colonies of the pomegranate crab, which, to quote Mr Forbes, is “labouring assiduously to make the soft pure white calcareous mud into tree-inhabitable land.” The climate is temperate and extremely healthy. Terrific storms sometimes break over the island; and it has been more than once visited by earthquakes. The inhabitants “are well developed, strong, and of a wonderfully healthy appearance”; they belong originally to various parts of the Indian archipelago, Borneo, Sumatra, Celebes, &c.

The Keeling Islands were discovered in 1609 by William Keeling on his way home from the Moluccas.^[3. His narrative is given by Purchas, and epitomized in Astley’s Collection.] In 1823 Alexander Hare, an English adventurer, settled on the southmost island with a number of slaves. Some two or three years after, a Scotchman, J. Ross, who had commanded a brig during the English occupation of Java, settled with his family on Direction Island, and his little colony was soon strengthened by Hare’s runaway slaves. The Dutch Government had in an informal way claimed the possession of the islands since 1829; but they refused to allow Ross to hoist the Dutch flag, and accordingly the place was taken under British protection in 1856. In 1878 it was attached to the government of Ceylon.
