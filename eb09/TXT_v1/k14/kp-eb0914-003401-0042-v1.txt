KENDAL, Kirkby-Kendal, or Kirkby-in-Kendal, a market-town and parliamentary and municipal borough of Westmoreland, is picturesquely situated in a pleasant valley on the east bank of the Kent or Ken, 44 miles south of Carlisle (50 by rail), and 241 miles from London. The town, which is the largest and most populous in the county, is very irregularly built, but the white-walled houses with their blue-slated roofs, and the numerous trees, give it a very attractive appearance. There are four leading streets, two of which together form a spacious thoroughfare a mile in length. The church of the Holy Trinity, whose oldest part dates from about 1200, is a Gothic edifice with five aisles and α square tower 72 feet high. Kendal contains numerous other churches, a town-hall, a mechanics’ institution, a literary and scientific institution, a museum, and a chamber of commerce. Its charities include a hospital (founded 1870), an old maids' hospital, α girls’ orphanage, almshouses, <fcc. The free grammar school is well endowed; and there are also in the town a well-endowed blue-coat school and hospital, a large national school, a school of science and art, and several Sunday schools, among which is the Greencoat Sunday school, founded in 1813. On an eminence to the east of the town are the ruins of Kendal Castle, attributed to the first barons of Kendal. It was the birthplace of Catherine Parr, Henry VIII.’s last queen. On the Castle-law-hill, an obelisk was raised in 1788 in memory of the revolution of 1688. The woollen manufactures of Kendal have been noted since the 14th century, when Edward III. established a colony of Flemish weavers in the town; and, although the coarse cloth known to Shakespeare as “Kendal green” is no longer made, its place is more than supplied by active manufactures of tweeds, linsey-wolsey, railway rugs, horse clothing, knitted woollen caps and jackets, worsted and woollen yarns, and similar goods. Other manufactures of Kendal are machine-made boots and shoes, cards for wool and cotton, agricultural and other machinery, paper, and, in the neighbourhood, gunpowder. There are also important marble-works. There is a large weekly market for grain, and annual horse and cattle fairs. The population in 1881 was 13,696, an increase of only 250 from 1871.

Kendal was the head of a barony given by William the Conqueror to Ivo de Talbois. It has given the title of earl to various royal and other personages of English history. The town received its charter from Queen Elizabeth in 1575. A second, granted by Charles I., and confirmed by Charles II., was superseded by the Municipal Act of 1835, according to which the town is governed by six aidermen and eighteen councillors, who select a mayor from among themselves. Quarter sessions are held alternately at Appleby and Kendal. The Reform Act of 1832 assigned one member of parliament to Kendal.
