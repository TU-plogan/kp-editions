KUTAIS, a town of the Caucasus, Russia, capital of the province of same name, 60 miles east from Poti, and 4 miles from the Rion station of the railway between Poti and Tiflis. It is one of the oldest towns of the Caucasus; Procopius mentions it under the name of Kotatision. Persians, Mongolians, Turks, and Russians have again and again destroyed the town and its fortress. In 1810 it became Russian. It is situated now on both banks of the Rion river, which is spanned by an iron bridge. Its most remarkable building is the ruined cathedral, erected in the 11th century by the Bagratides, which is the most important representative of Georgian architecture. The fort Uhimerion, mentioned by Procopius, is now but a heap of ruins. During recent years Kutais has acquired some importance, and its population is rapidly increasing; it. is now 12,000. The inhabitants make hats and silks, and trade in agricultural produce and wine. On the right bank of the Rion is a Government model-garden, with a model-farm for promoting the improvement of gardening, for which the warm and moist district of Imeritia is well adapted.
