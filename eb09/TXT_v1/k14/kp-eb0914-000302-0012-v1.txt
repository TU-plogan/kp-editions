KARASU-BAZAR, a town of Russia, in the government of Taurida, near the rivers Tunas and Karasu, in 45° 3' N. lat. and 34° 26' E. long., 27 miles from Simpheropol on the road to Theodosia. The site is low, but it is surrounded by hills, one of which, the Ak-Kaya or White Rock, not only affords protection from the north wind, but so reflects the sunshine upon the town that it enjoys a much milder climate than the surrounding region. The dirty streets full of petty traders, the gloomy bazaar with its multitude of small shops, the market squares, the blind alleys, the little gates in the dead court-yard walls, all give the place the stamp of a Tartar or Turkish town, and remind the visitor that here was after 1763 the seat of the Crimean khans. In 1861 there were twenty-four mosques, but several have fallen into decay; in one of them is the tomb of Yakubaga-Rudzvitch, the founder of the well-known Crimean family. Of the numerous caravanserais, the Tash-Khan is the most notable —a strong half-fortified building erected in 1656. Placed on the high road between Simpheropol and Kertch, and in the midst of a country rich in corn-land, vineyards, and gardens, Karasu-Bazar used to be a chief seat of commercial activity in the Crimea; but it is gradually declining in importance. The population consists of Armenians, Greeks, Jews, Tartars, and (in smaller numbers) Russians. The bulk of the trade is in the hands of the Armenians, and they are also the owners of the great proportion of [9:14:4] the buildings in the town. About 2000 of the Jews are what are known as Krimtchaks, or sometimes as Constan tinopo!itan Jews. From the ordinary “rabbinical Jews” of Russia they differ by wearing the Tartar costume and by the use of the Tartar tongue, instead of the German jargon. They are engaged in making leather, Tartar knives, Tartar embroidery, and similar articles. The population of Karasu-Bazar is given by the St Petersburg Calendar for 1874 as 14,397. Round about the town lie cemeteries of unusual extent.

By Thunman and others Karasu-Bazar has been identified with the Greek town of Mauron-Kastron, but Professor Bruhn thinks that, as there has never apparently been any fortress at Karasu-Bazar, the site of the “Black Castle” is more probably at Mangup-Kale. The caves of Akkaya, however, give evidence of early occupation of the spot. When in 1736 Khan Feta Ghirei was driven by the Russians from Bakhchisarai he settled at Karasu-Bazar, but next year the town was captured, plundered, and burned by General Douglas. In 1784 it was the temporary seat of the Russian administration of the Crimea.
