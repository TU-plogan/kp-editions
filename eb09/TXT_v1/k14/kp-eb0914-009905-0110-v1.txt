KIRMÁN, the ancient Karmania, a province of south Persia, bounded on the E. by Sistân and Balûchistân, on the W. by Farsistân, N. by Khérâsân, on the S. by Lâristân, Makrân, and the Strait of Ormuz. It is of very irregular shape, expanding in the north towards Khorâsân, and gradually contracting in the south to the narrow coast district of Mogistan; the extreme length between Sistân and Fars east and west is 400 miles; the greatest breadth from south of Yezd to the coast at Bandar-Abbas is 300 miles; and the total area is estimated at 55,000 to 60,000 square miles. It is generally described as consisting of two parts, an uninhabitable desert region in the north, and a habitable mountainous region in the south. But the recent explorations of Khanikoff, Goldsmid, Lovett, St John, and others require this view to be considerably modified. There are mountains and desert tracts in all parts, while much of what appears on the maps as forming the western portion of the great Kirmân desert consists of the fertile upland plateau of the Kuh-Banân, stretching along the eastern base of the lofty range which runs from Yezd south-east to Khabis. West of and parallel to this range are two others, one culminating north of Bam in the Kuh-Hazâr, 14,550 feet, the other continued at about the same elevation under the name of the Jamal Bâris south-eastwards to the Kohistân highlands on the Makrân frontier. These chains traverse the fertile Nurmanshahr district, dividing it into several longitudinal valleys of considerable length, but not averaging more than 12 miles in width. Snow lies on their slopes to a great depth for the better part of the year, feeding the springs and “karez” or underground irrigation rills, by means of which large tracts in this almost rainless region in summer are kept under cultivation. Still further west the Kuh-Dinâr range is continued from Farsistân also in a southeasterly direction to the valley of the Minâb, which is the only river worthy of the name in the whole province.

Between the south western highlands and the Jamal Baris there is much arid and unproductive land. But the true desert of Kirmân lies mainly in the north and northeast, where it merges northwards in the desert of Lut,^[1. The term lut means simply arid, waterless, and has nothing to do with the Lot of Holy Writ, as some have supposed.] which stretches far into Khérâsân. These southern deserts differ from the Great Kavir, or Salt Desert of North Khérâsân, mainly in three respects :—they are far less saline, are more sandy and drier, and present in some places tracts of from 80 to 100 miles almost absolutely destitute of vegetation. Yet they are crossed by a well-known track [9:14:100] running from Kirmân north-eastwards to Herât, which is traversed by couriers at great risk in about eighteen days. It appears from recent observation that these sandy wastes are continually encroaching on the fertile districts, and this is the case even in Nurmanshahr, which is being invaded by the sands of the desolate plains stretching thence westwards to Bam, There are also some “kafeh” or salt swamps, answering to the kavir of Khôrâsân, but occurring only in isolated depressions, and nowhere of any great extent. The desert of Kirmân lies about 500 or 600 feet above the sea, apparently on nearly the same level as the desert of Lut, from which it cannot be geographically separated.

The climate, which varies much with the relief of the land, has the reputation of being the most unhealthy in Persia, the fever-stricken districts of the Caspian alone excepted. The cool air from the snowy ranges is usually attended by chills and agues, so that the people on the whole prefer the sultry heat of the plains. Still some of the sheltered upland valleys in Nurmanshahr and elsewhere enjoy a genial climate like that of Shiraz.

The chief products are cotton, wheat, barley, gums, dates of almost unrivalled flavour from Mogistan, and wool both of sheep and goats (furk) noted for its extreme softness. This wool is used in the manufacture of the Kirmân shawls, which yield in delicacy of texture only to those of Kashmir, while often surpassing them in design, colour, and finish. A shιwl of the finer quality, 3 yards long, is sold on the spot for from £20 to £24. Spinning and dyeing are also practised, so that the province completes the manufacture of its own raw material. Its carpets and felts are also unsurpassed for richness of texture and durability. Besides these woven goods it exports mainly cotton, grain, and dates, receiving in return from India chintzes, muslins, indigo, tea, gold-cloth, china, glass, sugar; from Turkestan madder, rhubarb, drugs, gums, furs, silks, Bokhara furs, steel, copper, tea. Bandar-Abbas is the natural outport; but, since shipping has shown a preference for Bushire further north, the trade of Kirmân has greatly fallen off.

The inhabitants, numbering altogether about 500,000, consist of Tajiks in the towns and agricultural districts, some Tùrki, Rind, and Balûchi nomads in the east and south-east, and numerous Kùrd tribes, here called Leks. Shiel gives a list (incomplete) of twenty-one of these Lek tribes, dwelling partly in houses partly in tents, and numbering altogether about 200,000 souls.

The chief towns are Kirmân (the capital), Regan, Kruk, Kùm, Bam, Khabis, Khânù, and Bandar-Abbas.
