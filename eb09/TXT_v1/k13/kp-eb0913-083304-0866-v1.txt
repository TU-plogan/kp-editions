KÁMRÚP, a district of Assam, India, extending along both banks of the Brahmaputra, between 25° 50' and 26° 53' N. lai, and 90° 40' and 92° 2' E. long., bounded on the N. by Bhutân state, on the E. by Darrang and Nowgong districts, on the S. by the Khâsi hills, and on the W. by Goálpárá district.

The general physical characteristics of Kámrúp are those common to the whole valley of Assam. In the immediate neighbourhood of the Brahmaputra the land is low, and exposed to annual inundation. In this marshy tract reeds [9:13:834] and canes flourish luxuriantly, and the only cultivation is that of rice. At a comparatively short distance from the river banks, the ground begins to rise in undulating knolls towards the mountains of Bhutân on the north, and towards the Khâsi territory on the south. The hills south of the Brahmaputra in some parts reach the height of 800 feet. It is on the slopes of these hills, amid the primeval jungle, that European planters have set out their trim tea-gardens. The general scenery of Kâmrùp is thus agreeably diversified; and the villages are described as very picturesque. The Brahmaputra, which divides the district into two nearly equal portions, is navigable by river steamers and large cargo boats throughout the year, and receives several tributaries navigable by large native boats in the rainy season. The chief of these are the Manâs, Châul Khoyâ, and Barnadi on the north, and the Kulsi and Dibru on the south bank. Forests cover about 130 square miles of the district, of which 49 square miles have been reserved by the forest department. There is also a plantation reserve, where seedlings of teak, sdl i sissu, sum, and nahor are reared, and experiments are being made with the caoutchouc tree.

The census of 1871 returned a population of 561,781 (292,688 males and 268,993 females), spread over an area of 3631 square miles. Hindus numbered 514,024; Mahometans, 45,823; Buddhists, 182; Christians, 204, of whom 120 are natives; and “others,” 448. Kamrup is the headquarters of a sect of Vishnuvites, known as Mahâpurushias, who are described as extremely bigoted. The Mahometans are supposed to be the descendants of the early invaders. The native Christian community is under the charge of the American Baptist Mission, which has a station at Gauhati town. The population is entirely rural, the only town with upwards of 5000 inhabitants being Gauhâti, with 11,492. The temples of Hajo and Kamakhya attract many pilgrims from all quarters.

The staple crop of the district is rice, of which there are three crops. The state is the landlord, and the land settlement is made directly with the cultivators. The condition of the cultivators is high, and it is found difficult to obtain labourers for ordinary work. The indigenous manufactures are confined to the weaving of silk and cotton cloths for home use, and to the making of brass cups and plates. The cultivation and manufacture of tea are conducted almost solely by European capital. In 1874 there were twenty-four plantations, with 2638 acres under tea, the out-turn being 375,634 lb. The chief exports are rice, oilseeds, timber, and cotton; the imports are fine rice, salt, piece goods, sugar, betel nuts, cocoa nuts, and hardware. Education in 1872 was afforded by 146 schools, attended by 3969 pupils, including a high school and college in Gunhati town. The mean temperature is 76°, and the average annual rainfall 70 ’ 12 inches.
