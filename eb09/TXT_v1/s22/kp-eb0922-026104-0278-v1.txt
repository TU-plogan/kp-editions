SOMNÁTH, an ancient but decayed city of peninsular Guzerat, India, with a population in 1881 of 6644, mostly Mohammedans, is situated on a bay of the Arabian Sea, in 20° 53' N. lat. and 70° 24' E. long. The port, which is called Veráwal, is distinct from the city proper (Deva-Pattan, Somnáth-Pattan, or Prabhas). The latter occupies a prominence on the south side of the bay, is surrounded by massive fortifications, and retains in its ruins and numerous tombs many traces of its former greatness as a commercial port. But the city was most famous for the temple just outside its walls in which stood the great idol or rather columnar emblem of Mahadeo called Somnáth (Moon’s lord), which was destroyed by Mahmúd of Ghazni; see the details in vol. xv. p. 287. For the so-called “gates of Somnâth,” now at Agra, see Ghazni, vol. x. p. 560. The temple was again plundered by Ala el-Dín in 1300, and appears to have been converted into a mosque. See Yule’s edition of Marco Polo, vol. ii. p. 389 sq.
