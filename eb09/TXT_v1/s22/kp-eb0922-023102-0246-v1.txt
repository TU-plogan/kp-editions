SOCOTRA, or Socotora (Arabic Sokotrá), an island of the Indian Ocean, 150 miles from Cape Gardafιιi and about 220 from the Arabian coast. Its length from east to west is 71 miles, its greatest breadth 22. A plain 2 to 4 miles wide skirts the greater part of the coast, while the interior is mountainous. The granite peaks behind Tamarída (a village on the north coast and the chief place in the island, but now much decayed) rise to a height of 4000 feet, and a limestone chain connected with these runs north and south with an average height of about 1900 feet. The climate is moist, but not unhealthy, with much rain, especially during the south-west monsoon. At this season the temperature rises to 80° or even 95°, but on the whole the heat is not excessive. The scenery of the island is very striking, with bare rocky heights and fertile valleys; but there is little cultivation, the inhabitants living mainly by their vast flocks of sheep and goats, or on dates, homegrown and imported. Milch cows are numerous near Tamarída. The population is about 5000, of two distinct types. The nomad inhabitants of the uplands are a peculiar race, well built, with good features and long curling but not woolly hair; they resemble neither the Arabs nor the Somál. In Tamarída and other villages and towards the eastern end of the island the population is a mixture of Arab, African, and other elements, even including Portuguese. The native speech is not intelligible to ordinary Arabs, but Wellsted says that it can sometimes be made out by Arabs from the opposite (Mahra) coast. In fact, according to Ibn Mojáwir and Hamdání, the Socotrans in the Middle Ages were regarded as Mahra and spoke the Mahra dialect. Their way of life is rude and simple in the extreme, but they are hospitable and generally well-behaved, though they have almost no government; they are nominally dependent on the sultan of Keshin. A certain dependence (at least of places on the coast) on some sovereign of the Arabian coast has endured for many centuries, except during the short Portuguese occupation of Tamarída by Albuquerque. From 1876 to 1886 the sultan of Keshin was bound by treaty not to cede the island to a foreign power or allow settlements on it without the consent of England. In 1886 it was formally annexed by Great Britain.

The fauna and flora of Socotra are peculiar. As regards mammalia the civet cat is found, but the ordinary wild beasts of Arabia are unknown. The flora was studied by Professor Bailey Balfour in 1880, and his account of it is about to be published by the Royal Society of Edinburgh. The most valuable vegetable products are now, as in the Middle Ages, aloes and dragon’s-blood. The Socotran aloes (the French chicotin) is esteemed the best in the world when unadulterated. In old times the ambergris of Socotra was also famous.

Socotra was known to the ancients as the isle of Dioscorides; this name, and that by which the island is now known, are usually traced back to a Sanscrit form, Dvípa-Sakhádhára, “the island abode of bliss,” which again suggests an identification with the vησoι εὐδαίµovες of Agatharchides (§ 103). The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea speaks of the island as peopled only in one part by a mixed race of Arab, Indian, and Greek traders. It was subject to the king of the Incense Country, and was a meeting-place of Arabian and Indian ships. Cosmas in the 6th century says that the people spoke Greek and were largely Christian, with a bishop sent from Persia. The Arab geographers also had a tradition of an early Greek settlement (which they naturally ascribe to Alexander), but also of later Persian influence, followed by a settlement of Mahra tribes, who partly adopted Christianity. The Socotrans remained Nestorian Christians, with a bishop under the metropolitan of Persia, through the Middle Ages (Assemani, B. O., ii. 459; comp. Mohallebí, in Abulfeda, p. 371); but in their isolated position they have gradually lost all trace of Christianity except reverence for the cross, and practise the old South Arabian moon worship. There was much more at least of the forms of Christianity when Europeans first visited the island in the 16th century. In the Middle Ages Socotra was a station of the Indian corsairs who harassed the Arab trade with the far East. The population seems then to have been much larger; Arabian writers estimate the fighting men at 10,000.

See, for the history of Socotra, Yule, Marco Polo, ii. 400 sq., and, besides the authorities there cited, Yakut, s.v. ; Hamdání, p. 52; Kazwíní, ii. 54. For the state of the island at the beginning of the 18th century, see the account of the French expedition to Yemen in 1708 (V iaggio nell' Arabia Felice, Venice, 1721); and, for the present century, Wellsted, City of the Caliphs, vol. ii. (1840). For the topography, &c., see Red Sea Pilot, 2d ed., 1882.
