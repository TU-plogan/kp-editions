SUNDERLAND, Charles Spencer, Third Earl of (1675-1722), was the second son of the second earl, but on the death of his elder brother at Paris, on 5th September 1688, he became the heir to the peerage. He was born in 1675, and when twenty years old was sent to the House of Commons by the two constituencies of Hedon in Yorkshire and Tiverton in Devonshire. He chose the latter, and represented it until his succession to the earldom of Sunderland in 1702. Throughout this period of his life his career was undistinguished; his first start in the world of politics occurred in 1705, when he was sent to Vienna as envoy extraordinary, a mission which he discharged with signal ability. Although Sunderland was tinged with republican feeling and had rendered himself personally obnoxious to Anne, he was foisted by the all-powerful influence of his father-in-law, the duke of Marlborough, into the ministry as secretary of state for the southern department. This office he held from 3d December 1706 to 14th June 1710, when he fell, as he rose, through his connexion with the duke and duchess of Marlborough. The queen offered him a pension of £3000 a year, but he proudly refused the temptation, saying that, if he could not serve, he would not plunder, his country. After the accession of George I. he was lord lieutenant of Ireland (1714-15), lord keeper of the privy seal (1715-17), and secretary of state for the northern department (April 1717 to March 1718). At the latter date he was raised to the post of prime minister, holding with the office of first lord of the treasury the position of lord president of the council. Sir Robert Walpole had been shelved, and he revenged himself on the new administration by resisting and defeating the Bill which was designed to limit the numbers of the House of Lords,—a victory over Sunderland which led to a partial reconciliation between him and Townshend and Walpole, his rivals. Lord Sunderland was at the head of affairs during the South Sea mania, and the bursting of the financial bubble led to his political ruin. Through Walpole’s influence he was acquitted of personal corruption, but he was forced to resign his place as first lord of the treasury on 1st April 1721. The passion for intrigue which characterized the father had descended to the son: he was ever plotting, and within a few months after Walpole had saved him from disgrace, if not from a worse fate, he was engaged in scheming against the friend who had saved him. But his plots were interrupted by his death, which occurred on 19th April 1722. Lord Sunderland’s manners were repelling and his disposition was harsh, but he stands high among his compeers for disinterestedness. The love of books ranked among the ruling passions of his life, and he spent his leisure hours and his wealth in forming the great collection at Althorp.
