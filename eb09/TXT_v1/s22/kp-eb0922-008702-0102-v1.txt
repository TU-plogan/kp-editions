SIMSON, Robert (1687-1768), mathematician, was the eldest son of a Glasgow merchant, John Simson of Kirktonhill in Ayrshire, and was born on the 14th of October 1687. He was intended for the church, and passed with distinction through the usual course of study for that profession at the university of Glasgow. The bent of his mind, however, was towards mathematics, not theology; and, when a prospect was opened up to him of succeeding to the mathematical chair, he proceeded to London in order to become acquainted with some of the eminent mathematicians there and to increase his stock of mathematical knowledge. After a year’s residence in London he returned to Glasgow, and in 1711 was appointed by the university to the professorship of mathematics. The duties of this office he discharged for half a century. During that time he published several works on pure geometry, and carried on an extensive mathematical correspondence. In 1746 the university of St Andrews, wishing to confer on him an honorary degree, chose, according to his biographer Dr William Trail, that of doctor of medicine, because in his youth he had made a careful study of botany. He never married, and his long life was spent within the walls of his college. His habits were exceedingly regular, his hours of work and of amusement being rigorously fixed. A studious man of science, he had no relish for the promiscuous intercourse of society, and his manner of living was simple and inexpensive. In person he was tall, with a handsome countenance and an affable manner, and he used always to dress in lightcoloured clothes. Though, like some other distinguished mathematicians, he was rather absent-minded, in matters of business he was very circumspect. He was a man of the strictest integrity, ready to do justice to the merits of others, and not too sensible of his own. He enjoyed a long course of uninterrupted health, and was seriously indisposed only for a few weeks before his death, which took place on the 1st of October 1768.

The first of Simson’s published writings is a paper in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London (vol. xl. p. 330, 1723) on the subject of Euclid’s Porisms, the nature of which he was the first to elucidate (see Porisms). Then followed Sectionum Conicarum Libri V. (Edinburgh, 1735), a second edition[9:22:88] of which, with additions, appeared in 1750. The first three books of this treatise were translated into English, and several times printed, with the title The Elements of the Conic Sections. In 1749 was published Apollonii Pergaei Locorum Planorum Libri II. , a restoration of one of Apollonius’s lost treatises, founded on the lemmas given in the seventh book of Pappus’s Mathematical Collection. In 1756 appeared, both in Latin and in English, the first edition of his Euclid’s Elements. This work, which contained only the first six and the eleventh and twelfth books, and to which in its English version he added the Data in 1762, has become the standard text of Euclid in England. The additions and alterations which Simson made by way of restoring the text to its "original accuracy” are certainly not all of them improvements, and the notes he appended show with what an uncritical reverence he regarded the great geometers of antiquity. Two other works, restorations of Apollonius’s treatise Be Sectione Determinata and Euclid’s treatise De Porismatibus, which Simson was too distrustful of himself to publish during his lifetime, were printed for private circulation in 1776 at the expense of Earl Stanhope, in a volume with the title Roberti Simson, M.D Opera Quaedam Reliqua. The volume contains also two additional books De Sectione Determinata, two small dissertations on Logarithms and on the Limits of Quantities and Ratios, and a few problems illustrative of the ancient geometrical analysis. How far these restorations represent the lost originals will probably always be a matter of conjecture. The De Porismatibus certainly cannot be coextensive with Euclid’s three books; but, if it is only a restored fragment, the credit due to Simson’s perseverance and penetration in recovering from oblivion the nature and some of the contents of one of the most interesting treatises of antiquity will always be such as to keep his name in the remembrance of geometers.
