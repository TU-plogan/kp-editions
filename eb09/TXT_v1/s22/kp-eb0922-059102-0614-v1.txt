STRAUBING, an ancient town in the most fertile part of Lower Bavaria, is situated on the right bank of the Danube, 25 miles to the south-east of Ratisbon. Its oldest and most characteristic building is the tall square tower of the town-hall, with its five pointed turrets, dating from 1208. The church of St James is a good Late Gothic edifice (1292-1512), with some paintings ascribed to Wohlgemuth, and the old Carmelite church contains a handsome monument to Duke Albert II. of Bavaria. The industries of Straubing are tanning, brewing, and trade in grain and cattle. The population in 1880 was 12,625, nearly all Roman Catholics.

Straubing is a town of remote origin, believed to be identical with the Roman station of Serviodurum. In definite history, however, it is known only as a Bavarian town, and from 1333 to 1425 it was the seat of the collateral ducal line of Baiern-Straubing. Its chief historical interest attaches to its connexion with the unfortunate Agnes Bernauer, who lived at the chateau here with her husband Duke Albert III. During the latter’s absence his father, Duke Ernest, exasperated at the mesalliance, cruelly and unjustly condemned his son’s low-born wife to death, and caused her to be hurled into the Danube from the bridge (1435). A chapel in the churchyard of St Peter’s is said to cover her remains. Fraunhofer the optician was born at Straubing in 1787.
