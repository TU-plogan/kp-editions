STRATFORD DE REDCLIFFE, Stratford Canning, Viscount (1786-1880), diplomatist, was the first cousin of George Canning the statesman, and the youngest son of Stratford Canning, who, having been disinherited for marrying beneath his rank, settled in London as a merchant in Clement’s Lane, where young Canning was born 4th November 1786. Shortly afterwards the father died, and the family removed to Wanstead, the boy attending the village school and afterwards a school at Hackney until 1794, when he went to Eton. Ultimately he became captain of the school, and he also manifested his literary predilections by publishing, in conjunction with Wellesley and others, a collection of essays entitled The Miniature. In 1805 he was elected scholar of King’s College, Cambridge, and, while still attending the university, became in 1807 précis writer to his cousin, who had been appointed foreign minister. At the close of the year he went to Copenhagen as one of the secretaries of a special diplomatic mission, and after his return he was appointed in June 1808 first secretary at Constantinople. On the removal of his chief Mr Adair to Vienna in July 1810, Canning remained minister plenipotentiary, making use of the opportunity to give indications of that overmastering purpose and bold yet subtle diplomacy which were to have such an important influence on the history of the Eastern question. In 1812 he succeeded in effecting the treaty of Bucharest between Russia and Turkey, which was signed on the 12th May, shortly before the arrival of his successor. This was properly the inauguration of that English influence in Turkey which did not cease until within recent years. The treaty was also of immense immediate advantage by freeing the Russian army to act against Napoleon, and on his return to England Canning was rewarded by a pension of £1200 a year. He remained in London, occupying himself with literature, and contributing some articles to the Quarterly Review, then newly founded, until in May 1814 he was appointed by Lord Castlereagh minister plenipotentiary to Switzerland, where he succeeded in effecting the federation of the cantons as a neutral state. He returned to England in 1817, and in August 1820 was sent as plenipotentiary to the United States, to arrange certain outstanding differences between the States and England; but, although a convention was signed 13th March 1824, this was rejected by the American senate, and matters for several years remained, so far as any actual arrangement was concerned, in statu quo. In October 1825 Canning was sent on a second commission to Constantinople, chiefly to promote the independence of Greece, but after long and complicated negotiations the attack, without the knowledge of the ambassadors, on the Turkish fleet by the allies under Sir E. Codrington at Navarino, 20th October 1827, caused a conference then being held to be suddenly broken up, and rendered necessary the withdrawal of the ambassadors from Constantinople. They, however, again met at Poros towards the close of the following year, and ultimately Turkey was compelled, by the treaty of Adrianople, 14th August 1829, following a short war with Russia, to loose her grasp on Greece, and consent to the arrangement of a frontier limit. On his return to England Canning was made G.C.B. In 1828 he had been elected to the House of Commons for Old Sarum, and he sat for different boroughs until 1841, when he again accepted the office of ambassador to Turkey. During the next twelve years he gradually succeeded in winning the confidence of the sultan, as well as awakening his wholesome awe, by convincing him, not[9:22:591] merely of his sincere interest in the welfare of Turkey, but of his sole ability to thwart the wiles of the Russian emperor. There is no doubt a certain degree of exaggeration in Kinglake’s description of Canning as the “Great Elchi,” at whose slightest frown the Turks were ready to quail, and by whose matchless skill and coolness the emperor Nicholas was placed at his wits’ end; but the consummate ability with which he managed the negotiations connected with the question of the Holy Places, so as to place the emperor as much as possible in the wrong, and to render his act of hostility on 3d July 1853—which led to the Crimean war—unjustifiable, cannot be denied. During the war he retained his position at Constantinople, but at its conclusion he returned in 1858 to London. In 1852 he had been raised to the peerage with the title Viscount Stratford de Redcliffe. His later years were spent chiefly in retirement, and, except when the Eastern question came prominently into notice, he took little part in political discussion. On Eastern politics he contributed several papers to the Times and the Nineteenth Century. He died without surviving male issue 14th August 1880.

His essays were collected and published in 1881 under the title of the Eastern Question, with a memorial preface by Dean Stanley. A memoir by Stanley Lane Poole is in preparation.
