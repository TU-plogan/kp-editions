SOLI, an ancient town of Asia Minor, on the coast of Cilicia, between the rivers Lamus and Pyramus, from each of which it is about 62 miles distant. Colonists from Argos in Greece and Lindus in Rhodes are described as the founders of the town, which is first mentioned in history at the time of the expedition of the younger Cyrus. In the days of Alexander the Great it was so wealthy that that conqueror exacted from its inhabitants a fine of 200 talents. In the war between Mithradates and the Romans Soli was destroyed by Tigranes, but it was subsequently rebuilt by Pompey, who settled there many of the pirates whom he had captured, and called the town after himself, Pompeiopolis. Soli was the birthplace of Chrysippus the Stoic and of the poets Philemon and Aratus. The bad Greek spoken there gave rise to the[9:22:251] term σολοικισμός, “solecism,” which has found its way into all the modern languages of Europe. Extensive ruins still mark the site of the town; the place is now called Mezetlu.
