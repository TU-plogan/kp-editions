SIMPSON, Sir James Young, Bart. (1811-1870), physician, was born in the town of Bathgate, Linlithgow, Scotland, on the 7th of June 1811. His father was a baker in that town, who largely owed a moderate success in business to a shrewd and managing wife. James was the youngest of a family of eight, and for the furtherance of his worldly prospects the others struggled and sacrificed. At the age of fourteen he entered the university of Edinburgh as a student in the arts classes. Two years later he began his medical studies. At the age of nineteen he obtained the licence of the College of Surgeons, and two years afterwards took the degree of doctor of medicine. Dr Thomson, who then occupied the chair of pathology in the university, impressed with the graduation thesis, “On Death from Inflammation,” presented by Simpson, offered him his assistantship. The offer was accepted, and during the session 1837-38 he acted as interim lecturer on pathology during the illness of the professor. The following winter he delivered his first course of lectures on obstetric medicine in the extra-academical school. On February 4, 1840, he was elected to the professorship of medicine and midwifery in the university. Towards the end of 1846 he was present at an operation performed by Liston on a patient rendered unconscious by the inhalation of sulphuric ether. The success of the proceeding was so marked that Simpson immediately began to use it in midwifery practice. He continued, however, to search for other substances having similar effects, and in March 1847 he read a paper on chloroform to the Medico-Chirurgical Society of Edinburgh, in which he fully detailed the history of the use of anaesthetics from the earliest times, but especially dwelt upon the advantages of chloroform over ether. He advocated its use, not only for the prevention of pain in surgical operations, but also for the relief of pain in obstetrical practice. His strong and uncompromising advocacy of its use in the latter class of cases gave rise to one of the angriest and most widespread controversies of the time, and, although his views may not have been generally indorsed by later professional practice, anaesthetics in surgical operations have from that time held an indisputed place, and Simpson’s anaesthetic still continues the favourite in the practice of the Edinburgh school. In 1847 he was appointed a physician to the queen in Scotland. In 1859 he advocated the use of acupressure in place of ligatures for arresting bleeding; his views on this subject have, however, given place to improvements in the ligature and to a better knowledge of the conditions influencing its efficiency. His contributions to the literature of his profession and to archaeology, in which latter he took an active interest, were very numerous, and embrace Obstetric Memoirs and Contributions (2 vols.), Homoeopathy, Acupressure, Selected Obstetrical Works, Anaesthesia and Hospitalism, Clinical Lectures on the Diseases of Women, and three volumes of essays on archaeological subjects. Simpson, who had been created a baronet in 1866, died on May 6th 1870, and was accorded a public funeral; his statue in bronze now stands in West Princes Street Gardens, Edinburgh.

Simpson was a man of strong individuality and somewhat hasty temper, an uncompromising and aggressive opponent when he believed himself in the right, yet so tender and sympathetic that he endeared himself to an immense circle of friends and patients. Endowed with great mental power, activity, and receptivity, he performed a very large amount of literary work, much of which was of great value at the time and still continues to be of interest. He will, however, be chiefly remembered in the annals of medicine as a great personality, who brilliantly fought and won the battle for anaesthetics, and introduced chloroform.
