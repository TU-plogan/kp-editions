SIMBIRSK, capital of the above government, is situated 576 miles east-south-east of Moscow, between the Volga and the Sviyaga, here separated by an isthmus only 2 miles broad. The central part of Simbirsk—the Crown (Vyenets), containing the cathedral and the best houses— is built on a hill 560 feet above the Volga, whence there is a beautiful view over the low left bank of the river. Adjoining is the trading part of Simbirsk, while farther down on the slope, towards the Volga, are scattered the store-houses, the shops for the sale of stoneware and other merchandise brought by the steamers and boats, and the poorest suburbs of the city; these last also occupy the western slope towards the Sviyaga. There are three suburbs on the left bank of the Volga, communication with them being maintained in summer by steamers. A great fire having destroyed nearly all the town in 1864, it has been again built on a new plan, still mostly of wood. The cathedral of St Nicholas dates from 1712. The new one, that of the Trinity, was erected by the nobility in commemoration of 1812. The old church of St Nicholas on the Karamzin Square is architecturally pleasing. A public garden has been laid out on the top of the Vyenets Hill and another in the outskirts of the city, while no fewer than three hundred private gardens, where fruits are grown for exportation, are scattered throughout the town. The historian Karamzin (born in 1766 in the vicinity of Simbirsk) has a monument here, and a public library bearing his name contains about 15,000 volumes. Gardening and fishing occupy many of the inhabitants. The trade is brisk, corn being the principal item, while next come potash, wool, fruits, wooden wares, and manufactured produce. The Simbirsk fair, having a turnover of some 6 million roubles, still maintains its importance. The population (24,600 in 1867) was 36,600 in 1880.
