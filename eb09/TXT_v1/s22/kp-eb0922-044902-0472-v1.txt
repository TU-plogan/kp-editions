STANHOPE, Charles Stanhope, Third Earl (1753- 1816), was born on 3d August 1753, and educated under the opposing influences of Eton and Geneva, devoting himself whilst resident in the Swiss city to the study of mathematics, and acquiring from the associations connected with Switzerland an intense love of liberty. He contested the representation of the city of Westminster without success in 1774, when only just of age; but from the general election of 1780 until his accession to the peerage on the 7th of March 1786 he represented through the influence of Lord Shelburne the Buckinghamshire borough of High Wycombe, and during the sessions of 1783 and 1784 he gave his support to the administration of William Pitt, whose sister Lady Hester Pitt he married on 19th December 1774. When Pitt ceased to be inspired by the Liberal principles of his early days, his brother-in-law severed their political connexion and opposed with all the impetuosity of his fiery heart the arbitrary measures which the ministry favoured. Lord Stanhope’s character was without any taint of meanness, and his conduct was marked by a lofty consistency never influenced by any petty motives; but his speeches, able as they were, had no weight on the minds of his compeers in the upper chamber, and, from a disregard of their prejudices, too often drove them into the opposite lobby. He was the chairman of the “Revolution Society," founded in honour of the Revolution of 1688, the members of which in 1790 expressed their sympathy with the aims of the French republicans. He brought forward in 1794 the case of Muir, one of the Edinburgh politicians who were transported to Botany Bay, and in 1795 he introduced into the Lords a motion deprecating any interference with the internal affairs of France. In all of these points he was hopelessly beaten, and in the last of them he was in a “minority of one ”—a sobriquet which stuck to him throughout life,—whereupon he seceded from parliamentary life for five years. The lean and awkward figure of Lord Stanhope figured in a host of the caricatures of Sayers and Gillray, reflecting on his political opinions and his personal relations with his children. His first wife died on 20th July 1780, and he married on 17th March 1781 Louisa, daughter and sole heiress of the Hon. Henry Grenville (governor of Barbados in 1746 and ambassador to the Porte in 1762), a younger brother of the first Earl Temple and George Grenville. Through his union with this lady, who survived until March 1829, he was doubly connected with the family of Grenville. By his first wife he had three daughters, one of whom was Lady Hester Stanhope (see below), and his second wife was the mother of three sons. Lord Stanhope died at the family seat of Chevening, Kent, on 15th December 1816.

Earl Stanhope was elected a fellow of the Royal Society so early as November 1772, and devoted a large part of his income to experiments in science and philosophy. He invented a method of securing buildings from fire (which, however, proved impracticable), the printing press and the lens which bear his name, and a monochord for tuning musical instruments, suggested improvements in canal locks, made experiments in steam navigation in 1795-97, and contrived two calculating machines. When he acquired an extensive property in Devonshire, he projected a canal through that county from the Bristol to the English Channel and took the levels himself. Electricity was another of the subjects which he studied, and the volume of Principles of Electricity which he issued in 1779 contained the rudiments of his theory on the “return stroke” resulting from the contact with the earth of the electric current of lightning, which were afterwards amplified in a contribution to the Philosophical Transactions for 1787. His principal labours in literature consisted of a reply to Burke’s Reflections on the French Revolution (1790) and an Essay on the rights of juries (1792), and he long meditated the compilation of a digest of the statutes. His scientific theories, his mechanical experiments, and his studies in music absorbed all his thoughts, and for them he neglected his wives and his children. His youngest daughter, Lady Lucy Rachael Stanhope, eloped with Mr Thomas Taylor of Sevenoaks, the family apothecary, and her father refused to be reconciled to her, an inconsistency in a republican which subjected him to a caricature from Gillray. Lady Hester Stanhope abandoned her home and went to live with her mother’s relations. Lord Stanhope’s high qualities were marred by an impracticable disposition.
