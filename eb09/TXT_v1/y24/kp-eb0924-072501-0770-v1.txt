YAK. This animal is the Bos grunniens of Linnaeus and all subsequent zoologists, so called on account of the pig-like grunting sounds it makes. It is structurally more closely allied to the common ox than to the bison, with which group of the Bovidae it has been sometimes erroneously associated. It is only found in the lofty plateau of Asia between the Altai Mountains and the Himalayas, and occurs both wild and as the ordinary domestic animal of the inhabitants of that region, supplying milk, food, and raiment, as well as being used as a beast of burden. The wild yaks inhabit the most inaccessible parts of the mountains, ranging up to an elevation of 20,000 feet,—higher it is said, than any other animal,—delighting in extreme cold, and finding their sustenance in the coarse, wiry grass which is almost the only vegetable production of those desolate regions. They cannot live to the south of the

Himalayas beyond the immediate neighbourhood of the snow. Their size is that of a small ox. The horns are long, nearly cylindrical, smooth, and pointed at the ends, and with a peculiar and characteristic curve, being directed at first outwards, then upwards, forwards, and inwards, and finally a little backwards. Some of the domestic yaks are hornless. The most remarkable external character is the excessive growth and peculiar distribution of the hairy covering. The upper parts of the body and sides are clothed with a thick, soft, woolly hair, more fully developed along the middle of the back, especially on the shoulders, where it forms a great bunch; on the sides it is comparatively short. From the upper parts of the limbs and the whole of the lower surface of the body a thick growth of long, straight pendent hair descends, in old animals sweeping the ground and almost concealing the somewhat short legs. The tail is profusely covered with a thick mass of such hairs. The calves are at first covered only with a soft, shortish woolly hair, of nearly uniform length all over. Domestic yaks vary considerably in size and appearance according to their treatment and the purpose for which they are bred. The finest are those used for carrying the native chiefs. Those employed for ploughing are very inferior-looking animals. They vary also in colour. The wild animals are nearly uniformly black; the domestic yaks are often quite white. It is not uncommon to see the long hair on the ridge of the back, that on the tail, and the long flowing hair of the under parts white, whilst all the rest of the animal is black. The tails of the domestic yaks are used as ornamental standards by the Tartars, and are largely imported into India as chowries or fly-flaps.
