PUMA, a name, probably of native origin, introduced into European literature by the early Spanish writers on South America (as Garcilaso de la Vega and Hernandez) for one of the largest feline animals of the New World. It is generally called “cougouar” by the French, “leon” by the Spanish Americans, and “panther” by the Anglo-American hunters of the United States. It is the Felis concolor of Linnaeus and all subsequent systematic zoological authors. In general and anatomical characters, teeth, &c., it is a typical member of the genus Fells. (See Mammalia, vol. xv. p. 434.) Though often spoken of as the American lion, chiefly on account of its colour, it rather resembles the leopard of the Old World in size and habits. It usually measures from nose to root of tail about 40 [9:20:105] inches, the tail being rather more than half that length. The head is rather small compared with that of other cats and has no mane. The ears are large and rounded. The tail is cylindrical, with some bushy elongation of the hairs near the end, but not forming a distinct tuft as in the lion. The general colour of all the upper parts and sides of the adult is a tawny yellowish brown, sometimes having a grey or silvery shade, but in some individuals dark or inclining to red. The lower parts of the body, inner surface of the limbs, the throat, chin, and upper lip are dirty white; the outside of the ears, particularly at their base, and a patch on each side of the muzzle black; the end of the tail dusky. The young, as is the case with the other plain-coloured Felidae, are, when born, spotted with dusky brown and the tail ringed. These markings gradually fade, and quite disappear before the animal becomes full-grown.

The puma has an exceedingly wide range of geographical distribution, extending over a hundred degrees of latitude, from Canada in the north to Patagonia in the south, and was formerly pretty generally diffused in suitable localities from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean, but the advances of civilization have in recent years considerably curtailed the extent of the districts which it inhabits. In Central America it is still common in the dense forests which clothe the mountain ranges as high as 8000 or 9000 feet above the sea-level, where the hideous sound of its howling is said to be almost continuously heard at night during the breeding season. Though an expert climber, it is by no means confined to wooded districts, being frequently found in scrub and reeds along the banks of rivers, and even in the open pampas and prairies. Its habits much resemble those of the rest of the group to which it belongs; and, like the leopard, when it happens to come within reach of an abundant and easy prey, as the sheep or calves of an outlying farming station, it kills far more than it can eat, either for the sake of the blood only or to gratify its propensity for destruction. It rarely attacks man, and, when pursued, escapes if possible by ascending lofty trees. Several instances have occurred of pumas becoming tame in captivity. Edmund Kean, the celebrated actor, had one which followed him about like a dog. When caressed they express their pleasure by purring like a domestic cat.
