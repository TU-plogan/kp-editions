PRUD’HON, Pierre (1758-1823), French painter, born at Cluny on the 4th of April 1758, was the th⅛d son of a mason. The monks of the abbey undertook his education. The paintings which decorated the monastery excited his emulation, and by the aid of Moreau, bishop of Mâcon, he was placed with Devosges, director of the art school at Dijon. In 1778 Prud’hon went to Paris armed with a letter to Wille, the celebrated engraver, and three years later he obtained the triennial prize of the states of Burgundy, which enabled him to go to Rome, where he became intimate with Canova. He returned to Paris in 1787, and led for some time a precarious existence, painting portraits and making designs for booksellers. The illustrations which he executed for the Daphnis and Chloe published by Didot brought him into notice, and his reputation was extended by the success of his decorations in the Hôtel de Landry (now Rothschild), his ceiling painting of Truth and Wisdom for Versailles (Louvre), and of Diana and Jupiter for the Gallery of Antiquities in the Louvre. In 1808 he exhibited Crime pursued by Vengeance and Justice (Louvre, engraved by Royer), which had been commissioned for the assize courts, and Psyche carried off by Zephyrs (engraved by Massard). These two remarkable compositions brought Prud’hon the Legion of Honour; his merit was widely recognized; he received innumerable orders, and in 1816 entered the Institute. Easy as to fortune, and consoled for the misery of his marriage by the devoted care of his excellent and charming pupil, Mademoiselle Mayer, Prud’hon’s situation seemed enviable; but Mademoiselle Mayer’s tragical suicide on 26 th May 1821 brought ruin to his home, and two years later (16th February 1823) Prud’hon followed her to the grave. The classic revival which set in towards the close of the 18th century, and of which Louis David was the academic chief, found in Prud’hon an interpreter whose gifts of grace and naïveté tempered by seriousness atoned by the personal charm which they imparted to all he did for the want of severity and correctness in his execution. Mademoiselle Mayer (1778-1821) was his ablest pupil. Her Abandoned Mother and Happy Mother are in the Louvre.
