PSKOFF, capital of the above government, is picturesquely situated on both banks of the broad Velikaya river, 9 miles from Lake Pskoff and 171 miles by rail south-west of St Petersburg. The chief part of the town, with its kremlin on a hill and several suburbs, occupies the right bank of the river, to which the ruins of its old walls descend; the Zapskovie, consisting of several suburbs, stretches along the same bank of the Velikaya below its confluence with the Pskova; and the Zavelitchie occupies the left bank of the Velikaya,—all three keeping their old historical names. The cathedral in the kremlin has been four times rebuilt since the 12th century and contains some very old shrines, as also the graves of the bishops of Pskoff and of several princes, including those of Dovmont and Vsevolod. The church of Dmitrii Solunskii also dates originally from the 12th century; there are others belonging to the 14th and 15th. The Spaso-Mirojskii monastery, founded in 1156, has many remarkable antiquities. The ruins of numerous rich and populous monasteries in or near the town attest its former wealth and greatness. The present town is ill built, chiefly of wood, and shows traces of decay. Many of the inhabitants live by agriculture or gardening; the remainder are engaged in loading and unloading merchandise on the Velikaya and at the railway station, in combing flax, fishing, and domestic trades. The manufactures are unimportant. Since the completion of the St Petersburg and Warsaw railway the trade of Pskoff has increased. In 1880 the exports reached 99,000 cwts. on the Velikaya and 463,000 cwts. by rail; the imports were 125,700 cwts. on the Velikaya and 591,600 cwts. by rail. Pskoff has regular steam communication with Dorpat. The population in 1882 was 21,170 (15,086 in 1866).

History.— Pskoff, formerly the sister republic of Novgorod, and one of the oldest cities of Russia, maintained its independence and its free institutions until the 16th century, being thus the last to be brought under the rule of Moscow. Its annals, unquestionably the fullest and liveliest of any in Russia, affirm that it already existed in the time of Rurik; and Nestor mentions under the year 914 that Igor’s wife, Olga, was brought from Pleskoff (i.e., Pskoff). It was quite natural that a Russian fortified town should rise at the entrance of the Velikaya valley within the earliest period of the Russian colonization of that region; the river had from a remote antiquity been a channel for the trade of the south with the north Baltic coast. Pskoff being an important strategic point, its possession was obstinately disputed between the Russians and the Germans and Lithuanians, and throughout the 11th and 12th centuries numerous battles were fought. At that time the place had its own independent institutions; but, attacked as it was from the west, it became in the 12th century a “prigorod” of the Novgorod republic,—that is (so far as can be judged from the incomplete testimony of historical documents), a city having its own free institutions, but included in certain respects within the jurisdiction of the metropolis, and compelled in time of war to march against the common enemy. Pskoff had, however, its own prince {defensor municipii) ; and in the second half of the 13th century Prince (Timotheus) Dovmont fortified it so strongly, and was so successful in repelling its enemies, that the town acquired much importance and asserted its independence of Novgorod, with which in 1348 it concluded a treaty wherein the two republics were recognized as equals. The institutions of Pskoff resembled those of Novgorod; it, in its turn, had several prigorods, and its rule extended over the territory which now forms the districts of Pskoff, Ostroff, Opotchka, and Gdoff. Within this territory the “vyetche” or “forum” of Pskoff was sovereign, the vyetches of the subordinate towns being supreme in their own municipal affairs. The city of Pskoff was divided into several sections or “kontsy,” according to the prevalent occupations of the inhabitants, and the kontsy were divided into “ulitsy” (streets), which enjoyed extensive powers of self-government. The vyetche was supreme in all affairs of general interest, as well as a supreme court of justice, and the princes were elected by it; these last had to defend the city and levied the taxes, which were assessed by twelve citizens, who combined to some extent the functions of judges with those of a jury. Pskoff differed widely, however, from Novgorod in the more democratic character of its institutions; and, while the latter constantly showed a tendency to become an oligarchy of the wealthier merchants, the former figured as a republic where the influence of the poorer classes prevailed. Its trading associations, supported by those of the labourers, checked the influence of the wealthier merchants.

This struggle (of which the annals give a lively picture) continued throughout the 14th and 15th centuries, resulting sometimes in armed riots. Notwithstanding these conflicts Pskoff was a very wealthy city. Its strong walls, whose ruins are still to be seen, its forty-two large and wealthy churches, built during this period, as also its numerous monasteries and its extensive trade, bear testimony to the wealth of the inhabitants, who then numbered about 60,000. The “dyetinets” or fort, enclosed by a stone wall erected by Dovmont, stood on a hill between the Pskova and the Velikaya, having within its walls the cathedral of the Holy Trinity. Another stone wall enclosed the commercial part, the Kromy (kremlin) or middle town. In 1465 the suburb Polonische became so prosperous that it also was enclosed by a wall, and included within the circuit of the town proper. Even the Zapskovie was enclosed by a wooden palisade in the 15th century and later on by a stone wall; while the Zavelitchie was a busy centre of foreign trade. As early as the 13th century Pskoff had become an important station for the trade between Novgorod and Riga. A century later it entered the Hanseatic League. Its merchants and trading associations had factories at Narva, Revel, Riga, and exported flax, corn, tallow, skins, tar, pitch, honey, and timber for shipbuilding, which were transported or shipped via Lake Peipus, the Narova, and the Embach to the ports on the Baltic and on the Gulf of Finland. Silks, woollen stuffs, and all kinds of manufactured wares were brought back in exchange and sold throughout northern Russia.

Nevertheless, the continuous struggle between the “black” and “white” people (the patricians and the plebeians) offered many opportunities to Moscoλv for interference in the internal affairs of Pskoff, especially -with regard to the election of the princes, which was often the occasion of severe conflicts. In 1399 the prince of Moscow arrogated the privilege of confirming the elected prince of Γskoff in his rights; and though, fifty years later, Pskoff and Novgorod concluded several defensive treaties against Moscow the fall of both republics was inevitable, the poorer classes continuing to seek at Moscow a protection against the oppression of the richer citizens. After the fall of Novgorod (1475) Pskoff could no longer maintain its independence, and in 1510 it was taken by Vasιlii Joannovitch. The vyetche was abolished and its bell taken away, and a waywode was nominated by Moscow to govern the city. Moscow merchants were settled at Pskoff, and put in possession of the fortunes of the forqιer citizens. The conquered territory still maintained to some extént its self-government, especially with re gard to trade, but the struggle between rich and poor was aggravated by the intervention of foreigners. The “lutschiye ludi” (wealthier merchants) prohibited the “malomotchnyie” (poorer merchants) from entering into direct trade relations with foreigners, and compelled them to sell their wares to themselves or to become their agents. These disputes furnished Moscow at the end of the 17th century λvith a pretext for abolishing the last vestiges of self-government at Pskoff, and for placing all affairs of local administration in the hands of the Moscow waywodes. Thenceforward Pskoff fell into rapid decay. It became a stronghold of Russia against Poland and was besieged for seven months by Stephan Bathory during the Livonian War, and later on by Gustavus Adolphus. Under Peteι I. it became a fortified camp, and its walls were protected by earthworks. But it never recovered its former importance, and is now one of the poorer cities of the empire. (P. A. K.)
