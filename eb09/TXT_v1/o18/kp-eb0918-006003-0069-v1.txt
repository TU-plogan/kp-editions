OSTIA, a city of ancient Latium, situated at the mouth of the Tiber, from which circumstance it obviously derived its name. Owing to this position it became from an early period the port of Rome, but its foundation as a regular colony of that city is ascribed by ancient authors to Ancus [9:18:61] Marcius, who is said to have at the same time established there extensive salt works, which long continued to supply Rome and its neighbourhood with that necessary article. As the wealth and importance of Rome itself increased, the prosperity of Ostia naturally rose with it, and it continued throughout the period of the Roman republic to be at once the principal emporium of trade in this part of Italy and the permanent station of the Roman fleet. It was, however, at no period a really good port, and the natural disadvantages of its position were not merely felt the more keenly as its commercial importance increased, but they were continually aggravated by natural causes,—the alluvial matter continually brought down by the Tiber having filled up the port, and at the same time in great measure blocked the mouth of the river, so as to render it inaccessible to the larger class of vessels. Strabo gives a lively picture of the difficulties with which these bad to contend in his time, and which were only surmounted on account of the great pecuniary advantages arising from its proximity to the capital. The necessity of taking some steps to obviate these evils had indeed already presented itself to the dictator Caesar, who had proposed to construct an artificial port at Ostia, with all the appurtenances requisite for so extensive a trade, but no steps were taken towards the execution of this project till the reign of the emperor Claudius, who constructed an entirely new basin or artificial port at a distance of about two miles north of Ostia, and communicating by an artificial channel with the Tiber on one side and the sea on the other. These works were afterwards largely augmented by Trajan, so that the port came to be known as the Portus Trajani, and the channel from thence to the sea was called the Fossa Trajani. This was undoubtedly the same with what is now become the right branch of the Tiber, entering the sea at Fiumicino. From this time the great mass of the trade was transferred to the new port, while that of Ostia continually diminished, though the city itself continued to be a populous and flourishing place throughout the period of the Roman empire. It was not till the close of the western empire that Ostia itself, which was unprotected by walls, and consequently exposed to the attacks of the barbarians, fell into decay; and after it was plundered by the Saracens in the 9th century the site became altogether abandoned, the modern village of Ostia (a very poor place) being situated at a distance of about half a mile from the ruins of the ancient city. The extent and variety of these, as well as the beauty of the works of art discovered on the site, confirm the accounts given by ancient writers of the opulence and prosperity of Ostia in the days of the empire; while those of Porto, as the port of Trajan is still called, are of great interest as exhibiting not only the artificial basin of the port, with its quays and the remains of the surrounding magazines, but a large part of the circuit of walls and towers by which it was protected. Such was the importance of Portus under the Roman empire that it became an episcopal see, and still gives that title to one of the cardinals of Rome.

The continual advance of the coast-line, owing to the alluvial deposits brought down by the Tiber, has left the ruins of Ostia more than two miles from the sea. Those of Portus are separated from it by an eqtfal interval, and even the tower of Fiumicino, which was built in the last century at the entrance of the right branch of the Tiber— the only one now navigable—is already a considerable distance inland.

For a detailed account of the history and topography of Ostia and the neighbouring Portus, as well as of the changes in the coast-line and channel of the Tiber, the reader may consult Nibby, Dintorni di Roma, vol. ii. p. 426-474, 602-660; and an elaborate paper by Preller in the Berichte der Sächsischen Gesellschaft /or 1849.
