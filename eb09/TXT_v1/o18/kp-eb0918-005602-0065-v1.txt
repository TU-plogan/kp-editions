OSPREY, or Ospray, a word said to be corrupted from “Ossifrage,” in Latin Ossifraga or bone-breaker. The Ossifraga of Pliny (7Z. Λ r ., x. 3) and some other classical writers seems, as already said, to have been the Lämmer- geyer (vol. xiv. p. 244); but the name, not inapplicable in that case, has been transferred—through a not uncommon but inexplicable confusion—to another bird which is no breaker of bones, save incidentally those of the fishes it devours.^[1. Another supposed old form of the name is “Orfraie but that is said by Μ. Rolland (Faune popul. France, ii. p. 9, note), quoting Μ. Suchier (Zeitschr. Röm. Philol., i. p. 432), to arise from a mingling of two wholly different sources:—(1) Oripelargus, Oriperagus, Orprais, and (2) Ossifraga. “Orfraie” again is occasionally interchanged with Effraie (which, through such dialectical forms as Fresaie, Fressaia, is said to come from the Latin praesaga), the ordinary French name for the Barn-Owl, Aluco flammeus (see Owl, infra, p. 91); but the subject is too complex for any but an expert philologist to treat. According to Prof. Skeat’s Dictionary (i. p. 408), “Asprey” is the oldest English form; but “Osprey” dates from Cotgrave at least.] The Osprey is a rapacious bird, of middling size and of conspicuously-marked plumage, the white of its lower parts, and often of its head, contrasting sharply with the dark brown of the back and most of its upper parts when the bird is seen on the wing. It is the Falco haliaetus of Linnaeus, but unquestionably deserving generic separation was, in 1810, established by Savigny (Ois. de V Égypte, p. 35) as the type of a new genus which he was pleased to term Pandion — a name since pretty generally accepted. It has commonly been kept in the Family Falconidae, but of late regarded as the representative of a separate Family, Pandionidae, for which view not a little can be said.^[2. Mr Sharpe goes further, and makes a “Suborder” Pandiones; but the characters on which he founds such an important division are obviously inadequate. The other genus associated with Pandion by him has been shown by Mr Gurney (Ibis, 1878, p. 455) to be nearly allied to the ordinary Sea-Eagles (Haliaetus), and therefore one of the true Falconidae.] Pandion differs from the Falconidae not only pterylologically, as long ago observed by Nitzsch, but also osteologically, as pointed out by Μ. Alphonse Milne-Edwards (Ois. Foss. France, ii. pp. 413, 419), and it is a curious fact that in some of the characters in which it differs structurally from the Falconidae, it agrees with certain of the Owls; but the most important parts of its internal structure, as well as of its pterylosis, quite forbid a belief that there is any near alliance of the two groups.

The Osprey is one of the most cosmopolitan Birds-of-Prey. From Alaska to Brazil, from Lapland to Natal, from Japan to Tasmania, and in some of the islands of the Pacific, it occurs as a winter-visitant or as a resident. The countries which it does not frequent would be more easily named than those in which it is found—and among the former are Iceland and New Zealand. Though migratory in Europe at least, it is generally independent of climate. It breeds equally on the half-thawed shores of Hudson’s Bay and on the cays of Honduras, in the dense forests of Finland and on the barren rocks of the Red Sea, in Kamchatka and in West Australia. Where, through abundance of food, it is numerous—as in former days was the case in the eastern part of the United States—the nests of the Fish-Hawk (to use its American name) may be placed on trees to the number of three hundred close together. Where food is scarcer and the species accordingly less plentiful, a single pair will occupy an isolated rock, and jealously expel all intruders of their kind, as happens in Scotland.^[3. Two good examples of the different localities chosen by this bird for its nest are illustrated in Ootheca Wolleyana, pls. B. & H.] The lover of birds cannot see many more enjoyable spectacles than an Osprey engaged in fishing—poising itself aloft, with upright body, and wings beating horizontally, ere it plunges like a plummet beneath the water, and immediately after reappears shaking a shower of drops from its plumage. The feat of carrying off an Osprey’s eggs is often difficult, and attended with some risk, but has more than once tempted the most daring of birds’ nesters. Apart from the dangerous situation not unfrequently chosen by the birds for their eyry,— a steep rock in a lonely lake, only to be reached after a [9:18:57] long swim through chilly water, or the summit of a very tall tree,—their fierceness in defence of their eggs and young is not to be despised. Men and boys have had their head gashed by the sharp claw of the angry parent, and this happening when the robber is already in a precarious predicament, and unable to use any defensive weapon, renders the enterprise formidable. But the prize is worthy of the danger. Few birds lay eggs so beautiful or so rich in colouring: their white or pale ground is spotted, blotched, or marbled with almost every shade of purple, orange, and red—passing from the most delicate lilac, buff, and peach blossom, through violet, chestnut, and crimson, to a nearly absolute black. A few years ago some of the best-informed ornithologists were led to think that persecution had exterminated the Osprey from Great Britain, except as a chance visitant. This opinion proved to be incorrect, and at the present time the bird is believed still to breed in at least two counties of Scotland, but the secret of its resorts is carefully guarded by those who wish to retain it as a member of the country’s fauna, for publication would doubtless speedily put an end to its occupancy.
