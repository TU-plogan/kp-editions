OSWEGO, a city and port of entry of the United States, capital of Oswego county, New York, stretches between 2 and 3 miles along the south-east shore of Lake Ontario, on the low bluffs and hilly ground near the mouth of the Oswego river, which divides it into two nearly equal portions, and is spanned by three iron drawbridges. By the Delaware, Lackawanna, and Western Railroad it is 305 miles from New York, and by the New York, Ontario, and Western Railway 326 miles. The Oswego Canal connects at Syracuse with the Erie Canal. The situation of the city is a beautiful and healthful one: most of the streets are 100 feet wide, and there .are two finely-shaded public parks, one on each side of the river. Among the more conspicuous buildings are the conjunct custom-house, postoffice, and United States court-house, erected in 1858 at a cost of $120,000, the city-hall, the county court-house, the State armoury, the church of the Evangelists, the large Roman Catholic church in Mohawk Street, the public library (10,000 volumes), the normal and training schools, the city almshouse (2 miles outside the city limits), and the orphan asylum. Falling 34 feet in its passage through the city, Oswego river furnishes a good supply of waterpower, rendered available by a canal on each side. Besides the Oswego starch factory (founded in 1848, and now probably the largest in the world, occupying 10 acres of ground, partly with fireproof buildings seven stories high, and producing 35 tons of starch daily), the manufactories of Oswego comprise flour-mills, large iron-works (making steam-engines, steam-shovels, dredges, &c.), knitting works, shade-cloth factories, railway carriage works and repair shops, box factories, planing-mills, and a large number of subsidiary establishments. In the extent of its trade Oswego is the principal United States port on Lake Ontario, importing vast quantities of grain and timber, and exporting coal, flour, and salt. The annual duties on imports average over $1,000,000. The inner harbour, formed by the river mouth beingenclosed by jettie: has about 3 miles of wharfage, and a depth at low water of from 9 to 13 feet; and the outer harbour, formed by the construction since 1871 of a breakwater 5700 feet long, has about 4 miles of wharfage, and a depth of 20 feet. Fort Ontario, rebuilt by the United States Government in 1839, guards the entrance to the harbour; it is a place of some strength. The population of Oswego was 12,205 in 1850, 20,910 in 1870, and 21,112 in 1880.

Oswego was visited by Champlain in 1615, by the Jesuits Le Mayne in 1654, and by other early explorers. In 1722 the English established a trading post here, and in 1727 Governor William Burnet (son of Bishop Burnet) erected Fort Oswego. A body of about 700 men, left here by Governor Shirley, oonstructed in 1755-56 two other forts—Fort Ontario on the east and Oswego New Fort on the west side of the river. In 1756 the place was bombarded and captured by Montcalm; but between 1757 and 1759 new works were constructed by the English, who kept possession till Oswego was transferred to the United States by the Jay treaty in 1796. In 1814 Sir James Yeo took the fortress after a bombardment of three hours. The little hamlet of Oswego, commenced by Neil Μ‘Mullen, rapidly increased after the introduction of steam navigation on the lake (1816) and the construction of the Welland and the Oswego Canal (1828). In 1828 it was incorporated as a village, in 1848 as a city.
