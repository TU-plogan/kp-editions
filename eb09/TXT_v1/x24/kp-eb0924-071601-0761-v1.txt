X

X represents the Phoenician letter Samekh, to which the old Ionian Ξ is singularly close in form. This form is familiar to Greek students, because it belongs to the alphabet that superseded the alphabet of the Euboean type which was first in use at Athens. But the Euboean form of the letter was -f- (see Roehl, I.G.A., No. 372); and this form went with the Euboean alphabet of Chalcis to the western Hellenic world, and passed in Italy into the form X, which survives with us. The history of the symbol in Italy is not, however, perfectly clear, because in the extremely archaic alphabets of Caere and Formello we find not only -Jbut also a symbol ffi, and this has the place of Xι in the Ionian alphabet, whereas + stands after U, instead of in its proper place, which has been thus usurped by this huge and otherwise unknown intruder. There would be no difficulty in supposing that + is only a curtailed portion of the fuller form, and that the two survived for a time side by side in the alphabet, perhaps with some differentiation of value, were it not that this is inconsistent with the ultimate derivation of the Italic alphabet from Chalcis, where the large form certainly does not appear. The name Xι (ksi) is clearly Greek, not, like the names of the letters in general, borrowed from the Phoenician. It is obviously modelled upon Psi, just as Psi was itself modelled upon Pi. The value of the sound in Phoenician was probably a strong sibilant, with a weak guttural preceding. In the old inscriptions of the Aegean Islands—Thera, Naxos, &c.—we find a double symbol K M (i.e., ks); in Naxos we find also X Σ and BΣ (i.e., hs), which indicates a guttural breathing before the s; and in old Attic inscriptions also we find XΣ.

But this same symbol X had another very different value in Greece from l·s, and by this value, i.e., a guttural aspirate, kh or ch, it is familiar to Greek students under the name Chi. This value is confined to alphabets of the Ionian type. In the islands we find KQ or KH, also Φ0 at Thera, digraphs being employed in the same manner as for ks and ps. This same guttural sound is represented in alphabets of the Euboean type under the form j r or ψ, which appears naturally in the Caere alphabet, but in the derived Italian alphabets was retained by the Etruscan only. In Greece it was found in Bceotia and the Peloponnesus: e.g., it appears on the tripod at Delphi set up by the Lacedaemonians to commemorate the victory of Plataeae. But in the Ionic alphabet alone this same symbol has a totally different value, to wit, ps, and to this value the Greeks gave the name Psi. It is noteworthy that the old Attic way of writing this double sound was φ∑. The origin of this second X and that of its companion Y is very uncertain. The Attic writings above mentioned, and the φ Q of Thera, give colour to the idea that X and Φ may be survivals of a ruder alphabet, superseded by the Phoenician, with the values k and p. On the other hand, it does not seem impossible that γ, with the value ch, may be a descendant of the useless φ (koppa), obtained by opening out the circle (Taylor, Alphabet, ii. 93); but the same writer maintains that X is a variation of K, which seems very improbable. It is at least as credible that it is a variant of Samekh, in which the guttural element of the original complex sound superseded the sibilant.

There is nothing noteworthy in the history of x in English. In French, when medial, it has generally passed into ss, as in laisser (from laxare) ; and it has the same sound, even when written, as in soixante. It is frequently found at the end of words owing to a mis-writing, the contraction for final us having been confounded with it, as in plurals, yeux, animaux, &c., where the u has been added again, also in epoux (esponsus), faux (falsus), roux (russus), &c. Not unnaturally the x has been substituted still further, as in prix; in other cases, like croix, we have probably a learned imitation of the Latin. Italian also substitutes ss for x, as in massimo for maximus, lussuria, &c. On x in Spanish, see vol. xxii. p. 350.
