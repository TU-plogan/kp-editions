GALLIPOLI, the ancient Kαλλi7roλιs, a seaport town of Turkey in Europe, in the province of Rumili and vilayet of Edimeh, at the north-east extremity of the Straits of

Dardanelles, on a narrow peninsula 130 miles S.W. of Constantinople, and 90 miles due S. of Adrianople, in 40° 24' N. lat. and 26° 40' 30" E. long. Nearly opposite is Lapsaki on the Asiatic side of the channel, which is here about 2 miles wide. The town of Gallipoli presents a miserable aspect; the streets are narrow, the houses mostly of wood and ill built, though there are a few better structures near the harbour, and the Anglo-French occupation of 1853-6 led to some improvements. The only noteworthy buildings are the large, crowded, and well-furnished bazaars, with leaden domes. There are several mosques, none of them remarkable, and many interesting Roman and Byzantine remains, especially a magazine of the emperor Justinian, a square castle and tower attributed to Bajazet I., and some tumuli on the south, said to be the tombs of the Thracian kings. The lighthouse, built on a cliff, has a fine appearance as seen from the Dardanelles. Gallipoli is the residence of a captain-pasha and the seat of a Greek bishop. It has two good harbours, and is the principal station for the Turkish fleet. From its position as the key of the Dardanelles, it was occupied by the allied French and English armies in 1854. Then the isthmus a few miles to the north of the town, between it and Boulair, was fortified with strong earthworks by English and French engineers mainly on the lines of the old works constructed in 1357, when the Turks first crossed over into Europe, nearly 100 years before they gained possession of Constantinople. These fortifications were renewed and enlarged in January 1878, on the Russians threatening to take possession of Constantinople. The peninsula thus isolated by the fortified positions has the Gulf of Saros on the N.W., and extends some 50 miles to the S.W The guns of Gallipoli command the Dardanelles just before the strait joins the Sea of Marmora. The town itself is not very strongly fortified, the principal fortifications being further down the Dardanelles, where the passage is narrower. The district of Gallipoli is exceedingly fertile and well adapted for -agriculture; a great variety of crops are raised, but, previous to the war of 1877-8, nearly all progress was stopped on account of the maladministration of the Turkish authorities. Nevertheless considerable quantities of the various cereals were exported, besides wine, oil, skins, cotton, sheep, &c., much of the trade being transit. The principal imports are manufactured goods, coal, sugar, coffee, rice, soap, iron. The line of railway between Adrianople and the Egean Sea has been prejudicial to the transit trade of Gallipoli, and several attempts have been made to obtain concessions for the construction of a railway that would connect this part with the Turkish railway system. There is little industry in Gallipoli, though previous to the war attempts had been made to extend and improve the manufacture of silk thread and silk goods, and some little business was done in the construction of coasting vessels. Steamers to and from Constantinople call regularly at Gallipoli. Widely different estimates have been given of the population of the town; it is probably somewhere about 25,000 or 30,000.
