GIANT’S CAUSEWAY, a promontory of columnar basalt, situated on the coast of Antrim in the north of Ireland. It is divided by whin-dykes into the Little Causeway, the Middle Causeway or “Honeycomb,” as it is locally termed, and the Larger or Grand Causeway. The pillars composing it are close-fitting and for the most part somewhat irregular hexagons, made up of articulated portions varying from a few inches to some feet in depth, and concave or convex at the upper and lower surfaces. In diameter the pillars vary from 15 to 20 inches, and in height some are as much as 20 feet. The Great Causeway is chiefly from 20 to 30, and for a few yards in some places nearly 40 feet in breadth, exclusive of outlying broken pieces of rock. It is highest at its narrowest part. At about half a dozen yards from the cliff, widening and becoming lower, it extends outwards into a parade or platform, which has a slight seaward inclination, but is easily walked on, and for nearly 100 yards is always above water. At the distance of about 150 yards from the cliff it turns a little to the eastward for 20 or 30 yards, and then sinks into the sea. The neighbouring cliffs exhibit in many places columns similar to those of the Giant’s Causeway, a considerable exposure of them being visible at a distance of about 100 roods in the bay to the eastward. A group of these columns, from their arrangement, have been fancifully named the “Giant’s Organ.” The most remarkable of the cliffs is the Pleaskin, the upper pillars of which have the appearance of a colonnade, ancl are 60 feet in height; beneath these is a mass of coarse black amygdaloid, of the same thickness, underlain by a second range of basaltic pillars, from 40 to 50 feet in height. Near the Giant’s Causeway are the ruins of the castles of Dunseverick and Dunluce, situated high above the sea on insulated crags, and the swinging bridge of Carrick-a-Rede, spanning a chasm of 80 feet deep, and connecting a rock, which is used as a salmon-fishing station, with the mainland. Fairhead, a pro montory composed of columnar greenstone, the highest point on the coast, has an altitude of 550 feet.
