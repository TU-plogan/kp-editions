GLUKHOFF, or Gluchow, as the name is transliterated in German, a town of Russia, at the head of a district in the government of Tchernigoff, 132 miles E. of Tchernigoff in 51° 54' N. lat. and 33° 35' E. long., on the highway between Moscow and Kieff. It is situated on the sloping banks of the Yasmin, a subtributary of the Desna, which in its turn unites with the Dnieper. Among its buildings are eleven churches and two Jewish meeting-houses, a district school, an almshouse, and a hospital. In 18G0 its population, mainly engaged in agricultural pursuits and petty commerce, amounted to 10,008, of whom 4998 w ere males; in 1873 it was 10,747; and according to the Si Petersburg Calendar for 1878, it has increased to 13,398. The Jews in 1860 numbered 2517. About 4 miles from the town, near the village of Poloshek, there exists an extensive deposit of white clay, which supplies nearly all the porcelain factories in Russia. Glukhoff is mentioned in the Laurentian Chronicle as early as 1152. For some time it was in the hands of a branch of the ducal family of Tchernigoff, which retired before the encroachments of the Tartars in the middle of the 13th century. Before its final incorporation with Russia, it passed under the sway first of the Lithuanians and then of the Poles. On the destruction of Baturin by Peter I. in 1708, it was made the residence of the hetmans.
