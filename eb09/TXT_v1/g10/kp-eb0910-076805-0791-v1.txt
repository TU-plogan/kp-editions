GOLOVNIN, Vasily Mikhailovich (1776-1831), a Russian vice-admiral, was born April 20, 1776, in the village of Gulynki, in the province of Ryazan, and received his education at the Cronstadt naval school. From 1801 to 1806 he served as a volunteer in the English navy. In 1807 he was commissioned by the Russian Government to survey the coasts of Kamchatka and of Russian America, including also the Kurile Islands. Golovnin sailed round the Cape of Good Hope, and on October 5,1809, arrived in Kamchatka. In 1810, whilst attempting to survey the coast of the island of Kunashir, he was seized by the Japanese, and was retained by them as a prisoner until October 13, 1813, when he was liberated, and in the following year he returned to St Petersburg. Soon after this the Government planned another expedition, which had for its object the circumnavigation of the globe by a Russian ship, and Golovnin was appointed to the command. He started from St Petersburg on the 7th September 1817, sailed round Cape Horn, and arrived in Kamchatka in the following May. He returned to Europe by way of the Cape of Good Hope, and landed at St Petersburg, September 17, 1819. He died July 12, 1831.

Golovnin published several works, of which the following are the most important :— Journey to Kamchatka, 2 vols., 1819; Journey round the JVorld, 2 vols., 1822; and Narrative of my Captivity in Japan, 2 vols., 1816. The last has been translated into French, German, and English. A complete edition of his works was published at St Petersburg, 1864, in five volumes, with maps and charts, and a biography of the author by N. Grech.
