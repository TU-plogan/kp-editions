GEORGE of Trebizond (1396-1486), one of the distinguished writers in the great controversy between Aristotelianism and Platonism in the 15th century, was born at Chandace in the island of Crete. He received his cognomen apparently from the fact that his ancestors had come from Trebizond. At what period he came to Italy is not absolutely certain; according to some accounts he arrived as early as 1430, and settled as teacher of philosophy and rhetoric at Venice; according to others he did not come over to Italy till the period of the council of Florence (1438-9). His reputation as a teacher and as translator of Aristotle was very great, and he was selected as secretary by Pope Nicholas V., an ardent Aristotelian. The needless bitterness of his attacks upon Plato (in the Comparatio Aristotelis et Platonis), which drew forth a powerful response from Bessarion (ctyo.), and the manifestly hurried and inaccurate character of his translations both of Plato and of Aristotle, combined to ruin his fame as a scholar, and to endanger his position as a teacher of philosophy. The indignation against him on account of his first-named work was so great that he would probably have been compelled to leave Italy, had not Alphonso V. given him protection at the court of Naples. He died at Rome in 1486. Many of his translations of Aristotelian treatises are to be found in the older editions of Aristotle. A notice of his other writings is given in Fabricius, Bibliot1ι. Graeca.
