GLASSIUS, Solomon (1593-1656), theologian and Biblical critic, was born at Sondershausen, in the principality of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen, in 1593, received his school-elucation at the gymnasium of Gotha, and in 1612 entered the university of Jena, where, with the exception of some months spent at Wittenberg ∙in 1615, he passed the following nine years of his life. As a student of theology under John Gerhard he directed his attention especially to Hebrew and the cognate dialects; in 1619 he was made an ' t adjunctus” of the philosophical faculty, and some time afterwards he received an appointment to the chair of Oriental languages. From 1625 to 1638 he discharged the duties of superintendent in Sondershausen; but in the latter year, shortly after the death of Gerhard (1637), he was, in accordance with the last wish of that great’man, appointed to succeed him in the chair of theology at Jena. He did not, however, continue long at that university; for in 1640, at the earnest invitation of Duke Ernest the Pious, he removed to Gotha, there to act as general superintendent in the execution of important reforms which bad been initiated both in the ecclesiastical and in the educational establishments of the duchy. The delicate duties attached to this office he discharged with singular tact and energy; and when called upon to take part in what is known as the “syncretistic” controversy, by which Protestant Germany was so long vexed, he manifested a combination of firmness with liberality, of loyalty to the past with a just regard to the demands of the present and the future, which unhappily have only too seldom been equalled in theological disputes. His principal work, the well known Philologia Sacra, published originally in 1625, was and still is regarded as a work of great value in biblical hermeneutic; and it has an historical importance as marking the transition from the earlier views on questions of biblical criticism to those of the school of Spener. It was more than once reprinted during the author’s lifetime, and appeared in a new and revised form, edited by Dathe and Bauer at Leipsic, towards the close of the century (1776-1797). Glassius succeeded Gerhard also in the editorship of the Weimar Bibelwerk, and he wrote the commentary on the poetical books of the Old Testament for that publication. A volume of his Opuscula was printed at Leyden in 1700. He died in 1656.
