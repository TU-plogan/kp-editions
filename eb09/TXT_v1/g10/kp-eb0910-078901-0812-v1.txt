GOSLAR, a town in the district of Hildesheim, Prussia, province of Hanover, is situated on the Gose, an affluent of the Ocker, at the foot of the Harz, 24 miles S.E. of Hildesheim. It is surrounded by walls, and has a very antique appearance. Among the noteworthy buildings are the market church, in the Romantic style, restored since its partial destruction by fire in 1844, and containing the town archives, and a library in which are some of Luther’s manuscripts; the old town-house, possessing many interesting antiquities; the Kaiserworth, with the statues of the German emperors; the Kaiserhaus, founded by Henry III. in 1050, and along with the adjoining Ulrich’s chapel restored in 1873 at the cost of the Prussian Government; the small chapel, which is all that remains since 1820 of the old cathedral founded by Henry III. in 1040, containing among other antiquarian relics of the cathedral an old altar supposed to be that of the idol Krodo which formerly stood on the top of the Burgberg near Neustadt-Harzburg; the church of the monastery of Neuwerk, in the Roman style, with wall paintings of considerable merit; and the house of the bakers’ guild, the birthplace of Marshal Maurice of Saxony. There are four Evangelical churches, one Catholic church, a synagogue, a real school of the first order, a higher girls’ school, and a number of small foundations. The population are chiefly occupied in connexion with the sulphur, copper, silver, and other mines in the neighbourhood. The town has also been long noted for its beer, and possesses some small manufactures, and a considerable trade in fruit. The population in 1875 was 9838.

Goslar was founded by Henry the Fowler about 920, and when in the time of Otto the Great the mineral treasures in the neighbourhood were discovered it increased rapidly in prosperity. It was frequently the seat of German diets, and the residence of the emperor. About 1350 it joined the Hanseatic League. It was unsuccessfully besieged in 1625, during the Thirty Years’ War, but was taken by the Swedes in 1632, and nearly destroyed by fire. Additional conflagrations in 1728 and 1780 gave a severe blow to its ancient prosperity. It was a free town till 1802, when it came into possession of Prussia. In 1807 it was joined to Westphalia, in 1816 to Hanover, and in 1866 it was, along with Hanover, reunited to Prussia.
