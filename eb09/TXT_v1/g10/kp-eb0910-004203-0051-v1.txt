GALLIO, Junius Annaeus, proconsul or “deputy” of Achaia at the time of the apostle Paul’s first visit to Corinth (53 a,d.), was the son of Μ. Annaeus Seneca, a Roman eques and rhetorician, and was born at Cordova about the beginning of the Christian era. His mother’s name was Helvia; and L. Annaeus Seneca, the philosopher, and L. Annaeus Mela, the geographer, were his full brothers, his own proper name being Marcus Annaeus Novatus. After he had received a careful education from his father at Cordova, he went to Rome, where he attracted the notice of L. Junius Gallio, a rhetorician of some repute, who ultimately adopted him, thus conferring the name by which he is usually known. The terms on which he lived with his kindred and with the world are well illustrated in the epithet “dulcis” applied to him by Statius (Silv., ii. 7, 32), and by Seneca (Nat. Qu., 4 pref.—“nemo mortalium uni tam dulcis est quam hic omnibus ”). It is probable that Gallio shared the misfortunes of his brother when the latter, having incurred the enmity of Messalina, was banished to Corsica; and that both returned together to Rome when Agrippina had selected Seneca to be tutor to Nero. Towards the close of the reign of Claudius, Gallio received the proconsulship of the newly constituted senatorial province of Achaia (Acts xviii. 12), but seems to have been compelled by ill health to resign the post within a few years (Pliny, H. N., xxxi. 33; Seneca, Hp. civ.). In the fifth year of Nero we hear of him as having been again in Rome (Dio Cassius, lxi. 20, 21), and on the same authority we learn that he finally became one of the last victims of that emperor (lxii. 25). The statement of Jerome in the chronicle of Eusebius, that Junius Gallio “frater Senecae, egregius declamator, propria se manu interfecit,” appears to be founded on a confusion of names. Seneca’s works, De Ira and De Vita Beata, are dedicated to Gallio, who himself appears to have written some treatises in natural history (Sen., N. Q., v. 11). Compare Tacitus, Ann., xv. 73; xvi. 17; Dio Cassius, lx. 35.
