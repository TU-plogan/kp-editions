GORI, in Georgia, an ancient fortress, is now the chief town of a district of the same name in the government of Tiflis, and a station on the Poti-Tiflis railroad. It is built at the foot of an isolated hill crowned by the old fortifications, in a luxuriantly fertile plain on the left bank of the Kour, at the junction of the Bleejah’va and Medjoura, 48 miles west of Tiflis. The population, about 5000, is almost exclusively Armenian, engaged in commerce. The women are noted for their beauty. This town, at one time celebrated for its silk and cotton stuffs, is now famous for corn, reputed the best in Georgia; the wine is also esteemed, 5200 acres being laid out in vineyards. The climate is excellent, delightfully cool in summer, owing to the refreshing breezes from the mountains of the great Caucasian range, which, however, are at times disagreeably felt in winter. Gori was founded (1123) by David II., “the Restorer,” for the Armenians who fled their country on the Persian invasion. The earliest remains of the fortress are Byzantine, but it was thoroughly restored in 1634-58, during the reign of Rustam, and destroyed by Nadir Shah. Besides the Armenian and Georgian churches, and some good schools, there is a church constructed in the 17th century by Capuchin missionaries from Rome. Gori was the birthplace (1773) of Stephàn Peshanegishvyly, a distinguished and popular poet. Eight miles from Gori is the remarkable rock-cut town of Ouplytz-tzykhè, consisting of several large dwellings having their interiors ornamented with mouldings, imitation beams, and designs sculptured in relief, and innumerable smaller habitations, the majority being divided into chambers with doorways, openings for light, and sundry provisions for domestic comfort. The ’whole have been hewn out of the solid rock, the groups being separated by streets, where steps for facilitating communication and grooves for water courses are cut. This “Fortress of Ouplytz” was projected and completed, according to the annals of Georgia, by Ouphlis, an immediate descendant of Noah (see Georgia). It was a fortress in the time of Alexander of Macedon, and an inhabited cityin the reign of Bagrat III. (980-1014).
