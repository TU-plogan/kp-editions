GIB, Adam (1714-1788), the leader of the Antiburgher section of the Scottish Secession Church, was born April 14, 1714, in the parish of Muckhart, Perthshire, and, on the completion of his literary and theological studies at Edinburgh and Perth, was licensed as a preacher in 1740. In the following year he was ordained minister of the large Secession congregation of Bristo, Edinburgh, being the first in the city inducted into such a charge; and there his powerful intellect and his intensity of character soon secured for him a position of considerable prominence. In 1742 he caused some stir by the publication of an invective entitled A learning against countenancing the ministrations of Mr George Whitefield', and in 1745 he was almost the only minister of Edinburgh who continued to preach, and to preach against rebellion, while the troops of Charles Edward were in occupation of the town. When in 1747 “the Associate Synod,” by a narrow majority, decided not to give full immediate effect to a judgment which had been passed in the previous year against the lawfulness of the “Burgess Oath,”^[1. This was an oath imposed upon all burgesses of Edinburgh, Glasgow, Perth, and some other towns, by which they “professed and allowed the true religion presently professed within this realm, and authorized by the laws thereof.” The question was whether these words implied an approbation of the Established Church, with all its “corruptions.”] Gib led the protesting minority, who forthwith separated from their brethren and formed the Antiburgher Synod. It was chiefly under his influence that it was agreed by this ecclesiastical body at subsequent meetings to summon to the bar their “Burgher” brethren, and finally to depose and excommunicate them for contumacy. In 1765 he made a vigorous and able reply to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, which had stigmatized the Secession as “threatening the peace of the country ;” and this apology was further developed in his Display of the Secession Testimony, published in 1774. From 1753 (when after protracted litigation he was compelled to leave the Bristo church) till within a short period of his death, which took place June 18, 1788, he preached regularly in Nicolson Street church, which is said to have been filled every Sunday with an audience of 2000 persons. Besides other publications, he wrote a volume of Sacred Contemplations (1786), to which was appended an “Essay on Liberty and Necessity” in reply to Lord Kames.
