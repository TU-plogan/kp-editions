GENNADIUS. Georgius Scholari or Scholarius, better known as Gennadius, a learned Greek and for some time patriarch of Constantinople, obtains a place in history through the important part played by him in the contest between Platonism and Aristoteliaoism which marks the transition from mediaeval to modern thought. Extremely little is known of his life, and so contradictory are some of the accounts bearing on detached facts in it that it has often been supposed there were two writers of the same name living at the same period. The researches of Renaudot seem, however, to render it approximately certain that all the historical notices we possess relate to one Scholarius, and that the apparent inconsistency in the accounts is due largely to a real change in that writer’s views. Scholarius first appears in history as assisting at the great council held in 1438 at Ferrara and Florence with the object of bringing about a union between the Greek and Latin Churches (see Eugenius IV., Bessaeion). At the same council was present the celebrated Platonist, George Gemistus Pletho, the most powerful opponent of the then dominant Aristotelianism, and consequently the special object of reprobation to Gennadius. In church matters, as in philosophy, the two were opposed,—Pletho maintaining strongly the principles of the Greek Church, and being unwilling to accept union through compromise, Gennadius, [9:10:154] more politic and cautiou3, pressing the necessity for union, and instrumental in drawing up a form which from its vagueness and ambiguity might be accepted by both parties. It would seem that at Florence Pletho published the work on the difference between Aristotle and Plato (see Gemistus) which afterwards called forth a reply from Gennadius. Of this reply only the fragments quoted by Pletho in his counter-argument {Contra Gennαdium) have been preserved. They show that Gennadius, though Aristotelian throughout, had an accurate knowledge of Aristotle, and wa3 more moderate than some of his contemporaries, e.y., George of Trebizond. The next appearance of Gennadius is in 1453. After the capture of Constantinople by the Turks, Mahomet, finding that the patriarchal chair had been vacant for some time, resolved to elect some one to the office. The choice fell on Scholarius, who is described as a layman. While holding the episcopal office Gennadius drew up, apparently for the use of Mahomet, a symbol or confession of faith, which is very valuable as the earliest expression of the principles of the Greek Church. He also at this time had the pleasure of condemning to the flames the great work of his old opponent Pletho, the treatise on Laιvs (Νό/ζοι), of which considerable fragments have come down to us. The character of this work was accurately apprehended by Gennadius (see his Letter to the Exarch Joseph, in Gass, as below), and his opposition to it is intelligible. After a short period of office at Constantinople Gennadius is said to have resigned the episcopal dignity and to have retired into a convent. The date of his death is unknown.

The fullest account of his writings is given in Gass (Hennαdvus and Pletho, 1844), the second part of which contains Pletho’s Contra Gennadiurn. See also F. Schultze, Gesch. der Phil. d. Renaissance, i., 1874. A list of the known writings of Gennadius is given in Fabricius, Bibliotheca Grceca, ed. Harless, vol. xi.
