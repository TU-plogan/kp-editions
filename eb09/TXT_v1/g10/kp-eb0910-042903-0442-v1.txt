GEORGE, known as Pisides or Pisida, a Byzantine writer of the 7th century, was, as his surname implies, a native of Pisidia; but of his personal history nothing is known except that he had been ordained a deacon, and that he held either simultaneously or successively the offices of “Chartophylax, n “Scenophylax,” and “Referendarius” in the “Great Church” (that of St Sophia) at Constantinople. He is also believed to have accompanied the first expedition (622) of the emperor Heraclius against the Persians; at all events his earliest work, consisting of 1098 iambic trimeter verses under the title ’Eiç τηv κaτa Hepσωv eκστpa-τeiav 'Αρaκλeioυ τov βaσ<λtως dκpoασeις rpeîs, is devoted to such a description of that campaign as could hardly have come from any other than an eye-witness. This composition was followed by the 'kβapικd or ∏0λ∈∕zoς Αβapικo<s in 541 verses, containing the details of a futile attack on Constantinople made by the Avari in 626, while the emperor was absent and the Persian army in occupation of Chalcedon; and by the 'Hpακλιας, a general survey of the exploits both at home and abroad of Heraclius down to the final overthrow of Chosroes in 627, which is believed to have been written before the end of 628. In addition to these three works, which have been edited by Bekker in the Corpus scriptorum histor. Byzant. (1836), we have from the pen of [9:10:430] George of Pisidia the ’Esasµepov ητoL Koσμoυpγia, a poem upon the creation of the world, containing in its present form 1910 trimeter iambic verses; a treatise on the vanity of life, ’Etç ⅛ µáratov βlov, in 262 verses; a controversial composition against Severus of Antioch, Kατα 3aeυηpoυ, in 731 verses; two short poems upon the resurrection of Christ and upon the temple of the Virgin at Blachernae respect ively, aud a prose encomium upon Anastasius the martyr, (*Eγκω∕Λtov eìç ròv aγιov Avaσ~τaσtov μaρτυpa). George of Pisidia is known to have written several other works, which, however, are no longer extant; and there is no suffi cient reason for assigning to him the compilation of the Chronicon Paschale, or the astronomical poem entitled Empedoclis Sphaera. The Hexaemeron and De Vanitate Vitee were first printed along with a Latin version at Paris in 1584 or 1585 by Federicus Morellus. They are also to be found in the Max. Bibliotheca Vett. Patrum, xii. p. 322 (1677); and in the 46th vol. of Migne’s Patrologia Graeca. The only complete edition of all the extant works is that of Quercus in Foggini’s Corp. Hist. Byzant. Nova Appendix (Rome, 1777). As a versifier George is correct and even elegant; as a chronicler of contemporary events he is exceedingly useful; but the modern verdict on his merits as a poet has not confirmed that of those later Byzantine writers whose enthusiastic admiration led them to compare him with and even prefer him to Euripides. Recent criticism is unanimous in characterizing his composition as artificial and almost uniformly dull.
