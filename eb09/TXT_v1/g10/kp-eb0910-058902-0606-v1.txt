GIESELER, Johann Karl Ludwig (1792-1854), one of the most distinguished of the modern school of scientific writers on church history, was born at Petershagen, near Minden, where his father, a man of considerable vigour and independence of character, was minister, on the 3d of March 1792. In his tenth year he entered the orphanage at Halle, whence he duly passed to the university, his studies being interrupted, however, from October 1813 till the peace of 1815 by a period of military service, during which he was enrolled as a volunteer in a regiment of chasseurs. Having in 1817 taken his degree in philosophy, he in the same year became assistant head master in the Minden gymnasium, and in 1818 was appointed conrector of the gymnasium at Cleves. Here he published his earliest work {Historischkritischer Versuch über die Entstehung u. die frühesten Schicksale der schriftlichen Evangelien'), a treatise which has had considerable influence on all subsequent investigations and discussions of the question as to the origin of the gospels, in so far as it may be considered to have finally disposed of that theory of a “primitive” written gospel to which most critics in the earlier part of the century had inclined. In 1819 Gieseler was appointed a professor ordinarius in theology in the newly-founded university of Bonn, where, besides lecturing on church history, he made important contributions to the literature of that subject in Rosenmuller’s Repertorium, Stäudlin u. Tschirner’s Archiv, and in various university “programs.” The first part of the first volume of his well-known Church History appeared in 1824. In 1833 he accepted a call to Göttingen, where the remainder of his life was spent, marked by few noteworthy events beyond the steady publication of volume after volume of his contributions to historical science. In 1837 he was appointed a consistorialrath, and shortly afterwards was created a knight of the Guelphic order. In the winter of 1853-4 symptoms of failing health began to appear, and towards the end of the session he was able to lecture only occasionally. His death occurred on the 8th of July 1854. The fourth and fifth volumes of the Kirchengeschichte, embracing the period subsequent to 1814, were published posthumously by Redepenning (1855); and they were followed in 1856 by a Dogmengeschichte, which is sometimes reckoned as the sixth volume of the Church History. Among church historians Gieseler continues to hold a very high place. Less vivid and picturesque in style than Hase, conspicuously deficient in Neander’s deep and sympathetic insight into the more spiritual forces by which church life is always more or less pervaded, he excels these and all other contemporaries in the fulness and accuracy of his information. His Lehrbuch der Kirchengeschichte, in which indeed the text as compared with the notes often occupies a very subordinate place, is invaluable to the student who wishes at each step to be brought into direct contact with all the original sources of information which it is of importance that he should know. The work, which has passed through several editions in Germany, has partially appeared also in two English translations. That published in New York {Text Book of Ecclesiastical History, 4 vols.), brings the work down to the peace of Westphalia, while that published in “Clark’s Theological Library” {Compendium of Ecclesiastical History, Edin., 5 vols.) closes with the beginning of the Reformation. For the life of Gieseler reference may be made to Redepenning’s biographical sketch in the fifth volume of the Kirchengesclιichte, and to Herzog’s article in the Real-Encycloρadie (of which great work, it may be mentioned, Gieseler was an energetic promoter). Both biographers testify that with the habits of a devoted student he combined those of an energetic man of business. He frequently held the office of pro-rector of the university, and did much useful work as a member of several of its committees. He took a warm interest also in the Göttingen orphanage, where he was a daily visitor, knew all the children personally, and taught them to regard him as a counsellor and friend.
