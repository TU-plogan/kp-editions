GARONNE, the ancient Garumna, a river of southern France, which rises in the Spanish Pyrenees not far front the massif of Maladetta, flows through the fine gorge called the Val d’ Aran, partly loses itself under the calcareous rocks that form the gulf of Clédes, enters France near the Pont du Roi, and proceeds in a general north-west direction till it falls into the Bay of Biscay. Rafts can be sent down the river from the Spanish frontier; boats can pass with the stream from the confluence of the Salat to Toulouse; from Toulouse downwards regular navigation with boats can be maintained; and seafaring vessels can sail up as far as Castets, 32 miles above Bordeaux. At Bee d’Ambes, near the confluence of the Dordogne, the river widens out to a breadth of from 2 to 4 miles, and takes the name of the Gironde, This estuary presents an almost uninterrupted succession of islands and banks, which divide it into two nearly equal branches, and render the navigation somewhat difficult. At the mouth stands the famous tower of Cordouan, which dates from 1584-1610, and ranks as one of the finest lighthouses on the coast of France. The current at Toulouse, when the water is at its lowest, amounts to 1271 cubic feet per second, but in the ordinary state of the river it is 5297 cubic feet. During ordinary flood it rises about 25 feet; but in exceptional cases, as in 1855 and 1856, this increases to 28 or even 30 feet, and as the banks of the river are low the inundations are very extensive. The principal affluents on the right are the Salat, the Ariége, the Tarn, the Lot, the Dropt, and the Dordogne; and on the left the Neste, the Bouge, the Save, the Gimoné, the Gers, the Baise, and the Ciron.
