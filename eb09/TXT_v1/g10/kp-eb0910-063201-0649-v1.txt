GLADIOLUS, a genus of monocotyledonous or endogenous plants, belonging to the natural order Iridaceoe, and representative of the tribe Gladioleoe, a group of bulbous plants in which the perianth is irregular, and the stamens unilateral and arched, with the filaments free. It belongs to a subdivision of the Gladioleoe, in which the segments of the limb of the perianth are very unequal, and is specially distinguished by having the perianth tube curved, funnel-shaped[9:10:633], and widening upwards, and by the segments equalling or exceeding the tube in length. About ninety species are described, of which number upwards of fifty are from the Cape, and the rest from tropical Africa, the central and southern regions of Europe, Persia, the Caucasus, and the Levant. One species, G. illyricus, is found apparently wild in England, in the New Forest, Hampshire. Some of the species have been cultivated for a long period in our flower-gardens, where both the introduced species and the modern varieties bred from them are very ornamental and popular. G. segetum has been cultivated since 1596, and G. byzantinus since 1629, while many additional species were introduced during the latter half of the 18th century. One of the earlier of the hybrids originated in gardens was the beautiful G. Colvillii, raised in the nursery of Mr Colvill of Chelsea in 1823 from G. concolor fertilized by G. cardinalis. In the first decade of the century, however, the Hon. and Rev. W. Herbert had successfully crossed the showy G. cardinalis with the smaller but more free-flowering G. blαndus, and the result was the production of a race of great beauty and fertility. Other crosses were made with G. tristis, G. οppositiflorus, G. hirsutus, G. alatus, and G. natalensis; but it was not till after the production of G. gandavensis about 1843, by the crossing of G. natalensis with G. oppositiβorus (sometimes erroneously attributed to natalensis and cαrdinalis y ), that the gladiolus may be said to have become a general favourite in gardens. Since that time the varieties have been greatly multiplied in number, and improved in size and quality, as well as marvellously varied in colour and marking, so that they have now become exceedingly popular. A few years since large numbers of novel varieties were annually introduced by the French florists, but the English-raised varieties are now in great measure superseding them. One cultivator, Mr Kelway of Langport, devotes a space of not less than 8 acres to gladioli, and cultivates annually from 10,000 to 60,000 each of some of the more popular kinds, while seedlings are raised to the extent of half a million a year. The seeds are sown in the open ground about April, glass culture with so large a number being out of the question; and in the first season the young plants make bulbs averaging the size of peas. The time occupied from the sowing of the seed until the plant attains its full strength is from three to four years. The approved sorts, which are identified by name, are multiplied by means of bulblets or offsets which form around the principal bulb or corm; but in this they vary greatly, some kinds furnishing abundant increase and soon becoming plentiful, while others persistently refuse to yield offsets. The stately habit and rich glowing colours of the modern gladioli render them exceedingly valuable as decorative plants during the late summer months. They are, moreover, very desirable and useful flowers for cutting for the purpose of room decoration, for while the blossoms themselves last fresh for some days, the undeveloped buds open in succession, if the stalks are kept in water, so that a cut spike will go on blooming for a considerable period.
