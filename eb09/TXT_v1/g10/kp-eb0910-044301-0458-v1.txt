GERHARD, Johann (1582-1637), one of the ablest and most learned exponents of Lutheran orthodoxy, was born of a good middle-class family in Quedlinburg, 17th October 1582. In his fifteenth year, during a dangerous illness, he came under the personal influence of Johann Arndt, author of Das Wahre Christenthτnn, and resolved to study for the church. Soon after entering the university of Wittenberg, however, in 1599, he began to waver in this determination, and ultimately gave himself for two years to the study of medicine, but in 1603 resumed his theological reading at Jena, and in the following year received a new impulse from Winkelmann and Mentzer at Marburg. Having graduated and begun to give lectures at Jena in 1605, he in 1606 received and accepted the duke of Coburg’s invitation to the superintendency of Heldburg and mastership of the gymnasium; soon afterwards he became general superintendent of the duchy, in which capacity he was much and usefully engaged in the practical work of ecclesiastical organization until 1616, when he found a more congenial sphere in the senior theological chair at Jena, where the remainder of his life was spent. Though still comparatively young, Gerhard had already come to be regarded as the greatest living theologian of Protestant Germany; in the numerous “disputations” which characterized that period he was always protagonist, while on all public and domestic questions touching on religion or morals his advice was eagerly sought on all hands and by every class. It is recorded that during the course of his lifetime he had received repeated calls to almost every university in Germany, as well as to Upsala in Sweden. He died on the 20th August 1637. Personally he is said to have exhibited a rare combination of all the best elements of the Christian character; the only failing imputed to him by any one decidedly leans to virtue’s side—an excessive love of peace.

His writings are very numerous, alike in exegetical, polemical, dogmatic, and. practical theology. To the first category belong the Commentarius in harmoniam historiae evangelicae de passione Christi (1617), the Comment, super priorem D. Petri Epistolam (1611), and also his commentaries on Genesis (1637) and on Deuteronomy (1658). Of a controversial character are the Confessio Catholica (1634-68), an extensive work which seeks to prove the evangelical and catholic character of the doctrine of the Augsburg Confession from the writings of approved Roman Catholic authors; and the Loci theologici (1629),∙ his principal contribution to science, in which Lutheranism is expounded “nervose, solide, et copiose,” in fact with a fulness of learning, a force of logic, and a minuteness of detail that had never before been approached. The Meditationes sacrae (1621), a work expressly devoted to the uses of Christian edification, has been frequently reprinted in Latin and has been translated into most of the European languages, including Greek. The English translation by R. Winterton (1631) has passed through at least nineteen editions. There is also an edition by W. Papillon in English blank verse (1801). A Vita Joh. Gerhardt was published by E. R. Fischer in 1723.
