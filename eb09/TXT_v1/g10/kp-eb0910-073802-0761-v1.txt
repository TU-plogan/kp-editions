GOGO, or Ghoghâ, a town in Λhmadabad district, Bombay, 193 miles north-west of Bombay. About three-quarters of a mile east of the town is an excellent anchorage, in some measure sheltered by the island of Perim, which lies still further east. The natives of this are reckoned the best sailors in India; and ships touching here may procure water and supplies, or repair damages. It is a safe refuge during the south-west monsoon, or for vessels that have parted from their anchors in the Surat roads, the bottom being an entire bed of mud, three-quarters of a mile from the shore, and the water always smooth. Gogo has of late years lost its commercial importance. Its rival, Bhaunagar, is 8 miles nearer to the cotton districts. North of the town is a black salt marsh, extending to the Bhaunagar creek. On the other sides is undulating cultivated land, sloping to the range of hills 12 miles off. South of the town there is another salt marsh. The land in the neighbourhood is inundated at high spring tides, which renders it necessary to bring fresh water from a distance of 4 or 5 miles. The average annual value of the exports for five years ending 1871-72 was £56,227 and of the imports £103,083. Population (1872), 9571.
