GOLDEN BULL (Latin, Bulla Aurea) is, in general, the designation of any charter decorated with a golden seal or bulla, either from the intrinsic importance of its contents, or from the rank and dignity of the bestower or the recipient. The custom of thus giving distinction to certain documents is said to be of Byzantine origin, though if this be the case it is somewhat strange that the word employed as an equivalent for golden bull in Byzantine Greek should be the hybrid χρνσόβουλλον {cf Codinus Curopalates, ό μ,eγας λογοθέτης διατάττει το. παρά του βασιλέως aπoστeλλoμeνa προστάγματα και χρυσό βουλλα προς τe 'Ρήγας, 2οΰλτανα?, καί τοπάρχονς; and Anna Comnena, Alexiad, lib. iii., διά ^χpυσoβoυλloυ λόγου j lib. viii., χρυσόβουλον λόγον). In Germany a Golden Bull is mentioned under the reign of Henry I. in Chronica C assin., ii. 31, and the oldest German example, if it be genuine, dates from 983. At first the golden seal was formed after the type of a solid coin, but at a later date, while the golden surface presented to the eye was greatly increased, the seal was really composed of two thin metal plates filled in with wax. The number of golden bulls issued by the imperial chancery must have been very large; the town of Frankfort, for example, still preserves no fewer than eight. But the name has become practically restricted to a few documents of unusual political importance, the golden bull of the Empire, the golden bull of Brabant, the golden bull of Hungary, and the golden bull of Milan—and of these the first is undoubtedly the golden bull par excellence.

It was drawn up under the direction of the emperor Charles IV., and it was formally ratified in 1356,—the first twenty-three chapters by the diet of Nuremberg (10th January), and the remaining seven by the diet of Metz (25th December). The actual redaction has been assigned to Bartolus de Saxoferrato, to Rudolf of Friedberg the imperial secretary, and even to the emperor himself; but there is no distinct authority for any of the three hypotheses as opposed to the others. A brief statement of the general purpose of its enactments has already been given at page 495 of the present volume. The exordium is a strangely rhetorical lamentation over the miseries of division, and more especially of a kingdom divided against itself; and the body of the document gives a survey of the duties, privileges, and relations of the various dignitaries of the empire, the emperor, the electors ecclesiastical and secular, the electoral plenipotentiaries, and the officers of the court. As might almost be expected, a large place is given to rules of ceremony and etiquette. At first the document was known simply as the Lex Carolina; but by and by the name of the Book with the Golden Bull came into use, and the present elliptical title was sufficiently established by 1417 to be officially employed in a charter by King Sigismund. The original autograph was committed to the care of the electoral prince of Mainz, as chancellor-in-chief of the empire, and it was preserved in the imperial archives at Mainz till 1789. Official transcripts were probably furnished to each of the seven electors at the time of the promulgation, and before long many of the other members of the empire secured copies for themselves. The transcript which belonged to the elector of Treves is preserved in the state archives at Stuttgart, that of the elector of Cologne in the court library at Darmstadt, and that of the elector of Bohemia in the imperial archives at Vienna. Berlin, Munich, and Dresden also boast the possession of an electoral transcript; and the town of Kitzingen has a contemporary copy in its municipal archives. There appears, however, to be good reason to doubt the genuineness of most of these so-called original transcripts. But perhaps the best known example is that of Frankfort-on-the-Main, which was procured from the imperial chancery in 1366, and is adorned with a golden seal like the original. Not only was it regularly quoted as the indubitable authority in regard to the election of the emperors in Frankfort itself, but it was from time to time officially consulted by members of the empire.

The manuscript consists of 43 leaves of parchment of medium quality, each measuring about 10∣ inches in height by 7⅛ in breadth. The seal is of the plate and wax type. On the obverse appears a figure of the emperor seated on his throne, with the sceptre in his right hand and the globe in his left; a shield, with the crowned imperial eagle, occupies the space on the one side of the throne, and a corresponding shield, with the crowned Bohemian lion with two tails, occupies the space on the other side; and round the margin runs the legend, Kαrolus quartus divina favente clementia, Romanorum imperator semper Augustus et Boemiae rex. On the reverse is a castle, with the words Aurea Roma on the gate, and the circumscription reads, Roma caput Mundi Regit orbis frena rotundi. The original Latin text of the bull was printed at Nuremberg by Creussner in 1474, and a second edition by Kobergen appeared at the same place in 1477. Since that time it has been frequently reprinted from various manuscripts and collections. Goldastus gave the Palatine text, compared with those of Bohemia and Frankfort, in his Collectio Constitutionum Imperialium, tom. i. Another is to be found in Onuphrius Panvinius, De Comitiis Imperii, and as an appendix to Cujacius, De feudis∙, and a third, of unknown history, is prefixed to the Codex Recessuum Imperii, printed at Mainz in 1599, and again in 1615. The Frankfort text appeared in 1742— Aurca Bulla secundum exemplar originale Frankfurtense —from the pen of Wolfgang Ch. Multz. German translations, none of which, however, had any official authority, were published at Nuremberg, 1474(?); at Venice, Johannus Jenson, 1476; and at Strasburg, Joh. Preussen, 1485. Among the earlier commentators· of the document are Buxtorf, Dominicus Arumaeus, Martinus Rumelius, H. Caninius, G. T. Dietrich, Ostermann, Speidelius, and Limnaeus {In Auream bullam, Strasburg, 1662). The student will find a good account of the older literature of the subject in Biener, Commentarii de origine et progressu legum Germanicarum, 1787 (vol. ii.); and, besides the important work of Ohlen-schlager, Neue Erläuterungen der Güldener Bulla, Frankfort and Leipsic, 1766, he may consult H. G. Thülemarius, De bulla aurea argentea, &c., Heidelberg, 1682 (which gives the Frankfort text of the bull of Charles IV., a golden bull of Andronicus of Constantinople, the Bulla Brabantina, and the capitulation of Maximilian II.); Pütters, Staatsverfassung des deutschen Reichs, Gottingen, 1788; Pfister, Geschichte der Deutschen, Hamburg, 1831 (vol. iii.); and Stobbe, Gcsch. der Deutschen Rechtsquellen, Brunswick, 1860. A learned article on “Goldene Bulle,” by H. Brandes, will be found in Erseh and Gmber - s Encyclopädie, 1861.
