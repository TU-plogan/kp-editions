GOLDINGEN, in Lettish Kuldiga, a district town of the Russian province of Courland, in 50° 58' N. lat. and 11° 58' E. long., 85 miles W.N.λV. of Mittau, on the left bank of the Windau, which forms a beautiful waterfall— the Rummel—in the neighbourhood. On the Schlossberg or Castlelιill are a few remains of the foundations of what in the end of the 18th century was the most magnificent ruin in Courland, and in the 17th century had been the palatial residence of the dukes. The town is beautifully built; and it possesses a Lutheran church dating from 1606, and a Catholic church five years older, a hospital and two almshouses, two benevolent societies, founded respectively in 1836 and 1839, and a society of rural economy. Brushmaking is the only local industry of much importance. In 1861 the population was 5475 (2764 males), of whom the greater proportion were Lutherans, 1551 being Jews, 360 Roman Catholics, and 290 members of the Greek Church; but according to the St Petersburg Calendar for 1878 it has diminished to 4758. The castle of Goldingen was founded in 1249 by Dietrich of Groningen, and in 1347 the town received its first charter of privileges from Goswin von Gerike, master of the Teutonic order. It has been a district town since 1795.
