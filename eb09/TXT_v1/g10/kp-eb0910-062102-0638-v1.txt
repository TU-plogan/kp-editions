GIRARDIN, Madame Émile de, a French authoress, was born at Aix-la-Chapelle, January 26, 1804, and died at Paris June 29, 1855. Her maiden name was Delphine Gay, and her mother, the well-known Madame Sophie Gay, brought her up in the midst of that brilliant literary society of which she was afterwards a conspicuous ornament. In 1822 she obtained peculiarly honourable mention from the Academy for a poem on the Devotion of the Sisters of Sainte Camille at the Siege of Barcelona ; and not long after she published two volumes of miscellaneous pieces, Essais jyoetiques (1824) and Nouveaux essais poétiques (1825). A visit to Italy in 1827, during which she was enthusiastically welcomed by the literati of Rome and even crowned in the capitol, was productive of various poems, of which the most ambitious was Napoline (1833). Her marriage in 1831 to M. Émile Girardin opened up a new literary career. The contemporary sketches which she contributed from 1836 to 1839 to the feuilleton of La Presse, under the nom de plume of Charles Delaunay, were collected under the title of Lettres Parisiennes (1843), and obtained a success which has proved as permanent as it was brilliant. But it was to more elaborate efforts that the authoress would have preferred to entrust her reputation, and she indeed confesses, in a half serious half mocking mood, that it was almost a disappointment to find herself famous for so slight a thing. To the close of her life she continued to appear both as a novelist and as a writer for the stage, and in both departments she reaped a wide popularity through the wit and emotional force of her productions. Contes Tune vieille fille a ses neveux (1832), La canne de Monsieur de Balzac (1836), and II ne faut pas jouer avec la douleur (1853) are among the best known of her romances; and her dramatic pieces include H École des journalistes (1840), Judith (1843), Cleopatre (1847), C ’ est la faute du mam (1851), Lady Tartufe (1853), Lajoie fait peur (1854), Le chapeau Tun horloger (1854), and Une femme qui déteste son mari, which did not appear till after the author’s death. In the literary society of her time Madame Girardin exercised no small personal influence, and among the frequenters of her drawing-room were Gautier and Balzac, Alfred de Musset and Victor Hugo. During the latter years of her life a pensive melancholy gathered round her: for long years she had prayed the prayer of Hannah, and her woman’s heart had not been comforted. Her collected works were published in six volumes, 1860-1861.
