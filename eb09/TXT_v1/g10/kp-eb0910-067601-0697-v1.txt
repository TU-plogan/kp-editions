GLAUCHAU, one of the most important manufacturing towns of Saxony, circle of Zwickau, is situated on the right bank of the Mulde, 7 milee north of Zwickau and 17 west of Chemnitz. It is the seat of a royal administrative commission, of a district court, and of the ecclesiastical and secular courts of the countship of Schönburg. Its principal manufactures are woollen and half-woollen goods, in regard ta which it occupies the first position in Germany. ’ Besides 3000 hand-looms and 1000 power-looms in the town, the trade gives employment to many others in the neighbouring districts. There are also dyeworks, print works, and manufactories of paper, linen, thread, and machinery. Glauchau possesses a real school, an elementary school, a weaving school of the higher grade, an orphanage, and an infirmary. Some portions of the extensive old castle date from the 12 th century, and the Gottesacker church contains interesting antiquarian relics. Glauchau was founded by a colony of S0rb3 and Wends, and belonged to the lords of Schön burg as early as the 12th century. The mineralogist Agricola was born at Glauchau in 1494. While the population in 1834 was only 6292, it was 14,357 in 1858 and 21,743 in 1875.
