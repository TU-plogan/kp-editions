GLANVILL, or Glanvil, Joseph (1636-1680), was born at Plymouth in 1636, and was educated at Oxford university, where he graduated as M.A. in 1658. In 1666 he obtained the cure of Abbey Church at Bath; in 1678 he became prebendary of the church of Worcester, and acted as chaplain in ordinary to Charles II. He died at Bath, November 16, 1680, in the forty-fourth year of his age. Glanvill’s first work, The Vanity of Dogmatizing, or Confidence in Opinions, manifested in a Discourse of the shortness and uncertainty of our Knowledge, and its Causes, ιvith Reflexions on Peripateticism, and an Apology for Philosophy, 1661, is interesting as showing one special direction in which the new method of the Cartesian philosophy might be developed. Pascal had already shown how philosophical scepticism might be employed as a bulwark for faith, and Glanvill follows in the same track. The philosophic endeavour to cognize the whole system of things by referring all events to their causes appears to him to be from the outset doomed to failure. For if we inquire into this causal relation we find that though we know isolated facts, we cannot perceive any such connexion between them as that the one should give rise to the other. In the words of Hume, “they seem conjoined but never connected.” All causes then are but secondary, are merely the occasions on which the one first cause operates. It is singular enough that Glanvill who had not only shown, but even exaggerated, the infirmity of human reason, himself paid a strange tribute to its weakness; for, after having combated scientific dogmatism, he not only yielded to vulgar superstitions, but actually endeavoured to accredit them both in his Scepsis Scientifica, 1665, and in his Philosophical Considerations concerning the [existence of Sorcerers and Sorcery, published in 1666, in 4to. The story of the pretended drum, which was said to have been heard every night in the house of an inhabitant of Wiltshire (Mr Mompesson), a story which made much noise in the year 1663, and which is supposed to have furnished Addison with the idea of his comedy of the Drummer, appears to have given occasion to the latter work. At his death Glanvill left a piece entitled Saddιιcismτιs Triumphatus, which was printed in 1681, reprinted with some additions in 1682, and translated into German in 1701. He had there collected twenty-six relations or stories of the same description as that of the drum, in order to establish, by a series of facts, the opinion which he had expressed in his Philosophical Considerations. Glanvill supported a much more honourable cause when he undertook the defence of the Royal Society of London, under the title of Plus Ultra, or the Progress and Advancement of Science since the time of Aristotle, 1658, a work which shows how thoroughly he was imbued with the ideas of the empirical method as in Bacon. The style of Glanvill is clear, easy, and animated; and to the student of philosophy his works are of considerable interest.

Besides the works already noticed, Glanvill wrote—Lux Orientalis, 1662; Philosophia Pia, or Discourse on the Religious Character, and the Tendency of Experimental Philosophy; Essays on Several Important Subjects in Philosophy and Religion, 1676; An Essay Concerning Preaching; and Sermons. After his death in 1681, there were published other sermons, &c., in one volume 4to. See Rémusat, Hist, de la Phil, en Angleterre, bk. iii. ch. xi.
