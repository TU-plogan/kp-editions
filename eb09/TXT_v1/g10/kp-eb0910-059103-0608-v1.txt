GILBERT, Nicolas Joseph Laurent (1751—1780), a French poet, was born at Fontenay-le-Chateau in Lorraine, in 1751. Having completed his education at the college of Dôle, he devoted himself for a time to a half scholastic half literary life at Nancy, but at length in 1774 he found his way to the capital. As he had already assumed a hostile and satirical position towards the Encyclopedists, he naturally received a warmer welcome from the conservative party; [9:10:592] and as he did not disdain to prostitute his muse to the celebration of the heroic and royal virtues of the despicable Louis XV., he was rewarded with pensions to a considerable amount. He died in October 1780 from the results of a fall from his horse. The satiric force of one or two of his pieces, as Mon apologie (1778), and Le dix-huitième siècle (1775), would alone be sufficient to preserve his reputation, and it has been further increased by the eulogies of those modern writers who, like Alfred de Vigny, consider him a victim to the spite of his philosophic opponents.

Among his other works may be mentioned Les Familles de Darius et d'Éridame, histoire persane (1770), Le Carnaval des Auteurs (1773), Odes nouvelles et patriotiques (1775). Gilbert’s Oeuvres complètes were first published in 1778, and they have since been edited by Mastrella (Paris, 1823) and by Charles Nodier (1840, 1859, &c. ).
