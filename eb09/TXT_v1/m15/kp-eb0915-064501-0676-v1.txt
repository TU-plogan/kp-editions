MAXIMILIAN II. (1527-1576), holy Roman emperor, son and successor of Ferdinand I., was born at Vienna on the 1st of August 1527. He was of a mild and tolerant disposition, and in youth received a favourable impression of Protestantism from his tutor, Wolfgang Severus,—an impression which was not effaced by a residence of three years at the Spanish court. In 1562 he became king of Bohemia and king of the Romans, in 1563 king of Hungary, and in 1564 emperor. At the time of his accession to the imperial throne Hungary was at war with Turkey. The sultan Soliman II. was conciliated by the cession of all the territories he had conquered in Hungary, and by the promise of a yearly tribute of 300,000 florins. Soon afterwards Soliman renewed the war on behalf of the prince of Transylvania; but after his death in 1566 his successor, Selim, concluded with Maximilian an armistice of eight years. Maximilian’s brothers, Ferdinand and Charles, fought incessantly against Protestantism in their respective lands; but it was tolerated by Maximilian in Austria, Bohemia, and Hungary. His authority, however, was greatly limited by the influence of the Jesuits. He died on the 12th of October 1576. Of his eight children (six sons and two daughters) two—Rudolph II. and Matthias—became emperors.

. MAXIMILIAN (1832-1867), archduke of Austria (Ferdinand Maximilian Joseph) and emperor of Mexico, was the second son of the archduke Francis Charles, and was born in Vienna on July 6, 1832. He was trained for the navy, and ultimately attained a high command in that branch of his country’s service. In February 1857 he was appointed governor of the Lombardo-Venetian kingdom, and in the same year he married the Princess Charlotte, daughter of Leopold I., king of the Belgians. On the outbreak of the war of 1859, he retired into private life, chiefly at Trieste, until 1863, when at the instance of Napoleon III. he accepted the crown which had been offered to him by the notables of Mexico. He landed at Vera Cruz on May 28, 1864, but from the commencement of his reign found himself involved in difficulties of the most serious kind, which in 1866 made apparent to almost every one outside of Mexico the necessity for his abdicating. This, however, he declined to do. Withdrawing, in February 1867, to Querétaro, he there sustained a siege for several weeks, but on May 15 resolved to attempt an escape through the enemy’s lines. He was, however, arrested before he could carry out this resolution, and, after trial by court martial, was condemned to death. The sentence was carried out on June 19, 1867. His remains were conveyed to Vienna, where they were buried in the imperial vault early in the following year. See Mexico. Maximilian’s papers were published in 1867 in seven volumes, under the title Aus meinem Leben, Reiseskizzen, Aphorismen, &c.
