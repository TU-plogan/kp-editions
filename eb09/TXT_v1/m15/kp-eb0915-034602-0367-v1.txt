MALVERN, Great, a watering-place of Worcestershire, England, beautifully situated on the eastern slope of the Malvern hills, 8 miles south-west by south of Worcester, and 120 north-west by west of London. The town is irregularly built, but there are many villas, and on account of its fine situation in the centre of the Chase of Malvern, its pure air, and its chalybeate and bituminous springs, it is much frequented by summer visitors. At Malvern a hermitage was endowed by Edward the Confessor, which after the Conquest was changed into a Benedictine priory. Of the buildings, which date from 1083, there still remain the abbey gate, and also the church (partly rebuilt in the reign of Henry VII., and restored since 1861), a very fine structure, Norman and Perpendicular, with square embattled tower. There is a proprietary college, founded in 1863. At Little Malvern, about 3 miles south of Great Malvern, there was a Benedictine priory, founded in 1171, upon the site of which the dwelling-house of Malvern Court has been erected, preserving the tower and chancel of the old priory church. At Malvern Wells, 2 miles south of Malvern, is the celebrated “Holy Well,” the water of which is of perfect purity. The population of Malvern in 1871 was 5693, and in 1881 it was 5847.
