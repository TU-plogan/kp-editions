MANLEY, Mary de la Rivier (1672-1724), dramatist, political writer, and novelist, the most eminent female “wit” of the reign of Queen Anne, was the daughter of a studious and literary royalist, Sir Roger Manley, governor of the Channel Islands, part author of The Turkish Spy., and author of several military histories. Mrs Manley is herself the chief authority for such particulars of her private life as are known. Towards the close of Anne’s reign, finding that Curll had announced The Adventures of Rivella, or the History of the Author of Atalantis, and suspecting this to be the work of an enemy, she contrived with dexterous tact to supplant Curll’s author, and wrote her own biography under the announced title. Her mother died when she was a child, her father when she was a girl [9:15:492] of sixteen. A kinsman, already married, took advantage of her position, went through a mock ceremony of marriage, and deserted her basely three years afterwards. She was patronized for a short time by the duchess of Cleveland, and in 1696 made good a position among writers of established reputation by two plays, a comedy and a tragedy. The dialogue of the comedy, The Lost Lover, is extremely brilliant and witty, overflowing with high animal spirits; in freedom of speech it goes almost beyond the most licentious male writers of comedy in that generation. The play was at once published. In the preface she thanks the town for not keeping her long in suspense: her comedy was damned with promptitude. A similar fate befel her tragedy, The Royal Mischief, though great literary power was shown in it. The splendid energy of the characters, and the hyperbolical vigour of their language, may be compared with the undisciplined youth of the Elizabethan drama; but it was not without reason that even contemporary critics complained of the “warmth” of certain passages. She pleaded in defence the example of Dryden; but Dryden in his most indecent moments falls short of it. From 1696 Mrs Manley was a favourite member of witty and fashionable society; she admits that she never had any pretensions to beauty, but the charms of her eyes and her conversation made her very fascinating. She achieved her principal triumph as a writer by her Secret Memoirs of Several Persons of Quality, a scandalous chronicle “from the New Atalantis, an island in the Mediterranean,” published in 1709. Henceforth she was known as “the author of Atalantis.” The Atalantis had a political purpose. Mrs Manley was a warm Tory partisan, and she sought in this scandalous narrative to expose the private vices of the ministers whom Swift, Bolingbroke, and Harley combined to drive from office. There are many references to her in Swift’s Journal to Stella. “She has very good principles for one of her sort, and a great deal of good sense and invention.” Mrs Manley was in fact one of the most romantically public-spirited and disinterested politicians of that corrupt time, and next to Swift the most effective writer on the side of Harley and Bolingbroke. During the keen political campaign in 1711 she wrote several pamphlets, and many numbers of the Examiner, criticizing persons and policy with equal vivacity. After the accession of George, she wrote a tragedy Lucius (1717)—a failure, and two so-called novels, Bath Intrigues, and A Stage-Coach Journey to Exeter. The story in these novels is told in letters between the principal characters.
