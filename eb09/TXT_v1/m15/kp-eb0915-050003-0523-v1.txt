MANSUR, Mansoor, or more properly, with the article, Al-Mansur, “the victorious,” a surname (lakab') assumed by not a few Mohammedan princes. Among the personages commonly referred to by this title the following may be noticed.

1. Abu Ja'far ibn Mohammed, second caliph of the house of 'Abbas, who reigned 754-775 a.d. See Mohammedan Empire.

2. Abù Tâhir Isma'il ibn Al-Kâim, third Fatimite caliph of Africa (946-953). Under Al-Kâim, his father, the Fatimites, already weakened by their conflict with the Omayyads of Spain, were threatened with utter ruin by a Berber rising under Abù Yezid, a poor nonconformist (Tbâdi) schoolmaster, who appeared as a religious reformer, and gathered round him the Sunnites, who detested the Fatimites. In 944 Abιi Yezid conquered the capital Kairawân, and recognized the spiritual headship of the Spanish caliph. While the Spanish caliph and his vassals stripped the Fatimite of his remoter possessions, Abd Yezid pressed him at home, and during the siege of Susa Al-Kâim died, and was succeeded by Al-Mansdr. Then the fortunes of war rapidly turned. Abd Yezid alienated many of his followers by lapsing into habits of arrogant luxury and by treachery towards the Sunnites. At length he lost all he had won, fell into the hands of Al-Mansdr, and was put to death (947). The caliph built the city of Man-sdriyah on the field of the decisive battle and made it hi.s residence; the empire was rapidly restored, and the Spanish vassals driven from Africa. Al-Mansdr died at Mansdri-yah, and was succeeded by Al-Mo'izz, the conqueror of Egypt (see vol. vii. p. 750 sg ’.).

3. Ibn Abi 'Amir Mohammed, commonly called Almanzor by European writers, of an ancient but not illustrious Arab family, which had its seat at Torroχ near Algeciras, was born 939 a.d., and began life as a lawyer at Cordova. In 967 he obtained a place at the court of Hakam II., the Andalusian caliph, and by an unusual combination of the talents of a courtier with administrative ability and address in dealing with men, rapidly rose to distinction, enjoying in particular the powerful support of Subh, the favourite of the caliph and mother of his heir Hisliâm. On the death of Hakam (976) the accession of a minor gave fresh scope to the genius of Ibn Abi 'Amir, who threaded his way with consummate but unscrupulous talent through the intrigues of the court, and in 978 became prime minister. He now aimed at absolute dominion. The weak young caliph, absorbed in exercises of piety, was easily reduced to a cipher, but at first Ibn Abi 'Amir had to share the power with his father-in-law Ghâlib, the best general of Andalusia, and his chief aid, along with the mother of Hishâm, in the steps that had raised him to power. At last a rupture took place between the two ministers, and ended in a war in which Ghâlib professed himself the champion of the caliph and called in the aid of the Christians of Leon. But his rival had anticipated the struggle; he had long before found means to add military to administrative reputation, and since he rose to the direction of affairs had remodelled the army so as to make it more formidable and more devoted to his cause. Ghâlib fell in battle (981); a victorious campaign chastised the Leonese; and on his return to Cordova the victor assumed the regal surname of Λl-Mansûr billah, and became practically sovereign of Andalusia. The caliph was a mere prisoner of state, holding a nominal dignity, and Al-Mansxrr ultimately assumed the title as well as the prerogatives of king (996). Unscrupulous in the means by which he rose to power, he wielded the sovereignty nobly. His strict justice and the enlightened excellence of his internal administration were not less notable than his military prowess. But it is by the latter that he is best known. His arms were the terror of the Christians, and raised the Moslem power in Spain to a pitch it had never before attained. He fought more than [9:15:501] fifty campaigns, all glorious, and destroyed many cities, including the three capitals of Leon, Pampeluna, and Barcelona, and the sacred shrine of Santiago de Compostella. In Africa his armies were for a time hard pressed by the revolt of Ziri, viceroy of Mauretania, but before his death this enemy had also fallen. Al-Mansür died at Medinaceli 10th August 1002, and was succeeded by his son Modaffar.^[1. His life is brilliantly described in vol. iii. of Dozy, Histoire des Μusιιlmans d'Espagne.]

4. Abd Ydsuf Ya'kdb ibn Yusuf (Jacob Almanzor), of the Moorish dynasty of the Almohades, the conqueror of Alphonse» III. in the great battle of Alarcos (1195), reigned 1184-99.
