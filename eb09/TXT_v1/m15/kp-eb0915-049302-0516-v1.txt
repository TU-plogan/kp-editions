MANNHEIM, the most populous town and the second capital of the grand-duchy of Baden, lies on the right bank of the Rhine, in the triangular piece of low-lying ground enclosed between that river and the Neckar. It [9:15:494] is the most regularly built town in Germany, consisting of twelve parallel streets intersected at right angles by ten others, which cut it up into about 130 square sections of equal size. These blocks are distinguished, after the American fashion, by letters and numerals. Except on the south side all the streets debouch on the promenade, which forms a circle round the town on the site of the old ramparts. Outside this ring are the suburbs of Schwetz-inger Garten to the south and Neckargärten to the north. Mannheim is connected by a handsome bridge with Ludwigshafen, a rapidly growing commercial and manufacturing town on the left bank of the Rhine, in Bavarian territory. The Neckar is spanned by a suspension bridge. In 1880 Mannheim contained 53,545 inhabitants, of whom about 4500 were Jews, and the rest Roman Catholics and Protestants in nearly equal proportions. Ludwigshafen contained 15,012 inhabitants.

Nearly the whole of the south-west side of the town is occupied by the palace, built in 1720-29, and formerly the residence of the elector of the Palatinate. It is one of the largest buildings of the kind in Germany, covering an area of 15 acres, and having a frontage of 650 yards. The left wing was totally destroyed by the bombardment of 1795, but has since been restored. The palace contains a picture gallery and collections of natural history and antiquities. The large and beautiful garden at the back forms the public park of the town. Among the other prominent buildings are the theatre, the arsenal, the synagogue, the “kaufhaus,” the town-hall, the railway station, and the observatory. The only noteworthy church is that of the old Jesuit college, the interior of which is lavishly decorated with marble and painting. The square in front of the theatre is embellished with statues of Schiller, Iffland the actor, and Dalberg, intendant of the theatre in the time of Schiller. Mannheim is the chief commercial town on the upper Rhine, and yields in importance to Coblentz and Cologne alone among the lower Rhenish towns. The staple commodities of its trade are tobacco, grain, petroleum, hops, timber, and coffee. Its new harbour, constructed at a cost of £650,000, and measuring 2300 yards in length, is the most extensive inland harbour in Germany. It is entered annually by 3000 river craft, carrying nearly 700,000 tons of goods. The railway goods station and warehouses in connexion with the harbour cover 400 acres of ground. The principal industrial products of Mannheim are machinery, iron, brass, india-rubber, sugar, mirrors, chemicals, wall-paper, and cigars. The manufactories of Ludwigshafen produce aniline dyes, soda, tartaric acid, alum, artificial manures, and lime. Mannheim is the seat of the central board for the navigation of the Rhine, of a chamber of commerce, and of the supreme court of Baden. Ten or twelve different countries are represented here by their consuls. The schools and public institutions of Mannheim include a gymnasium, a “realschule,” an industrial school, a high school for girls, a public library, a large poorhouse, three hospitals, and an orphanage.

History. — The name of Mannheim was connected with its present site as early as the 8th century, when a small village belonging to the abbey of Lorsch lay in the marshy district between the Neckar and the Rhine. To the south of this village, on the Rhine, was the castle of Eicholzheim, which acquired some celebrity as the place of confinement assigned to Pope John XXIII. by the council of Constance. The history of the modern Mannheim begins, however, with the opening of the 17th century, when Elector John Frederick IV. founded a town here, which he peopled chiefly with Protestant refugees from Holland. The strongly fortified castle which he erected at the same time had the unfortunate result of making the infant town an object of contention in the Thirty Years’ War, during which it was five times taken and retaken. In 1689 Mannheim, which had in the meantime recovered from its former disasters, was captured by the French under Melac, and ruthlessly destroyed. Ten years later it was rebuilt on an extended scale and provided with fortifications. For its subsequent importance it was indebted to Elector Charles Philip, who, owing to ecclesiastical disputes, transferred his residence from Heidelberg to Mannheim in 1720. It remained the capital of the Palatinate for nearly sixty years. In 1794 Mannheim fell into the hands of the French, and in the following year it was retaken by the Austrians after a severe bombardment, which left scarcely a single building uninjured. In 1802 it was assigned to the grand-duke of Baden, who caused the fortifications to be razed. Ludwigshafen, originally only the tête· du·pont of Mannheim, received its present name in 1843, and became a town in 1859. Towards the end of last century Mannheim attained great celebrity in the literary world as the place where Schiller’s early plays were performed for the first time. It was at Mannheim that Kotzebue was assassinated in 1819.
