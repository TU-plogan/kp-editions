MEMMINGEN, a town of Bavaria, in the district ol Schwaben and Neuburg, is situated about 35 miles to the south-west of Augsburg, near the river Hier. It is a well-built town, still partly surrounded with walls, and contains a Roman Catholic and three Protestant churches, a townhouse of 1580, and several schools and charitable institutions. Its industrial products are yarn, calico, woollen goods, and thread. A considerable trade is carried on in hops, which are extensively cultivated in the neighbourhood, and in wool, leather, and grain. The population in 1880 was 8050.

Memm⅛gen, first mentioned in a document of 1010, belonged originally to the Guelph family. In 1286 it became a free city of the empire, a position which it maintained down to 1802, when it was allotted to Bavaria. In 1529 Memmingen was one of the “protesting[9:15:847]” towns represented at the diet of Spires. During tho Thirty Years’ War it was alternately occupied by Swedes and Imperialists. In 1800 the French under Moreau gained a victory over the Austrians near Memmingen. Compare Dobel, Memmingen im Reformations Zeitalter, 1877-78.
