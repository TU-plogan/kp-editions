MÀLER KOTLA, a native state in the Punjab, India, situated between 30° 24' and 30° 4Γ N. lat., and between 75° 42' and 75° 59' 15'' E. long., with an estimated area of 165 square miles, and an estimated population of 91,560. The chief products are cotton, sugar, opium, aniseed, tobacco, garlic, and grain. The gross revenue is £25,893. The nawàb exercises complete jurisdiction, and receives a compensation of £250 per annum in perpetuity from the British Government, on account of loss of revenue caused by the abolition of customs duties. Mâler Kotla town is situated 30 miles south of Ludhiana.

The nàwâb or chief is of Afghan descent; his family originally came from Cabul, and occupied positions of trust in Sirhind under the Mughal emperors. They gradually became independent as the Mughal empire sank into decay in the course of the 18th century.

In General Lake’s campaign against Holkar in 1805 the nawab of Maier Kotla sided with the British. After the subjugation and flight of Holkar, the English Government succeeded to the power of the Mahrattas in the districts between the Sutlej and the Jumna; and in 1809 its protection was formally extended to Maier Kotla, as to the other cis-Sutlej states.against the formidable encroachments of Ranjit Sinh. In the campaigns of 1806, 1807, and 1808 Ranjit Sinh had made considerable conquests across the Sutlej; in 1808 he marched on Maier Kotla, and demanded a ransom of £10,000 from the nawab. This led to the interference of the British, who addressed an ultimatum to Ranjit Sinh, declaring the cis-Sutlej states to be under British protection. Finally the raja of Lahore submitted, and the nawâb was reinstated in February 1809.
