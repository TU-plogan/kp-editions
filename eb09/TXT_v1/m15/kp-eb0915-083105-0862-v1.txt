MEISSÉN, an ancient and important industrial town of Saxony is situated on the left bank of the Elbe, between the streams Meisse and Triebisch, in the district and about 9 miles to the north-west of the town of Dresden. Its irregular hilly site and numerous fine old buildings give it a quaint and picturesque appearance, and most of the streets are narrow and uneven. The cathedral, one of the finest Early Gothic edifices in Germany, is conspicuously situated on the Schlossberg, 160 feet above the town. It is said to have been originally founded by the emperor Otho I., but the present building was begun in the 13th century, and completed soon after 1400. The lofty tower dates from the 15th century. Within the cathedral are the tombs of several Saxon princes of the 15th and 16th centuries, including those of Albert and Ernest, the founders of the present reigning lines. Adjoining the cathedral stands the castle, dating originally from 1473-81, but restored and named Albrechtsburg in 1676. Another thorough restoration was undertaken in 1863, when a series of historical frescos by celebrated modern artists was begun upon its walls. An old stone bridge of the 13th century connects the Schlossberg with the Afraberg, which owes its name to the old convent of St Afra. The convent was suppressed by Duke Maurice in 1543, and converted into the “Fürstenschule,” one of the most renowned schools in Germany, counting Lessing and Gellert among its former pupils. The other chief buildings are the town-house, built in 1479, and restored in 1875; the fine old town church, also called the Frauenkirche or Marienkirche; and the churches of St Francis. St Nicholas (coeval with the town), and St Afra. Since 1710, immediately after Böttcher’s great discovery, Meissen has been the seat of the manufacture of the so-called Dresden china. Till 1863 the porcelain factory was in the Albrechtsburg, but in that year it was transferred to a large new building in the Triebisch-thal, close to the town, where about six hundred and seventy hands are now employed. Meissen also contains iron foundries, manufactories of earthenware stoves and pottery, a jute-mill, sugar refineries, breweries, [9:15:832] tanneries, &c. A considerable trade is carried on in the wine produced in the surrounding vineyards. The population in 1880 was 14,166.

Meissen, one of the oldest and most interesting towns in Saxony, was founded by the emperor Henry I. in 928 as an outpost against the Wends, and became the capital of a margraviate, which was afterwards merged in the duchy of Saxony. Its margraves were among the most powerful mediaeval princes in Germany, and were the direct ancestors of the present royal house of Saxony. From 965 till 1581 Meissen was also the seat of an important line of bishops, who ranked as princes of the empire. The town suffered greatly from the Hussites in the 15th Century, and it was captured by the imperial troops in the war of the Smalkaldian League, and again in the Thirty Years’ War. In 1637 it was severely handled by the Swedes, and in 1745 it fell into the hands of the Prussians.
