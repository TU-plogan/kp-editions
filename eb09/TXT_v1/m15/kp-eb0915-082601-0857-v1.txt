MEGALOPOLIS, a city of southern Arcadia, situated in a plain about 20 miles south-west of Tegea, on both banks of the Helisson, about 2∣ miles above its junction with the Alpheus. Like Messene, it owed its origin to Epaminondas, and was founded in 370 B,c., the year after the battle of Leuctra, as a bulwark for the southern Arcadians against Sparta, and as the seat of the Arcadian federal diet, which consisted of ten thousand men. The builders of the city were protected by a Theban force, and directed by ten native oecists, who likewise attended to the peopling of the new city, which apparently drew inhabitants from all parts of Arcadia, out more especially from the neighbouring districts of Maenalia and Parrhasia. Forty townships are mentioned by Pausanias (viii. 27, 3-5) as having been incorporated in it. It was fifty stadia in circumference, and was surrounded with strong walls. Its territory was the largest in Arcadia, extending northward 24 miles. The city was built on a magnificent scale, and adorned with many handsome buildings, both public and private. Its temples contained many ancient statues brought from the towns incorporated in it. On the north side of the Helisson, which divided it into two nearly equal parts, was the agora with four porticos, the gymnasium, a sacred grove, temples to the Lycaean Zeus, Pan Oinoeis, Bhea, Tyche, the great goddesses (Demeter and Core), Zeus Philios (with a statue by Polycletus), Aρhro-dite[9:15:827], Core, Athena Polias, and Hera Teleia. Among the numerous statues which stood in the open air the finest was that of Apollo Epicurius, 12 feet high, brought from the beautiful temple of Bassae, which was built by Ictinus, and is still in great part standing. On the south side of the river were the theatre, the largest in Greece, the Thersilion •or hall for the assembly of the Arcadian diet, a house built for Alexander the Great, with a statue of Zeus Ammon, the stadium, temples to the Muses, Apollo, and Hermes, to Aphrodite, to Ares, to Dionysus, to Hercules and Hermes, to Artemis Agrotera, to Asclepius and Hygiea, to the son of Asclepius, and to Apollo. Of all these buildings, with the exception of the theatre, hardly a trace remains above ground. The ruins of Megalopolis are near Sinanou.

The foundations of Megalopolis were hardly laid when Agesilaus undertook an expedition in the hope of breaking up the union of which it was the visible sign and capital. He accomplished nothing, and had hardly reached home when the Thebans and their allies under Epaminondas and Pelopidas entered the Peloponnesus and marched through Laconia almost unopposed. After the departure of Epaminondas, Lycomedes of Mantinea succeeded in drawing the Arcadian federation away from its alliance with Thebes, in consequence of which it had to make common cause with Athens An attempt on the part of the federation to use the treasures of the temple of Zeus at Olympia led to internal dissensions, so that in the battle of Mantinea (362) one half of the Arcadians fought on the side of the Spartans, the other on that of the Thebans. After this battle many of the inhabitants of Megalopolis sought to return to their former homes, and it was only by the assistance of three thousand Thebans under Pammenes that the authorities were able to prevent them from doing so. In the year 352, when Thebes had her hands full with the so-called Sacred War, the Spartans made an attempt to reduce Megalopolis; but the Thebans promptly sent assistance, and the city was rescued. Not sure of this assistance, the Megalopolitans had appealed to Athens, an aj>peal which gave occasion to Demosthenes’s oration ∏∈pl tΛeyaKoιtoKιτωv. The Spartans were now obliged to conclude peace with Megalopolis and acknowledge her autonomy. Nevertheless their feeling of hostility did not cease, and Megalopolis consequently entered into friendly relations with Philip of Macedon. Twenty years later, when the Spartans and their allies rebelled against the power of Macedon, Megalopolis remained firm in its allegiance, and was subjected to a siege of considerable duration. After the death of Alexander, Megalopolis was governed by native tyrants. In the war between Cassander and Polysperchon it took part with the former, and was, in consequence, besieged by the latter. On this Occasion it was able to send into the field an army of fifteen thousand. In 234 B.c. Lydiades, the last tyrant of Megalopolis, voluntarily resigned his power, and the city joined the Achaean league. In consequence of this it was once more exposed to the bitteι hatred of Sparta. In 222 Cleomenes took and plundered it, and killed or dispersed its inhabitants, but in the year following it was restored and its inhabitants reinstated by Philopoemen, a native of the city At this time the circuit of its walls always too great, seems to have been contracted. At all events it never again attained political importance, and gradually sank into insignificance. The only great men whom it produced were Philopoemen and Polybius the historian. Lycortas, the father of the latter, may be accounted a third In the time of Pausanias the city was mostly in ruins.
