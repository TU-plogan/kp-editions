MAIDENHEAD, a municipal borough and markettown in Berkshire, England, in the diocese of Oxford, 22∣ miles from London, 13⅛ from Reading, and 6 from Windsor. It was formerly called Maidenhythe, a wharf for timber and a wooden bridge across the Thames having existed there from very early times. In 1352 Edward III. incorporated a guild to keep the bridge in repair. In 1400 the duke of Surrey and the followers of Richard II. held the bridge against the new king, Henry IV., and at nightfall made good their retreat. In July 1647 a meeting took place at the Greyhound Inn between Charles I. and his three children. The church, dedicated to St Andrew and St Mary Magdalene, was originally founded by Margaret of France in 1270, and it was rebuilt on the same site in 1724; but in 1826 it was entirely taken down, and a new church was erected at the east end of the High Street. A church dedicated to St Luke was erected in 1867, and enlarged in 1869. The town contains a small town-hall, a large hall recently erected for concerts and lectures, schools, almhouses, and Roman Catholic, Wesleyan, and Baptist places of worship. There are numerous charities for the education and maintenance of poor persons. The principal trades are in malt, meal, and timber. A fine stone bridge across the Thames was erected at a cost of .£20,000 in 1772, connecting Berkshire with Buckingham. The scenery around Maidenhead is extremely picturesque, and several noblemen’s seats are in the neighbourhood. Population in 1871, 6173; in 1881, 8219.
