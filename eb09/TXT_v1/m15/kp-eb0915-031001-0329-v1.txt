MAJLÁTH, Janos or John, Count (1786-1855), Hungarian historian and poet, was born at Pest on the 5th of October 1786. First educated at home, he subsequently studied philosophy at Eger (Erlau) and law at Györ (Raab), his father, Count Joseph Majlâth, an Austrian minister of state, eventually obtaining for him an appointment in the public service. The weakness of his eyesight having rendered it necessary for him a few years later to resign the Government secretaryship to which he had been promoted, Majlâth turned his attention to literature, especially devoting himself to historical research, and the translation into German of Magyar folk-tales, and of selections from the works of the best of his country’s native poets. Moreover, as an original lyrical writer, and as an editor and adapter of old German poems, Majlâth showed considerable talent; and, in general, his activity as an author was remarkable, his various literary productions in German and Hungarian amounting together to more than sixty volumes. During the greater part of his life he resided either at Pest or Vienna, but a few years before his death he removed to Munich, where he fell into a state of destitution and extreme despondency. Seized at last by a terrible infatuation, he and his daughter Henriette, who had long been his constant companion and amanuensis, determined to put an end to their dependent position by drowning themselves in the Lake of Starnberg, a few miles south-west of Munich. This fatal resolution was carried into effect on the 3d of January 1855.

It is generally admitted that in his great historical treatises Count Majlath has failed in a critical discrimination between the merely mythical or poetical and the true historical element,—the former not unfrequently being allowed to unduly influence and obscure the latter. The political tendency of his writings, moreover, has been objected to, especially by his own countrymen, as being too conservative and over-favourable to Austria. Of his historical works the most important are the Geschichte der Magyaren (Vienna, 1828-31, 5 vols.; 2d ed., Ratisbon, 1852-53), and his Geschichte des österreichischen Kaiserstaats (Hamburg, 1834-50, 5 vols.). Specially noteworthy among his metrical translations from the Hungarian are the Magyarische Gedichte (Stuttgart and Tubingen, 1825); and Himfy's auserlesene Liebeslieder (Pest, 1829 2d. ed., 1831; see Kisfaludy, Sandor). A valuable contribution to folk-lore appeared in the Magyarische Sagen, Märchen, und Erzählungen (Brünn, 1825; 2d ed., Stuttgart and Tübingen, 1837, 2 vols.).
