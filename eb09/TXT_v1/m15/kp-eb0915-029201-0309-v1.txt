MAHZOR (^ΠTΠθ), or Mahazor, ^[1. Targum Yonathan on Genesis i. 14 (p"ltT∏O⅞), which is the plural of Mαhαzοrο, and mediately of Mahazοr.] as some write the word (from the root Ιf∏, to go round, to return), signifies a cycle. The term is used by the Jews in a threefold sense :—(1) astronomically, as Mahzor Katan for the cycle of nineteen years, Mahzor Gadol for that of twenty-eight years, Mahzor Gadol lallebanah ^[2. This must not be mistaken for Mahzor Gadol shel Lebaηah, which consists of twenty-one years. See Pirelce R. Elιezer, cap. vii.] for the Metonic cycle; (2) liturgically, for the “Larger PrayerBook,” whether in its narrower or its wider meaning (see below); and (3) ritually, for a book containing religious laws and directions, as, for example, Hahzov Vitri by R. Simhah b. Shemuel of Vitri-le-Français, Mahzor Pahbenu Tam by R. Ya'akob b. Meir of Rameru, &c. In the first sense the plural is either Mahazoroth ^[3. See Pireke R. El!ezer, cap. vi.] p or Mahzorvm ^[4. See Pireke R. Elι'ezer, cap. vi.] f or Mahazorin· ^[5. See noteabove.] f in the second and third it is exclusively Mahzorim. As most ancient prayerbooks contain more or less fully elaborate “tables,” exhibiting calendar matter, in connexion with the fixing of feasts and fasts and of the lessons from the Pentateuch and the Prophets, we cannot be in doubt as to the true cause of the application of the word Mahzor to the “Larger Prayer-Book.” It is not applied because it is the equivalent of the Syriac lμzdra, as some think, but simply because Mahzor is the equivalent of the Greek cyclos (κύκλος).^[6. For the sake of completeness we may mention the term ‘ ‘ Mahazorto,” which occurs in the Massoreth. It is not so called, as some have thought, because the Mahzor Vitri (or, indeed, any other Mahzor), ever gave the text of the whole Bible. The Mahazorto was a pattern codex of the Bible, and got its name simply from its containing the cycle of the sacred Scriptures,—the Law, the Prophets, and the Hagiographa. It (or a similar codex) is also sometimes called Mahazoro Rubbo, in contradistinction to smaller codices, which contained only some part of the Bible. It should be also borne in mind that the Babylonian Jews (as we are distinctly told of those of Nehardea) used in olden times to read on Sabbaths in the synagogue not merely, as nowadays, the Pentateuch and portions of the Prophets, but, in the afternoon service, portions of the Hagiographa also (T. B., Shabbath, 116δ).]

The Mahzor, meaning prayer-book, is capable of division from different points of view. According to its contents we may divide it into two parts,—the Smaller and the Larger. The Smaller Mahzor contains the ordinary prayers, together with the poetical insertions and the lessons from the Pentateuch and the Prophets used on the Yamim N^oraim i or “Awe-inspiring Days” (i.e., New Year and the Day of Atonement), and those used on the Yamim Tobirn, the three principal festivals (Passover, Pentecost, aud Tabernacles). The Larger Mahzor is, indeed, the only one which really deserves this name, since it embodies the ordinary prayers, together with the poetical insertions for the whole year, and the lessons from the Pentateuch and the Prophets for all feasts and fasts and the other extraordinary occasions. According to its various “uses” the Mahzor may be divided into the Rabbanite and the Anti-Rabbanite. The Anti-Rabbanite Mahzor comprises the Karaite,^[7. See Daily and Festival Prayers, in 4 vols., Venice, 1528-29, 4to; in 3 vols., Kale, 1806, 4to; in 4 vols., Eupatoria, 1836, 4to; do., Vienna, 1854, 8vo.] used by the so-called Karaites, or Scripturalists, inhabiting Russia (especially the Crimea), Galizia(Austrian Poland), Egypt, Palestine, <fcc,, and the Semi-Karaite, adopted by the so-called “Reformed Jews” of England, in reality the “Congregations of British Jews” of London, Manchester, and Bradford^[8. Forms of Prayer, &c., in 5 vols., London, 1841-43, 8vo.]. 8 The Rabbanite Mahzor may be divided into that of the Ashkenazim, the Sepharadim, and the Italiani. The Italian Mahzor, though embodying large Ashkenazic and Sepharadic elements, is yet a distinct “use.” It branches out at home into three subdivisions— (1) the Roman,^[9. Soncinati, Soncino, Casai Maggiore, 1485-86, Bologna, 1540, both in folio.] (2) the Neapolitan^[10. Cambridge MS. Add. 491.] (now extinct), and (3) the Italian proper;^[11. Prayers, &c., Venice, 1545, 16mo, &c.] and abroad into (4) the Greek Rites of Kaffa,^[12. Cambridge MS. Add. 542.] Crete, &c. (Crete having very early received a large influx of immigrants from France and Germany, but chiefly from Italy), and (5) the Romanian,^[13. Prayers for the Whole Year, &c., in 2 vols., Venice, 1517-49, folio; Constantinople, 1573-76, folio. The copies of both editions in the Cambridge University Library are, so far as we know, the finest to be found in England.] i.e , the “use” obtaining, among others, at Constantinople and other Byzantine cities. The Italians who, long before the year 1000, had given Jewish learning and poetry, not merely to [9:15:293] Germany, but to the whole Roman empire, received in the 14th century numerous immigrants from northern France,^[14. There are to this day three congregations in Italy (Asti, Fossano, Moncalvo), which use the ancient ritual of northern France (see MS. Add. 667, in the Cambridge University Library).] in the 15th century from Spain and Portugal, and at all times from Germany. The “uses” of these immigrants are practically preserved side by side with the native Italian to this day. The pure Sepharadic Ritual^[15. Seder Tephilloth, &c., Amsterdam, 1642, 16mo; in 4 vols., 1644; in 6 vols., London, 1789-93; Mahzor, &c., Vienna, 1820, 8vo.] represents, in the first instance, of course, the “use” of the Jews formerly inhabiting Spain and Portugal, who now form the minority in Hamburg, Amsterdam, Manchester, London, Paris, Vienna, Budapest, Temesvâr, Semlin, Bucharest, Venice, Rome, and some other Italian and Greek cities, as also in Canada and the United States, and the majority in India, Persia, Morocco, Leghorn, Corfu, Belgrade, all Bulgaria, Constantinople, Palestine, Egypt, South Arabia, and other parts of the Turkish empire, in the French possessions in Africa, and in the south of France. Some of these, although characteristically Sepharadic, are distinct enough to claim a ritual of their own, as those of “Catalonia,”^[16. Mahzor, &c., Salonika, 1863, '8vo.] Algiers,^[17. Hokhmath Hammisken, &c., 1793; y∏ l ∏p, 1823; Mahzor Katan, &c., 1861, all at Leghorn, in 8vo.] Tunis,^[18. Mahzor, &c., Pisa, 1794; Selihoth, 1845; Pene Haragel, 1856, all at Leghorn, and in 8vo.] Tripoli,^[19. Siphethe Renanoth, kc., 2 vols., Venice, 1648, 1711, 4to, Leghorn, 1837; Kisshurin Leya'akob, Leghorn, 1858; Readings, Venice, 1736, all three in 8vo.] Tlemcen,^[20. Mahzor, &c., 1842 and 1861, both at Leghorn, and in 8vo.] Ceylon and Cochin in India,^[21. Order of Prayers, &c., Amsterdam, 1757 and 1769, Leghorn, 1849, all in 8vo.] the Comtat in France,^[22. Or Venaissin, i.e., the four congregations of Carpentras, Avignon, Lisle, and Cavaillon. See Seder Hattarnid, &c., Avignon, 1767, Aix, 1855, 8vo; Seder leyamim Noraim, &c., 1739; Seder leshalosh Regalim, 1759-1762, both at Amsterdam, and in 8vo; Seder Hakun∙ teris, &c., Avignon, 1765; Seder shel yom Kippur, 1766, and Seder Haashmuroth, 1763, both at Amsterdam, and all three in 4to.] and Provence, as a whole, in bygone days.^[23. It ought not to be omitted that in the old Provençal ritual and the South Arabian there are several points of contact existing. A teacher or teachers must have come from the one country and settled in the other. We will give but one example. The phrase, KtJΠp0Π Π*3O2Π, which occurs in the Path-shegen (on Genesis ii. 1), by an anonymous author, and published by Dr Nathan Adler, and which the editor modestly says he has not succeeded in finding, is in reality to be found in the service of the Hosha'noth, both in the old Provençal Mahzor (Camb. MS. Add. 752, leaf 205Ô; only that, instead of KBΠpD1, it reads KBΠpD ΠΏΊ) and in that of Yemen (Camb. MS. Add. 1200, leaf 62δ), though in no other so far as we know.] The “use” of the Ashkenazim,^[24. Mahzor, Pesaro, 1520, Augsburg, 1536, Venice, 1567, all in folio; 6 vols., London, 1807, 1824, 1826, &c., 8vo.] i.e., of the majority of the Jews inhabiting Germany, the Austrian states, Hungary, Russia, Denmark, Sweden, France, Belgium, Holland, the British empire (India excepted), the United States, &c., branches out into two rituals, the German proper^[25. Mahzor, 2 vols., Sulzbach, 1794, folio.] and the Polish. This latter has some differences of use between Great Poland and Little Poland.^[26. These differences show themselves first in the prayer “El erekh appayim” in the service for Monday and Thursday.] The German proper had in times past the separate rituals of Worms and other cities in the empire, which are all now extinct. Those of Frankfort-on-the-Main and of other towns are not sufficiently marked to deserve separate notice. It should, however, be mentioned that there are scattered everywhere, both at home and abroad, “Reformed congregations,” whose separate uses and practices are more or less an imitation of the “Temple” (Reformed congregation) of Hamburg.^[27. Ordnung der öffentlichen Andacht, &c., 1819; Seder Ha' ahodah, tze., both at Hamburg, and in 8vo.]

Some of these have only introduced choirs, others have introduced instrumental music, and others again have considerably curtailed not merely the poetical insertions, but the ordinary prayers themselves, and have introduced hymns and prayers in the vernacular. (s. μ. s.-s.)
