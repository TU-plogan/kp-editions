MARIGOLD. This name has been given to several plants, of which the following are the best known :— Calendula offi,dnalis, I.., the pot-marigold; Tagetes erecta, I.., the African marigold; T. patula, I.., the French marigold; and Chrysanthemum segetum, the corn marigold. All these belong to the order Compodtx; but Caltha palustris, I.., the marsh marigold, is a ranunculaceous plant.

The first-mentioned is the familiar garden plant with large orange-coloured blossoms, and is a native of the meadows of southern Europe (DC., Prod., vi. p. 451). It is unisexual, the “ray” florets being female, the “disk” florets male. This and the double variety have been in cultivation for at least three hundred years, as well as a proliferous form, C. proliféra, or the “fruitful marigolde” of Gerard (Herball, p. 602), in which small flower-heads proceed from beneath the circumference of the flower. The figure of “the greatest double marigold,” C. multifora maxima, given by Gerard (l.c.., p. 600) is larger than most specimens now seen, being, 3 inches in diameter. He remarks of “the marigolde” that it is called Calendula “as it is to be seene to flower in the calends ∙of almost euerie moneth.” It was supposed to have several specific virtues, but they are now discredited. “The marigold, that goes to bed wi’ the sun,” is mentioned by Shakespeare, Winter's Tale, iv. 3.

Tagetes patula, I.., and T. erecta, I.. (DC., Prod., v. p. 643), the French and African marigolds, are natives of Mexico, and are equally familiar garden plants, having been long in cultivation. Gerard figures four varieties of Flos africanus, of the single and double kinds (l.c., p. 609); but they do not appear to be specifically distinct; indeed Parkinson (Par., p. 303, 1629) regarded them as one. Besides the above species the following have been introduced later, T. lucida, Cav., T. signata, also from Mexico, and T. tenuifolia, Cav., from Peru (Hemsley’s Handbook of Hardy Trees, <kc., p. 247).

Chrysanthemum segetum, I.., the yellow corn marigold, is indigenous to Great Britain, and is frequent in corn-fields in most parts of England. A decoction of the fresh plant gathered before flowering is acrid, and is said to be useful medicinally. When dried it has been employed as hay It is also used in Germany for dyeing yellow (Baxter, Brit. Gen. of Pl., vol. iv. 306). Gerard observes that in his day “the stalke and leaues of Come Marigolde, as Dioscorides saith, are eaten as other potherbes are.”

Caltha palustris, I.., the marsh marigold, the “winking Mary-buds” of Shakespeare (Cιjmb., ii. 3), is a common British plant in marshy meadows and beside water. It bears cordate leaves, the flowers having a golden yellow calyx but no corolla, and blossoming in March and April. The flower-buds preserved in salted vinegar are a good substitute for capers. A double-flowered variety is often cultivated, and is occasionally found wild (Baxter, l.c., vol. ii. 153).
