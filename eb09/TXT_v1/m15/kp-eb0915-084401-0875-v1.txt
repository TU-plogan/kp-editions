MELVILLE, George John Whyte (1821-1878), has a right to be regarded as the founder of a school of fashionable novels,—the fashionable sporting novel.. He was lamented on his death as the Tyrtaeus of the hunting field, the laureate of fox-hunting; all his most popular and distinctive heroes and heroines, Digby Grand, Tilbury Nogo, the Honourable Crasher, Mr Sawyer, Kate Coventry, Mrs Lascelles, are or would be mighty hunters. The eldest son of Major Whyte Melville, of Mount Melville, Fifeshire, he received his school education, like so many of his heroes, at Eton, entered the army in 1839, became captain in the Coldstream Guards in 1846, and retired in 1849. His first appearance in literature was made soon after, with a translation of Horace into fluent and graceful verse, published in 1850. His first novel was Digby Grand, published in 1853. Although this first effort has a good deal more in it of Lytton’s early high-flying style than Whyte Melville’s later works, the unflagging verve and intimate knowledge with which he described sporting scenes and sporting characters at once drew attention to him as a novelist with a new vein. His power of sustaining interest in hunting and the things connected with hunting appeared more markedly in his next novel, Tilbury Nogo, contributed to the Sporting Magazine in 1853. He showed in the adventures of Mr Nogo, what became more apparent in his later works, that he had a surer hand in humorous narrative than in pathetic description; there are many pathetic scenes in his novels, but the pathos is sometimes rather forced, intended to point a moral—rather the pathos of the preacher than the poet. The hero of General Bounce, his next novel in order of publication {Fraser's Magazine, 1854), little as one would expect it from the title, ends in a painful manner, somewhat out of keeping with the lively middle and beginning. When the Crimean War broke out, Whyte Melville took part in it as a volunteer iu the Turkish contingent; but this was the only break in his literary career from the time that he began to write novels till his death in 1878. By a strange accident, he lost his life in the hunting-field, the hero of many a stiff ride meeting his fate in galloping quietly over an ordinary ploughed field.

Twenty-one novels appeared from his pen after his return from the Crimea:— Kate Coventry, 1856; The Interpreter, 1858; Holwiby House, 1860; Good for Nothing, 1861; Market Harborough, 1861; The Gladiators, 1863; Brookes of Bridlemere, 1864; The Queen's Maries, 1864; Cerise, 1865; Bones and I, 1868; The White Bose, 1868; Μ or A r , 1869; Contraband, 1870; Sarchedon, 1871; Satanella, 1872; Ende John, 1874; Sister Louise, 1875; Katerfelto, 1875; Rosine, 1876; Roy's Wife, 1878; Black but Comely, 1878. Several of these novels are historical, the Gladiators being perhaps the most famous of them. As an historical novelist Whyte Melville cannot be put on a level with Harrison Ainsworth for painstaking accuracy and minuteness of detail; he makes his characters live and move with great vividness, but he obviously did not know at first hand the history of the periods chosen by him. It is on his portraiture of contemporary sporting society that his reputation as a novelist must rest; and, though now and then a character reappears, such as the supercilious studgroom, the dark and wary steeple-chaser, or the fascinating sporting widow, his variety in the invention of incidents is amazing. Whyte Melville was not merely the annalist of sporting society for his generation, but may also be fairly described as the principal moralist of that society; he exerted a considerable and a wholesome influence on the manners and morals of the gilded youth of his time. His Songs and Verses and his metrical Legend of the True Cross, though respectable in point of versification, are hardly worth mentioning on their own merits.
