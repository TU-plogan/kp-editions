MELON (Cucumis Melo, I..), a most polymorphic species of the order Cucurbitaceae, the varieties of which are grouped by Naudin under ten tribes, while several other plants of less known characters probably belong to it.^[1. For generic characters see Benth. et Hook., Gen. Pl., i. 826; and for a full account of the species of Cucumis and of the tribes of melon, by Μ. Naudin, see Ann. des Sci. Nat., 4 ser., tom. xi. p. 34.] The melon is an annual herb with palmately-lobed leaves, and bears tendrils. It is monoecious, having male and female flowers on the same plant. The flowers have deeply five-lobed campanulate corollas and three stamens. Naudin observed that in some varieties (e.g., of Cantaloups) fertile stamens sometimes occur in the female flowers. It is a native of south Asia “from the foot of the Himalayas to Cape Comorin,”^[2. Naudin, l.c., pp. 39, 76; see also Gard. Cħron., 1857, p. 153, and 1858, p. 130.] where it grows spontaneously, but is cultivated in the temperate and warm regions of the whole world. It is excessively variable both in diversity of foliage and habit, but much more so in the fruit, which in some varieties is no larger than an olive, while in others it rivals the ponderous fruits of the gourd (Cucurbita maxima, I..). The fruit may be globular, ovoid, spindle-shaped, or serpent-like, netted or smooth-skinned, ribbed or furrowed, variously coloured externally, with white, green, or orange flesh when ripe, scented or scentless, sweet or insipid, bitter or even nauseous, &c. Like the gourd, the melon undergoes strange metamorphoses by crossing its varieties, though the latter preserve their characters when alone. The offspring, however, of all crossings are fertile. As remarkable cases of sudden changes produced by artificially crossing races, Μ. Naudin records that in 1859 the offspring of the wild melons m. sauvage de ΓInde (C. melo agrestis) and m. s. d’Afrique, le petit m. de Figari (C. maculatus?) bore quite different fruits from their parents, the former being ten to twelve times their size, ovoid, white-skinned, more or less scented, and with reddish flesh; though another individual bore fruits no larger than a nut. The offspring of m. de Figari after being crossed bore fruits of the serpent-melon. On the other hand, the serpent-melon was made to bear ovoid and reticulated fruit.^[3. See also Naudin, in Noue. rech, sur I. hyb. dans les veg., p. 118, 1861.]

With reference to the early cultivation of the melon, Naudin thinks it is probable that the culture in Asia is as ancient as that of all other alimentary vegetables. The Egyptians grew it, or at least inferior races of melon, which were either indigenous or introduced from Asia. The Romans and doubtless the Greeks were familiar with it, though some forms may have been described as cucumbers. Columella seems to refer to the serpentmelon in the phrase ut coluber . . . ventre cubat Jlexo. Pliny describes them as pepones (xix. 23 to xx. G) and Columella as melones (xi. 2. 53); see Γickering, Chron. Hist., of Pl., 229. The melon began to be extensively cultivated in France in 1629, according to Olivier de Serres. Gerard (IIerball, 771) figured and described in 1597 several kinds of melons or pompions, but he has apparently included gourds under the same name. Pickering observes that the melon was carried by Columbus to America, and by the Portuguese to the Malayan Archipelago.

The origin of some of the chief modern races, such as “Cantaloups,” “Dudaim,” and probably the netted sorts, is due to Persia and the neighbouring Caucasian regions. The first of these was brought to Rome from Armenia in the 16th century, and supplies the chief sorts grown for the French markets; but many others are doubtless artificial productions of West Europe.

For cultivation of the melon, see art. Horticulture, and also Gard. Chron., May 6, 1882, p. 596; and for references to French literature on the same see Naudin, ut supra, p. 82.
