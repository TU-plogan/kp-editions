MACNEE, Sir Daniel (1806-1882), portrait painter, was born in 1806 at Fintry in Stirlingshire. He was educated in Glasgow, and at the age of thirteen apprenticed, along with Horatio Macculloch and Leitch the water-colour painter, to John Knox, a landscapist of some repute at the time. He afterwards worked for a year as a lithographer, was employed by the Messrs Smith of Cumnock to paint the ornamental lids of the planewood snuff-boxes for which their manufactory was celebrated, and, having studied in Edinburgh at the “Trustees’ Academy,” supporting himself meanwhile by designing and colouring book illustrations for Lizars the engraver, he established himself as an artist in Glasgow. At first he was occupied a good deal with figure pictures, but the increasing demands on his time as a fashionable portrait painter eventually left him little leisure for this branch of art. He was one of the twenty-four associates of the Royal Institution who, in 1829, were admitted members of the Royal Scottish Academy; and on the death of Sir George Harvey in 1876 he was elected president, and received the honour of knighthood, and the degree of LL.D. from the Glasgow University. From this period till his death, on the 18th of January 1882, he resided in Edinburgh, where his genial social qualities and his inimitable powers as a teller of humorous Scottish anecdote rendered him popular. Among his portraits may be mentioned those of Lord Brougham, Viscount Melville, Lord Inglis, and Mrs Bough. His Dr Wardlaw obtained a gold medal at the Paris International Exhibition of 1855.
