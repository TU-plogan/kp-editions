+=====================================================================+


MARTIN, John (1789-1854), a popular ‘English painter, was born at Haydon Bridge, near Hexham, on the 19th of July 1789. On account of his early interest in art he was apprenticed by his father to a coachbuilder to learn heraldic painting, but owing to a quarrel the indentures were cancelled, and he was placed under Bonifacio Musso, an Italian artist, father of the well-known enamel painter Charles Musso. With his master Martin removed to London in 1806, where he married at the age of nineteen, and led a struggling life, supporting himself by giving drawing lessons, and by painting in [9:15:583] water colours, and on china and glass. His leisure was occupied in the study of perspective and architecture. His first picture, Sadak in Search of the Waters of Oblivion, was executed in a month. It was exhibited in the Royal Academy of 1812, and sold for fifty guineas. It was followed by the Expulsion (1813), Paradise (1813), Clytie (1814), and Joshua (1815). In 1821 appeared the famous Belshazzar’s Feast, which excited much favourable and hostile comment, and was awarded a prize of £200 at the British Institution, where the Joshua had previously carried off a premium of £100. Then came the Destruction of Herculaneum (1822), the Creation (1824), the Eve of the Deluge (1841), and a long series of other Biblical and imaginative subjects, many of which are widely known through engravings. In 1832-33 Martin received £2000 for drawing and engraving a fine series of designs to Milton, and along with Westall he produced a set of Bible illustrations. He was also much occupied with schemes for the improvement of London, and published various pamphlets and plans dealing with the metropolitan water supply, sewage, dock, and railway systems. During the last four years of his life he was engaged upon his large subjects of the Judgment, the Day of Wrath, and the Plains of Heaven. He was attacked with paralysis while painting, and died in the Isle of Man on the 17th of February 1854.

The bold originality of Martin’s productions startled and attracted the public, but they are without the qualities of solid execution and truth to nature upon which a lasting fame in the arts must be built. His figures are badly drawn, his colouring is hot and unpleasant. To most of his professional brethren his works seemed theatrical and tricky; and the best lay critics of his time, like Charles Lamb, were disposed to deny that they evinced true imaginative power. His popularity may be said to have culminated in 1828, the year of his Fall of Nineveh; since then it has been gradually declining.
