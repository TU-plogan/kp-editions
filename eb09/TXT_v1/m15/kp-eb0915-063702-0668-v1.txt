+=====================================================================+


MAURICE (Mauricius Flavius Tiberius), emperor of the East from 582 to 602, was of Roman descent but a native of Arabissus in Cappadocia, where he was born about 539. He spent his youth at the court of Justin II., and, having joined the army, fought with distinction in the Persian war (578-581). At the age of forty-three he was declared Caesar by the dying emperor Tiberius II., who bestowed upon him the hand of his daughter Constantina. In the meagre annals of the reign of Maurice the most conspicuous events are the termination of the long struggle in the East with the restoration to the Persian throne of Chosroes II. by the Roman general Narses (not the conqueror of Italy) in 591, and the successes of Priscus in the protracted war against the Avars. Some inopportune attempts at army reform, and an ill-judged refusal to provide a ransom which might have prevented the massacre of twelve thousand prisoners in the hands of the enemy, led to a rebellion [9:15:638] among the legions on the Danube, who declared Maurice unworthy to reign, and, commanded by Phocas, then a simple centurion, but destined to become emperor, marched upon Constantinople. The capital having declared against him, Maurice abdicated and withdrew to Chalcedon, but was pursued and put to death there after having witnessed the murder of five of his sons (November 27, 602). He was the author of a work on military art (στρατηγικά) in twelve books, of which there is an edition by Scheffer, publishèd at Upsala in 1664. There is a Vita Mauricii by Theophylact Simocatta.
