MANTELL, Gideon Algernon (1790-1852), born in 1790 at Lewes, Sussex, rose to eminence as a popular exponent of geology, and contributed many original papers to the literature of the science. Educated for the medical profession, he first practised in his native town, afterwards in Brighton, and finally at Clapham, near London. While devoting himself with industry and success to the duties of a medical man, he yet found time to prosecute researches in the palaeontology of the Secondary rocks, particularly in Sussex—a region which he has made for ever classical in the history of discovery. While he was still a country [9:15:503] doctor at Lewes his eminence as a geological investigator was fully recognized on the publication of his work on The. Fossils of the South Downs, 1822. His most remarkable discoveries were made in the Wealden formations, whence he brought to light and described the remarkable Γ)inosaurian reptiles known as Iguanodon, Hylxosaurus, Peior osa urus, and Regnosaurus. The memoirs in which he sketched the structure of these strange creatures, and pointed out the probable conditions in which they lived, were recognized by the Geological Society as deserving of its highest honour—the Wollaston medal. The Royal Society also awarded him a Royal medal. Besides these and other contributions to the literature of palaeontology and geology, he published from time to time various popular works which had a large sale and did much to spread a knowledge of and interest in the science.^[1. Of these the following may be enumerated—The Wonders of Geology, 2 vols.; The Medals of Creation, 2 vols.; Thoughts on a Pebble, or First Lessons in Geology, A Geological Excursion round the Isle of II ighl; Pictorial A tlas of Fossil Remains; Thoughts on Animalcules, or a Glimpse at the Invisible World as revealed by the Microscope·, Petrifactions and their Teachings.] Towards the end of his life Dr Manteli retired to London. Though for many years suffering from a severe spinal disease, the result of an accident, he continued with unabated enthusiasm the prosecution of his favourite scientific pursuits, sparing neither pains nor expense towards the attainment of his objects, and kindling in others a spirit of eager desire to farther the cause of science. He wrote with great clearness and attractiveness, so that his general works were deservedly popular. As a lecturer also he was almost unrivalled for fluency and eloquence. His name appeared on the list of membership of many learned societies both at home and abroad. He died in 1852.
