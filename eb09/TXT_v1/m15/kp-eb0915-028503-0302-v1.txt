MAHÁNADI, or Mahanuddy (“The Great River”), a river of India, rising in 20° 10' N. lat., 82° E. long., 25 miles south of Râipur town, in a wild mountainous region of the Central Provinces. At first an insignificant stream, it flows in a tortuous easterly course through the hills in a rocky bed until it reaches Dholpur in Orissa. From this point it rolls its unrestrained waters straight for the outermost line of the Eastern Ghâts. This mountain line it pierces by a gorge about 40 miles in length, overlooked by hills, shaded by forests, deep and tranquil, and navigable at all seasons. It pours down upon the Orissa delta at Narâj, about 7 miles west of.Cuttack town; and after traversing Cuttack district from west to east, and throwing off numerous branches (the Kâtjuri, Paika, Birùpâ, Chitartalâ, &c.), it falls into the Bay of Bengal at False Point by several channels.

The Mahanadi has an estimated basin of 43,800 miles, and its rapid flow renders its maximum discharge in time of flood second to that of no other river in India. During unusually high floods 1,800,000 cubic feet of water pour every second through the Narâj gorge, one-half of which, uncontrolled by the elaborate embankments, pours over the delta, filling the swamps, inundating the rice-fields, and converting the plains into a boundless sea. In the dry weather the discharge of the Mahanadi dwindles to 1125 feet per second. Efforts have been made to husband and utilize the vast water supply thrown upon the Orissa delta during seasons of flood. Each of the three branches into which the parent stream splits at the delta head is regulated by a weir. Of the four canals which form the Orissa irrigation system, two take off from the Birùpâ weir, and one, with its branch, from the Mahanadi weir. On the 31st December 1868 the Government took over the whole canal works from the East Indian Irrigation Company, at a cost of £941,368, since which time the gradual prosecution of the Orissa scheme to completion has been sanctioned. The canals thus taken over and since completed, or carried to an advanced stage of construction, are the High-Level Canal, the Kendrâpâra Canal, the Tâldandâ Canal, and the Mâchhgâon Canal, with their distributaries, designed to irrigate a total of 1,600,000 acres.
