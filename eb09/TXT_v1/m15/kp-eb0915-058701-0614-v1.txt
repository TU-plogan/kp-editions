MARTYROLOGY, a catalogue or list of martyrs, arranged according to the succession of their anniversaries, and sometimes including an account of their lives and sufferings. The corresponding word in the Greek Church is Menologion, or Analogion ; from the Menologia the Synaxaria are compiled. The custom of paying honour to the memory of those who had “witnessed the good confession” ip perilous times established itself very early in the Christian church, and one particular manner of commemoration was formally recognized by at least one ecclesiastical synod before the end of the 4th century; in the 47th canon of the third synod of Carthage (397 a.d.) it is decreed “liceat legi Passiones Martyrum quum anniversarii eorum dies celebrantur.” Apart from the still extant Depositio Martyrum, contained in the work of the chronographer of 354, edited in 1850 by Mommsen, the oldest “martyrologies” of which anything is known are the αρχαίων μαρτυρίων συναγωγή, or collection of records of past persecutions, to which Eusebius more than once alludes as having been made by himself, and the treatise On the Martyrs of Palestine, by the same author, the full text of which has been preserved in an ancient Syriac version edited by Cureton. Next to the general martyrology of Eusebius, in chronological order, it has been usual to place the calendar of saints’ days referred to in a letter, attributed to Jerome, which purports to be written in answer to bishops Chromatins and Heliodorus, who had asked him to search the archives of Eusebius with the view of enabling them to observe the saints’ days with more regularity. This epistle is now admitted to be spurious; ultimately, however, a so-called Martyrologium Hieronymianum came into existence, but it is not so much a single martyrology as a rude patchwork derived from many ancient church calendars. In its present form it is a meagre list of names and places, but may be said to lie at the foundation of all subsequent Western calendars. Almost contemporary with its last recension is what is known as the Parvum Martyrologvum Romanum, found by Ado of Vienne about 850; in it many of the dates are changed, and for the first time days are assigned to the chief characters of Scripture. To nearly the same date must be assigned the independent compilation of Bede, which has reached us, however, only as enlarged by subsequent editors. The 9th century was very fertile in martyrologies, among which may be mentioned that of Florus, subdeacon of Lyons (c. 830), who was the first editor of Bede, that of Hrabanus Maurus, an attempted further improvement on Bede and Florus, that of Ado, an enlargement of Florus, but based on the Parvum Martyrologium Romanum, that of Usuard of Paris, the epitomizer of Ado, and that of Notker of St Gall, based on Ado and Hrabanus. The Martyrologium Romanum was published by Baronius at the command of Pope Gregory XIII. in 1586; the enlarged edition by Rosweyd appeared at Antwerp in 1613. The Cistercian Martyrology appeared at Rome in 1733 and 1748. The best-known Greek Menologion is that prepared in the 9th century by command of the emperor Basilius Macedo; it was edited in 1727 by Cardinal Hannibal Urbini. An ancient Syriac martyrology, entitled “the names of our lords the martyrs and victors, with their days on which they won crowns,” written in 412, has been edited, with an English translation, by Professor W. Wright, in the Journal of Sacred [9:15:588] Literature (I860). See Catal. Syr. MSS. Br. Mus., ii. <532.
