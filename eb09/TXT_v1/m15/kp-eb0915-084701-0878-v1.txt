MEMNON ". In the Homeric mythology (or rather the mythology of the Troica in the much fuller form in which it existed in the times of Pindar and the tragic poets) this hero was called the son of Tithonus (the half-brother of Priam) and Eos (Aurora). Tradition represented him as an Ethiopian prince who came to assist the Trojans against the Greeks, and performed prodigies of valour, but was at length killed by Achilles, after having himself slain Antilochus, the son of Nestor, an event alluded to in Pindar, Pyth., vi. 32-39. His story must have been very famous, for more than one Greek play was composed bearing the title.

The chief source from which our knowledge about Memnon as a chief is derived is the second book of the PostHomerica, by Quintus Smyrnaeus, where his exploits and death are described at length. That Memnon was slain by Achilles is more than once affirmed by Pindar (A 7 ⅛ι., vi. 52; Isthm., iv. 41, vii. 54). He is mentioned also in the Odyssey (xi. 522), with especial praise for personal beauty; but the allusion to him is quite casual, and is one of many proofs that the compilation of that and the sister epic presupposes in the reader or hearer a full knowledge of the whole tale of Troy. Modern philology associates Memnon—like Achilles, whom he so closely resembles in many particulars, and like Sarpedon, who seems the representative of Memnon in the Iliad—with solar phenomena. He was the son of the dawn, and, though he might vanish from sight for a time, he could not be destroyed, and therefore it was said that Zeus, moved by the tears of his mother, granted him immortality. In this respect, as also in wearing bright armour made by Hephaestus, he is the counterpart of Achilles, who symbolizes the mid-day sun in his glory; and that Memnon is said to have come from the far east, i.e., from the region of sunrise, is in itself significant. Ovid, in a beautiful elegy on the death of Tibullus, Amor., lib. iii. 9, 3, thus associates the fates of Memnon and Achilles :—

Memnona si mater, mater ploravit Achillem, Et tangunt magnas tristia fata deas,

Flebilis indignos, Elegeia, solve capillos; Ah nimis ex vero nunc tibi nomen erit.

Like the body of the dead hero Sarpedon (H., xvi. 681), so that of Memnon was borne through the air, a legend represented on Greek vases of a rather early date. This appears to mean that the sun, the offspring of the dawn, careers through the sky to the place of his departure in the west. Another account represents Zeus as navιng sent forth birds from the funeral-pile of Memnon, which straightway fought with each other, and many fell back as victims to the soul of the hero.

The mere fact that a Afemnonium,, or temple in honour of the hero, was erected both at Susa and at Egyptian Thebes, both of which places were centres of sun-worship, is a strong confirmation of the probability, derived from his mythical pedigree, that he was really a sun-god. Sir G. W. Cox remarks,^[1. Mythology and Folklore, p. 134.] “of Memnon’s head the story was told that it retained the prophetic power of the living Helios or of Surya. The story is found in the myth of the Teutonic Wismir, and it might have been related of Kephalos, the head of the sun ;” and again (p. 267), “Eos, the mother of Memnon, is so transparently the morning th it her child must rise again as surely as the sun reappears to run his daily course across the heaven.”

With respect to the meaning of the name, it may possibly be the same as Agamemnon, which has a prefix meaning brave. ^[2. Sir G. W. Cox, Mythology of the Aryans, p. 268, ed. 2.] It has been thought that Mqu,vωv and μvrjy-wv, “mindful,” are but forms of the same word, and that the prophetic power attributed to the head of the Egyptian Memnon, which was said to utter sounds at sunrise, is connected with this idea. It was said that the sound resembled the moaning noise or the sharp twang of a harp-string, and it may even be surmised that the syllables mem-non imitated the resouauce. The Egyptian head is said to be a bust of King Amenophis;^[3. Φau,evo>Φ, as the Thebans themselves said, according to Pausanias, cited below.] but if the Greeks fancied it uttered the word memnon, they would have called it by that name. Tbe tendency, however, to give a Greek shape and inflexion to words which sounded barbarous will sufficiently account for tbe misnaming of the statue.

Strabo, lib. xvii. p. 816, declares that he himself heard it in company with Aelius Gallus and several of his friends, and Pausanias (i. 42, 2) says “one would compare tbe sound most nearly to the broken chord of a harp or a lute.” See also Juv., Sat., xv. 5; Tac., Ann., ii. 61.

Memnon, as an Ethiopian, was of course represented as a black; hence Virgil (J⅛., i. 493) speaks of “nigri Memnonis arma.” The figure itself was cut out*of black basalt, but that is a material not uncommon in Egypt Speaking quite generally, it seems reasonable to conclude that the Memrton from Ethiopia (which the early Greeks placed in the far east rather than in the south) typifies the eastern sun summoned to oppose the enemies of darkness from the west.
