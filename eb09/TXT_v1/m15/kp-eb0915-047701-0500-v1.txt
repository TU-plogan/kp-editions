MANDURIA, a city of Italy in the province of Lecce, 22 miles east of Taranto on the road to Lecce, in the midst of a wide open country. It had 7948 inhabitants at the census of 1871, is the seat of two pretty important fairs, and contains a spacious palace of the Francavilla family, and a fine old church with campanile and rose window; but the main interest of the place attaches to the ruins of the ancient city in the neighbourhood. The whole circuit of the double line of ancient walls, built of large rectangular stones without mortar, can still be traced, the outer wall and ditch measuring 23 feet in breadth, and the inner passage with the inner wall about 50 feet. At Scegno,*just outside the walls, the visitor may still see the fountain of Manduria, the level of which, according to Pliny, it was impossible to alter by any drawing out or pouring in of water.

Manduria is first mentioned in connexion with the death of Archidamus, king of Sparta, who perished in a battle fought under its walls in 338 B.c.; and the only other fact of importance in its ancient annals is the capture by Fabius Maximus in 209. Though omitted from Pliny’s list of towns in this region, it appears in the Tabula Peutiugeriana. After the destruction of the old town by the Saracens the inhabitants removed to the present site, and the name Casalnuovo, which they at first applied to tbe new settlement, was exchanged by Ferdinand I. for the original Manduria.
