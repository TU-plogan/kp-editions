MAITLAND, a town of Australia, in New South Wales, 93 miles north of Sydney, in the valley of Hunter river, and communicating with Newcastle and Port Hunter both by steamboat and railway. It consists of two distinct municipalities—East Maitland, incorporated in 1862, and West Maitland, in 1863. The former, which is the seat of a Roman Catholic bishop, contains a court-house, a large prison, and a mechanics’ institute; the latter a courthouse, an excellent hospital (Campbell’s Hill), a school of arts with a considerable library, a benevolent asylum, a theatre, and a Dominican nunnery. The district is a rich agricultural country, growing maize, barley, oats, wheat, tobacco, grapes, and oranges; coal and shale are regularly worked near the town; and a good trade is carried on with the interior townships. The inhabitants number 7881, East Maitland having 2500 and West Maitland 5381.
