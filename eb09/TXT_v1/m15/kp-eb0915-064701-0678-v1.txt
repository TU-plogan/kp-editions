MAXWELL, Sir William Stirling-, Bart. (1818— 1878), man of letters, the only son of Mr Archibald Stirling of Keir, Perthshire, and of Elizabeth, second daughter of Sir John Maxwell, seventh baronet of Pollok, Renfrewshire, was born at Kenmure, near Glasgow, in 1818. William Stirling was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated in 1839, and afterwards he spent some years on the Continent chiefly in France and Spain. Having succeeded his father as proprietor of Keir in 1846 (when he was made vice-lieutenant of Perthshire), he in 1852 entered parliament as member for that county; and he was several times re-elected. On the death of his uncle in 1865 he succeeded to the baronetcy and estates of Pollok, in respect of which he assumed the additional name of Maxwell. In the same year he became deputylieutenant of Lanarkshire, and a like office was conferred on him in Renfrewshire in 1870. The services which his talent, energy, and wealth enabled him to render to literature were recognized in a great variety of ways by numerous universities; in 1863 he was chosen lord rector of St Andrews, in 1871 the same honour was conferred by Edinburgh, and in 1875 he became chancellor of Glasgow. In the following year he was created a Knight of the Thistle, being the only commoner of the order. He died at Venice on January 15, 1878.

Sir W. Stirling-Maxwell’s works, which are invariably characterized by thoroughness of workmanship and refinement of literary taste, were in some cases issued for private circulation only, and almost all of them are now exceedingly rare. They include an early volume of verse (Songs of the Holy Land, 1847), and several volumes containing costly reproductions of old engravings, along with valuable explanatory matter. His best-known publications are Annals of the Artists of Spain (1848; 2d cd., 1853), The Cloister Life of Charles V. (1852; 3d ed., 1853), and Velazquez and his Works (1855). A life of Don John of Austria, from his posthumous papers, is now (1882) in the press.
