MARMONT, Auguste Frédéric Louis Viesse de (1774-1852), duke of Ragusa, and marshal of France, one of Napoleon’s earliest friends and most trusted generals, was born at Châtillon-sur-Seine, on July 20, 1774. He was the son of an ex-officer in the army, who belonged to the i)etite noblesse, and had adopted the principles of the Revolution. His love of soldiering soon showing itself, his father took him to Dijon to learn mathematics prior to entering the artillery, and there he made the acquaintance of Bonaparte, which he renewed after obtaining his commission when he served in Toulon. The acquaintance ripened into intimacy; Marmont became General Bonaparte’s aide-de-camp, and accompanied him to Italy and Egypt, winning distinction and promotion as general of brigade. In 1799 he left Egypt with Bonaparte to the mercy of the English; he was present at the revolution of the 18th Brumaire, and organized the artillery for the expedition to Italy, which he commanded with great effect at Marengo. For this he was at once made general of division. In 1801 he became inspector-general of artillery, and in 1804 grand officer of the Legion of Honour. In 1805 he received the command of a corps, with which he did good service at Ulm. He was then directed to occupy Dalmatia with his army; he defeated the Russians on October 30 at Castel Nuovo, and occupied Ragusa. The next five years were the most creditable in his life; he was both military and civil governor of Dalmatia, and has still left traces there both in great public works and in the memories of the people. In 1807 he was made duke of Ragusa, and in 1809, being summoned up to the help of Napoleon, who was closely beset in the island of Lobau, earned the marshal’s baton by his conduct at Wagram. In July 1810 he was hastily summoned from his palace, where he lived in Eastern luxury, to succeed Masséna in the command of the French army in the north of Spain, called the army of Portugal. The skill with which he manoeuvred his army during the year he commanded it has been always acknowledged. His relief of Ciudad Rodrigo in the autumn of 1811 in spite of the presence of the English army was a great feat, and in the tactics which preceded the battle of Salamanca he had the best of it. The extension of his left on the 22d July 1812 was, however, fatal, and its result was the great defeat of Salamanca, in which Marmont was severely wounded in the right arm and side. He retired to France to recover, and was still hardly cured when in April 1813 Napoleon gave him the command of the 6th corps. With [9:15:559] it he served at the battles of Lützen, Bautzen, and Dresden, and throughout the great defensive campaign of 1814, until the last desperate battle before the walls of Paris, from which he drew back his forces to the commanding position of Essonne. Here he had 20,000 men in splendid condition, and was the pivot of all thoughts. Napoleon said of Essonne, “C’est là que viendront s’addresser toutes les intrigues, toutes les trahisons; aussi y ai-je placé Marmont, mon enfant élevé sous ma tente.” Marmont betrayed this trust and suffered for it. On the restoration of the Bourbons he was made a peer of France, and a majorgeneral of the royal guard, and in 1820 a knight of St Esprit and a grand officer of the order of St Louis, but he was never trusted, never popular. He was the majorgeneral of the guard on duty in July 1830, and was ordered to put down with a strong hand any opposition to the ordinances (see France). After persevering some time he gave way, and allowed the republicans to succeed in their revolution. This defection brought more obloquy upon him, and the Due d’Angouleme even ordered him under arrest, saying, “Will you betray us, as you betrayed him?” After this Marmont left France and wandered about the Continent for twenty years, publishing many volumes of travels, an edition of Caesar and of Xenophon, and his Esprit des Institutions Militaires. Much of his time was spent upon his Mémoires, which are of real value for the military history of his time, though they must be read as a personal defence of himself in various junctures rather than as an unbiassed account of his times. They show Marmont, as he really was, an embittered man, who never thought his services sufficiently requited, a great artillery general indeed, but without the fire of genius which is so striking in several of his contemporaries, and above all, a man too much in love with himself and his own glory to be a true friend or a faithful servant.

For Mannont’s military ability consult Napier, Jomini, and tho historians of the time, particularly General Pelet. His own works are Voyage en Hongrie, &c., 4 vols., 1837; Voyage en Sicile, 1838; Esprit des Institutions Militaires, 1845; César; Xenophon ; and Mémoires, 8 vols., published after his death in 1856.
