MAP, Mapes, or Mapus, Walter, an ecclesiastical statesman and renowned wit of the 12th century, must be ranked among the greatest of English writers, though French was the language that he used, and his personal fame has long been lost in the splendour of his creations. He was the cosmogonist and one of the principal creators of the Round Table legends, which supplied the ideal of chivalrous life to so many succeeding centuries. Most of the facts that are known about his position in the world have been gathered from a gossipy anecdotical work of his in Latin, De Nugis Curialium. He was probably a native of Herefordshire or Gloucestershire. He tells us that his parents rendered services to Henry If. both before and after his accession. He was acquainted with the household of Thomas Becket before this famous ecclesiastic became archbishop of Canterbury, which wasin 1162. He studied in the university of Paris, attending the lectures of Girard la Pucelie, who began lecturing in 1160. Map seems to have risen rapidly in favour at the court of Henry If., combining ecclesiastical with civil and political functions. In 1173 he was an itinerant justice at the assize of Gloucester, and in the same year was with the court at Limoges, where the duty fell to him of entertaining the archbishop of Tarentaise, about whom he tells some marvellous stories. He was sent on a diplomatic mission to Louis le Jeune, king of France, and sat as a delegate in a council called by Pope Alexander III. (probably 1179), enjoying such repute that he was deputed to argue with the Waldenses. He accompanied Henry IT. on all his progresses, and in return for his services received several ecclesiastical preferments. Apparently he maintained his position at court under Richard and John. In 1196 he was appointed archdeacon of Oxford, and in 1207-8 the custodes of the abbey of Eynsham were ordered to pay him his accustomed rent of five marks per annum. In the 12th century the abuses of the church were assailed with great freedom and abundance of humorous wit in rhymed Latin verse, and a century or two later rubrics appear in the MSS. of these satirical poems ascribing them to Walter Map. “Golias Episcopus” is the nominal author and hero of a great many of these effusions; that is to say, they represent the sayings and doings of Golias, the revelation made to him, the confession made by him, his creed, his reasons for not marrying, and so forth. The fact that Map’s friend Giraldus Cambrensis denounces Golias as a foul-mouthed scoffer is rather against Map’s alleged authorship, and they have probably been attributed to him in consequence of his great reputation as a wit, and a tradition that he had such a hatred of the White Monks that he exempted them from his oath as king’s deputy to render even justice to all men. If these coarse and witty poems were really Map’s, they are a proof of astonishing versatility, for they offer as great a contrast as possible to the high imaginative qualities, gracious tenderness, pure and lofty idealism, of his contributions to the Round Table legends. This is not the place for an exposition of the origin of these legends, but the Quest du Saint Graal was undoubtedly written by Map, being assigned to him in the earliest MSS. Μ. Paulin Paris ascribes to him also, upon grounds which commend themselves as being at least highly probable, the Saint Graal, and the noble prologue and the concluding parts of Lancelot du Lac. The effect of these contributions to the cycle was to completely transform its character, making out of it a lofty spiritual allegory, and forcing the paganism of the earlier legends into the service of the morality of the church. With such consummate skill did Map insinuate his story of the Graal into the cycle that the separate legends of Lancelot, Gawain, Percival, and Tristan seem to grow out of it; the whole luxuriant and irregular growth acquires a unity from its connexion with this root and stem. This reorganizing achievement alone, apart from the high romantic value of Map’s independent additions, entitles him to a high place in literature.

The De Nugis Curialium and the Latin poems commonly attributed to Walter Mapes were edited by Mr Thomas Wright for the Camden Society; and the Quest du Saint Graal, by Mr Furnivall, for the Roxburghe Club.
