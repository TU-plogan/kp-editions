MÁRDÍN, a town of Turkish Kurdistan, the seat of a governor dependent on the pasha of Diarbekir, is situated in 37° 20' N. lat. and 4Γ E. long., about 60 miles southeast of Diarbekir, at a height of 3900 feet above the sea. Climbing the southern side of a steep conical hill (of soft limestone) in such a way that the roofs of the lower tier of houses serve as a·street for those immediately above, MArdin presents a very picturesque appearance; and on the summit of the hill, which affords an unusually wide view over the Mesopotamian plain, stand the ruins of the famous castle KaΓah Shuhbâ (Maride and Marde in Latin, and similarly in Syriac), which, at least from the time of the Romans, played an important part in the history of this region. The Arabian geographers characterize it as [9:15:536] impregnable; and, the approaches being extraordinarily steep, narrow, and well arranged for purposes of defence, it was able to offer a protracted resistance to the Mongolian conqueror Hulagu, and to the armies of Timur. The castle was for hundreds of years the residence of princes more or less independent. The town has not much commerce or industry, but the surrounding country is distinguished for its excellent water and general fertility, and more especially for its fruit trees and, melons. As regards their capacity and the honesty of their dealings, the people of Mârdin do not enjoy the best reputation. They are estimated to number from 15,000 to 18,000; in 1870 Professor Socin was informed in the town that there were 600 Jacobite, 300 Catholic Armenian, 200 Catholic Syrian, 30 Chaldaean, and 57 Protestant families. Among the Jacobites are included a few remnants of the old sect called Shemsiye. See Ritter, Erdkunde von Asien, 2d ed., vol. vii.
