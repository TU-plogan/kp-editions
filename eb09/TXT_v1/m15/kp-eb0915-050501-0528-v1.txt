MANUEL I., Comnenus, emperor of Constantinople from 1143 to 1184, was the fourth son of John II. (Calo-Joannes), and was born about the year 1120. He succeeded to the imperial crown on April 8, 1143, having for his martial qualities been nominated by John to the inheritance in preference to his elder surviving brother. During his reign of thirty-seven years he was involved in almost perpetual war, in which he displayed much more of the courage of a soldier than of the prudence and skill of a commander. In 1144 the imperial general Demetrius Branas brought back Raymond, the Latin prince of Antioch, to his allegiance, and in 1145 Manuel in person drove out the Turks who had invaded Isauria, and compelled them to accept peace on his own terms. In 1147 he granted a passage through his dominions to the crusaders under Louis VII. of France and Conrad III. of Germany, but secretly harassed them by every means in his power, and sent word to the Turks of their approach. In the following year he became involved, along with the Venetians, in a war with Roger of Sicily, who had taken Corfu and invaded Greece; an episode of the campaign towards its beginning was his repulse beyond the Danube of the Patzenegues, of whom he took hostages for their future good behaviour. Disembarking his host at Corfu before the end of the year, he invested the fortress in co-operation with the Venetian army; the inhabitants, after a long siege, in which he displayed prodigies of personal strength and valour, surrendered in 1149. Manuel was now prevented from invading Sicily by a diversion made by the Servians and Hungarians on the Danube, who were nut completely vanquished until 1152. In that year Manuel was repulsed by the Turks in Cilicia, but in the west his troops obtained possession of Bari, Brundisium, and other places of importance in Apulia and Calabria. r Γhe course of Italian politics, however, deprived him of ths means on which he had reckoned for enabling him to reunite southern Italy with the Byzantine empire, and after the defeat of his fleet at Negropont he concluded a peace with William, Roger’s successor, in 1155. The next important war of Manuel’s reign was waged against the Hungarians from 1163 to 1168; it came to an end in the latter year with the hard-won victory of the Byzantine arms at Zeugminum (Semlin). Less successful was the expedition under Andronicus Contostephanus against Egypt in 1169, when the combined forces of Manuel and King Amalric were compelled to withdraw from before Damietta. From 1171 to 1174 Manuel had a war with the Venetians; and in 1176 he led in person an expedition against Kilidj Arslan, the sultan of Iconium when he sustained a disastrous defeat at Myriocephalus, and was compelled to sign a dishonourable peace. This disgrace, although partially retrieved by a somewhat more successful expedition in 1177, so preyed upon the spirit of Manuel that he ultimately’succumbed to a slow fever on September 24, 1180. He was first married to Bertha (Irene), a relative of Conrad III. of Germany, and afterwards to Maria (Xene), daughter of Raymond of Antioch; Alexis II., his son by the latter, succeeded him.
