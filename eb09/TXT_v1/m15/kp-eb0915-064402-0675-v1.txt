MAXIMIANUS, Galerius Valerius, usually referred to by his name Galerius, Roman emperor from 305 to 311, was born near Sardica in Dacia, and originally followed his father’s occupation, that of a herdsman, whence his surname of Armentarius. He served with distinction as a soldier under Aurelian and Probus, and in 292 was designated Caesar along with Constantius, receiving in marriage Diocletian’s daughter Valeria, and at the same time having assigned to him as his special charge the care of the Illyrian provinces. In 296, at thebeginning of the Persian war, he was removed from the Danube to the Euphrates; his first campaign ended in a crushing defeat on the same field as that which had proved fatal to Crassus, but in 297, advancing through the mountains of Armenia, and taking the enemy by surprise, he gained a victory over Narses by which his military reputation was more than restored. In 305, on the abdication of Diocletian and Maximian, be at once assumed the title of Augustus, along with Constantius his former colleague, and, having procured the promotion to the rank of Caesar of Severus, a faithful servant, and Daza (Maximinus), his nephew, he hoped on the death of Constantius to become sole master of the Roman world. This scheme, however, was defeated by the sudden elevation of Constantine at York on the death of his father, and by the action of Maximian and Maxentius in Italy. After an unsuccessful invasion of Italy in 307 he elevated his friend Licinius to the rank of Augustus, and, moderating his ambition, devoted the few remaining years of his life “to the enjoyment of pleasure and to the execution of some works of public utility.” He died—of the morbus pedicularis, it is said—in May 311. It was at the instance of Galerius that the first of the celebrated edicts of persecution against the Christians was published, on February 24, 303, and this policy of repression was maintained by him until the appearance of the general edict of toleration, running in his own name and in those of Licinius and Constantine.
