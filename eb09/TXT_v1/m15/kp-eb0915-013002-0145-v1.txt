MACBETH, Macbethad, or Macbeda, son of Finnlaech, was king of Scotland from 1040 to 1057. He had previously been “mormaer” of Moravia or Moray; and his predecessor on the throne was Duncan, son of Crinan, and grandson of Malcolm, whom he slew (according to some accounts at “Bothgowan,” said to have been near Elgin). Macbeth’s wife was Gruoch, a descendant of the royal house. Of the events of his reign almost nothing is known. The ecclesiastical records of St Andrews bear that he and his wife, “rex et regina Scotorum,” made over certain lands to the Culdees of Lochleven; and in 1050 he appears to have visited Rome, perhaps to obtain absolution for the murder of Duncan. The sons of Duncan, who had taken refuge with their uncle Siward, earl of Northumberland, brought about an invasion of Scotland in 1054; a battle was fought at Dunsinnane with indecisive results, but three years afterwards Macbeth fell at Lumphanan in Aberdeenshire (August 15, 1057). The war was continued for some time in the interests of a certain Lulach, the son of Queen Gruoch by a former marriage; but he too was slain in Strathbogie in March 1058, and Malcolm, the son of Duncan, ascended the throne.

See Skene, Celtic Scotland, vol. i. chap. 8; and compare Burton {History of Scotland, vol. i. chap. 10 ad fin.), who gives special prominence to the circumstance that when the genealogy of the Scottish kings is traced upwards the first break in the hereditary succession occurs when Macbeth is reached; the break of continuity at this point becomes all the more prominent when it is found that the father of Macbeth’s successor had occupied the throne. “This had to be accounted for, and the easiest way was by treating the intruder as a ‘usurper.’ The loyal monks of the 15th century looked on a usurper with horror. Being so placed in the seat of political infamy, we have perhaps the reason why so many events, natural and supernatural, came to cluster round the career of Macbeth.” It is most probable that Shakespeare’s only source for the tragedy of Macbeth was the Chronicles of Holinshed (derived from John of Fordun and Hector Boece).
