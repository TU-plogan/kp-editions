MELCHIZEDEK “king of righteousness ”), king of Salem and priest of “supreme El” (El t elyon), brought forth bread and wine to Abram, on bis return from the expedition against Chedorlaomer, and blessed him in the name of the supreme God, possessor (or maker) of heaven and earth. And Abram gave him tithes of all his booty (Gen. xiv. 18-20). The Bible history tells us nothing more about Melchizedek (comp. Hebrews vii. 3); but the majestic figure of the king-priest, prior to the priesthood of the law, to whom even the father of all Israel paid tithes, suggested a figurative or typical application, first in Psalm ex. to the vicegerent of Jehovah, seated on the throne of Zion, the king of Israel who is also priest after the order of Melchizedek, and then, after the gospel had confirmed the Messianic interpretation of the Psalm (Matt, xxii. 42 sy.), to the kingly priesthood of Jesus, as that idea is worked out at length in the Epistle to the Hebrews.

The theological interest which attaches to the idea of the pre-Aaronic king-priest in these typical applications is practically independent of the historical questions suggested by the narrative of Gen. xiv. It is generally recognized that this chapter holds quite an isolated place in the Pentateuchal history; it is the only passage which presents Abraham in the character of a warrior, and connects him with historical names and political movements, and there are no clear marks by which it can be assigned to any one of the documents of which Genesis is made up. Thus, while one school of interpreters finds in the chapter the earliest fragment of the political history of western Asia, some even holding with Ewald that the narrative is probably based on old Canaanite records, other critics, as Nqldeke, regard the whole as unhistorical and comparatively late in origin. On the latter view, which finds its main support in the intrinsic difficulties of the narrative, it is scarcely possible to avoid the conclusion that the chapter is one of the latest additions to the Pentateuch (Wellhausen). The historical arguments pro and con may be seen at length in recent commentaries, but especially in Tuch’s essay (Z. D. Μ. G., i. 161 sq., reprinted in the second edition of his Genesis), which was long viewed as decisive in favour of the narrative, and in Nöldeke’s Untersuchungen, 1869, p. 156 sq., with which compare Wellhausen in Jahrb. f. D. Th., 1876, p. 414 sq The Assyrian monuments offer no decisive evidence, but are held to confirm the historical possibility of the proper names (Schrader, Kl. und AT., p. 46 sq. ; Delitzsch, Paradies, p. 224). Here we can only speak of the episode of Melchizedek, which, though connected with the main narrative by the epithets given to Jehovah in verse 22, seems to break the natural connexion of verses 17 and 21, and may perhaps have come originally from a separate source. As the narrative now stands Salem must be sought in the vicinity of “the king’s dale,” which from 1 Sam. xviii. 18 probably but not necessarily lay near Jerusalem. That Salem is Jerusalem, as in Psalm lxxvi. 2, is the ancient and common view, and is necessarily followed by those who view Melchizedek as a late creation. Those who hold the opposite view now lean to the identification with the ∑αλ∈iμ of John iii. 23, 8 miles south of Bethshean, which Jerome {Ep. lxxiii. ad Evangelium) confirms by a worthless tradition. In a genuine record of extreme antiquity the union of king and priest in one person, the worship of El as the supreme deity by a Canaanite,^[1. On the other hand it is not correct to appeal to the Poenulus of Plautus for the epithet elyôn.] and the widespread practice of the consecration of a tithe of booty can present no difficulty; but, if the historical character of the narrative is denied, the origin of the conception must be placed as late as the rise of the temporal authority of the high priests after the exile. An ancient legend identifies Melchizedek with Shem (Palestinian Targum, Jerome on Isa. xli., Ephraem Syrus in loco).
