MADURA, in High Javanese Madunten, an island of the East Indian Archipelago, separated by the shallow Strait of Madura from the east end of Java. It extends from about 112’ 32' to 114’ 7' E. long., and is divided into two nearly equal portions by the parallel of 7’ S. lat.; the· area is estimated at 2100 square miles. As the few travellers who have visited Madura have been for the most part content to follow the highways which, though running the whole length of the island, never strike very far inland either from the north or the south coast, a considerable part of the country is but vaguely known to Europeans. It may be safely asserted, however, that the general configuration is fairly simple,—the island being a plateau-like prolongation of the limestone range of northern Java, with frequent interchange of hill and dale, culminating towards the east in G unong Pedjudan or Tambuko at a height of 1542 feet. Hot springs are not unfrequent; and in the valley between Gunong Geger and Bandjar lies the mud volcano of Banju Ening. “Round the coast runs a girdle of tropical vegetation, broken only here and there by small white peaks with steep perpendicular cliffs ;” but, except in a few alluvial tracts in the lower courses of the streams, the soil is thin and poor, and better fitted for pastoral than agricultural purposes. Maize is by far the most important of the crops; it is planted after rice in the non-irrigable sawahs, and often before it in the irrigable; in the tagal fields it is sometimes sown thrice in a single year, frequently along with hαtjang (various kinds of native beans). European enterprise has not yet invaded the island; there is only one sugar plantation, Tedjeh, near Pamakasan, established in 1835. Much attention is paid to the rearing of cattle,—the small Madura oxen being greatly prized in Java, and consequently forming a regular article of export. Petroleum is found in small quantities in all the departments, but the most valuable product of the island is its salt (hence perhaps the name Madura; Sansk. Mandura, salt). The manufacture, a Dutch Government monopoly, was formerly carried on in several places, as at Brantah and Bunder (where the salt pans now serve as fish ponds), but in 1870 Sumenep was made the sole establishment for Java and Madura, and it still remains by far the most important, though its annual production of 875,000 cwts. has since 1875 to be supplemented by Ragung and Pangaringan. The population of Madura was in 1879 returned as 768,992,—472 Europeans (mostly at Maringan near Sumenep), 3702 Chinese, 1445 Arabs and other Orientals, and 763,373 natives. These last constitute one of the three great races of Java and Madura, and speak a distinct language, for which compare Java, vol. xiii.

The following are the places of chief note in the island. Kamal at the south-west corner is the point where people usually cross from Java. Bangkalang is the large and flourishing chief town of Madura proper, with the old palace of the sultan ana the residences of the princes of the blood; the mosque is adorned with the first three suras of the Koran, thus differing from nearly all the mosques in Java and Madura, though resembling those of western Islam. In the vicinity once stood the Erfprins fort. Arisbaya (less correctly Arosbaya) is the place where the first mosque was built in Madura, and where the Dutch sailors first made acquaintance with the natives. The once excellent harbour is now silted up. Ajermata, so called from its salt-springs, is the burial-place of the princes of Bangkalang. Pamakasan, though a town of considerable extent, presents nothing worthy of notice apart from the regent’s residence. Sampang, the seat of an important market, seems hardly so flourishing as in Valentyn’s days. The town or kotα of Sumenep had 15,000 inhabitants in 1846; and there are populous Malay, Arab, and Chinese villages between the town and the European settlement of Maringan. On a hill in the neighbourhood, with a fine outlook over the Bay of Sumenep, lies Asta, the burial-place of the Sumenep princes; and Nâtâ Kusuma’s mausoleum excels everything of the kind in Java.

Madura formerly consisted of three native states—Madura or Bangkalang, Pamakasan, and Sumenep. Dutch authority was represented by an assistant resident, and the whole island considered part of the Java residency of Surabaya. The separate residency of Madura was constituted in 1857. On the death of the second sultan of .Bangkalang (1847) the title had been reduced to that of panembahan; [9:15:194] and in 1872 the new ruler was deprived of the right of collecting taxes, and made a Government pensioner, while his territory was split into the two Dutch “departments” of Madura and Sampang. The sultan of Sumenep was in like manner succeeded by a panembahan in 1853; and the death of the panembahan in 1879 afforded an opportunity of enlarging the Government control. There are thus four “departments” in Madura,—Pamakasan, Madura, Sumenep, and Sampang. The first three are also regencies, and the fourth a subregency of Bangkalang; but Pamakasan alone has the full regency organization. The number of village communities is 1271.

The best systematic account of Madura will be found in Professor Veth’s Java, vol. iii., the proof sheets of which have, by the author’s courtesy, been consulted for this article.
