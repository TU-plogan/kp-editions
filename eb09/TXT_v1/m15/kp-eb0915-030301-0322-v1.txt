MÁINPURÁ, or Mynpookee, a district in the lieutenantgovernorship of the North-Western Provinces, India, between 26° 52' 30" and 27° 30' N. lat., and 78° 27' 45" and 79° 28' 30" E. long., is bounded on the N. by Etah, on the E. by Farrukhâbâd, on the S. by Etawah, and on the W. by Muttra and Agra, and has an area of 1697 square miles, of which 949 are cultivated, and 190 cultivable. It consists of an almost unbroken level plain, intersected by small rivers, but unvaried by any greater elevations than a few undulating sand ridges. It is wooded throughout with mango groves, and isolated clumps of bâlnd trees occasionally relieve the bareness of its saline usar plains. On the south-western boundary the Jumna flows in a deep alluvial bed, sometimes sweeping close to the high banks which overhang its valley, and at others leaving room for a narrow strip of fertile soil between the river and the upland plain. From the low-lying lands thus formed a belt of ravines stretches inland for some 2 miles, often covered with jungle, but affording good pasturage for cattle. Moving north-eastward from this point, one reaches in succession the small rivers Aganga, Sengar, Rind, Isan, and Kâli Nadi, most of which supply water to a small tract on either side, besides giving origin to rich deposits of cultivable silt. The Etawah and Cawnpur branches of the Ganges canal intersect the district for irrigation purposes, and the Lower Ganges canal, when completed, will furnish additional facilities in the same direction.

The census of 1872 returned the population of the district at 765,783 (males, 426,955; females, 338,828). The Hindus numbered 724,663, Mohammedans 40,965, Christians 85. Among high-caste Hindus, the Brahmans number 67,072, and form a wealthy landholding class. Rajputs are returned at 60,155⅛ amongst whom the Chauhans form the largest clan. They have long formed the aristocratic class of the district, and in 1872 owned 44 per cent, of the total area. Much of their hereditary property is, however, passing out of their hands into those of merchants and traders. Of the lower castes, the most important are the Ahirs, numbering 123,358, who own over 12 per cent, of the soil. For many centuries this tribe consisted of lawless robber hordes, who held the fastnesses of the Jumna ravines; and, though they have now been reduced to a comparatively industrial life, they still continue to afford the local authorities much trouble and anxiety. The Chamârs, 103,193 in number, are mere hewers of wood and drawers of water for the landholding classes, who held them in a condition of absolute serfdom under native rale. Other important Hindu tribes are Kâchhis (72,898), Lodhas (53,658), Gadariyas (28,047), and Kahârs (25,273). The Moslems are for the most part poor and without social influence. Only four towns in the district contain a population exceeding 5000: Mainpuri, 21,117; Sbikohâbâd, 10,069; Bhongâon, 6271; and Karhal, 5574.

Mainpuri is one of the districts where the question of female infanticide has long, engaged the attention of Government, and even as late as 1872 this practice was so common as in a great measure to account for the large preponderance of males in the general population. In 1842 measures were first introduced for the supervision of the Chauhân Rajputs and Phâtak Ahirs, among whom the practice was most common. Every female birth had to be duly reported and authenticated, together with a subsequent report on the child’s health. Illness had to be immediately announced to the police, who held an investigation. These rules remained in force until supplemented by those of the Infanticide Act of 1870. In 1843 there was not a single female child among these tribes; in 1847 there were but two hundred and ninety-nine. In 1851 a convention of the heads of clans was held, when a body of rales was drawn up and subscribed to, but they were never observed. In 1865 a census of the Chauhân and Phatak villages was held, when six of the former were found without a single female infant. In some cases a daughter had never been known in the village. In 1870 it was found necessary to impose more stringent rales, and a special Infanticide Act was passed by the viceregal council. Inquiries instituted in connexion with the census of 1872 revealed the fact that many other tribes than the Chauhans and Phâtaks were implicated in the practice. In 1875, although a large proportion of the community had so far reformed in this respect as to be exempted from the special supervision provided by the Infanticide Act, there were still two hundred and seventy-six villages on the “proclaimed list” under the surveillance of a specially organized police, maintained by a tax levied on the guilty communities.

In Mainpuri almost every acre of available soil is under tillage. The total area under cultivation at the date of the last settlement was 607,991 acres. Khαrif or rain crops included cotton, 48,901 acres; joar, 120,497; b(tjra, 74,028; indigo, 5369; with a little maize, rice, hemp, &c., making up a total of 299,850 acres. Rabi, or spring crops were the following :—wheat, 105,488 acres; barley, 60,443; wheat and barley mixed together, 66,488; with gram, poppy, &c., making a total of 282,376 acres. There were also 17,523 acres under sugar-cane. Of the 607,360 acres cultivated in 1881, 337,726 were unirrigated, 180,415 were irrigated by private individuals, and 89,219 by Government. Two-thirds of the land is held by tenants with rights of occupancy, and one-third by tenants-at-will. Mainpuri suffers little from floods or blights, but in former years it used to be severely afflicted by drought. The means of communication, added to the large and increasing irrigation system, are now probably sufficient to protect the district from extreme distress in years of famine.

The district trade is almost entirely of a rural character. The chief exports are cotton, grain, indigo, gbi, and miscellaneous agricultural produce; while metals, English piece goods, sugar, [9:15:304] pedlar’s wares, tobacco, and rice are imported. Cotton thread is largely manufactured, and there is some trade in bangles, hukΛs or pipes, inlaid wood-work, and other fancy articles. Saltpetre is refined at several factories. The district is thoroughly supplied with land and water communications. Good metalled roads connect all the principal towns and villages; the East Indian Railway runs for 23 miles through the south-western angle; the navigable branch of the Ganges canal intersects the central plateau; and the natural highway of the Jumna skirts the district to the south.

The gross amount of assessment in 1880-81 was £115,132. Education was afforded in 1880-81 by 151 schools with 4146 pupils. The climate is hot but not excessively sultry during the summer months, and damp or foggy during the cold weather rains. The average annual rainfall for the five years ending 1870-71 was 32 , 20 inches. The chief endemic disease is malarial fever.

Mainpuri anciently formed part of the great kingdom of Kanauj, and after the fall of that famous state it was divided into a number of petty principalities, of which Râpri and Bhongaon were the chief. In 1194 Râpri was made the seat of a Moslem governor. Mainpuri fell to the Mughals on Bâbar’s invasion in 1526, and, although temporarily wrested from them by the short-lived Afghan dynasty of Sher Shah, was again occupied by them on the reinstatement of Humâyûn after the victory of Pânipat. Like the rest of the lower Doâb, Mainpuri passed, towards the end of the last century, into the power of the Mahrattas, and finally became a portion of the Erovince of Oudh. When this part of the country was ceded to the ritish in 1801, Mainpuri town became the headquarters of the ex-extensive district of Etawah, which was in 1856 reduced by the formation of Etah and Mainpuri into separate collectorates. On the outbreak of the mutiny in 1857, the regiment stationed at Mainpuri revolted, and attacked the town, which was successfully defended by the few Europeans of the station for a week, until the arrival of the Jhausi mutineers made it necessary to abandon the district.

Mâinpurî, the chief town and headquarters of the above district, is situated in 27° 14' 15" N. lat., 79° 3' 5" E. long., and had a population in 1872 of 21,117, viz., Hindus, 17,596; Mohammedans, 3435; Christians and “others,” 146. The town consists of two separate portions, Mâinpurî proper and Mukhamganj; the former traditionally dates from the prehistoric period of the Mahabhdrata, while the latter was founded by Râjâ Jas want Sinh in 1803. Holkar plundered and burned part of the town in 1804, but was repulsed by the local militia. Since the British occupation the population has rapidly increased, and many improvements have been carried out. The Agra branch of the Grand Trunk Road runs through the centre, and forms a wide street lined on both sides by shops, which constitute the principal bazaar. Besides the usual Government offices, &c., in the civil station, the chief buildings are the police station, opium warehouses, jail, post-office, dispensary, two large schools, American Presbyterian mission, church, reading-rooms; there are two public gardens. The town carries on a considerable trade in cotton, indigo seed, country produce, and iron; and there is a manufacture of wooden articles inlaid with wire.
