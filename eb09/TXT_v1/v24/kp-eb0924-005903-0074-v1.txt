VANDEVELDE, William (1633-1707), the younger, marine painter, a son of William Vandevelde, the elder, also a painter of sea-pieces, was born at Amsterdam in 1633. He was instructed by his father, and afterwards by Simon de Vlieger, a marine painter of repute at the time, and had achieved great celebrity by his art before he came to London. In 1674 he was engaged by Charles II., at a salary of <£100, to aid his father in “taking and making draughts of sea-fights,” his part of the work being to reproduce in colour the drawings of the elder Vandevelde. He was also patronized by the duke of York and by various members of the nobility. He died in London on 6th April 1707.

It seems probable that most of Vandevelde’s finest works were executed before his residence in England, for they represent views off the coast of Holland, with Dutch shipping. His best productions are delicate, spirited, and finished in handling, and correct in the drawing of the vessels and their rigging. The numerous figures are tellingly introduced, and the artist is successful in his renderings of sea, whether in calm or storm. His later productions are less carefully finished, and less pure and transparent in colour. Vandevelde was a most prolific artist: in addition to his paintings, of which Smith catalogues about three hundred arid thirty, he executed an immense number of drawings, sketches, and studies, which are prized by collectors.
