VITEBSK, a government of western Russia, with Livonia and Pskoff on the N., Smolensk on the E., Moghileff, Minsk, and Vilna on the S., and Courland on the W., has an area of 17,440 square miles. Except on its south-eastern and northern borders, where there are low hills, deeply eroded by the rivers, its surface is mostly flat, or slightly undulating, and more than a million of acres are occupied by immense marshes, with as many as 2500 small lakes. The Devonian limestones and red sandstones of which it is built up are covered with thick layers of Glacial and Lacustrine deposits,—the Glacial boulderclay, with immense numbers of boulders, covering extensive areas. The rest consists of Lacustrine clays or sands. The soil is thus for the most part unproductive.

The Düna, or West Dwina, rises not far from the north-eastern angle of the government, and flows through it, or along its southern boundary, for 530 miles. From its junction with the Kasplya, i.e., for more than 450 miles, it is navigable; and, through a tributary, the Ulia, it is connected with the Dnieper by the Berezina Canal. The Mezha and Kasplya, tributaries of the Düna, are navigable in spring. The climate is relatively mild, the average yearly temperature at Vitebsk being 40° F. (January, 16° ∙4; July, 64° ∙3).

The population, 1,204,950 in 1884, is chiefly White Russian (61 per cent.) and Lettish (21 per cent.); Jews come next (10 per cent. ). The Poles make only about 2∙3 per cent. of the population, and there are moreover about 10,000 Germans in the north-west. The Great Russians number only a few thousands. Nearly two-thirds of the inhabitants are Orthodox or Raskolnik, the remainder being Catholics, Jews, or Lutherans.

Agriculture is the chief industry, but the yearly produce rarely suffices for the wants of the population, and corn has to be imported from Smolensk. Rye, oats, and potatoes are the chief crops, occupying about a third of the area. Flax is an important crop for export. Cattle-breeding is only moderately prosperous. Manufactures in 1884 occupied only some 3000 persons, and their aggregate production reached only about £788,700 (as against £84,000 in 1860); the most important branches are represented by distilleries, flourmills, and tanneries. As a rule, the White Russian population of the villages is very poor, and great numbers of the peasants are compelled every year to leave their homes in search of work. Of domestic trades, the manufacture of wooden wares, as well as some boat-building and flax-combing, may be mentioned. The principal exports are flax, linseed, timber, and hides. There is a brisk water-traffic on the Düna by boats to Riga, Vitebsk loading-places contributing 1,128,500 cwts. (483,000 roubles value) loaded and 630,000 cwts. discharged in 1883.

Vitebsk is divided into twelve districts, the chief towns of which, with populations in 1885, are Vitebsk (54,680), Drissa (3490), Dünaburg, a fortress on the Düna (69,030), Gorodok (5620), Lepel (6000), Lutsin (5460), Nevel (7310), Polotsk (19,130), Ryezhitsa (10,150), Sebezh (3820), Surazh (5085), and Velizh (16,370).
