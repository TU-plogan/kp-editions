VICTOR EMMANUEL (1820-1878), king of Italy, born at Turin on 14th March 1820, was the son of Charles Albert, prince of Carignano, who in 1831 became king of Sardinia. He was brought up with some severity and as a strict Catholic; but it was not found possible to interest him in study or intellectual pursuits. In 1842 he was married to Adelaide, daughter of the Austrian grand-duke Rainer, his father at that time desiring to improve his relations with Austria. The young man took no part in politics, but showed from the first the characteristics of an energetic soldier. After the Austrian occupation of Ferrara in 1847 he was among those who pressed for an immediate declaration of war; and, when a year later hostilities broke out, he threw himself into the struggle heart and soul. At Goito, where he was wounded, his reckless bravery turned the tide of battle; and in every encounter he was to be seen in the thickest of the fight. During the armistice that followed the defeat of Custozza (25th July) he was engaged in the reorganization of the Sardinian army. The abdication of his father on the evening of the battle of Novara (23d March 1849) made him king of a ruined state. From Radetzky he obtained some mitigation of the hard terms at first demanded by the conqueror, especially in the withdrawal of the Austrian claim that the Sardinian constitution should be abolished. It was the maintenance of this constitution, at a time when reaction swept away every other vestige of representative government in Italy, that gained for Victor Emmanuel the title of the honest king (re galantuomo) and won for him the confidence of the Italian nation, and ultimately the Italian crown. In the bitter days that followed Novara, the king, calumniated, misunderstood, and charged like his father with treachery, showed a noble forbearance and a self-mastery that could hardly have been expected from his passionate uncultured nature. Though in D’Azeglio and Balbo he had excellent friends and advisers, it was not till 1852 that the accession of Cavour (q.v.) to power gave him a man of great political genius for his guide. From that time the career of Victor Emmanuel became what Cavour made it. While ecclesiastical reforms, which brought upon the king and minister the execration of the church, laid the foundation for all future social and economical advance, the alliance of Sardinia with England and France in the Crimean War secured for Italy the interest of the Western powers, which Austria by its inaction and its half-measures had forfeited. Meanwhile his mother, his wife, and his brother died within four weeks of each other; and the clericals exulted in this manifestation of an offended Providence. At the end of 1855, while the allied troops were still in the East, Victor Emmanuel visited Paris and London. In 1859 Cavour’s object was attained and France united with Sardinia against Austria, the king, sorely against his will, giving his daughter Clotilda in marriage to Jerome Napoleon. Victor Emmanuel met Napoleon III. at Genoa on 13th May, and on the 30th fought at the head of a body of Sardinians and Zouaves at the battle of Palestro. After the victory of Magenta (4th June) the allied monarchs entered Milan, where Victor Emmanuel for the first time saw Garibaldi. In the crowning victory of 24th June, while the French were engaged at Solferino, the king with his Italians carried the village of San Martino. The peace of Villafranca left Venetia and the Quadrilateral to Austria. The extraordinary events of the next year united all Italy, with the exception of Rome and of what still remained to Austria, under the patriot king, who was now excommunicated by the pope (see Italy, vol. xiii. p. 490). A scene of great violence had passed between the king and Cavour when the peace of Villafranca was accepted by the former; but their old friendship was soon restored, and the death of Cavour in 1861 plunged Victor Emmanuel in the deepest grief. The Prussian alliance of 1866 incorporated Venetia with Italy. The personal desire of the king to assist Napoleon III. in the war of 1870 gave way before the wiser counsels of his ministers; and the entry of his troops into Rome after the disasters of the French army and the withdrawal of the French garrison completed Victor Emmanuel’s task and the union of Italy. He lived [9:24:215] for eight years more, reigning always as a constitutional king, and preserving amidst the splendours of a great court the simple tastes of his early life. He died at Rome of a fever on 9th January 1878, and lies entombed in the Pantheon.
