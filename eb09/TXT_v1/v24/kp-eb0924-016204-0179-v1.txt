VERA, Augusto (1817-1885), the chief representative of Hegelianism in Italian philosophy, was born at Amelia in the province of Perugia on 4th May 1817. He completed his education in Paris, and, after teaching classics for some years in Switzerland, was appointed professor of philosophy in connexion with the university of France. Attaching himself to Hegel’s system with the enthusiasm of a disciple, Vera (who wrote fluently both in French and English as well as in Italian) became widely influential in spreading a knowledge of the Hegelian doctrine. Without any marked originality, his writings are distinguished by the lucidity of their exposition, and by their genuine philosophic spirit. Among his numerous works may be mentioned Introduction à la Philosophie d'Hégel (1853, 2d ed. 1864); Problème de la Certitude (1861); Mélanges Philosophiques (1862); Essais de Philosophie Hégélienne (1864); Strauss, l’Ancienne et la Nouvelle Foi (1873), an attack upon Strauss’s last “confession,” written from the standpoint of an orthodox Hegelian; and a comprehensive work in Italian, Il Problema dell’ Assoluto, belonging to his later years. His English works are an Inquiry into Speculative and Experimental Science (1856), more recently an Introduction to Speculative Logic and Philosophy, and a translation of Bretschneider’s History of Religion and of the Christian Church. Vera also translated a number of Hegel’s works into French, with introductions and commentaries, including the Logic, the Philosophy of Nature, the Philosophy of Spirit, and the Philosophy of Religion. In 1860 Vera returned to Italy, where he was made professor of philosophy in the royal academy of Milan. In the following year he was transferred to Naples as professor of philosophy in the university there. His Prolusioni alla Storia della Filosofia and Lezioni sulla Filosofia della Storia connect themselves with the work of his chair, which was specially devoted to the [9:24:163] history of philosophy and the philosophy of history. He held this post till his death, which took place at Naples in the autumn of 1885.

A Life of Vera, in two volumes, has been published by Signor Mariano, a friend and follower.
