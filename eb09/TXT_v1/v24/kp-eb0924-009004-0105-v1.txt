VARNA, a fortified town and seaport of Bulgaria, in 43° 12' N. lat. and 27° 56' E. long., about midway between the Danube delta and the Bosphorus, lies on the north side of the Bay of Varna, at the opening of the Pravadi valley, 5 miles wide and skirted by hills on both sides. The town, which covers the slope of one of these hills, facing seawards, comprises Greek, Bulgarian, Turkish, Jewish, and Gipsy quarters, with a total population (1888) of 25,256 (8449 Bulgarians, 7569 Turks, 5423 Greeks). It has many finely built houses and shops. Its principal buildings are the gymnasium, a hospital, the barracks, and several churches and mosques. Amongst the industrial establishments are soap factories, breweries, distilleries, and tanneries. More than 3,740,000 gallons of wine are made annually within the department of Varna. The town is well supplied with good water, and is not unhealthy. Although open to the south and south-east, the bay affords safe anchorage, being sheltered from the north and north-east winds. Through the Pravadi it communicates with Lake Devno, which, if connected, as has been proposed, by a navigable canal with the bay, would form one of the best harbours in the Euxine. Varna is the chief outlet for the grain and agricultural produce of Bulgaria for Constantinople and the west of Europe, the export of grain in 1887 amounting in value to £244,210 (total exports, £349,030) and the total imports to £580,300. It lies 48 miles east of Shumla (Shumna), with which it is connected by the main Bulgarian railway, running thence to the Danube at Rustchuk,—these three fortresses forming with Silistria (on the Danube) the Bulgarian “quadrilateral.” The old stone walls of Varna have been destroyed to make room for earth-fortifications.

Varna has been identified with the ancient Milesian colony of Odessus on the coast of Moesia Inferior. It figures largely in the history of more recent times, and close by was fought in 1444 the battle in which Amurath (Murad) II. slew the Hungarian King Ladislaus, and routed his forces commanded by the renowned John Hunyady. Varna was occupied in 1828 by the Russians, in 1854 by the allies, who here organized the invasion of the Crimea, and in 1877 by the Egyptian troops summoned to the defence of Turkey against the Russians. The following year it was ceded to the principality of Bulgaria. It has long been the seat of a Greek metropolitan and since 1870 of a Bulgarian bishop.
