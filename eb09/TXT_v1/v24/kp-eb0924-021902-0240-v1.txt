VIEN, Joseph Marie (1716-1809), French painter, was not only the master but the forerunner of David, and the author of the classic movement which, inaugurated under Louis XVI., ran itself out under the first empire. He was born at Montpellier, 18th June 1716. Protected by Comte de Caylus, he entered at an early age the studio of Natoire, and obtained the great prize in 1745. He used his time at Rome in applying to the study of nature and the development of his own powers all that he gleaned from the masterpieces around him; but his tendencies were so foreign to the reigning taste that on his return to Paris he owed his admission to the academy for his picture Daedalus and Icarus (Louvre) solely to the indignant protests of Boucher. When in 1776, at the height of his established reputation, he became director of the school of France at Rome, he took David with him amongst his pupils. After his return, five years later, his fortunes were wrecked by the Revolution; but he undauntedly set to work, and at the age of eighty (1796) carried off the prize in an open Government competition. Bonaparte acknowledged his merit by making him a senator. He died at Paris on 27th March 1809, leaving behind him several brilliant pupils, amongst whom were Vincent, Regnault, Suvée, Ménageot, Taillasson, and others of high merit; nor should the name of his wife, Marie Thérèse Reboul (1728-1805), herself a member of the academy, be omitted from this list. Their son, Marie Joseph, born in 1761, also distinguished himself as a painter.
