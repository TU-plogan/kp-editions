VIAU, or Viaud, Théophile de (1590-1626), more commonly called both in his own time and since simply Théophile, a poet of unfortunate life and of great but misused powers, was born at Clairac near Agen in 1590. He went to the capital in his twentieth year and ingratiated himself with at least one patron, the ill-fated duke of Montmorency, who was always constant to him. He also became acquainted with most of the literary men of the time, and in 1617 composed and produced with success the tragedy of Pyrame et Thisbe. This piece, written in the extravagant Spanish-Italian manner which was fashionable in the interval between the Pléiade model and the innovations of Corneille, was later the subject of much ridicule, especially directed to the passage in which a sword, reddened with the blood of its master, is said to “blush for its treason,” no very unpardonable conceit in eyes less pedantic than Boileau’s. Théophile’s prosperity was not lasting. Only two years after the success of Pyrame he was accused of blasphemous and indecent writings, and was exiled to England. Returning in 1621 and joining the Roman Church (he had been a Huguenot), he served in two campaigns. But he was, rightly or wrongly, associated with the publication of the Parnasse Satirique, a collection of poems of the same character as those which had formerly got him into trouble, and in 1623 was tried, condemned in his absence to death, arrested, and imprisoned in the conciergerie. At length the sentence of death which hung over him was reduced to banishment, and the influence of Montmorency enabled him to hide himself in Paris till his death on 25th September 1626.

For his singular persecution, which, even if the charges had been much better established than they are, would have been surprising enough in an age of unusually loose conduct and writing, the machinations of the Jesuits are sometimes held responsible. But if Théophile had bitter enemies he had warm friends. Six years after his death Georges de Scudéry edited his work with a Tombeau (copy of obituary verses), and a challenge in the preface to any one who might be offended by the editor’s eulogy of the poet This was in 1632; the year before had appeared a tragedy entitled Ρasi-phaé, where the awkwardness of the subject is not redeemed by any merit of treatment; but it is by no means certainly or even probably[9:24:209] Théophile’s, and is not included in his works, the standard modern edition of which is that of Alleaume in the Bibliothèque Elzévirienne (Paris, 2 vols., 1856). These works may surprise the reader who only knows Théophile’s mishaps and ill-fame; for, though varied enough, they contain in the certainly authentic part of them nothing discreditable. Besides Pyrame et Thisbé, the chief in point of bulk is a paraphrase, half verse half prose, after the odd fashion of the time, of the Phaedo. There are numerous French and Latin letters, a vigorous Apologie rebutting the accusations against him, a promising fragment of comic prose narrative, and a large collection of occasional verses, odes, elegies, stanzas, &c. These latter, besides being very unequal, are distinguished by the faults of taste and the inelegance of language which marked the first quarter of the century. But there are occasionally bursts of real poetry; and on the whole Théophile is the superior of all his contemporaries between Regnier and Corneille. In addition to Alleaume’s edition, a delightful article in Gautier’s Grotesques should be consulted respecting him.
