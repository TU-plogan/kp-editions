VALERIAN, a genus of herbaceous perennial plants of the natural order Valerianaceae. Two species— Valeriana officinalis, L. (see vol. iv. pl. VIII.), and V. dioica, L., —are indigenous in England, while a third, V. pyrenaica, L., is naturalized in some parts of Scotland and the west of England. The valerians have opposite leaves and small flowers, usually of a white or reddish tint, and arranged in terminal cymes. The limb of the calyx is remarkable for being at first inrolled and afterwards expanding in the form of pappus. The genus comprises about 150 species. In medicine the root of V. officinalis is intended when valerian is mentioned. The plant grows throughout Europe from Spain to the Crimea, and from Iceland through northern Europe and Asia to the coasts of Manchuria. Several varieties of the plant are known, those growing in hilly situations being considered the most valuable for medicinal purposes. Valerian is cultivated in England (in several villages near Chesterfield in Derbyshire), but to a much greater extent in Prussian Saxony (in the neighbourhood of Cölleda, north of Weimar), in Holland, and in the United States (Vermont, New Hampshire, and New York).

The dried root or rhizome consists of a short central erect portion, about the thickness of the little finger, surrounded by numerous rootlets about 1 / 10 of an inch in diameter, the whole being of a dull brown colour. When first taken from the ground it has no distinctive smell; but on drying it acquires a powerful odour of valerianic acid. This odour, now regarded as intolerable, was in the 16th century considered to be fragrant, the root being placed among clothes as a perfume (Turner, Herbal, part iii., 1568, p. 76), just as V. celtica and some Himalayan species of the genus are still used in the East (see Spikenard). By the poorer classes in the north of England it was esteemed of such medicinal value that “no broth, pottage, or physical meat” was considered of any value without it (Gerard,. Herball, 1636, p. 1078).

Valerian owes its medicinal properties to a volatile oil, which is contained in the dried root to the extent of one or, more rarely, two per cent., plants growing on dry or stony soil yielding the largest quantity. The oil is a complex body, consisting of a terpene, C 10 H l6 ; an alcohol, C 10 H 18 O, isomeric with borneol, and compounds of the alcohol with formic, acetic, and valerianic acids; and an ether having the formula C 10 H 17 O. The valerianic acid occurring in the oil is not the normal acid, but iso-valerianic acid. The other constituents of the root are malic acid, resin, sugar, &c. Valerian is employed in medicine as a stimulant and antispasmodic in various forms of hysteria, and in chorea and hooping-cough; it is also stated to possess anthelmintic properties. The red valerian of cottage gardens is Centranthus ruber, also belonging to the Valerianaceae ; but Greek valerian is Polemonium coeruleum, belonging to the natural order Polemoniaceae. Cats are nearly as fond of the [9:24:41] smell of this plant as of the true valerian, and will frequently roll on the plant and injure it.
