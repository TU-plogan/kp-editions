VARRO, Publius Terentius, with the cognomen Atacinus, a Roman poet whose life extended from 82 to about 37 b.c. The name Atacinus, given to distinguish him from the more famous Varro of Reate, is drawn from Atax, the name of a small district or river in Narbonensian Gaul, near to which he was born. He was perhaps the first Roman born beyond the Alps who reached to eminence in literature. He seems to have taken at first Ennius and Lucilius as his models, and wrote an epic, entitled Bellum, Sequanicum, eulogizing the exploits of Caesar in Gaul and Britain, and also Satires, of which Horace speaks slightingly. Jerome has preserved a statement that Varro began to study Greek literature with great avidity in his thirtyfifth year. The last ten years of his life were given up to the imitation of Greek poets of the Alexandrian school. Quintilian (indirectly confirming the judgment of Horace concerning the Satires') says that Varro made his name as an interpres operis a,lieni—“ a translator of other men’s works,” for such is the force of the word interpres. Even in this capacity Quintilian bestows on him restricted praise as “by no means to be despised.” But Quintilian probably much undervalued the Roman imitators of the Alexandrians, Catullus included. From other evidence we may conclude that, though he had not sufficient power to excel in the historical epic or in the serious work of the Roman satira, Varro yet possessed in considerable measure the lighter gifts which we admire in Catullus. His chief poem of the later period was the Argonautica, modelled, somewhat closely it would seem, on the epic of Apollonius Rhodius. The age was prolific of epics, both historical and mythological, and that of Varro seems to have held a high rank among them. Ovid asks what age will ever be unacquainted with the story of the first ship as told by Varro. In one of Ovid’s lists of Roman poets Varro stands between Ennius and Lucretius, while in another he is linked with Virgil. Statius, in his poem on the birthday of Lucan, gives to the epic of Varro an equally distinguished place. Later he published erotic poems, probably in the elegiac metre. These Propertius seems to have valued highly, for in a well-known passage he ranks the Leucadia celebrated by Varro along with the Lesbia of Catullus, the Quintilia of Calvus, the Lycoris of Gallus, and his own Cynthia. The other titles which have been preserved are the Cosmographia, or Chorographia, a poem on geography, imitated from the Greek of Alexander, an Ephesian, described by Cicero (Att., ii. 22) as a careless man and no good poet; and the Ephemeris, a poem on weather-signs, in hexameters, after Aratus. The Varro whom Quintilian (i. 4, 4) mentions in company with Lucretius as author of a poem on philosophy can hardly have been either Varro of Atax or Varro of Reate. The fragments of Varro Atacinus which remain, about fifty lines in all, are put together by Riese at the end of his edition of the fragments of the greater Varro’s Menippean Satires; but there is not enough of them to enable us to form a judgment on his style.
