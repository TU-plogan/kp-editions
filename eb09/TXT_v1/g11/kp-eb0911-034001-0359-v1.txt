GÜTZLAFF, Karl Friedrich August (1803-1851), a missionary to China, was born at Pyritz in Pomerania, 8th July 1803. At an early age he cherished a strong desire to become a foreign missionary, but the poverty of his parents made it impossible for them to aid him in attaining his wishes, and he became apprentice to a saddler in Stettin. In 1821, however, he made known his inclination to the king of Prussia, through whom he obtained admission to the Pädagogium at Halle, and afterwards to the mission institute of Jänike in Berlin. In 1826, under the auspices of the Netherlands Missionary Society, he went to Batavia, where by intercourse with the Chinese residents he perfected himself in the Chinese language. He, however, severed his connexion with the Netherlands Society in 1828, and went to Singapore; and in August of the same year he removed to Bangkok, the capital of Siam, where he occupied himself with translating the Bible into Siamese. In 1829 he married an English lady, who aided him in the preparation of a dictionary of Cochin China, but she died in August 1831 before its completion. Shortly after her death he sailed to Macao in China, where, and subsequently at Hong Kong, he worked at a translation of the Bible into Chinese, published a Chinese monthly magazine, and wrote in Chinese various books on subjects of useful knowledge. He also at different times undertook voyages on the coast of China, and in 1834 he published at London an account of them under the title Journal of Three Voyages along the Coast of China in 1831, 1832, and 1833. He was appointed in 1835 joint Chinese secretary to the English commission, and during the opium war and the negotiations [9:11:341] connected with the peace that followed he rendered valuable service by his knowledge of the country and people. On account of the continued refusal of the Chinese authorities to permit foreigners to penetrate into the interior, Giitzlaff in 1844 founded an institute for the training of native missionaries, which was so successful that during the first four years as many as forty-eight Chinese were sent out from it to carry on missionary labours among their fellow-countrymen. He died at Hong Kong, August 9, 1851.

Besides the works already mentioned, Giitzlaff is the author of A Sketch of Chinese History, Ancient anol Modern, London, 1834; and a similar work published in German at Stuttgart in 1847; China Opened, 1838; and the Life of Taow-Kwang, 1851 (German edition published at Leipsic in 1852). A complete collection of his Chinese writings is contained in the library at Munich.
