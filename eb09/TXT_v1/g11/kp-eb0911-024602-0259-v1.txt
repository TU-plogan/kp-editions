GUÉRIN, Jean Baptiste Paulin (1783-1855), French painter, belongs to the group who specially represent the Restoration. Born at Toulon, on the 25th March 1783, of poor parents, he learnt, as a lad, his father’s trade of a locksmith, whilst, at the same time, he followed the classes of the free school of art. Having sold some copies to a local amateur, Guérin started for Paris, where he came under the notice of Vincent, whose counsels were of material service. Iu 1810 Guérin made his first appearance at the Salon with some portraits, which had a certain success. In 1812 he exhibited Cain after the murder of Abel (formerly in Luxembourg), and, on the return of the Bourbons, was much employed in works of restoration and decoration at Versailles. His Dead Christ (Cathedral, Baltimore) obtained a medal in 1817, and this success was followed up by a long series of works, of which the following are the more noteworthy :—Christ on the knees of the Virgin, 1819; Anchises and Venus, 1822 (formerly in Luxembourg); Ulysses and Minerva, 1824 (Musée de Rennes); the Holy Family, 1829 (Cathedral, Toulon); and Saint Catherine, 1838 (St Roch). In his treatment of subject, Guérin attempted to realize rococo graces of conception, the liveliness of which was lost in the strenuous effort to be correct. His chief successes were attained by portraits, and those of Charles Nodier and the Abbé Lamennais became widely popular. Guérin died January 19, 1855. We possess no account of his life and works beyond that which is afforded by brief notices in contemporary biographical dictionaries.
