GRADISCA, a town of Austria, in the principality of Görz and Gradιsca, situated about 10 miles S.W. of Gorz, on the right bank of the Isonzo. It was formerly a strongly fortified place, but its citadel is now occupied as a prison. The inhabitants of the commune, who numbered in 1869 rather more than 3000, are engaged in silk-spinning. Between 1471 and 1481 Gradisca was fortified by the Venetians, but in 1511 they surrendered it to the imperial forces. In 1647 Gradisca and its territory, including Λquileia and forty-three smaller places, was erected into a prince-countship in favour of the prince of Eggenberg. It lapsed in 1717 to the imperial crown, and in 1754 was completely incorporated with Görz. The name was revived by the constitution of 1861, which established the crownland of the countship of Gorz and Gradisca. See Görz.
