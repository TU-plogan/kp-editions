GREGORY III., St, pope from 731 to 741, a Syrian by birth, succeeded Gregory II. in March 731. His pontificate, like that of his predecessor, was disturbed by the iconoclastic controversy, in which he vainly invoked the intervention of Charles Martel. During his reign also it was that Boniface in Germany, on whom he conferred the pallium, Wilibald in Bohemia, and Bede in England carried on their most successful missionary labours. He died 29th November 741, and was succeeded by Zacharias I.
