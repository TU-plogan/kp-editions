GUINEA, the general name applied by Europeans to part of the western coast region of intertropical Africa. Like many other geographical designations the use of which is controlled neither by natural nor political boundaries, it has been very differently employed by different writers and at different periods. In the widest acceptation of the term, the Guinea coast may be said to extend from ll 0 N. lat. to 16° S. lat., or in other words, from the neighbourhood of Cape Verga to Cape Negro. Southern or Lower Guinea comprises the coasts of Loango, Congo, Angola, and Benguela; and Northern or Upper Guinea comprises part of Senegambia, the Sierra Leone district, the Grain Coast, the Ivory Coast, the Gold Coast, the Slave Coast, the Niger Delta, and the Calabar district. The Cameroon mountains may be accepted as the limit of the two divisions, though some writers prefer the river Gambia or the equator. In a narrower and perhaps more common use of the name, Guinea is the coast only from Cape Palmas to the Gaboon. Originally, on the other hand, Guinea was supposed to commence as far north as Cape Nun opposite the Canary Islands; and Azurara is said to be the first authority who brings the boundary south to the Senegal. The name is derived from Ginnie, Genna, or Jinnie, a town and kingdom in the Niger district; and, though it appears on a map as early as 1351, it did not come into general use till the close of the 15th century. Few questions in historical geography have been more keenly discussed than that of the first discovery of Guinea by the navigators of modern Europe. It appears from the testimony of Jacopo Doria that two Genoese, Ugolino and Guido de Vivaldi, were sailing south along the African coast in 1291, but there is almost no further record of their voyage. The French claim that in the latter part of the 14th century the people of Dieppe sent out several expeditions to Guinea; and Jean de Bethencourt, who settled in the Canaries about 1402, made explorations towards the south. At length, in the latter half of the 15th century, the consecutive efforts of the navigators employed by Prince Henry of Portugal, Cadamosto, Usodimare, and Diogo Gomes, made the whole region familiar to Europeans.
