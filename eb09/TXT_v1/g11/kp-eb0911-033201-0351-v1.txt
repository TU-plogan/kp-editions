GURNALL, William (1616-1679), author of the Christian in Complete Armour, was born in 1616 at Lynn, Norfolkshire. He was educated at the free grammar school of his native town, and in 1631 was nominated to the Lynn scholarship in Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. in 1635 and M.A. in 1639. Nothing is known of his history from the time that he left the university till 1644, when he was made rector of Lavenham in Suffolk; but it would appear from one of his letters that when he received that appointment he was officiating as minister at Sudbury. At the Restoration he signed the declaration required by the Act of Uniformity, and on this account he was the subject of a libellous attack, published in 1665, entitled Covenant-Denouncers Desperate Apostates. He died October 12, 1679, and was buried at Lavenham. The woιk by which Gurnall is principally known, The Christian in Complete Armour, was published in three separate volumes in 1655, 1658, and 1662, and soon became so popular that in 1679 a sixth edition had been called for. In consists of a series of sermons on the latter portion of the 6th chapter of Ephesians, and is more fully described in the title page as a “Treatise of the Saint’s War against the Devil; wherein a discovery is made of that grand enemy of God and his people, in his policies, power, seat of his empire, wickedness, and chief designs he hath against the saints;” and a “Magazine from whence the Christian is furnished with spiritual arms for the battle, helped on with his armour, and taught the use of his weapon; together with the happy issue of the whole war.” The work is more practical than theological; and its quaint fancy, graphic and pointed style, astonishing variety of scriptural application and allusion, and fervent religious tone render it still popular with a certain class of readers.

An Inquiry into the Life of the Rev. W. Gτιrnαll, by H. M'Keon; appeared af Woodbridge in 1830, and a biographical introduction by the Rev. J. C. Ryle, chiefly founded on this pamphlet, was prefixed to an edition of the Christian in Comp>lete Armour published in London in 1865.
