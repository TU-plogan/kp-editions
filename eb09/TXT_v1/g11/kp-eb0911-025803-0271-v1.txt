GUIENNE, an old French province, whose name until the 10th century was Aquitania, and whose history until it came into the possession of England in 1152 is given under the heading Aquitania. It was bounded by the Pyrenees, Languedoc, Auvergne, Angoumois, Saintonge, and the sea of Gascony; and out of it are now formed the departments of Gironde, Dordogne, Lot, Aveyron, Lot-et-Garonne, Tam, Landes, Gers, Upper Pyrenees, Ariége, and Lower Pyrenees. The chief town was Bordeaux. Soon after it was joined to the English crown the nobles twice revolted, but were each time subdued, and in 1169 Henry II. of England bequeathed it to his son Richard (Coeur de Lion), who after quelling all symptoms of revolt added in 1186 and 1188 Toulouse and Rochelle to his French possessions. In 1196 he bequeathed it to his nephew Otto of Brunswick, but he resumed its possession in 1198, when Otto was chosen king of Germany. After the death of Richard in 1199, his mother Eleanor retained possession of it during her lifetime. It was reconquered by the French in the reign of Edward I. of England, but at the peace of 1303 it was again ceded to the English, with whom it remained till 1451, when it was conquered and finally united to France by Charles VII. In 1469 Louis IX. gave it in exchange for Champagne and Brie to his brother the duke of Berri, after whose death in 1472 it was again united to the French crown.
