GOUJET, Claude Pierre (1697-1767), a French abbé and litterateur, was born at Paris, 19th October 1697. He studied at the college of the Jesuits, and at the Collége Mazarin, but he nevertheless became a strong Jansenist. In 1705 he assumed the ecclesiastical habit, in 1719 entered the order of Oratorians, and soon afterwards was named canon of St Jacques l’Hopital. On account of his extreme Jansenist opinions he suffered considerable persecution from the Jesuits, and several of his works were suppressed at their instigation. In his latter years his health began to fail, and he lost his eyesight. As he received little remuneration for his writings, he came also to be in circumstances of great poverty, and was compelled to sell his library, a sacrifice which hastened his death, which took place at Paris, 1st February 1767.

He is the author of a large number of works, of which the principal are:— Supplément au Dictionnaire de Moréri, Paris, 1735, and a Nouveau Supplément to a subsequent edition of the work; Bibliothèque française, ou Histoire littéraire de la France, 18 vols., Paris, 1740-1759; Vies des Saints, 7 vols., 1730; Mémoires historiques et littéraires sur le Collége royal de France, 3 vols., Paris, 1758; Histoire des Inquisitions, Paris, 1752; and an edition of the Dictionnaire, of which he has also given an abridgment. Sée Mémoires hist, et litt, de l'Abbe Goujet, ∏GT.
