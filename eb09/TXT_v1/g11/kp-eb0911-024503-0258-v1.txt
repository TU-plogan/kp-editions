GUÉRET, a town of France, chief town of the department of Creuse, is situated on a mountain declivity near the Creuse, about 250 miles south from Paris. It has a church of the 13th century, a communal college, a normal school, two hospitals, a botanical garden, a library, a picture gallery, and a museum for natural history and antiquities. The principal industries are the manufacture of beer, leather, potash, combs, and buttons; and there is a considerable trade in wood and cattle. Guéret grew up in the 8th century round an abbey founded by Clotaire in 720. The population in 1876 was 4973.
