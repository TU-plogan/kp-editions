GUERRAZZI, Francesco Domenico (1804-1873), Italian writer and politician, v?as born at Leghorn, August 12, 1804. He studied law at Pisa, and happened to become acquainted there with Byron, who produced a very strong impression on his lively imagination. Having taken his degree in law, he went back to Leghorn to practise his profession, but engaged at the same time in literary pursuits. In 1827 he published his first novel, The Battle of Benevento, a work displaying powerful imagination and strong patriotic feeling. While exiled in 1834 to Portoferraio, on the island of Elba, he wrote Isabella Orsini and The Siege of Florence, the latter producing great enthusiasm in Italy. The two compositions which followed, Veronica Cibo and The Hew Tartufes, are of inferior value. In 1844 Guerrazzi was again exiled to Portoferraio. When the revolution broke out in 1848, he was named deputy, then president of the counsel of ministers, and finally, in the beginning of 1849, along with Montanelli and Mazzoni, triumvir and dictator of Tuscany. He had to expiate these few months of power by years of imprisonment and exile. He was banished first to Corsica, where he wrote Beatrice Cenci, The Tower of Homa, and Fides ; and then to Genoa, where he composed the Memento Homo, The Hole in the Wall, Messer Arlotto Mainardi, Paolo Pellicione, The Italian Plutarch, The Lives of Andrea Doria, Francesco Ferruccio, Pasquale Paoli, The Siege of Home, and The Ass (L’Asino), a humorous work. When the kingdom of Italy was constituted, Guerrazzi was several times sent to parliament as deputy. Towards the end of his life he withdrew to a villa he had on the sea-shore, near Cecina, not far from Leghorn, where he wrote his novel entitled The Dying Century. He died there on the 25th September 1873, and was buried in the church of Montener∩, near Leghorn. His letters are being collected for publication under the direction of the poet Joseph Carducci.
