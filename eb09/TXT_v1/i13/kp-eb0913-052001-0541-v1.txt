IVANOVO, or Ivanovo-Voznesensk, the “Manchester of Russia,” a town in the government of Vladimir, 20 miles north-west of Shua, near the river Uvod, and on the road from Shua to Nerakhta. It consists, as the full name implies, of what were originally two villages—Ivanovo, which existed at least as early as the 16th century, and Voznesensk, of much more recent date—united into a town in 1861. Of best note among the public buildings are the cathedral of the Elevation of the Cross, and the church of the Intercession of the Virgin, formerly associated with an important monastery founded in 1579 and abandoned in 1751. One of the colleges of the town contains a public library. The industrial history of Ivanovo begins with the 18th century. Linen-weaving was introduced in 1751, and in 1776 the manufacture of chintzes was brought from Schlüsselburg by some natives of the village. By 1850 the worth of the chintzes amounted to 6,680,875 roubles, and 10,000 workmen were employed in the manufacture of coarse calico. The reports of 1879 show 35 calico-print works, a wool-spinning factory, 6 cotton-weaving factories, 8 bleachworks, 6 ironworks, 3 chemical works, and several minor establishments. The workmen number about 15,000 or 20,000. The cotton factories produce to the annual value of 25,000,000 to 30,000,000 roubles; the iron works manufacture 110,000 poods (1770 tons) of iron, and there is a considerable turn out of boilers and factory machinery.' Bast mats are made to the value of 15,000 roubles.
