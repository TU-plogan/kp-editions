INSTITUTE OF FRANCE, an association constituted under the name of the Institut National by the French Republican Convention, in October 1795, to occupy a similar position to that of the old academies suppressed by an Act of the Convention, 8th April 1793 (see Academy). The affix to the word “Institut” has undergone a variety of changes corresponding to changes in the form of the government of France. The Institute owed its existence chiefly to the efforts of three persons, Lakanal, Daunou, and Carnot, and, according to the terms of the law by which it was founded, its purpose was to “advance the sciences and arts of research by the publication of discoveries and by correspondence with other learned societies, and to prosecute those scientific and literary labours which shall have for their end general utility and the glory of the republic.” It was composed of three classes—the first for sciences physiques et mathématiques, the second for sciences morales et politiques, and the third for littérature et beaux-arts. Originally it consisted of 144 members (the 48 nominated by the Convention electing 96 others), an equal number of associates in the provinces, and 24 foreigners of distinction who held the position of correspondents. Each class was divided into several sections, 6 members and 6 associates being assigned to each section. The first class was composed of ten sections, viz., (1) mathématiques, (2) arts mécaniques, (3) astronomie, (4) physique expérimentale, (5) chymie, (6) histoire naturelle et minéralogie, (7) botanique et physique générale, (8) anatomie et zoologie, (9) médecine et chirurgie, (10) économie rurale et art vétérinaire. The second class was composed of six sections, namely, (1) analyse des sensations et des idées, (2) morale, (3) science sociale et législation, (4) économie politique, (5) histoire, (6) géographie. The third class consisted of eight sections, viz., (1) grammaire, (2) langues anciennes, (3) poésie, (4) antiquités et monuments, (5) peinture, (6) sculpture, (7) architecture, (8) musique et déclamation. To the first class were thus assigned 60 members and as many associates, to the second 36, and to the third 48, the foreign correspondents being divided equally among the classes. No member was permitted to belong to more than one class; but any one might be present at the meetings and assist in the labours of the other classes. The Institute was installed at the Louvre in the building formerly occupied by the Académie Française, but in 1806 its locality was changed to the College des Quatre-Nations. The First Consul on the 23d January 1803 decreed for it a new constitution, the leading features of which were—that the approval of the head of the Government was essential in the election of members; the suppression of the second class; and a redivision into the four classes of (1) sciences physiques et mathématiques, (2) la langue et la littérature Françaises, and (3) histoire et littérature anciennes, (4) beaux-arts. The first class was composed of the ten sections of the old first class, and an additional section of geography and navigation with 3 members, with power to nominate 100 correspondents. The second class was composed of 40 members not separated into sections. The third class was composed of 40 members and of 8 foreign associates, and had the power to nominate 60 correspondents. The fourth class, which was composed of 28 members and of 8 foreign associates, was divided into five sections :—peinture with 10 members, sculpture with 6, architecture with 6, gravure with 3, and musique (composition) with 3 members. It had the power to nominate 36 correspondents. All classes had power to elect a stipulated number of members from the other classes. After the Restoration Louis XVIII. on the 21st March 1816 decreed the revival of the names of the old academies to the four classes of the Institute:—(1) L’Académie Française, corresponding to the old second class; (2) L’Académie royale des inscriptions et belles lettres, corresponding to the third class; (3) L’Académie royale des sciences, corresponding to the first class; and (4) L’Académie royale des beaux-arts, corresponding to the fourth class. On the 5th March 1833 a fifth academy was added to the Institute,—L’Académie des sciences morales et politiques, corresponding to the second class suppressed by Napoleon. As restored, it was composed of 30 members, with a minimum of 30 and a maximum of 40 correspondents. It was divided into five sections, viz., (1) philosophie, (2) morale, (3) législation, droit public, et jurisprudence, (4) économie politique et statistique, (5) histoire générale et philosophique.

Each academy has its own special jurisdiction and work, with special funds and one or more perpetual secretaries, in addition to which there is a general fund and common library, which, as well as other matters connected with the Institute as a whole, are managed by a committee chosen in equal numbers from each of the academies. Matters of common interest to all the academies are discussed at a general meeting of the institute, and a séance publique annuelle takes place on the 25th October, the anniversary of the organization of the Institute. All the expenses of the Institute and the academies are defrayed by an annual sum voted by Government. Each member of the Institute receives an annual allowance of 1200 francs, and each secretary of an academy a salary of 6000 francs. A notice of the several academies is given in the article Academy.
