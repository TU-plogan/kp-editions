IO is the heroine of a legend associated with the cultus of Hera, both in Argos and in Euboea. In Argos the great temple of Hera was situated on a hill called Euboea, on the road from Mycenae to the city of Argos; while in Euboea the legend was associated with the town of Argoura. The identity of names shows that the legend dates from a very ancient period of the worship; and as, in accordance with the universal rule in such legends, Io is only a form of the goddess, it is highly probable that she represents an older stage of the cultus than the better known Hera. Her transformation into a cow is clearly a relic of the primitive time when the goddess was actually worshipped under the symbol of a cow, the fertile mother, united with the male deity in the tepb<s yapo<s which was annually celebrated at Argos (see Hera).

Even in the simplest form in which we know it, the legend has been much transformed by poetic fancy. As a heroine united with the country from immemorial time, Io is called daughter of Inachus, the river of Argos and its oldest king, or of Iasus, from whom comes the epithet *Iασov *Apγos. As associated with the oldest worship of Hera, she is called the daughter of Peiras, who made the first image of the goddesg out of a pear tree at Tiryns; and Io Callithyia is, by a common device in such legends, the first priestess of the goddess. Zeus fell in love with her, and she was transformed into a white cow either by Zeus, to hide her from the rage of Hera, or by the jealous goddess herself. When Io and Hera had once been made into distinct personalities, such tales easily arose to explain the relation between them. Hera then insisted on getting this cow from Zeus, and set Argus Panoptes with his thousand eyes to watch her. Io is almost universally understood to be the moon, and Argus the star-studded nightly heaven. Argus tied the cow to the olive tree shown in the sacred grove on Mount Euboea, or according to the poets pastured her in the fertile meadows of Lerna or Nemea. Zeus now sends his messenger Hermes, who lulls Argos to sleep with his magic wand, and slays him with the same curved sword, harpe, with which afterwards Perseus, the light-hero, slew the Gorgon, the power of darkness. According to another account Argus, the darkness, is slain by a stone thrown by Hermes, i.e., by the rising sun, whose sudden appearance is frequently spoken of as the throwing of a stone (Kuhn, Entwickl. d. Mytholj}. Maddened by a gadfly, Io wanders over many lands till at last she comes to Egypt, where she regains human form and becomes the mother of Epaphus. Opinions differ much as to the interpretation of this part of the tale. It is not probable that both Zeus and Hermes figured in the original legend; and the end has certainly been adapted so as to bring Greece and Egypt into connexion, and dates therefore from the time when intercourse between them became frequent and much influence was exerted by Egyptian religion on Greek thought, 7.e., the 7th century b.c. How far Oriental influence had affected the cultus at the period to which the origin of the legend belongs is doubtful ∙ i Preller compares the Phoenician conception of Astarte as a wandering cow. In later time Isis, who was conceived as horned (Herod, ii. 41), was connected with Io. The legend of Io was a favourite subject among Greek painters, and many representations are preserved on vases and in wall paintings (see Overbeck, Kunstmyth. d. Zeus, 465).

See the works quoted under Hermes ; and against the explanation of Io as the moon see Plew in N. Jαhrbb., 1870 and 1873.
