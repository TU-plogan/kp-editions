ISABELLA (1451-1504), surnamed la Catol·ica, “the Catholic,” queen of Castile from 1474, was the second child and only daughter of John II. of Castile by his second wife Isabella, granddaughter of John I. of Portugal (thus being through both parents a descendant of the famous John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster), and was born at Madrigal on April 22, 1451. On the death of her father, who was succeeded by her brother Henry IV. (1454), she was withdrawn by her mother to Arevalo, where her early education was conducted in the deepest seclusion; in 1462, however, after the birth of Joanna “Beltraneja,” she was, along with her uterine brother Alphonso, removed by Henry to the court, where she showed a remarkable example of staidness and sobriety. Already more than one suitor had made application for her hand, Ferdinand of Aragon, who ultimately became her husband, being among the number; for some little time she was engaged to his elder brother Carlos, who died in 1461. When in her thirteenth year her brother promised her in marriage to Alphonso of Portugal, but to this union she firmly refused to consent; her resistance seemed less likely to be effectual in the case of the marquis of Villena, the grand master of the order of Calatrava, to whom she was next affianced, when she was delivered from her fears by the sudden death of the bridegroom while on his way to the nuptials (1466). After an offer of the crown of Castile, made by the revolutionary leaders in the civil war, had been declined by her, she was in 1468 formally recognized by her brother as lawful heir, after himself, to the united crowns of Castile and Leon. New candidates for her hand now appeared in the persons of a brother of Edward IV. of England (probably Richard, duke of Gloucester), and of the duke of Guienne, brother of Louis XI., and heir presumptive of the French monarchy. Finally, however, in face of very great difficulties, she was married to Ferdinand of Aragon at Valladolid on October 19, 1469. Thenceforward the fortunes of the two spouses were inseparably blended (see Ferdinand, vol. viii. p. 81). For some time they held a humble court at Duenas, and afterwards they resided at Segovia, where on the death of Henry she was proclaimed queen of Castile and Leon (December 13, 1474). The first months of her reign were fully employed in coping with domestic disaffection and in repelling invasion from Portugal; but peace was soon secured on a basis of such firmness and permanence as rendered possible that successful policy the main features of which have already been sketched elsewhere. Spain undoubtedly owed to Isabella’s clear intellect, resolute energy, and unselfish patriotism much of that greatness which for the first time it acquired under “the Catholic sovereigns.” The moral influence of the queen’s personal character over the Castilian court was incalculably great; from the debasement and degradation of the preceding reign she raised it to being “the nursery of virtue and of generous ambition.” The very sincerity of her piety and strength of her religious convictions led her more than once, however, into great errors of state policy, which have never since been repaired, and into more than one act which offends the moral sense of a more refined age; her efforts for the introduction of the Inquisition into Castile, and for the proscription of the Jews, are outstanding evidences of what can only be called her bigotry. But not even the briefest sketch of the facts of her life can omit to notice that happy instinct or intuition which led her, when all others had heard with incredulity the scheme of Columbus, to recall the wanderer to her presence with the words “I will assume the undertaking for my own crown of Castile, and am ready to pawn my jewels to defray the expenses of it, if the funds in the treasury should be found inadequate.” She died at Medina del Campo on November 24, 1504, and was succeeded by her daughter Joanna “la loca” (the “Crazy ”) with Ferdinand as regent. See Prescott f History of the Deign of Ferdinand and Isabella, where the original authorities are exhaustively enumerated.
